It will aid understanding if I note at this stage that leading counsel appeared in Case F at hearings before Holman J on 16 September 2014, before Roderic Wood J on 27 January 2015 and before me at directions hearings on 3 March, 21 April and 17 June 2015, and in both Case F and Case H at the final hearing before me which started on 13 July 2015.  </p>

So, in very significant part, the preparatory work undertaken for the final hearing by leading counsel was common to both cases, as were the submissions made in court; the oral evidence in each case (see <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, para 66) was, of course, quite separate and distinct. Leading counsel&#8217;s submissions in each case dated, 10 June 2016, make clear, as do the relevant fee-notes, that &#8220;in all respects in which the work of leading counsel in Case F [Case H] was also done for the benefit of Case H [Case F] &#8230; a 50/50 apportionment has been made.&#8221;</p>

It was that judgment which, for the first time, set out the relevant law clearly and comprehensively. The brevity of the central parts of my judgment in the present cases (<span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, paras 81-84, 100-105) is therefore apt to mislead. What after September 2015 was in large part simple and clear, would have been very far from simple or clear, indeed both complex and obscure, prior to then.</p>

The litigation, it is said, undoubtedly warranted the use of leading counsel, whose fees should reflect the fact that there was a mass of authorities and other materials to be mastered and (in Case F) that leading counsel was acting without a junior. In relation to the solicitors&#8217; costs in Case H it is said that the work was done by fee-earners of appropriate grades and with perfectly reasonable charging rates; the point is made that &#8220;their hourly rates are within the guideline rates published by the SCCO for 2010.&#8221;</p>
