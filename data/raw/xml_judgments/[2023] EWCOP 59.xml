Contrary to the direction of Theis J, the bundle was filed and served around 9:30 pm on 18 December 2023. In any event this &#8216;latest&#8217; version lacked the recent up-to-care plan which included the proposed restraint. This was circulated, in breach of the order of Theis J, at some stage on the morning of the hearing. I was also provided for the first time, and in breach of the order of Theis J, with the witness statement of Dr C on the morning of the hearing. I also record that reference was made to the medical records and I was told a 600 page or so bundle existed, but that had not been sent to the court. </p>

I simply note that there is a dispute between the applicant and the X Group regarding the responsibility for bringing this application. That is why Theis J directed evidence explaining the delay. I do not propose to comment on the dispute between the applicant and the X group, other than to observe that no public body or private institution tasked with caring for vulnerable people should compromise their charges&#8217; welfare through a lack of cooperation.  </p>

Her &#8216;repeat bone marrow&#8217; shows a complete morphological remission, which he says &#8216;means there is no clear evidence of leukaemia down the microscope.&#8217; Given her genes, which he has analysed, her chance of cure is &#8220;good&#8221;. He notes she likely has residual leukaemia and it will require a further three cycles of chemotherapy. Each further cycle requires 5-8 days of intravenous chemotherapy to be delivered in a hospital setting. Each cycle comes with associated very low blood counts and the need for blood of platelet transfusions. The risk of infection is very high (50 %) with each cycle. Infection would require immediate broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics. There are wider risks. Given the infection levels there is, he says, a risk of death of around 5 % with each cycle of chemotherapy. For this reason he proposes that it will be necessary for Ms KL to be an inpatient for the duration of her treatment. He notes that a month of rest is required between each cycle of intravenous chemotherapy and that during the initial phase, oral chemotherapy is also provided.  He notes that there is a proposal to insert a line under Ms KL&#8217;s skin to administer future chemotherapy rather than in reliance on the PICC line (many of which Ms KL has pulled out). He notes this would require a general anaesthetic.</span></p>

She explained that this is a more permanent way of administering treatment. Over time it becomes harder to insert Hickman and Picc lines because of scar tissue, and also [Ms KL] would occasionally try to remove external tubes and lines. However [ Ms KL] is scared about this because the portacath needs to be inserted under general anaesthetic. She is scared of general anaesthetic and so when you talk to her about it, she will insist that she wants to keep her Picc line. In ES&#8217;s view this shows that she does have some understanding of what different procedures mean, and when she&#8217;s experienced something previously she is able to engage with the topic a bit more. </span></p>

Dr. Jancevic gave oral evidence first and told the Court unequivocally that she was assessing S's mental health and its impact on her decision-making process but the decision as to capacity lay with the obstetrician. Ms. Pretlove was subsequently equally unequivocal in confirming her view that the psychiatrists were best placed to assess capacity. The agreed order of events (discussion with obstetrician first, best interests meeting second, and discussions with psychiatrist last) lays bare a poorly constructed approach to assessment between the treating teams of clinicians. The suggestion that they should have done a joint assessment seemed to come as a surprise.&#160;</p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that &#8220;It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless&#8221;. But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;</p>

The burden of proof is on the applicant to the civil standard. They have discharged it. The written and oral evidence convincingly demonstrates that Ms KL is unable to make a decision about her cancer. She is clear she wants to get better and she does not want to die, but she has no understanding of her leukaemia diagnosis, the treatment she needs and is robbed of the ability to weigh up this relevant information.   Three doctors have given evidence that is the case, supported by the experienced chemotherapy nurse, Ms S. Mrs KLS agrees. There is no evidence before me that Ms KL can weigh up and understand the risks, pros and cons of her chemotherapy treatment. That inability is caused by her learning disability and/or EUPD. This is supported by the clinical evidence and has not been challenged.  There are no practical steps to assist Ms KL to make a capacitious decision in the time available. I am satisfied she lacks the relevant decision making ability for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 2</ref> and 3 MCA and will make a section 15 declaration to that effect. I am also persuaded, for similar reasons, that she lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings, as the Official Solicitor submits. </p>

These are very significant interferences in Ms KL&#8217;s rights. They are however, entirely necessary and proportionate because without this background to the treatment, she could not be safely provided with the intravenous chemotherapy. She manifestly needs it. The haematology evidence is that her prognosis with the treatment is good. I am concerned the risk of infection is very high because of the ancillary damage done to cells because of the toxic nature of the chemotherapy and I am in full agreement with the clinicians that inpatient admission until March is necessary and very much in Ms KL&#8217;s best interests to keep her safe from infection when she is weakened by the intravenous chemotherapy. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Given the multiple breaches of court orders I am concerned for Ms KL&#8217;s welfare. The disregard for the orders and directions made by Theis J and the piecemeal nature of how the evidence has been given to Ms KL&#8217;s litigation friend and family is not simply a procedural hiccup. It has obscured the court&#8217;s focus on the welfare and safety of Ms KL. Therefore, it is necessary to list this matter for a review hearing in the first week of February, with a time estimate of half a day, to consider the deployment of restraint, and to ensure Ms KL&#8217;s best interests in respect of cycles 3 and 4 are being properly managed. The parties will agree directions for this. If all matters are agreed then an agreed order can be placed before the court and the hearing vacated. It is necessary to emphasise the importance of the applicant complying with those directions.  </p>

I am particularly grateful to the Official Solicitor, her team and her counsel who have had to grapple with the consequences of the breach of directions by working long hours beyond the reasonable working day.</p>
