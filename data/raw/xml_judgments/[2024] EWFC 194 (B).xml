The triage document that I have looked at in the bundle at page 825 appears to have been redacted (with black and also with white redactions).  Details such as the home address and even details of who accompanied the child have been obscured.  Astonishingly, part of the history recorded at triage has also been removed.  I have no idea why that occurred.  It is completely inappropriate, and it is disappointing that in the preparation of the case this does not appear to have been picked up on.</span></p>

Further x-rays on 21.5.22 showed further evolution with hard callus and more consolidated subperiosteal bone formation.  Those three fractures Dr Olsen dated as being at least 2 weeks old on 16.5.22 and no more than 4-5 weeks old.   Dr Olsen made it clear that although there is a small window of overlap of these timing windows, the differences in expressed healing meant that the left radius fracture was more recent than the other fractures.  At the end of his evidence Dr Olsen suggested the extent of healing for the three older fractures compared to the left forearm, which has absolutely no sign of healing, indicates a difference of about a week or so.</span></p>

The clavicle fractures could have been due to an impact if Tim was dropped and landed on one shoulder, the collarbone on that side could break.

Ambulatory subjects with these EDS subtypes may have a higher incidents of fractures during childhood.&#8221;  The authors warn about the weight to be placed on their findings in relation to ambulatory children: &#8220;However, until replicated in a larger, prospective study, our findings should be interpreted as preliminary and with caution.&#8221;</span></p>

If the same gene spelling is found in one of the parents, but no symptoms are manifested by them, then it can be disregarded.

A fall downstairs onto wrists, and a fall from a pram could each have plausibly been from a height of greater than 50cms, at which point fracturing becomes a feasible risk.  Fracturing a finger from being hit by a ball depends on a number of factors: the speed of the ball, the movement of the hand, the hardness of the ball and how it impacted against the finger.  However, the mother is noted to have been actively involved in competitive sports at school and I can take judicial notice that injuring or even fracturing a finger playing a ball game is not an unusual injury for many sports people.</span></p>

The GP record of that day states, &#8220;? Feels pain around elbow upper arm intermittently&#8221;.  The mother took issue with that note saying that she was talking about his use of the arm which was intermittent.  She also disagreed with the mention of pain, saying if it had been in pain she would have mentioned it.  That evidence contradicted her contemporaneous text message of 14.05.22, &#8220;It was just Friday he was in pain and stiff&#8230;  Maybe that night when he woke up early crying it happened?&#8221;.</span></p>

She told me that when she handed Tim over, he was not crying, but when she moved away he started whining.  In her text message she described, &#8220;Baby crying when I left him today&#8230;  I could still hear him when I left the building.&#8221; And explained that she had not mentioned their concerns about his arm, &#8220;I forgot cos he started crying&#8221;.  When the text messaged were put to her, she said that Tim started crying as she was leaving and that the nursery worker had brought him to the window which was why she could hear him so clearly.  I cannot ignore the effect of the passage on time on her memory in relation to this.</span></p>

That was at a time when, because of the covid restrictions, he had to remain outside the hospital while the mother and Tim were inside.  Both parents told me was it a phrase they understood to mean simply that he was waiting around.  A &#8220;sitting duck&#8221; is a well-known idiom that refers to a helpless or easy target or victim.  However, I cannot overlook that it is not uncommon for people sometimes to misunderstand the most common phrases.  When I consider it in the context of the parents&#8217; text messages, it is consistent with their having misunderstood the phrase &#8220;sitting duck&#8221;.</span></p>

I do not accept that evidence.  The context is a long series of messages about how difficult it had been to meet Tim&#8217;s needs &#8211; that he was crying, tired, not taking milk and had hit his chin.  The mother was reassuring that, &#8220;It will get better each time you are with baby&#8230;  He will get used to it&#8221;.  Half an hour later the mother asked, &#8220;How&#8217;s everything?&#8221; to which the father answered, &#8220;Nightmare&#8221;.  I am satisfied that in his oral evidence the father was seeking to minimise his contemporaneous description of what had been an extremely difficult day.</span></p>

They were both dignified during their evidence and occasionally emotional, but appropriately so.  There were some inconsistencies between their accounts and with earlier things they had said.  They both showed a tendency to minimise or distance themselves from things such as whether the baby was in pain, or his arm was swollen.  I am not sure whether that was an active attempt to dissemble, or simply the fallibility of memory and the human tendency to recollect matters in a more flattering light.  However, I was not persuaded by the father&#8217;s claim that his &#8220;Nightmare&#8221; description of caring for Tim was a flippant joke.  Nonetheless, the overall impression I formed of both parents was that they appeared to be credible.</span></p>

The suggestion being that he has a high pain threshold such that he did not have an obvious response to having his bones broken.  I accept Dr Michie&#8217;s evidence about there being a dramatically wide level of variation in pain responses by infants.  The parents point out that when Tim was seen by the GP on 13.5.22 it was not obvious to the GP that there was a fracture, nor was it immediately obvious at hospital until x-rays were taken.

On the basis of the evidence from the events of 13.05.22 and from the many months that have passed since then, I am not persuaded that Tim is a child who does not feel pain or masks his pain to the extent that an acute injury would not be obviously responded to at the time it occurred.  On 13.5.22, Tim demonstrated with his parents that morning and later at nursery what I am satisfied is an expected response to pain.</span></p>

She had previously dropped out of university when she had her first child.  During her pregnancy with Tim, she had commenced a nursing course.  During Tim&#8217;s early months the mother had balanced her studies with caring for Tim.  She was able to work online.  However, there were periods of time when she had to attend at university and was not available to care for Tim.  Typically, the father would care for Tim during these periods.</span></p>

The mother told me that if she needed to she would have prioritised Tim and deferred her studies.  That is something she did before for her daughter.  The local authority identifies this as a stressor, either because the mother&#8217;s career development was threatened by Tim&#8217;s dependency on her, or because the mother&#8217;s absence would leave the father with the very difficult task of caring for Tim in circumstances where he would not accept a bottle and would only take milk from the breast.  I should make it clear that the father was not left entirely unable to provide Tim with sustenance &#8211; Tim had reached the point where he would eat purees and although he would not latch onto a bottle, he could still be given some milk as it would leak into his mouth.  However, it is clear that the father was unable to replicate with a bottle, the soothing and calming effect of breast feeding.</span></p>

There is a library of photos and videos, albeit not covering every day of the period.  Tim was seen by family, friends and some professionals, particularly the nursery.  There was no suggestion that Tim was being hidden or kept away, such that an injury was being actively disguised.  If the parents were engaging in a cover up, it would make little sense for them to hide the first set of fractures, but then to seek medical attention about Tim&#8217;s arm.</span></p>

None were called to give evidence.  The nursery had a very limited amount of involvement with Tim with an increasing pattern of attendance over 3 days until 12.05.22, which was Tim&#8217;s first full day.  In her statement the manager said, &#8220;It was when mother picked up Tim at the end of the day that I noticed his arm was stiff compared to how it was the day before.  Tim cried a few times during the day but nothing out of the ordinary or hysterical.  It appeared he got upset when he needed something, for example if he needed to be changed or fed.&#8221;</span></p>

It is an unusual observation that his arm seemed stiffer than the day before and I do wonder to what extent the manager&#8217;s subsequent knowledge that Tim had suffered a fracture has affected the account that she delivered over a year later in her statement, which was prepared long after the events &#8211; it is dated 6.06.23.  In any event, on the CCTV there is a very marked observable change in the way that Tim presented on 12.05.22 when he appeared settled when compared with 13.05.22 when he was very distressed and difficult to settle.  In my judgment it is likely that the manager is mistaken in her statement about her observation of Tim&#8217;s arm on 12.05.22.</span></p>

The mother later informed them that his arm was hurting and it &#8220;felt weird&#8221;.  He was present from 9am to 12noon.    I have seen the CCTV footage of that day.  Tim was extremely unsettled.  He spent a lot of time in the arms of one of the nursery staff.  In trying to settle him, the staff member jogged him up and down and rocked him in a way that Mr Woodward-Carlton describes as vigorous.  Having observed the video, it was done quite energetically. However, it was not, in my judgment, anything that would be inappropriate with a healthy and uninjured baby.  However, I agree with Mr Woodward-Carlton that it was a type of movement that would have been unthinkable if it had been known that Tim had a fractured arm.  For a lengthy period, Tim&#8217;s injured left arm is stretched outside his body and flails up and down while he is rocked and jogged.  His crying is audible on the video.  </span></p>

I have reviewed that video.  A child in a red babygro is not being directly interacted with by a staff member, however, there are 4 or 5 members of staff present in other parts of the room and the child in the babygro appears to be content and occupied.  Mr Woodward-Carlton invites me to draw an inference about the quality of the supervision at the nursery with a view to the possibility that Tim could have suffered an accidental injury while at nursery.</span></p>

Dr Saggar entertained the possibility of a genetic vulnerability that had an influence at the time of the fractures, but which, due to Tim&#8217;s general bone development, no longer had such an influence as he reached the toddler stage.  That is a possibility I have factored in as part of the &#8220;dark corners&#8221; of medical science, but I note that there is no evidence of such a condition in Tim and that Dr Saggar nonetheless accepted that even if there was decreased bone strength there would still need to be an event that applied the force to cause the fractures and that the fractures would hurt as much as in a child without decreased bone strength.</span></p>

The parents&#8217; evidence contradicts Sam&#8217;s account, on the basis that she has not been left alone with Sam in circumstances where Tim has become upset.  The mother said she has never left the two children unsupervised.  The father said he may have popped out for a moment to fetch something.  However, if Sam picked up Tim and dropped him, even if he was uninjured, it is likely Tim would have been upset and cried immediately after.  If he suffered a fracture, that is even more likely.  Sam would also have likely been upset and affected about dropping her much-loved baby brother.  The parents give no account of anything of that sort having occurred.  I also note Dr Michie&#8217;s opinion that at Tim&#8217;s age, he is unlikely to put out his arms to break a fall.  If a drop had happened, it would have been a memorable event for any adult or adults present in the home, even if they did not witness the drop.

This was the major motivation behind Tim commencing nursery in May 2022.  The mother in her evidence was clear that she would have deferred her course if necessary because Tim&#8217;s needs came first.  She had a track-record of making similar decisions as she had stepped away from her first degree to care for Sam.

When the mother was absent, he was left caring for a baby who, irrespective of how much he tried, he could not give enough milk to.  It was not a case of Tim being left hungry, because he had started some pureed foods and so he was able to eat.  However, breast feeding played a major role in calming and settling Tim, which could not be replicated by bottle feeding.

I am satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, it is likely that these fractures were non-accidental injuries inflicted on Tim.  There is no explanation for the two clavicle and right radius fractures and these were never identified by the parents.</span></p>

They and Tim were all affected by illness.  The availability of family support was reduced because of Ramadan and the family&#8217;s illness.  They both had to face the uncertainty about the mother&#8217;s career progression and whether Tim&#8217;s feeding issues would stymie her ability to attend her training placement.  The father faced additional issues during periods when he was left to care for Tim, in particular there could be occasions when, irrespective of what he tried, he would have been unable to provide what Tim needed because of Tim&#8217;s difficulty with bottle feeding.</span></p>

They both are appropriately upset about what happened to Tim and the impact on their family.  They both were exposed to the stressful demands of caring for Tim.  They both were present in the home when Tim was hurt.  </span></p>
