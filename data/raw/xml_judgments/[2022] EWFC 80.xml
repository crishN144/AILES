	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2022, the Applicant Trust sought a declaration that it was lawful to undertake brain stem testing and to withdraw mechanical ventilation in relation to their patient, Archie Battersbee, a 12-year-old boy. There was a good deal of anxiety that Archie&#8217;s medical circumstances were so fragile that the practicalities of undertaking MRI scanning might provoke a crisis. Ultimately, the brain stem testing was attempted, but it was not successful. Archie&#8217;s doctors considered that many of the signs and symptoms that they could see and evaluate clinically, pointed strongly towards Archie having sustained brain stem death. The Judge who heard the application, Arbuthnot J, was persuaded by this analysis to make a finding of brain stem death by application of the civil standard of proof. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Court of Appeal concluded that such an approach was wrong in law. It strikes me that it is also wrong, clinically. The law and good medical practice will rarely, if ever, diverge. Ascertaining death requires the application of clear clinical guidelines. Where they are not met, brain stem death cannot be identified with the certainty that such a conclusion requires. Brain stem death cannot, at least to my mind, be equated with a diagnosis, though I note, that the guidance by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges is headed <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The Code of Practice for the Diagnosis and Confirmation of Death&#8221;.</span> Death, it seems to me, is a stage beyond diagnosis and thus it follows, that a differential diagnostic approach (i.e., diagnosis by symptoms) is highly unlikely to be appropriate. This rehearing, directed by the Court of Appeal, proceeds on the premise that Archie Battersbee is alive and that this Court should consider where his best interests now lie. That investigation requires unswerving focus on Archie. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The medical evidence filed in the proceedings before Arbuthnot J revealed a consensus both on Archie&#8217;s condition and in respect of any progress he might make. With that in mind, at a directions hearing on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022, I made orders which included the following recitals: </p>

At this point, however, it is important that I address what has happened to Archie as well as what has been done to help him. On the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2022, Archie was found with a ligature round his neck in the home that he lived in with his mother. I do not know why he did this, nor am I prepared to speculate. His mother was understandably frantic when she made the discovery. She told me that she ran into the street for help and then returned to cut Archie down. The trauma of that day will, I have no doubt, live with her for the rest of her life. She tells me that she has not even begun to process the horrors of that experience. She intimates that is something she will have to address in the future. It is a tragedy of immeasurable dimension for Archie and for his family. </p>

The compelling and unanimous medical evidence is that he has not regained awareness at any time and has now been in a coma, with a Glasgow score of 3/15 (i.e., the lowest) for over 3 months. His mother believes that Archie <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;is still there&#8217;</span>. Clinical observations reveal that he has been entirely unresponsive and has not shown any sign at all of being able to sustain breathing independently of the ventilator to which he is attached. </p>

Her view as to Archie&#8217;s condition and prognosis accords exactly with that of Dr Playfor. Her evidence, however, casts some light on the reality of Archie&#8217;s day to day experience. She has told me that with brain injury as devastating as that sustained by Archie, the loss of brain function, inevitably, causes adverse cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, metabolic and haematological change. This in turn creates instability in organ function and in the heart. In her statement, Dr F lists the treatments that seek to manage or mitigate this instability. They require to be set out here because they reveal the reality that every aspect of Archie&#8217;s bodily function is maintained artificially through ventilatory support, chemical assistance and the physical care provided by the nurses. This is a remarkable medical achievement but the moral and ethical challenges it creates are obvious. Archie&#8217;s care requires the following: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Dr F has explained, a patient with a brain injury of the magnitude of that sustained by Archie becomes unstable without this high level of critical care intervention. In simple terms, this means that Archie&#8217;s blood pressure may fall to dangerous levels and his heart rate may drop, impeding the blood supply to the major organs and heart. By way of illustration, this lack of oxygen and blood supply to the pituitary gland led to diabetes insipidus, which creates uncontrolled loss of water in the urine due to a lack of a brain hormone called vasopressin. This severe fluid loss and electrolyte disturbance causes dangerous vacillations in blood pressure. Essentially, Archie receives vasopressin to mirror what the brain would normally do for itself, but however remarkable the medication, it is a second-rate understudy for the main actor i.e., the brain itself.  Controlling urine output, fluid balance, control of bodily water, salts and blood pressure has proved to be very challenging. Archie has required additional IV fluid boluses to replete his water stores, given the volume of his urine output. He has also required nifedipine medication to reduce his high blood pressure. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further consequence of the brain&#8217;s failure is that Archie&#8217;s gut has also failed. In consequence and despite the incredible efforts of all involved, Archie has lost a very significant amount of weight. Along with his fluid loss has been diarrhoea, which makes it difficult to manage the diabetes insipidus. Archie is treated by loperamide to try and slow down the gut to facilitate better food absorption. Again, the medication is endeavouring to replicate that which would ordinarily be stimulated by brain activity. Archie&#8217;s nurses and doctors have experimented with feed formulations to see if any are more easily absorbed. They have had some success. Archie now feeds continuously but has ongoing issues with intermittent diarrhoea or constipation. He has become malnourished and this, along with the necessity for repeated blood tests, has led to him becoming anaemic. For this he was treated with an iron infusion, which I have been told, can take two weeks to become effective. Inevitably, anaemia adds to the burdens that have been discussed above. It further increases the risk of infection, intestinal disorders, abnormal heart rhythm and low blood pressure. Archie needs blood tests every hour or two to monitor the acids and salts in his blood. He requires intermittent transfusions. </p>

These are suctioned from the breathing tube; this can indicate infection arising from the breathing machine and the plastic tubing going into his airway. Archie&#8217;s inability to cough, swallow, or move renders him more vulnerable to infection. Though he cannot move himself, he is moved and positioned carefully by the nurses to prevent pressure sores which have very serious consequences in this context. They may become sites for ulcers and infection. Archie&#8217;s malnutrition also increases the risk of skin breakdown and delayed healing. It is thought that this will also have weakened his bones. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Though I do not discount the existence of at least some residual life in Archie&#8217;s brain stem, there is a professional consensus here that Archie is most likely beyond pain. The corollary to this is that he is also beyond pleasure. He can experience no comfort nor receive soothing from those around him. Though his parents vacillate, for reasons which strike me as entirely natural, in recognising the extremity of Archie&#8217;s situation, it is inevitable that neurocritical care interventions will eventually fail. Archie has no control over the functioning of any aspect of his body or organs. This has been devolved to the critical care support that I have outlined. Archie&#8217;s mum believes him to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a fighter&#8217; </span>and I have no doubt at all that he was. &#8216;The fight&#8217; however, if it can be properly be characterised as such, is no longer in Archie&#8217;s hands. The damage to his brain has deprived him of any bodily autonomy. Eventually, Archie&#8217;s organs will fail and ultimately, his heart will stop. How, when and in what circumstances is impossible to predict. </p>

The alternative is that advanced by those caring for Archie and by his Guardian. It is reasoned that, as Archie has no prospect of recovery, intensive support, on a true construction, now serves only to protract death and not to promote life.  This gradual realisation, I have been told, has generated considerable distress for the PICU nurses. Mr Wise QC, acting on behalf of the parents, submits that the reaction of the nurses should play no part in my decision. With respect to him, I disagree. It is crucial that I survey the entire canvas of the available evidence, the reaction of the nurses, as reported to me, is a part of that canvas, particularly when considering what weight should be afforded to respect for Archie&#8217;s dignity and autonomy. </p>

At 12 years of age, he has already broken a few hearts. I asked mum if Archie recognised that he was a good-looking boy. Without a moment&#8217;s hesitation, mum told me that he was absolutely sure of it and not least because she told him so every day. Whilst Archie&#8217;s charm was generated by his effervescent enthusiasm for life and his instinctive kindness for others, his mother signalled to me that he could also deploy it effectively where it was expedient for him. In simple terms, he could turn on the charm when he needed to. In his hospital room, there are cards from &#8216;ex-girlfriends&#8217;, as well as from his many friends. The room is described as colourful. Archie&#8217;s family all visit him, but his mother has been in constant vigil staying day and night.

There are photographs of Archie delighting in his well-honed physique. His dad reminded me that he had won a number of medals in his gymnastics. Archie has also been involved in MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). I note that like boxing, which Archie also enjoyed, this too can be a dangerous sport. I was told that dad used to fish regularly with Archie&#8217;s older brother Tom. When Archie went fishing with his dad, he was predictably a bit of a handful.

Mr Battersbee struck me as an instinctively good dad, both natural and confident in the role.

He related to his mum how the MMA fighters prayed for protection when they entered the ring. He requested a crucifix for which he paid &#163;5 a week from his pocket money to buy it. Mum tells me that Archie had frequently requested to be Christened. In the daily bustle of life, they never got round to it.

Archie is said to have responded <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to leave mum and I would try to get out of bed&#8221;. </span>I accept the broad accuracy of this conversation, not least because it resonates entirely with what dad told me about Archie&#8217;s concern for his mum&#8217;s welfare. It says a great deal about Archie that when contemplating existence on a life support machine, his thoughts were not for himself at all, but for his mother. </p>

Each case will be both situational and person specific.

The forensic approach is 'subjective', in the sense that it requires all involved, family members, treating clinicians, the Courts to conduct an intense focus on the individual at the centre of the process. Frequently, it will involve drilling down into the person's life, considering what he or she may have said or written and a more general evaluation of the code and values by which they have lived their life.&#8221;</span></p>

The purpose of the best interests&#8217; test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;&#160;(per Baroness Hale)</span></p>

Archie&#8217;s mum, in particular, but the family more generally, recoil from this terrible reality. Nobody criticises them in any way for this.
