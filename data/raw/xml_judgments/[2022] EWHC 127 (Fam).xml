	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The central issue within the care proceedings is the potential risk which is posed to the children by having contact with their father given his proven engagement in terrorist activities. Both the mother and the father remain married and ideally wish to live together with the children. The four children currently have supervised contact with their father twice a week while he continues to live in &#8220;approved premises&#8221;. Mr K&#8217;s current religious/political ideology will be critical to the assessment of any ongoing risk he may pose to his children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">At an earlier stage of these proceedings, at a case management hearing and at the request of the parties, I directed disclosure of documents from Her Majesty&#8217;s Prison and Probation Service (&#8220;HMPPS&#8221;); the direction sought discovery of documents which would shed (it is hoped) more light on the circumstances of the father&#8217;s offences, his current attitude to those offences and his conviction, and his ideology. Disclosure was provided. </p>

Accordingly, and pursuant to a formal application which I considered on the papers, I made a further direction, by consent, for further disclosure from HMPPS. In response to my direction, the Secretary of State for Justice (&#8220;SSJ&#8221;) responded. Through counsel, Ms Fiona Paterson, he indicated a willingness to comply with the direction (and did so) but wished to take the opportunity to make wider submissions to the court about the process by which additional disclosure had been ordered in this case, and in future cases. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On the wider procedural issues referred to above, Ms Fiona Paterson filed detailed written submissions on behalf of the SSJ; she has proposed that it would be useful for the court to consider in general terms how third-party directions orders against HMPPS and similar bodies connected with the criminal justice system could in the future could be better managed.

Accordingly, the court should be careful to identify with as much precision as possible in any order directed to the police or other agencies: the issues which arise in the family proceedings; the types of information it seeks; and the timetable set by the court for the family proceedings (&#167;13).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Given Mr. K&#8217;s conviction and the consequent potential risk to his children through radicalisation, the SSJ, through Ms Paterson, acknowledges that there is a &#8220;compelling argument for the Family Court, the expert and the parties, to receive disclosure of any material&#8221; which informs the question of Mr K&#8217;s current religious/political ideology. However, she submits, that argument must be balanced against the practical challenges faced by HMPPS in this (or indeed any other similar) case in responding to a direction for the disclosure of relevant documents. In particular, she pointed up that:</p>

In this particular case, the disclosure which the SSJ has made amounts to some 640 pages; this is a fraction of the total amount of material held by HMPPS concerning Mr K. Accordingly, specific rather than general requests for documents are encouraged;</p>

It is suggested that a significant amount of time could have been saved in the disclosure process had Mr K, in this case, alerted his legal team to the fact that he possessed some of the relevant documents and could then have written to the SSJ and the Parole Board seeking their views about the appropriateness of disclosure of these documents to the appointed expert and/or to the court and parties in the care proceedings (Mr K would not have had an automatic right to disclose the Parole Dossier or its contents directly to non-parties to the Parole Board proceedings).</p>

The accompanying <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Direction</span> (&#167;2.1) provides, in effect, that in issued proceedings this is the Treasury Solicitor&#8217;s Office (i.e., GLD). The principal advantage of service of an order on the GLD, submits Ms Paterson, is that the request for disclosure can be considered by someone who is legally qualified, and who will be in a good position to appreciate not only the significance of the request but also the potential urgency. He/she may also anticipate what classes of documents could be available and whether redaction is likely to be necessary.</p>

This may enable the SSJ to suggest the potential relevance of documents which have not been identified by the parties &#8211; for example, in the present proceedings, Mr K&#8217;s updated OASys report. In my judgment, the parties should obtain explicit permission of the court to provide the summary of relevant information given the provisions of <span style="font-style:italic">r.12.72-75</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">FPR 2010 / PD12G FPR 2010</span>; it may be necessary/appropriate to accompany the proposed summary with an application for a reporting restriction order to prohibit further publication of the summary information provided.</p>
