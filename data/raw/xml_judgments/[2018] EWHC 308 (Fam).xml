	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Alfie was born at the Liverpool Women&#8217;s Hospital. He was delivered at full term with a healthy weight and discharged home three days after the birth. Alfie&#8217;s mother was then 18 years old and this was her first pregnancy. Alfie&#8217;s father Tom was 19 years of age. Though self-evidently very young and though Alfie had not been planned his parents were delighted by him. They were both determined to be good parents and, from what I have seen and read, were instinctive and natural. The couple were well-supported by their respective extended families. Alfie was a happy smiling baby who seemed to be perfectly well. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The first indication that all might not be well occurred in July 2016 when Alfie was noted to have a &#8216;divergent squint&#8217; for which a hospital referral was considered appropriate. He was seen again by his General Practitioner, at four months, for his first child development check. It is clear that M already had some concerns about her son&#8217;s general development. Alfie&#8217;s smile had become less frequent, he was sleeping to an extent that had begun to alarm her and quite commonly she had to wake him up. She was concerned too with Alfie&#8217;s lack of general interaction and disinclination to reach out for or play with his toys. I sense also that M considered that the squint was something rather more serious. She queried Alfie&#8217;s ability to see. It is apparent that concern was shared by others, the health visitor was troubled by Alfie&#8217;s lack of age-appropriate head control.</p>

He was reviewed in the general paediatric outpatient clinic in Alder Hey Hospital in November 2016. On examination he was there found to be functioning in a range appropriate to a six week &#8211; 2 month old infant. An MRI brain/spine scan was arranged for 30 November 2016. The report of Dr M, a Consultant Paediatrician, specialising in intensive care medicine, records the following:   </p>

His parents reported that this episode had lasted approximately 20 minutes, after which Alfie had a sleep. He was taken to Accident and Emergency about 20 minutes after the episode.

(The normal breathing rate for this age is 20 -30 breaths per minute).  He had moderate increased work of breathing with signs on auscultation (listening) to the chest of wheeze and scattered crepitations (crepitations are heard with secretions in the lungs).  A microbiology test on a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) showed rhinovirus/ enterovirus. (The test cannot differentiate these two organisms - infection could be with either or both pathogens). We commonly isolate these viruses in infants with acute viral lower respiratory tract infections. Alfie was diagnosed with acute viral bronchiolitis and a possible prolonged febrile convulsion.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Later in the afternoon Alfie was observed to have episodes of jerking of his whole body and referred to the Neurology team. An EEG was requested and the plan was to commence anti-convulsant therapy if the seizures worsened. On 15 December 2016 the seizures continued to the degree that it was thought necessary to prescribe Midazolam which is a benzodiazepine which is, I am told, a first line drug. This was administered for Alfie via the buccal route (placed against the inside lining of the cheek) which enables rapid absorption for patients who do not have an intravenous cannula. The medical records reveal that the seizures stopped after two or three minutes and Alfie slept. </p>

On the 19 December Alfie was reviewed by Dr R, a consultant in paediatric neurology and on examination was found to have a slow breathing rate, apnoeas (pauses in breathing) and his most significant identifiable neurological response was to pain. The plan was to transfer Alfie to the High Dependency Unit for non-invasive respiratory support. Whilst preparing for this Alfie&#8217;s condition deteriorated significantly, his heart rate dropped and the periods of apnoea became more prolonged. A cardiac arrest call was made and bag-mask-valve ventilation was commenced to support his breathing. </p>

In addition the plan to admit Alfie to HDU was abandoned and he was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).  Dr R has given a summary of this period in a statement filed in this Application.  It requires to be stated in full:</p>

He showed sudden unprovoked movements compatible with infantile/epileptic spasms.  An EEG performed on the 16</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt">th</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt"> December 2016 confirmed hypsarrhythmia (electrical correlate to clinical epileptic or infantile spasms, disorganised EEG).  The EEG captured a number of electro-clinical epileptic spasms.  I commenced Alfie on Vigabatrin (anti-epileptic medication, first line treatment for infantile/epileptic spasms) with an increasing dose regime as per standard practice.  Alfie did not show any neurological recovery following the severe respiratory deterioration and critical life threatening illness on the intensive care unit.  Alfie showed signs of a severe infantile progressive encephalopathy with drug and ketogenic diet resistant seizures.  He remained profoundly encephalopathic/ comatose and remained unresponsive to central noxious stimuli (i.e. painful/ uncomfortable  stimulation delivered via rubbing of cranial nerve exit points in the area of his eyebrows) .   Encephalopathy is a general term that refers to brain malfunction due to brain disease or brain injury. The major symptom of an encephalopathy is reduced responsiveness or an altered mental state. Epileptic seizures and a movement disorder can also be a symptom of an encephalopathy.  There are numerous causes for an encephalopathy in childhood. They include infections, brain malfunction due to lack of oxygen or reduced blood flow, metabolic and biochemical conditions, toxins, drugs, trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases. At times Alfie  showed withdrawal of his legs to peripheral noxious stimuli (ie   applying pressure to his nailbeds)  and presumed spinal reflexes.  This means that information of painful stimuli travel up the nerve, enter the spinal cord in the back and stimulate a motor response, i.e. withdrawal, extension or flexion, via exiting immediately through the frontal nerve roots in the spinal cord without being modified from central &#8220;higher&#8221; nerve cells in the brain. Similar to our immediate withdrawal to for example, touching a hot cooker plate, when we withdraw our fingers long before we realise there is pain.  The majority of responses to tactile stimuli or to eye opening/light exposure were and are seizures as confirmed on repeated EEG examinations.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">A further EEG was performed in January 2017. This, however, was markedly different, showing attenuation with little in the way of reactive response for protracted periods of time. Changes only really occurred when Alfie had an epileptic seizure. Though there was no period of collapse between December and January all are agreed that Alfie was very unwell with a severe bi-lateral pneumonia.  It was at this time that the treating clinicians thought it both necessary and appropriate to broach with the parents the real possibility that Alfie might not recover.  In fact Alfie did not succumb to the pneumonia and effectively fought off the infection.  This has become an absolutely crucial feature of Alfie&#8217;s treatment in the father&#8217;s mind.  I think, having prepared himself for the worst, he believes that Alfie&#8217;s triumph over this infection is indicative of potential for more general recovery.  In cross-examination F has been critical of the doctors for having that conversation with him which he believes to have been premature.  He perceives this as &#8220;the hospital giving up on Alfie&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Though Alfie had successfully resisted the viral infection it is the case that the EEG pattern did not change and indeed has remained largely static since.  Dr R characterises Alfie&#8217;s present condition as showing no response to tactile, visual, auditory or sensory stimulation.  He has concluded that Alfie is in a coma and thus unaware of his surroundings.  By January 2018, the pupillary response was, he considers, <span style="font-size:11pt">&#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">entirely abnormal with only the most subtle, brief dilatation to light without any normal constriction.&#8221;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt"/>Some of this is disputed by Mr Evans. </p>

She noted that the MRI scan performed on 30 November 2016 raised the possibility either of underlying degenerative disorder or alternatively a metabolic disorder.  Mr Evans, during his cross-examination of the Trust&#8217;s witnesses, has focused on the possibility of the latter, identifying metabolic disorder as the diagnosis which permits of a more optimistic prognosis. In her evidence Professor Cross told me that she reviewed the serial EEG investigations. She emphasised that there is a &#8216;striking&#8217; and &#8216;marked&#8217; distinction between those of December and those post-January.  Those in December reveal evidence of hypsarrhythmia i.e. activity, particularly during sleep.  However, in January (2017) Professor Cross was clear that there was little in the way of reactive response.  The EEG she told me was <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;markedly</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">attenuated&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:10pt"/>which she clarified as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">essentially flat&#8221;</span>.

Both doctors but Dr R in particular volunteer that the scans, whilst important diagnostically, also have to be considered in the broader context of Alfie&#8217;s clinical presentation and history.  A number of scans were undertaken.  The first, as I have stated above, was dated 30 November 2016.  The second was in February 2017.  The third scan was performed on 22 August 2017 and was significant.  When Professor Cross gave her evidence the August scan was the most recent.  Because that scan was now nearly six months old I asked if a further MRI scan could be taken in order that I had the most up-to-date evidence.  I was reassured by Dr R that this would not be an intrusive or unsettling investigation for Alfie.  The most recent scan is dated 2 February 2018.  The earlier scans seen by Professor Cross enabled her to interpret the following:</p>

During her cross-examination by F she told him in gentle terms  that even if it were possible to stop Alfie&#8217;s seizures, which did not look likely given his poor response to anti-convulsant treatment to date, his brain is entirely beyond recovery.  The brain she said, again on F&#8217;s enquiry, simply has no capacity to regenerate itself unlike e.g. the liver.  She agreed that nobody knew quite why the brain does not have the ability to do so but it is simply acknowledged by neurologists that it cannot.  F, who has been representing himself and his partner during this case for reasons which I will address in detail, followed this observation up by enquiring whether given that Alfie&#8217;s brain has not yet (at his age) fully formed it might generate as oppose to regenerate brain matter.  That was just one of F&#8217;s many thoughtful and impressive questions of the medical experts.  Sadly, it drew a negative response.  The brain would only be able to generate further from existing matter.  </p>

It is unlikely that he can breathe now without assistance.  She factored in the dramatic deterioration in the EEG scans.  All this she concluded pointed to a mitochondrial disorder.  This she recognised had now been further supported by tests indicating mitochondrial genetic mutation.  Nothing in the brain was functioning normally.  Professor Cross considered that the brain was now only able to generate seizures.  Accordingly, this was not an epileptic encephalopathy by which Professor Cross explained that the epileptic seizures are not contributing to the neurological degeneration but a consequence of the neurodegenerative disorder.  </p>

Nobody knows what triggered or caused this devastating erosion of Alfie&#8217;s brain, there is no diagnosis and there may never be.  The fact remains however that all agreed the degeneration is both catastrophic and untreatable.  Professor Haas&#8217;s report, dated 7 January, was filed in consequence of my own case management decision on the 19 December in response to the parents&#8217; application.  At that time both were represented by highly experienced solicitors and Counsel.  At the hearing the specialism of the required expert was agreed but I permitted the parents&#8217; team to identify the individual.  In the light of the broad consensus I do not consider it necessary to review the evidence of each of the witnesses.  It is however important that I identify the conclusions of Professor Haas.  At the hearing the Court staff spent several days trying to contact Professor Haas who was returning from an international conference.  He had not been warned to attend to give evidence by F.  Contact was made and Professor Haas was ready to commence his evidence by telephone link.  At the very last minute F decided that he did not wish to challenge Professor Hass&#8217;s evidence.  In setting out these arrangements I do not intend to be critical of F in any way, but it is important that it is recorded that every effort has been made in order for him to develop his case as fully as possible.</p>

I believe that given Alfie&#8217;s very poor prognosis with no possible curative treatment and no prospect of recovery the continuation of active intensive care treatment is futile and may well be causing him distress and suffering.

He responded to the obvious challenge of being questioned directly by a grieving parent in a public Court room with patience, compassion and great professional skill.  Without exception he displayed a willingness to reflect carefully on the questions and propositions put to him and a readiness to yield to any point that might be made against him.  F was unsparing in some of his challenges to Dr R, suggesting collusion with other doctors and sometimes seeking to cast doubt on his integrity.  Expressed in this way it appears to reveal F in an unfavourable light but these assays have to be tempered against F&#8217;s essential courtesy and good manners throughout.  I observe that, whilst it may not seem entirely consistent with the case he advanced, F consistently paid tribute to the medical and nursing staff.

Crucial to the decision I am being asked to make is the need to ascertain, as accurately as it can be, the present level of Alfie&#8217;s awareness.  Accordingly, I considered that an up-to-date MRI scan was a significant component in the broad sweep of evidence that was likely to inform this assessment.  The scan of 2 February 2018 confirmed the progressive destruction of the white matter of the brain which Dr R interpreted as now appearing almost identical to water and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  In addition, new areas of signal abnormality were demonstrated in the deep grey matter of the basal ganglia.  The thalami, which I have been told fire the pathways within the white matter which generate sensory perception is, Dr R points out, effectively invisible in the scan.  In simple terms the thalami, basal ganglia, the vast majority of the white matter of the brain and a significant degree of the cortex have been wiped out by this remorseless degenerative condition. </p>

He does not show any spontaneous movements. His motor responses are either of an epileptic nature or are spinal reflexes.  He is deeply comatose and for all intents and purposes therefore unaware of his surroundings.  Although fluctuating, his pupillary responses are abnormal with now only the most subtle, very brief dilatation to exposure to light but no normal constriction.  Exposure to loud noises does not elicit any response.  There is no response to central painful stimuli other than the occasional seizure.  There is no response to painful peripheral stimuli other than seizures or at times spinal reflexes with extension and internal rotation of his arms and less frequently now, of flexion of his legs.  Alfie is profoundly hypotonic (low muscle tension at rest).  Deep tendon reflexes are absent.

Alfie has not lost brainstem control as he does not show signs of temperature instability, diabetes insipidus (i.e. loss of central control to concentrate urine) or abnormalities of sugar control.  Episodes of otherwise not explained low heart rate point to an impairment of brainstem function suggesting that very rudimentary functions are at least intermittently impaired. This is not unusual. This does not imply that Alfie is able to &#8220;enjoy sensations&#8221;, it just means that very basic functions are impaired. When there is severe impairment of the brain during for example severe hypoxic/ ischaemic events, the brain &#8220;shuts down&#8221; any non essential perfusion ensuring that the  brainstem continuous to be supplied with blood flow and oxygen to preserve vital functions to &#8220;preserve life&#8221;   Alfie does not currently show other brainstem dysfunction such as temperature de-regulation, excessive sweating, abnormal skin perfusion (flashing or extreme pallor), de-regulation of his glucose (sugar) levels or dysregulation of his fluid haemostasis (no evidence for diabetes insipidus with excessive urine output and electrolyte disturbances).</span></p>

He will never make any developmental  progress (gross motor, fine motor, vision, hearing, social, emotional). Alfie is not responding to any painful or uncomfortable stimuli other than with seizures or with spinal reflexes to uncomfortable/painful peripheral stimuli.  Due to his underlying neurological process it is highly unlikely that Alfie has any awareness of pain or discomfort and does not show any neurological signs that would suggest that he is in pain or discomfort such as increase of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate to uncomfortable/painful stimuli.  It is likely that the pathways that would usually transmit the stimuli are interrupted/dysfunctional making a cognitive awareness of pain unlikely.  However, as Alfie is unable to communicate, it is important to consider whether, despite his inability to respond, Alfie may still have some awareness of pain and discomfort and this should therefore be kept to an absolute minimum considering that he might still be able to &#8220;feel&#8221; uncomfortable sensation I think it is unlikely that Alfie has any ability to be reassured by the voices and touch of his parents.</span></p>

Alfie had been the subject of on-going investigation in the context of dispute for many months and it was clear that the case had to be scrutinised by the Court. I ordered the case be listed on the 19 December 2017.  The parents were, at that stage, represented by solicitors. A robust application, on paper, was made to adjourn the Directions Hearing by F&#8217;s team.  That application was entirely misconceived.  It is manifest that the case required to be scrutinised by the Court. At the Hearing, though the parents&#8217; statements had not been filed, a timetable was drawn up, with the assistance of experienced Counsel who acted on their behalf.  The parents were given ample opportunity to put those documents together.  I extended the timescales in order that they would not have to worry about the preparing of documents over the Christmas period, indeed, I stressed in Court that they should not do so.  That time, I recognised, was very important to them.  </p>

F was directed to an alternative and highly respected firm of solicitors, convenient to his home, who would probably take up the case.  That was not pursued and by the time this hearing began the parents remained unrepresented.  I formed the clear impression that F thought that this fact would determine, in his favour, his yet further application to adjourn.  It was a miscalculation on his part.  F told me that his and the mother&#8217;s human rights to a fair trial would be breached if he was forced to go ahead.  My very clear impression was that the father wanted to do everything in his power to buy time for his son.  I do not criticise him, on the contrary he has my every sympathy but it is, I hope, evident from everything that I have set out above that Alfie required a decision to be taken.  </p>

In resisting the application he emphasised that the medical evidence did not allow us to assume that Alfie is free from pain.  Further, it was submitted, the evidence pointed compellingly towards futility of treatment.  The parents had instructed experts of their own to advise them on the issues.  During the course of the dispute the parents have engaged the services of no fewer than six different firms of lawyers.  I agreed with Mr Mylonas that an adjournment was entirely irreconcilable with Alfie&#8217;s best interests.  That said, I should record that the Child&#8217;s Guardian, represented by her solicitor Ms Carew, declared herself to be &#8220;probably neutral&#8221;.  I will make no comment on that.  </p>

In the event, as anybody sitting in Court would immediately recognise, F&#8217;s presentation of his case was extraordinarily impressive.  His knowledge of the paperwork and the medical records was prodigious.  His understanding of the functioning of the brain and his exploration of competing hypothesis was remarkable.  At one point in the evidence when he had asked a question of particular complexity I asked him if somebody had been providing the questions for him.  He told me, entirely convincingly, that he had written it out a moment or two before.  His uncle, sitting next to him, confirmed it.  F left school at 16.  He served an apprenticeship as a plasterer.  It says much about his commitment to his son and the time and energy he has directed to this case that he has absorbed the issues so completely and intelligently.  He believes passionately that his view of Alfie&#8217;s future is the correct one.  As I said during the course of the evidence it can only be in Alfie&#8217;s interest for all the available theories to be evaluated.  On this premise therefore Alfie could have had no more articulate voice on his behalf than his father&#8217;s in this Court room.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">F&#8217;s case is not entirely easy to state. His core dilemma, from which he struggles to escape, is that whilst he recognises and understands fully that the weight of the evidence spells out the futility of Alfie&#8217;s situation he is, as a father, unable to relinquish hope.  This is to my mind entirely understandable. It is a facet of F&#8217;s grief.  In consequence, there is often a tension in the logic of his position.  His personal conflict emerges in its starkest form in his attitude to the Alder Hey Hospital.  Sometimes F is fulsome and generous in his tributes to the doctors and medical staff, on other occasions his criticisms are vituperative.  This tension resonates in his approach to the medical evidence.  It is, I think, no coincidence that F, whose primary position is that &#8220;no stone should be left unturned&#8221;, was resistant to the final MRI scan being undertaken.  F, in my judgment, knew all too well, in the light of the earlier scans, what the latest MRI scan might reveal and, again for entirely understandable reasons, could not bear to confront it.  As the Judge I did not have that option, for the reasons that I have set out.  It was shortly after the final scan became available that F renewed his application for representation.  I interpret that as a signal of his distress but not as an indicator of forensic vulnerability. </p>

It is clear that in his best interest there should be a possibility for Alfie to live the possibly short rest of his life in dignity together with his family if this is the wish of his parents at home, which I believe is the best for him, outside a hospital or in a hospice or other form of caring institution.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The assumption of BG and Professor Haas is that the short note provided by Dr Hubner of the &#8216;Pediatric Air Ambulance&#8217; could be relied on.  Whilst that is a perfectly reasonable assumption to have made I regret to say that I have been unable to.  Dr Hubner gave evidence and was cross-examined by Mr Mylonas.  He accepted that he had gone to the Alder Hey Hospital in a clandestine manner, posing as a friend of the family.  He agreed with Mr Mylonas that he had deliberately withheld his professional status from the doctors and staff.  He told me that he had never done that before.  I am at least relieved to hear that.  It is corrosive of the bonds of professional trust and co-operation which are intrinsic to good medical practice and indispensible in a case of this kind.  Further, it emerged that Dr Hubner had provided a statement directly to the father and to his solicitors.  This had not been filed in these proceedings but it was produced at my request.  The statement began with an assertion by Dr Hubner that he had seen all of Alfie&#8217;s files.  He accepted in evidence that this was not the case.  In fact, he has seen very little.  I emphasise that the statement contained a Declaration of Truth.  Perhaps most alarmingly, Dr Hubner&#8217;s travel plan for Alfie, set out an anticonvulsant medical regime which, on the basis of Alder Hey&#8217;s experience with Alfie would have been ineffective and inappropriate.  In particular the Midazolam proposed by Dr Hubner was entirely contra indicated by his medical history.  Dr Hubner also told Mr Mylonas that he had not used the Air Ambulance for the purposes suggested here in cases where patients were dying.  I am at a loss to know quite why Dr Hubner fell so far below the standards expected of his profession.  I am constrained to say that he has failed the parents, the Court but most importantly, Alfie.   Mr Mylonas makes the point that he seemed not to recognise the extent and significance of his shortcomings in his evidence.  I agree.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;Your meeting will address questions dealing with the end of earthly life. &#160;They are questions that have always challenged humanity, but that today take on new forms by reason of increased knowledge and the development of new technical tools.&#160; The growing therapeutic capabilities of medical science have made it possible to eliminate many diseases, to improve health and to prolong people&#8217;s life span.&#160; While these developments have proved quite positive, it has also become possible nowadays to extend life by means that were inconceivable in the past. &#160;Surgery and other medical interventions have become ever more effective, but they are not always beneficial: they can sustain, or even replace, failing vital functions, but that is not the same as promoting health.&#160; Greater wisdom is called for today, because of the temptation to insist on treatments that have powerful effects on the body, yet at times do not serve the integral good of the person.   Some sixty years ago, Pope Pius XII, in a memorable address to anaesthesiologists and intensive care specialists, stated that there is no obligation to have recourse in all circumstances to every possible remedy and that, in some specific cases, it is permissible to refrain from their use (cf. AAS XLIX [1957], 1027-1033).&#160; Consequently, it is morally licit to decide not to adopt therapeutic measures, or to discontinue them, when their use does not meet that ethical and humanistic standard that would later be called &#8220;due proportion in the use of remedies&#8221; (cf. CONGREGATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH, </span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal;font-size:11pt">Declaration on Euthanasia</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">, 5 May 1980, IV: AAS LXXII [1980], 542-552). &#160;The specific element of this criterion is that it considers &#8220;the result that can be expected, taking into account the state of the sick person and his or her physical and moral resources&#8221; (ibid.).&#160; It thus makes possible a decision that is morally qualified as withdrawal of &#8220;overzealous treatment. Such a decision responsibly acknowledges the limitations of our mortality, once it becomes clear that opposition to it is futile. &#160;&#8220;Here one does not will to cause death; one&#8217;s inability to impede it is merely accepted&#8221; (</span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal;font-size:11pt">Catechism of the Catholic Church</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">, No. 2278).&#160; This difference of perspective restores humanity to the accompaniment of the dying, while not attempting to justify the suppression of the living.&#160; It is clear that not adopting, or else suspending, disproportionate measures, means avoiding overzealous treatment; from an ethical standpoint, it is completely different from euthanasia, which is always wrong, in that the intent of euthanasia is to end life and cause death. Needless to say, in the face of critical situations and in clinical practice, the factors that come into play are often difficult to evaluate. &#160;To determine whether a clinically appropriate medical intervention is actually proportionate, the mechanical application of a general rule is not sufficient.&#160; There needs to be a careful discernment of the moral object, the attending circumstances, and the intentions of those involved. &#160;In caring for and accompanying a given patient, the personal and relational elements in his or her life and death &#8211; which is after all the last moment in life &#8211; must be given a consideration befitting human dignity.&#160; In this process, the patient has the primary role. &#160;The </span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal;font-size:11pt">Catechism of the Catholic Church </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">makes this clear: &#8220;The decisions should be made by the patient if he is competent and able&#8221; (loc. cit.). The patient, first and foremost, has the right, obviously in dialogue with medical professionals, to evaluate a proposed treatment and to judge its actual proportionality in his or her concrete case, and necessarily refusing it if such proportionality is judged lacking. &#160;That evaluation is not easy to make in today's medical context, where the doctor-patient relationship has become increasingly fragmented and medical care involves any number of technological and organizational aspects.&#8221;</span></p>

The evidence, she told me, had served ultimately to confirm her recommendation.  She stated that in her view Alfie&#8217;s life now lacks dignity and his best interests can only be met by withdrawing ventilation.  This evidence from an experienced children&#8217;s guardian requires to be considered very carefully.  I have done so.  With great respect to her I disagree with her view on Alfie&#8217;s dignity.  As I had promised the family I attended the PICU at Alder Hey to meet Alfie.  I was greeted not merely with courtesy by the parents and a number of aunts and uncles but with a sincere and genuine warmth. I was and remain grateful to them.  Alfie&#8217;s pod in the unit is large, comfortable and he is surrounded by some of the world&#8217;s most up-to-date technology.  F was, in my presence, assiduous to Alfie&#8217;s care.  He is entirely besotted with his son.  M, both parents agree, is far less involved in Alfie&#8217;s practical care and less confident.  Her contribution, in my assessment, is of an entirely different complexion.  She has, if I may say so, a zany and delightful sense of humour entirely free from self-regard or pomposity.  Her love for her partner and her son was obvious.  The atmosphere around Alfie was peaceful, dignified and though some might find it surprising for me to say so, very happy.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">There emerge a number of key points in the evidence which now require to be identified.  Most striking is the indisputable fact that Alfie&#8217;s brain has been devastated by progressive degeneration.  The MRI scans, as interpreted, are compelling.  The thalami, which regulate the pathways of the brain, have entirely disappeared.  This, I remind myself, controls the stimuli to the most basic sensory functions.  Alfie has lost the capacity to hear, see, smell or respond to touch, other than reflexively.  At the conclusion of his evidence F produced a considerable number of video clips.  The overwhelming majority of these demonstrated the accuracy of the medical view in that they illustrate reactive responses which were frequently intentionally generated by F.  I stress that this was entirely well-motivated on F&#8217;s part.  In simple terms touching part of Alfie&#8217;s body generates a predictable response in a different muscle group.  There were two videos however which caused me much thought.  In one Alfie appears to emit a lusty yawn in another he appears actively to withdraw from a touch to his mouth.  I have watched these, as F is aware, repeatedly and carefully.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Following the videos being produced Dr R also viewed them extensively and thoughtfully.  The following day, having had time to reflect overnight, Dr R was recalled to the witness box.  He told me that for the yawn to be a true, as opposed to a reflexive action, it would require a complex response of the brain.  In simple terms, Dr R said there is not sufficient of Alfie&#8217;s brain left intact for this to occur, other than as a reflexive action.  The effect is entirely    to mimic a purposeful yawn.  I completely understand why F has invested so much in it.  When the yawn occurs F&#8217;s response is one of obvious delight.  However, it is impossible to avoid the force of Dr R&#8217;s conclusion, it has to be confronted.  The second video can far more easily be seen as reflexive.  I accept this evidence not merely because of the careful, interpretative expertise of Dr R but also because it unifies the remaining evidence, the EEG&#8217;s, the scans, the observations of Alfie over many months by so many medical professions and indeed, the preponderance of the parents&#8217; own observations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">I should add by way of Post Script my thanks to Mr Mylonas.  His presentation of this case has been assiduously fair and balanced throughout.  His cross-examination of F was skilful, sensitive and kind.  F paid a similar tribute at the conclusion of the case which I observed at the time and take this opportunity to reiterate, says a great deal about both of them.</p>
