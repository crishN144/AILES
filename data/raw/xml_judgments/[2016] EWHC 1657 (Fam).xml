The mother strongly opposes the father&#8217;s appeal.  She maintains that, as the 2008 French order remains extant (despite its obvious age) it should be enforced in this jurisdiction in line with the philosophy of reciprocal enforcement which underpins the Convention, as is exemplified by recital 21 of the Convention which provides:</span></p>

He, the father, asked if a lady companion could be in court for the hearing, to which there was no objection from the mother&#8217;s side.  I proffered that the lady could sit beside him to help him, but he was content that she should sit at the back of the court, as she did and as she is now doing during the delivery of this judgment.  The mother, who is publicly funded (and has been assisted by a French interpreter) has been represented by Mr. Hosford-Tanner of counsel who was accompanied by his instructing solicitors. It is not easy to provide a level playing field when there is an &#8216;inequality of arms&#8217; such as this; but I tried my best to explain things to the father as we were going along and to assist him by formulating some of the questions which he wanted to put to the mother.  I have read all the relevant parts of the bundle, including statements by both parties setting out their cases and an attendance note by CAFCASS officer dated 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> May 2016 setting out her discussions with both children at court on 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> May 2016.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Normally, in an application such as this, oral evidence would probably not be necessary.  Here, however, there is a profound dispute of fact on the statements as to the circumstances in which the children were transferred in 2013 from the mother in France to the father who brought them to England.  The mother says that the father has wrongly retained them here since 2013 and the father says that he has had them here with him since 2013 with the mother&#8217;s consent.  It seemed to me that this was an important, if not pivotal, issue as regards the overall justice of either recognition and enforcement or non-recognition and non-enforcement of the 2008 order.  I considered that I ought, therefore, to hear the parties, so as to be able to make a factual finding on the issue.  It could have been done by inferences (as is so often done in Hague Convention proceedings); but with both parties here with interpreters it could have left a sense of grievance in the party against whom I made findings on the factual issue in question, if he or she had not been given a chance to give his or her explanations in an attempt to rebut those possible inferences.   </span></p>

It would not be difficult on that factual hypothesis to find that recognition and enforcement would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of this jurisdiction.  But the same would not apply if the factual finding were the other way about, namely that there has been a wrongful retention in this country by the father.</span></p>

The two children the subject of the French order of 2008 and therefore of these proceedings are A, a boy, born in 2004, who is aged 12 and B, a boy born in 2006, who is 10.  Both are French citizens.  In 2001 the parties were married in the Congo. They subsequently moved to France where both children were born.  In 2007 the parties separated.  The mother and children moved from Brittany to Bordeaux.  The father later moved from Brittany to Rennes.</span></p>

The divorce order had an agreement between the parties dated 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2008 whereby the parties agreed and the court approved that the residence of the children should be granted to the mother with such contact to the father as the parties might agree, but in default of agreement then for half of each school holiday.  It was further agreed and, accordingly, ordered that the father should pay the mother maintenance at the rate of &#8364;120 per month per child.  The mother&#8217;s case is that that was not often paid.   Other than that, the order of 28</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2008 took effect and seems to have worked satisfactorily in most respects for the next five years or so until 2013.  In 2009 the father applied to the court in Bordeaux and achieved the suspension of the maintenance which I have just mentioned on the basis that he was out of employment.  He was ordered to provide the mother with six monthly evidence of his income and his efforts to find employment, but the mother&#8217;s case is that this never happened.  That, however, is not a point which has been explored at this hearing.  Nevertheless, it meant that she was responsible, on any view, both for bringing up and providing financially for the children. </span></p>

She was, accordingly, summonsed before the social services and before the court in Bordeaux.  Those documents are in the bundle.  Following investigation of the issues raised about the safety and the welfare of the children, they were returned to her or else allowed to be retained by her.  She thereafter continued to care for them under the 2008 residence order and the father&#8217;s contact continued likewise under that order.  However the mother&#8217;s case, which I accept, is that bringing up two children and having to work to support them, sometimes extremely long hours, was exhausting and that she became seriously run down and eventually unwell.   </span></p>

The children were then nine and seven respectively.  The mother accepts that the father said at that time that he was relocating to England and she accepts that she agreed to the children going with him until she was better.  She obtained certificates from the school (which the father relies on) which are headed &#8220;Certificat de Radiation&#8221;, which means &#8220;striking off&#8221;, signed by the school dated 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2013.

The mother also gave the father the children&#8217;s relevant health books.  He relies on having been given those books and the school certificates as showing that the children were handed over to him for good. The mother says that the certificates were simply the way the school expressed the fact that she had told the school that there was a risk that they would not be back in September 2013 if she was not well enough to resume caring for them.</span></p>

By that time she felt well enough to resume their care.  She says that the father refused.  From then on it is her case further that she could only speak to the children over the telephone with difficulty and she could only ascertain the fact that the father and the children were living in London, but not any precise address.  She says she tried many times to negotiate the children&#8217;s return to France, but without success, including consulting his relatives in Africa which the father accepts she did do.  The father, on the other hand, says that the mother refused to accept his calls when he tried to telephone her, because he considered that she was not wishing to agree to share with him the French child benefit of which he believes she was in receipt in France and which he had earlier asked her to pay over to him.</span></p>

However, it led to the decision that a collection order from the children&#8217;s schools was &#8216;the only way that the court could achieve the necessary control over the matter&#8217; given the then understanding that the father had not been frank with the Tipstaff.

Ms Y recommended to Holman J that the children should not be separated.  Under para.4 of the order of Holman J of that date it was directed that neither party should cause or permit the children to leave England and Wales, repeating a previous order of Wood J.  One aspect of the judge&#8217;s order was that the parties were to try to agree contact for the father to the children, the order being premised on the basis that the children would live with the mother until such time as the question of recognition and enforcement of the French order had been resolved.

Even if the mother had been pregnant in 2013, as the father seems to be suggesting (but which she denies) it would be surprising for an otherwise fit and healthy young mother (as per the preponderance of the father&#8217;s case) suddenly to relinquish to the father care of two sons, whom she clearly loves and for whom she was caring at least adequately (as per the 2011 Bordeaux safeguarding finding).  The mother&#8217;s case seems inherently the more likely that she was worn out and unwell with having to care for the children and to support them financially and needed some respite help from the children&#8217;s father until she had recovered sufficiently to resume their care.  </span></p>

I find as a fact that she was ill in 2013 and told the father so; and that the agreement was as she claims it was, namely for the father to take the children (and also to take them to England) but only until she was better and asked to resume their care.  I reject the claim that the arrangement was for the father to keep the children for good and I find that his keeping them since late 2013 was a wrongful retention of them in this jurisdiction in the face of the 2008 order giving residence to the mother.  This finding means that the 2008 order is, on any view, still extant (the father&#8217;s application to change residence in the court at Bordeaux having been dismissed in October 2014 as above).  The only reason that the boys have been in this jurisdiction so long (nearly 2 &#190; years) is that the father refused the mother&#8217;s requests, as I find, to return them to her in France and that she did not know their address in London.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The situation of A however is more difficult in view of his expressed wishes and feelings.  I have considered carefully whether he should have a Children&#8217;s Guardian to argue his particular case against a return to France.  However, it is necessary to balance the advantages of that against the fact that it would cause delay.  Such delay would be particularly unfortunate when the boys&#8217; lives are in limbo and when the mother is living away from her home in France with no income, spending her modest savings and borrowing money from friends.  She has very considerable accommodation difficulties.  Her solicitors have themselves funded her accommodation here, reliant on reimbursement from the public funding authorities.  In the end I have decided that a Children&#8217;s Guardian is not necessary for A.  As I have said, his opposition to living with his mother in France was not absolute when he spoke to Ms Y and I am fully cognisant of the arguments which can and would be put before me were he separately represented.  I am fortified in this view (i) by the fact that such an experienced judge as Holman J, having heard Ms Y report about the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings on 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> May 2016, did not appoint a Children&#8217;s Guardian for A; and (ii) by the mother&#8217;s evidence, which I accept, that her relationship with A is much better now that he has actually been with her.  That, I might add, is by no means counterintuitive.  It seems clear from what B originally told Ms Y (above), from the school&#8217;s observation of B&#8217;s demeanour and from the school&#8217;s record of things he subsequently said after spending time with the mother, that the father must have been saying negative things about the mother from time to time, which (although he denies it) I find he was.  Even if he had not been, the boys were clearly very conflicted, caught up in the dynamics of very obvious acrimony between their parents whenever they (the parents) communicated by telephone and they (the boys) were doubtless of the mind-set that, by not seeing them for such a long time, their mother had abandoned them.  All this would be likely to have set A against the mother in a way which would be equally likely to be ameliorated once reunited with her, especially since he knows that his brother B wishes to be cared for by the mother in France.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">So the question regarding A comes to this.  Can it be said that the passage of time since 2008, coupled with his (A&#8217;s) expressed wishes and feelings to Ms Y, amount to such a serious welfare consideration, i.e. such a negative and detrimental welfare consideration, that Article 23 is met so as to require me not to recognise and not enforce the French order?  For the reasons just set out, there is in my judgement every likelihood that A will settle with the mother, if he has not done so already, and will settle back to the home in Bordeaux, where the family lived (that is, the mother and the two boys) prior to her being unwell in 2013 and asking the father to help out.  He would be there with his younger brother, and I agree with both the mother and Ms Y that it would clearly not be in their interests to separate them one from the other.  That is what would happen if the French order were recognised and enforced regarding B but not regarding A.  It would leave B in France with the mother; but where would it leave A?  The current contact order is for supported contact to the father, specifically at a contact centre.  Unless there were to be a complete reversal of that approach today, as to which there has not been evidence or debate, it is difficult to see how A could just be returned to the father&#8217;s care, even though that might turn out to be perfectly appropriate on further examination. </span></p>

That, together with his obvious sadness when talking to Ms Y, suggests to me a lad who was conflicted when he spoke to Ms Y and it is easy to see why.  Last, whilst Art. 23 provides that a foreign order shall not be enforced if the child was not given an opportunity to be heard at the time it was given, these two children were respectively aged only 4 and 2 in 2008, when the consent order was made in France.  So I cannot see that that provision realistically applies on the facts so as to mean that the French order is not to be enforced here.</span></p>

True it is that the 2008 order is a very old one, much older than in the previous cases to which I have been referred; but the age of the order is not </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">per se</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> a reason for its non-recognition and enforcement.  It is all a question of considering the overall circumstances.  It is a matter of fact and degree.  Here the order was, on any view, &#8216;actively&#8217; effective until September 2013, three years ago, and only ceased to be effective &#8216;on the ground&#8217; (of course it remained in force in law) because the mother temporarily relinquished the children to the father, as I have found, and the father retained them.  Further, the father himself took advantage of the French legal system by way of his application there to change residence which, although it was not pursued and was dismissed for that reason in 2014, had as its very subject matter the 2008 order.</span></p>
