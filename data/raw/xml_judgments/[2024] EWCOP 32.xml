I got the impression that the pace of change for CD is very slow. I cannot see that arranging a contact visit to South West England would be a good reason for not progressing activities for CD in South Yorkshire. That was certainly AB&#8217;s view.

GH responded that CD&#8217;s assessed need is for 2:1 support in the community and that she needs to know how CD&#8217;s needs are going to be met in any given situation.</p>
