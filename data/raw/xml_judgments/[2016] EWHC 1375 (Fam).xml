	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this matter I am concerned with the welfare of NH.  NH was born in October 1999 and is now 16 years old.&#160; The applications originally brought by the London Borough of Sutton were those for orders under the inherent jurisdiction and/or a public law order under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  Only the latter application is now pursued.  This matter is listed before me for a final hearing by a case management order dated 17 December 2015.</p>

The mother instructed lawyers to represent her at this hearing, has corresponded extensively with the court in respect of this hearing and has travelled to this jurisdiction prior to the start of this hearing. The mother was in the jurisdiction on the date the final hearing commenced but did not attend.  </p>

The mother indicated she would not be attending and gave various reasons for this, ranging from a fear of being arrested in circumstances where she is in breach of a reporting restriction order made by Cobb J on 17 December 2015, through an assertion that she has injured her foot, to sundry difficulties with travel arrangements.  Within the foregoing context I was satisfied that the circumstances were such as to justify proceeding with the hearing despite the mother&#8217;s absence pursuant to FPR 2010 r 27.4(3)(b).  In the event however, it has not been possible to conclude matters for reasons which I shall come to.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the commencement of this hearing the mother was represented by leading and junior counsel, Mr Tertha Gupta QC and Mr Michael Bailey, instructed by a solicitor acting on her behalf, Mr William Bache.  Following my refusal of an application to adjourn this final hearing issued by the mother on 14 March 2015 on the grounds of alleged defects in the bundle, the mother&#8217;s legal team felt compelled to retire in circumstances where mother had made clear first, that they were not instructed proceed with the hearing without her approval and before the defects she considered existed in the bundle had been remedied (email of 14 March 2016 at 10:43), second that they did not have her interests at heart (email of 14 March 2016 at 16:21) and, finally, that she had instructed them to appeal &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">court injunctions</span>&#8221; (apparently a reference to an order I made on 9 March controlling the manner in which the mother sees certain documents filed in these proceedings) instead of appearing at the hearing (email of 14 March 2016 at 17:16).  </p>

Notwithstanding this position, I was provided with a Certificate of Capacity by NH&#8217;s treating psychiatrist dated 8 March 2016 which confirmed that NH had capacity to conduct proceedings.  During the course of the hearing, and as a result of events which I shall set out in more detail below, NH&#8217;s treating psychiatrist confirmed that NH appears now to have lost capacity to conduct proceedings.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As set out above, the London Borough of Sutton apply for a care order in respect of NH under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.   At the outset of this hearing the local authority&#8217;s care plan for NH was for him to be supported to return to Canada subject to his mental health stabilising under the care of the Unit in which he is currently detained under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>, this being at the outset of the hearing also NH&#8217;s clearly expressed wish.  The mother fiercely opposes this plan and seeks the return of NH to either South Africa or Zimbabwe.   Prior to this hearing, NH has expressed equally fierce opposition to such an outcome and a clear wish to return to Canada.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having read the papers in this matter, and having regard in particular to the expert evidence concerning the laws of Alberta and Ontario, it is right to note that at the outset of the hearing I entertained significant doubts as to whether the court had sufficient clarity concerning the likely position of NH in Canada to consider, let alone approve, the local authority&#8217;s current care plan.  Following developments during the course of this hearing, the local authority now in any event concedes that, at this point in time, the court does not have before it the clarity required to undertake the holistic balancing exercise necessary to determine which of the options for NH&#8217;s future care is in his best interests.  Whilst it had been my intention nonetheless to utilise this hearing to deal with the issue of threshold, this course was rendered inappropriate when it became apparent during the course of the initial stages of the hearing that NH had apparently lost capacity to conduct litigation.  In the circumstances, the only matter capable of being dealt with at this hearing has been a review of the position in respect of jurisdiction, as mandated by the case management order of Cobb J of 27 November 2015.</p>

Whilst a Senior Support Worker initially insisted on being present during the meeting, he alleges that he felt unsafe in the presence of the mother and left the room.  Watching through a window the Support Worker contends that he witnessed certain documents being produced from the trousers of the mother or the cousin, which documents had not been apparent when the women passed through the security measures at the hospital.  The Senior Support Worker relates that the mother and LN proceeded to discuss the pre-prepared documents with NH and persuaded him to sign the same.  Watching from outside the room the Senior Support Worker considered NH to have been coerced into signing the documents, some of which he did not read before signing.</p>

That said, I do have grave concerns over the manner in which the statement I have described was obtained from NH and in relation to the mother&#8217;s visit to the hospital more generally.  Of further concern is the apparent impact that the mother&#8217;s visit, and her conduct during the course of that visit has had on NH&#8217;s emotional equilibrium.   NH&#8217;s treating psychiatrist considers that the impact of the events that I have recounted on NH&#8217;s mental health has been such that it appears that NH has now lost capacity to conduct proceedings.  </p>

I have also had access to the large amount of email correspondence that the mother has provided to the court and to the parties.  In the circumstances, I have felt able to deal with at least the review exercise mandated by the order of Cobb J of 27 November 2015.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As noted above, the mother agrees broadly with the chronology set out in the judgment of Cobb J.  The additional matters that the mother produces by way of evidence in her statement of 3 December 2015 centre on reinforcing the primary argument that she advanced before Cobb J in July 2015, namely that NH is habitually resident in Zimbabwe.   To this end, the mother provides additional evidence of the fact that she brought a plot of land in Harare in August 2013 and set out two businesses in Zimbabwe in 2014, that NH spent most of his school holidays between July 2013 and August 2014 in Zimbabwe (a fact reflected in Cobb J&#8217;s judgment), that NH spent Christmas 2014 in Zimbabwe, that on 3 March 2015 the mother informed the Swiss Education Board of her intention to remove NH from private education and that in 2015 she enrolled him in school in Zimbabwe and made enquiries of a clinic in South Africa.  The Skeleton Argument filed on behalf of the mother argues that this evidence, together with certain aspects of the OECD Model Tax Convention, further supports the primary submission she advanced in writing to Cobb J in July 2015, namely that it demonstrate that the mother and NH were habitually resident in Zimbabwe at the time they entered the England in 2015.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">NH likewise agrees broadly with the chronology set out by Cobb J in his judgment.  In his statement of 8 December 2015 on the issue of habitual residence he contends he has only spent approximately 12 months in Zimbabwe throughout his sixteen years (the longest period being the academic year from July 2013 to July 2014, during which period NH states that he had extensive holidays away from Zimbabwe), that the mother&#8217;s property in Harare is her house and not his home, that he was forced against his will to go to Zimbabwe and has no desire to return there.  NH contends that he was tricked into coming to England in April 2014 and, had he known his mother&#8217;s true intentions, he would never had left Switzerland.  </p>

However, I am satisfied that the evidence filed by the mother taken at its highest in no way undermines the factual determinations made by Cobb J in his judgment of 30 July 2015 and, indeed, is consistent with those determinations.  I am likewise satisfied that the evidence filed by NH in no way undermines the factual determinations made by Cobb J in his judgment of 30 July 2015 and does not undermine the same.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In reaching his decision in July 2015 Cobb J considered that the views of NH and his state of mind were highly material to the issue of habitual residence.  Prior to this hearing, the information and evidence available to me makes clear that NH saw his home as being in Switzerland or Canada (albeit his right to remain in Switzerland was extinguished and he has not been to Canada for a number of years) and at no point considered himself to be habitually resident in Zimbabwe.  The mother argues that the weight to be attached to NH&#8217;s state of mind must be considered in light of his being a vulnerable child and particularises in her Skeleton Argument a series of factors which support that submission.  Whilst I am mindful that NH&#8217;s mental health has deteriorated to the point that his current wishes and feelings are now unclear, there is no evidence currently before the court to suggest that NH seeks to resile from what he has said with regard to his own state of mind insofar as relevant to the issue of habitual residence or that, on the basis of the facts broadly accepted by all parties, he would be in a position to do so.  It is plain from the history I have set out above that, since his arrival in England, NH cannot be said to have become integrated into a social and family environment. </p>

Whilst reiterating that the question of habitual residence is a question of fact, Lord Wilson concluded in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>that, as reflected in previous case law, a situation in which a child has no habitual residence will be a situation that is exceptional in nature.

In particular, I am satisfied that the evidence filed by the mother with a view to reiterating and reinforcing her submission that NH was habitually resident in Zimbabwe, of which submission Cobb J was fully cognisant, is capable of disturbing Cobb J&#8217;s finding that this was not the case.</p>

In circumstances where NH&#8217;s emotional equilibrium is apparently now even more fragile than it was as at 9 March 2016, in my judgment the need to protect NH from the emotional harm of knowing that very personal details are at risk of being publicised in the manner the mother has publicised other documents in this case is even greater.  Within this context, I bear in mind in particular the importance that is ascribed to the confidentiality attaching to personal medical matters.  Within this context, I am satisfied that the order should also extend to cover the report and Certificate of Capacity from NH&#8217;s treating psychiatrist filed by 4pm on 18 March 2016.</p>

Once again, that restriction is limited to a degree of control being exercised over <span style="font-style:italic">how</span> the mother gains access to this evidence (which mechanism is often relied on in other contexts, for example where a parent is of no fixed abode).

These documents are not yet available and will not be available for some time.  The circumstances that pertain at the time they are due to be filed and served may be different to the circumstances that pertain now.  In my judgment a proportionate approach requires that the question of whether the order regulating the manner in which the mother has access to the evidence in this case should extend to such documents be decided only once those documents have been produced so that the court may take its decision in light of the actual contents of the same when undertaking the requisite balancing exercise.  </p>

First, there are difficulties in a party to care proceedings being watched closely by an employee or solicitor of the local authority when viewing documents in circumstances where the authority is the &#8220;prosecuting&#8221; authority.  Conversely, unless there is <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> species of supervision then no one is going to know whether the mother has abided by the terms of the order.

I am invited to make a similar injunction against any lawyers who may be instructed by the mother in the future.   Having given further consideration to the matter it seems to me that there are inherent difficulties in making an injunctive order against lawyers who are not yet instructed and who, by definition, have had no notice of the application for such relief and I have, on further reflection, decided not to make such an order at this stage.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to my interim order of the 9 March 2016 I decline the mother&#8217;s application for permission to appeal.   The mother was represented at the hearing on 9 March 2016 by leading and junior counsel who made full submissions on her behalf opposing the order regulating the manner in which she gains access to the relevant documents.   The order made on 9 March 2016 covered only three sets of documents, namely the report compiled pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> in respect of NH, the psychological report in respect of NH from his treating psychiatrist and medical records pertaining to NH.  Provision was made for the mother to see and read these documents at the chambers of leading and junior counsel ahead of the commencement of the final hearing but the mother did not avail herself of this opportunity.  Finally, for the reasons set out in my judgment of 9 March 2016 the order was an interim order and one which I am satisfied struck the correct balance between the mother&#8217;s Art 6 rights and the Art 8 rights of NH.  In the circumstances, I adjudge that an appeal against my order of 9 March 2016 has no real prospect of success.</p>

I remain satisfied that the mother&#8217;s criticism of the bundle did not amount to a proper ground for adjourning the final hearing for the reasons set out in this judgment.  Save the documents which were the subject of my order of 9 March 2016, to the best of my knowledge the mother has had all of the documents filed and served in this case.  The mother had notice of the final hearing since 17 December 2015 and was in the jurisdiction at the time the same commenced.  Further, and in any event, it has become necessary to adjourn this hearing for the reasons I have likewise set out herein.  In the circumstances, an appeal again the order refusing an adjournment is otiose.  In the circumstances, I likewise adjudge the mother&#8217;s appeal in respect of my decision of 15 March 2016 to have no real prospect of success.</p>
