Karen told me a lot about you. She told me that you were a very talented linguist, and very bright. She said you were also good at sports. She told me a lot about the conversations you had with her, and she was impressed with how thoughtful you were. To speak three languages at the age of 12 is simply incredible!</span></p>

Your mum told me that she wanted to move to Northern Europe. She told me that life in London has become very difficult and expensive. She was worried that she does not have a lot of support in London and would have more support and be better able to look after you in Northern Europe. Your dad doesn&#8217;t agree; he thinks you should stay in London where you are settled, and you have friends. You told Karen that you&#8217;d like to stay in London, partly because you are settled, and partly because of your half-sister. Karen agreed with you and told me she thought this was best. </span></p>

Your dad was really sad about your mum&#8217;s wish to move to Northern Europe, and I think that this sadness has changed how he sees her and the situation. I was worried that this might affect you. I was also worried that being away from your mum &#8211; who is the only person who has ever looked after you all of the time &#8211; would be very bad for you. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties separated eight or nine years ago, although I understand they lived together for a short period post-separation to provide Amelia with a continuity of care.  In 2018, a child arrangements order was made governing the amount of time that Amelia spends with both her parents.  More recently, the mother says it has become difficult for her to continue to afford to live in London but has expressed a wish to move back to Northern Europe.  Throughout this time, however, and since the child arrangements order application, Amelia has spent time with her father and that time has become increasingly more flexible and free.  They are the essential background facts.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Amelia&#8217;s welfare is my paramount consideration.  Welfare is conceived of with reference to the welfare checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  An order is an intervention in the right of a private and family life of Amelia and her parents and therefore, the degree of intervention must be both necessary and proportionate as required by the European Convention on Human Rights.  If there is a conflict between Amelia&#8217;s rights and those of her parents, Amelia&#8217;s rights necessarily prevail.  As there is a child arrangements order, the application to relocate is made pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.13</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and not <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref>.  However, the principles remain the same.</p>

She said she could benefit from living in Northern Europe.  The route to this conclusion was the interview with Amelia and the impact of the change of the feeling that she is English, although she embraces her Central and Northern European heritage.  She also takes into account the fact she has a sister in London.  The Cafcass officer acknowledged that close relationships would be impacted nevertheless if she moved to Northern Europe.  Having read that report, in my view, the report could have made it clear that whichever way this goes, she will lose out.  If she is in Northern Europe, she will lose out on what she is used to with the whole of her life but if she is in London, she will lose out with a relationship with her mother.</p>

I accept that Eliza is very important to Amelia and, indeed, that she will pine for her father but the mother, in my judgment, represents the one thread of stability that Amelia has enjoyed in her short life.  They have never lived apart.  The mother has been a consistent figure through a life of change.  The breakdown of her parents&#8217; relationship and the adjustment that comes with that.  Although Amelia is able to give her wishes and feelings as she may perceive them, and accept that she said what she said, Amelia is, in my judgment, unable to reflect on a loss of such significant magnitude.</p>

She has failed to do this.  There is, in addition, a failure to note that the conduit/the glue between Amelia and Eliza is largely the mother.  Although Eliza spends time with her father and Amelia enjoys this, and no doubt would enjoy this if she lived there, I cannot escape the fact that the mother has an excellent relationship with Eliza&#8217;s own mother, and she frequently arranges for time to be spent with the girls away from the father.  I reject the suggestion that a move to Northern Europe will result in the cessation of that relationship.  Every thread of evidence from the past suggests that the mother takes the relationship between Amelia and Eliza seriously and will continue to promote this.</p>

The welfare officer seems to have looked to Amelia herself to provide an evidence base of what her life would be like rather than scrutinise the statements in this case where the options for Amelia are clearly set out.  The welfare officer said in her assessment:</p>

I did not get the sense from the mother, and this concords with the Cafcass analysis, that Amelia was anything other than resilient and able to combat change.

This includes the applicant mother taking Amelia to counselling, sexual health therapy, without, as far as the respondent is aware, discussing this first with Amelia to her father&#8217;s knowledge without a referral from her GP, which the respondent father worries has pressured Amelia.  The respondent father is concerned that the applicant mother is psychologically pressuring Amelia to instigate guilt about how Amelia responded to Cafcass and about moving to Northern Europe, including discussing the move to Northern Europe.&#8221;</p>

I have confidence that an accredited and regulated therapist would not allow themselves to be used in an orchestrated attempt to pressurise a child.  Second, the reason for the referral describes the work being there to assist Amelia coping with emotions.  This is credible against the Cafcass report being filed that plainly painted Amelia as split in her loyalties.  It is obvious that Amelia was undergoing a period of anguish.  Finally, Amelia&#8217;s worries about being abandoned chimed with the mother&#8217;s own life story and I have sympathy with the fact that mother, in all likelihood, would want to prevent Amelia from experiencing similar emotions of rejection and abandonment.</p>

Evidentially, of course, that does not matter for the Cafcass report.  As the welfare officer noted, this therapeutic involvement postdated her assessment and, therefore, did not impact the report.  I reject the argument as it seemed to be thought that this was a source of pressure in the preparation of that assessment.</p>

She explained that the welfare report had been left out on a coffee table in December 2023 shortly after it was received.  The mother told me that she had been unwell and the report was left out carelessly.  I do consider this to be very unfortunate and this has undoubtedly raised the temperature of the proceedings as Amelia was plainly nervous about going against the mother&#8217;s wishes.  Even though Amelia was bound to be curious about the proceedings and the plans for her future, it was, in my very clear view, not appropriate for her to have access to the documents within the proceedings.  To her credit, the mother accepts this.  I was concerned at conversations reported by the welfare officer that the mother and Amelia discussed Northern Europe.  Again, I accept that it is hard for the mother to delineate her own plans and experience from that of Amelia&#8217;s and that there is an inevitable degree of crossover.  However, it is also plain to me from those conversations and from the mother&#8217;s own evidence that Amelia, in my view, has been overexposed to the brunt of these proceedings.</p>

This simply would not have happened as Amelia has grown up with relatively infrequent contact without the support of the mother.  It is inherently unlikely, in my judgment, that the mother has been anything other than highly supportive of the relationship between Amelia and her father.  Amelia adores her father.  She speaks very highly of him.  She aligns herself to his humour and his personality.  It is simply not true to suggest that there is any track record of alienation in this case or isolation.  Amelia knows her father and is in regular touch with him through a number of media.  I see no reason why this will not continue.  I reject the suggestion as made in evidence that the father&#8217;s relationship will be fractured.  I am of the view that this may be more infrequent but of no less quality.

In my view, this has clouded his objectivity and he was unable to realise the advantages of Northern Europe or, indeed, recognise any of them.  He thought the only advantage was about a relationship with mother.  He then said he wanted to provide a balanced view before speaking negatively and bringing it back to him but he has, in my view, allowed his own negative view of the mother to cloud a proper assessment of the advantages of moving to Northern Europe.

As young children become older, the relationships they have with their friends and peers become more important than they do in primary school.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I have to consider, however, whether these are authentic and informed wishes.  I am not satisfied, for the reason I have already expressed, that Amelia can or has properly engaged with the magnitude of the question she was being asked, i.e. separation from the only primary carer she has in living memory.  I respect her desire for the status quo and I understand this completely but I am simply not persuaded that Amelia has articulated or been challenged on what, in my view, would be a potentially catastrophic loss of her only living memory carer from her everyday life.  Wishes and feelings are not determinative anyway but, for that reason, I am cautious when I rely on what Amelia tells the Cafcass officer.</p>

He can meet Amelia&#8217;s emotional needs in the short-term and their interactions and bond are of good quality but I have no base of evidence to draw upon when assessing the father&#8217;s ability to recognise and support Amelia&#8217;s emotional needs on a day-to-day basis.  Indeed, and very concerningly, when I asked the father to consider the question of abandonment and how Amelia might experience that, I do not consider the father was able to engage in that at all.</p>

The mother&#8217;s parents are an hour or so away from the mother&#8217;s home city in Northern Europe which would be accessible easily.  They are in their 80s.  Amelia loves them dearly.  The father&#8217;s parents are in Central Europe.  The father loves them dearly and so does Amelia.  She loves visiting them.  Grandparents play a huge part in a child&#8217;s emotional and social development.  The father&#8217;s parents are always, however, and would remain, a flight away.  It seems to me that there is an advantage to have at least one set of grandparents within a short distance. </p>

As I have explained, that her bond with her father is so strong is that testament to the mother&#8217;s ability to support this relationship.  On the contrary, however, I consider that the mother&#8217;s relationship with Amelia would be harmed by her staying with the father.  I do not consider at present that the father has shown an ability to extract his own ill-feeling from his evidence and, in all likelihood, therefore his parenting.  I consider that there is a very real risk that the father may allow this ill-feeling to permeate his interactions with Amelia. </p>

Amelia will either move to Northern Europe and have her ties to education and family strained or broken, or she will move in with her father and have her most significant relationship strained.

How will she settle into an environment that is not her own?  However, likewise, the father&#8217;s care is, to some extent, untested.  How will she settle into his full-time care?  How will she cope with the loss of a day-to-day figure in her life?  Can the father be trusted to support that therapeutically and appropriately?  How will she adjust to a new partner?  Will she see Eliza less given that the mother, and not the father, is, in my view, the real conduit, with the father&#8217;s time with Eliza limited practically and by his poor relationship with her own mother?  Her housing will change.  She will have to adjust to new accommodation.  I do not consider that either of the options are unsuitable.  Her schooling will change.  The quality of schooling is equivalent but, of course, she will lose her friends if she moves to Northern Europe or certainly those friendships will become harder to maintain.  However, I note both parents&#8217; description of Amelia as adaptable and resilient.  She can and will, in my view, absorb change.  She can socialise with ease and make friends.  Her capacity to do that is well-established as she has just moved schools.</p>

In fact, there is certainty from the mother&#8217;s plan as to living, schooling, and wraparound care.  The mother has proposed, in my view, a realistic and well thought through plan in terms of Amelia&#8217;s existence.  Likewise, Amelia&#8217;s schooling and living arrangements in London are a certain but there is a lack of wraparound care which places an extra burden on the father and his partner and a limited support network of other adults who have other children and busy lives.  There will, in my view, be a very positive effect on the mother&#8217;s ability to provide Amelia with the enduring quality of care that she requires in Northern Europe.  I cannot say the same about the father in the UK.  This is not to say that I do not think the father would manage but, likewise, the mother&#8217;s proposal is by far the most attractive option.</p>

This can be done in a way that is culturally sensitive, including by conversing in the father and Amelia&#8217;s shared language.  As Amelia gets older and wants to spend more time with her friends and less with her family, this will also allow her to maintain vital ties with her father and enjoy a social life at the same time.</p>

This may affect the relationship between the mother and Amelia as Amelia gets older and her ability to provide care to Amelia at the moment and meet her needs, or even, frankly, engage in the relationship in the short-term.  There is a risk that all those things, in my view, could be compromised.  That would be completely antithetical to Amelia&#8217;s welfare.</p>

There will be more regular contact.  The father&#8217;s wider family are in Central Europe and not in the UK and therefore, as I have said, they remain they remain a flight away.  So, there will be little to no impact on Amelia&#8217;s ability to maintain relationships with her grandparents.  However, in Northern Europe, she will gain a maternal family just a short distance away.  She will benefit from regular and incidental contact with her treasured grandparents and her wider family.</p>

It is entrenched and I have every confidence it will endure if she moves to Northern Europe.  Amelia sees a lot of herself in the father.  She loves his company and enjoys his humour.  As I have said, they communicate through a variety of media and I have no reason to consider that this will not continue.  This has blossomed in spite of the fact that she has been living with her mother.  I am satisfied, for the reasons I have explained already, that this could not have happened without the support of the mother.  Cafcass says very clearly she loves both of her parents but if she were in Northern Europe and chatter about the father continued, this would grind her down.  However, I reject that.  There is absolutely no evidence of this happening in the past.  In fact, the relationship could not be better.</p>

I am concerned, as I have said, however, by the father&#8217;s attitude towards the mother and the likelihood, as I see it, that the father would allow this conflict to permeate into his parenting.  In my view, this may damage the mother and Amelia&#8217;s relationship.</p>

The mother has an excellent relationship with Eliza&#8217;s mother, and they arrange visits and incidental contact.  That is not in any way to diminish the father but his relationship with Eliza is constrained and controlled.  For the reasons I have expressed, I consider the mother is the conduit and therefore the glue and can perhaps improve over time.  I have no doubt that this will continue if Amelia moves to Northern Europe.</p>
