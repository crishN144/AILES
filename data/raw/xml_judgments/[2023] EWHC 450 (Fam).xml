He is 11 years old and presently lives with his mother in this jurisdiction. He is the only child of the Applicant (&#8220;the father&#8221;) and the Respondent (&#8220;the mother&#8221;). G is represented in these proceedings by his children&#8217;s guardian. Both G and his parents are nationals of country X where the father continues to live. G has not seen or spoken to his father or paternal family since October 2020.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November and December 2022, I conducted a fact-finding hearing to investigate the nature of the mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s relationship and the circumstances in which G both travelled to this jurisdiction with his mother in October 2020 and came to remain here. On the father&#8217;s case, this was a pre-planned and clandestine abduction by the mother in an attempt to excise him from G&#8217;s life. On the mother&#8217;s case, this was a flight from life-threatening persecution and/or discrimination by elements of the authorities in country X. Additionally, she alleged serious physical and sexual abuse of G by his father and paternal uncle as well as serious domestic abuse. I handed down a judgment on 21 December 2022 and it is that judgment which lies at the heart of the application before the court today. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To set the context, it is important to note that, although this court is entitled to make an order for G&#8217;s summary return to country X, it is not permitted to implement such an order as, in March 2022, both the mother and G were granted asylum in this jurisdiction. However, the prohibition on implementation in these circumstances neither prevents the court from making a return order nor prohibits the court from investigating matters which are germane to the mother&#8217;s asylum claim. I observe that, although concerned with an application pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention, neither the Supreme Court in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">G v G (Secretary of State for the Home Department and Others intervening)</span> [2021] UKSC 9 at [164] nor the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R (Asylum and 1980 Hague Convention Application)</span> [2022] EWCA Civ 188 at [97]-[99] criticised a party to proceedings who, on the basis of a reasoned judgment in the family court, sought to obtain reconsideration by the Secretary of State for the Home Department of a grant of asylum. By analogy, that course is also available to a parent in proceedings for the return of a child pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I conducted a directions hearing on 10 January 2023 when it became clear that an issue had arisen as to whether my fact-finding judgment should be disclosed to the Secretary of State for the Home Department (&#8220;the SSHD&#8221;). There were matters in that judgment which, in my view, might have a bearing on the asylum status of G and his mother. I invited the SSHD to intervene in the proceedings for the purpose of deciding whether or not I should order disclosure of my judgment. All the parties filed helpful skeleton arguments addressing this issue. Alongside those directions, the children&#8217;s guardian was directed to prepare an analysis addressing (a) interim contact between G and his father; (b) G&#8217;s knowledge of the proceedings; (c) how my findings should be communicated to him; and (d) disclosure of my judgment to the SSHD. The children&#8217;s guardian produced a most helpful and insightful analysis which has played a significant role in my thinking about this very difficult case.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During my fact finding enquiry, I heard oral evidence from the father, the mother, the paternal uncle, the paternal grandmother, and the jointly instructed expert, Mr Spencer. In a lengthy judgment, I rejected the mother&#8217;s case that she was a victim of domestic abuse by the father and that G was a victim of serious physical and sexual abuse by the father and/or the paternal uncle. I found that the mother and G left country X on 9 October 2020 by aeroplane, travelling on passports which did not belong to them, and arrived in this jurisdiction on or about 10 October 2020. It thus follows that I rejected, as constituting a fabrication, the mother&#8217;s account about how she travelled to this jurisdiction which was given to the SSHD in November 2020 and maintained by her to date. I also found facts which were incompatible with the mother&#8217;s account of summary arrest and detention in country X by state agents in September 2020. That account was an integral part of her asylum claim.</p>

I set out a summary of that material later in this judgment. Mr Jones submitted that, if there was material in my fact-finding judgment to suggest that there had been a misrepresentation or omission of facts relied upon as part of the mother&#8217;s and G&#8217;s asylum applications, this would be relevant to the exercise of the SSHD&#8217;s functions. The Immigration Rules obliged the SSHD to revoke a grant of asylum where she was satisfied that it had been obtained by misrepresentation or omission of facts. By virtue of the Revocation Guidance, the SSHD had to give careful consideration to revoking refugee status where evidence had emerged that this status had been obtained by misrepresentation or omission of facts. </p>

There was a compelling public interest in the SSHD making asylum decisions on the basis of full and correct facts, and barriers should not be erected between the family court and the SSHD, especially in circumstances where there had already been disclosure of documents from the asylum file into the family proceedings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Though the SSHD noted the analysis of the children&#8217;s guardian that disclosure would have both positive and negative welfare considerations, Mr Jones submitted that the compelling public interest in disclosure outweighed any negative welfare considerations in circumstances where (a) those considerations were said to be finely balanced; (b) where welfare considerations could be mitigated, for example, by parental reassurance; and (c) where there were statutory safeguards in place to protect G&#8217;s welfare following disclosure of any judgment to the SSHD. He pointed to the safeguards available to G and his mother if their status was under review and emphasised that any reconsideration by the SSHD would not simply be a matter of establishing whether deception was proven but would also require the SSHD to consider whether G and his mother would still qualify for protection status for any other protection-based reasons. At the moment, Mr Jones could not give the court a firm timeframe for the reconsideration of G and his mother&#8217;s asylum status but noted the SSHD&#8217;s duty to carry out her functions in a way that takes account of the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the United Kingdom, by virtue of section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, which includes the need to demonstrate that asylum applications were dealt with in a timely fashion.</p>

He confirmed that, pending a reconsideration decision by the SSHD, the mother was able to work. However, were her status revoked, and leave to remain cancelled, the mother would ordinarily not be able to do so even though it was understood she may wish to challenge that decision. Additionally, in those circumstances, neither she nor G would ordinarily have access to benefits. He confirmed that G&#8217;s status would be considered separately to that of his mother.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the father, Mr Harrison KC submitted that the fact-finding judgment should be disclosed to the SSHD, especially in circumstances where there had already been substantial disclosure and liaison between the court and the SSHD. Applying the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C</span> factors, the balance fell squarely in favour of disclosure in circumstances where it would be undesirable for the court and the SSHD to come to conclusions about a child which were diametrically opposed. He also relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">G v G</span> which anticipated transparency insofar as disclosure from the family court to the SSHD was concerned. Withholding disclosure would have serious implications for the Article 6 rights of left behind parents who would be effectively denied a remedy to challenge a status conferred on their child which interfered to a substantial degree with both their Article 8 rights and the Article 8 rights of the child. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to G&#8217;s welfare, it was difficult to conceive that it would be in his best interests to hold refugee status on a false basis. G would not only be unable to live with his father in country X but could not even visit that country. His relationship with his father would be extremely circumscribed and he would also be unable to see members of his paternal family such as his elderly grandmother. The psychological burden on G of being required to collude in his mother&#8217;s narrative and keep her secrets would likely have an adverse impact on him. It would be very difficult to rationalise the life story work recommended by the children&#8217;s guardian if at the same time the court continued to impose a cloak of secrecy as far as the SSHD was concerned. Any suggestion that disclosure should await the court&#8217;s welfare determination was misconceived since the main welfare detriment was uncertainty and insecurity for G which any reconsideration would create whether now or at some future date. There was a strong argument for initiating that process now before G&#8217;s roots in this jurisdiction became even more firmly established than they already were. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the mother, Mr Gupta KC was neutral on the application but submitted that, if I were to order disclosure, the SSHD should have the mother&#8217;s most recent statement filed in response to the fact finding judgment as well as my welfare judgment when that became available in late July 2023. On balance, he submitted that, should I order disclosure, I should not allow my judgment to be made available to the SSHD until after I had made the welfare decision. Disclosure now ran the risk of unsettling G and might interfere with the reintroduction of contact to the father. In any event, reconsideration by the SSHD would potentially lead to the revocation of status and with it the mother&#8217;s ability to work or claim benefits. That would be destabilising for G. Were the SSHD to revoke the mother and G&#8217;s status, the mother would seek to appeal that decision which would inevitably delay the implementation of any welfare decision this court might make. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children&#8217;s guardian was neutral on the disclosure issue. She recognised that disclosure of the fact-finding judgment was inevitable and that this may cause instability for G. Factors in favour of disclosure included clarity about whether G&#8217;s residence in this jurisdiction was secure and the need to provide G with a truthful narrative about what had happened to him. She recognised that G was clear he wished to remain in the UK but accepted that those wishes were not informed by a full appreciation of either the facts found in the judgment or the implications for him of a status founded on misrepresentations and lies. The Guardian recognised (a) that there had already been substantial disclosure between the SSHD and the family court; (b) that G&#8217;s welfare was not the court&#8217;s paramount consideration; and (c) that there was a strong public interest in the administration of justice such that the family court could not condone deceit before it being kept from the SSHD when this might be relevant to the exercise of her functions.</p>

Hayden J held that the grant of refugee status to a child by the SSHD was an absolute bar to any order in family proceedings seeking to effect the return of the child to an alternative jurisdiction. Further, he held that the SSHD was actively obliged, in accordance with the relevant immigration rules and guidance, to revoke a grant of asylum where she was satisfied that the evidence established that the person&#8217;s misrepresentation or omission of facts, including the use of false documents, had been decisive for the grant of refugee status. Were the court in the family proceedings to make findings of fact which undermined the allegations made by the mother against the father in her asylum claim, the SSHD would be required to reconsider her decision with such findings included within the scope of her consideration.

Though that case was decided in the context of the 1980 Hague Convention, the guidance suggested by the Supreme Court is informative in this present context. So far as disclosure from the family courts to the SSHD is concerned, it is clear that transparency is expected as set out in paragraph 64<span style="font-style:italic">: &#8220;information in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings and the court&#8217;s decision may inform the determination by the Secretary of State of a person&#8217;s asylum claim or as to whether the Secretary of State revokes refugee status&#8221;</span>. The Supreme Court was concerned to smooth the interplay between the family court and the SSHD, for example, by suggesting that the SSHD should ordinarily be invited to intervene in the family proceedings and that there should be prompt liaison between the family court and the SSHD (paragraphs 166-169). In paragraph 169, the Supreme Court said that the documents in the 1980 Hague Convention proceedings should ordinarily be made available to the Secretary of State.

The court must also have regard to the welfare of the children concerned. Indeed, I recognise that in fact every issue set out in Re C (above) may well be relevant. However, it would be my view given both the need for parental honesty and the absence of s 98(2) protection, that the need for encouraging frankness might well be accorded greater weight in private law proceedings and that accordingly the court might be more disinclined to order disclosure.&#8221;</span></p>

Throughout the lengthy fact-finding hearing, his perspective and experiences were at the forefront of my mind and informed the questions I posed to both the witnesses and to the advocates. I concluded that, arising from the behaviour of his mother, G had experienced serious harm by being abruptly taken from his country of origin and birth without a chance to say his farewells to those he loved and was friendly with. His relationship with his father had been severed and I thought it more likely than not that G had been involved in the mother&#8217;s enterprise by having to keep secrets about how they had travelled to this jurisdiction. These matters make the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C </span>welfare considerations engaged in the balancing exercise unusually complex.</p>

In both those respects I have been hugely assisted by the perceptive and sensitive analysis of the children&#8217;s guardian. She considers that there is a role for the Cafcass commissioned Improving Child and Family Arrangements (&#8220;ICFA&#8221;) service to work on reintroducing contact between G and his father as G seems emotionally able to contemplate resuming a relationship with his father. This will require patience and restraint by the father as well as reassurance from the mother who has said she supports direct contact resuming. </p>

It was very plain from her analysis that G was uncomfortable and evasive when asked by the children&#8217;s guardian about his journey to England and did not volunteer any information about this, claiming that he could not remember. I accept the children&#8217;s guardian&#8217;s recommendation that G is provided with only the most important and understandable information about my findings since the priority must be to rebuild his relationship with the father in a sensitive and emotionally attuned way. Nevertheless, G needs to know that he is not responsible for any of the events that have unfolded around him and that his father loves him and does not pose a risk to his safety. I also accept the view of the children&#8217;s guardian that G needs to be told that his mother has been untruthful about the way she and G travelled to the UK and about not having siblings who live here. G has no knowledge of his mother&#8217;s account of detention and arrest in country X, or of her allegations of sexual abuse and radical extremism. </p>

Much of the above may be difficult for him but, in the view of the children&#8217;s guardian, G is settled in his school and home life and does not present with any obvious emotional and behavioural difficulties. He has shown significant resilience in coping with (a) living in temporary accommodation, (b) learning a new language and (c) settling into a new way of life in the UK. </p>

It is of key importance that he re-establishes a positive and loving relationship with his father at his own pace and in his own time. Likewise, G needs to be informed of some of my findings to build a foundation for successful contact as well as possibly releasing him from the burden of secrecy placed on him by the mother. I recognise that both these features have the potential to create uncertainty for G and that disclosure of my fact-finding judgment may cause G further anxiety about what might happen to his status in this jurisdiction and this may potentially interfere with the resumption of contact. </p>

Certainty about his status &#8211; whatever that is - will support G&#8217;s stability and I am clear that his identity needs to be constructed on a truthful narrative rather than one distorted by lies. It is also much to G&#8217;s benefit for the court to know about the realistic options for him if his ability to remain in the UK is compromised. Disclosure of the judgment does not itself mean that G will be returned to country X or that any such step is imminent. Even if the SSHD chose to revoke G&#8217;s asylum status, there remain significant legal hurdles which would stand in the way of his immediate removal from the UK. Further, there is no clear advantage in postponing disclosure until after my welfare determination &#8211; this prolongs uncertainty for G and may be even more damaging for him as his roots in this jurisdiction inevitably deepen and extend. </p>

G can be helped by patience on the father&#8217;s part and the skilled intervention of the children&#8217;s guardian and the ICFA service. G&#8217;s mother also has a role to play in reassuring him and this court will keep under active review her commitment to do so.  Thus, taking all these welfare considerations into account, I am of the view that the overall impact on G of disclosure is not so serious as to be determinative in the balancing exercise.</p>

This was not a mother who made admissions against her own interests or who gave a frank and honest account of her circumstances. On the contrary, the mother lied to the family court about almost every issue in dispute and, I note, she continues in her most recent statement to maintain her version of events notwithstanding my findings of significant dishonesty. Frankness in the context of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C</span> exercise does not provide protection to a parent who has lied and intends to lie in future about matters germane to the exercise of either this court&#8217;s functions or the functions of another administrative or judicial body. </p>

I agree with the analysis of Mr David Rees KC in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v D and H</span> that the family court should be wary of permitting the confidentiality which attaches to family proceedings to be used to conceal material and adverse findings about a party or their evidence from another public body such as the SSHD who has a direct, legitimate and undisputed interest in that material. Further, the decision-making processes of the SSHD with respect to the revocation of asylum status are clear and transparent with mechanisms for making representations and challenging her eventual decision. In my view, these processes serve to enhance the public interest in disclosure. Thus, in the particular circumstances of this case, other factors such as G&#8217;s welfare are insufficiently decisive so as to prevent disclosure to the SSHD. </p>

Indeed, my order dated 21 February 2022 stated that the SSHD was to be provided with all documents and orders filed within the family proceedings. Accordingly, the solicitors for the father sent the bundle available in February 2022 to the SSHD and she also received a copy of my August 2022 judgment concerning disclosure of the mother&#8217;s asylum file into the family proceedings. Mr Harrison KC told me that the SSHD had not received any of the other material filed in these proceedings. I note that the ambit of the February 2022 order was deliberately unconstrained and would, in my view, encompass providing a copy of my fact-finding judgment to the SSHD.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Accordingly, I direct that the father&#8217;s solicitors provide a copy of the full, updated bundle to the SSHD alongside a copy of my fact-finding judgment. As envisaged in my February 2022 order, there will be ongoing disclosure by the father&#8217;s legal representatives to the SSHD of all future orders and evidence filed in the family proceedings. It also seems to me to be prudent that I give permission to the mother and to G to disclose my judgment for the purpose of obtaining advice and assistance with respect to any reconsideration by the SSHD. </p>
