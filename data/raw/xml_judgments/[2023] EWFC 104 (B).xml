For reasons which I will endeavour to explain the hearing has been used to determine the contested threshold and to make findings of fact which are relevant to the future welfare decisions which will fall to be made in respect of T and Z and further case management to provide for further necessary evidence. The urgent welfare decisions for the girls will be made at an adjourned three day final hearing before me on 7 November 2023.</span></p>

She has three children, two of which are subject to these proceedings, plus an older child with a previous partner. Her eldest child was subject to care proceedings in 2018, which concluded with a special guardianship order to a paternal relative. The parents&#8217; relationship commenced at some point in mid-2018 and ended in or around December 2021/January 2022. The family came to the attention of the local authority in October 2018 when a referral was received from a midwife at [redacted] Hospital advising that the mother was pregnant. Unborn T was made subject to a child protection plan given the concerns in the previous proceedings.  T was born in May 2019. Some months later, the family began to come to the attention of professionals worried about a number of police callouts to the property. None of these, however, resulted in any further action. Moving forward, it appeared that the Child Protection Planning was having the desired effect, and on 17 February 2020, T was stepped down to a Child In Need plan.</span></p>

The family was put back on a Child Protection Plan on 21 September 2021. The family did not engage with the Local Authority and in October 2021, the Local Authority progressed the matter to the Public Law Outline pre-proceedings. Again, the family did not engage. Matters came to a head in December 2021 when the mother left the family home on Christmas Eve, and the Father placed T in the care of his sister. The mother returned to the home on/around 27 December and, believing T to have been kept from her care without her consent, called the police. In the course of her conversations with the police about this incident, she made allegations of domestic abuse against the father. The father was arrested, but no charges were brought, save that he was subsequently charged and convicted of assaulting an emergency worker in his attempts to resist arrest. It is around this date that the relationship between the mother and father ended. </span></p>

T was born in May 2019 so she was at this stage around 2 &#189; years old. The applicant noted the mother was 24 years old (she was born in December 1997) and was diagnosed with learning difficulties and likely Attention Deficit Disorder. Litigation capacity issues were raised.  The father was then 37 years old (born in September 1984). </span></p>

The mother&#8217;s solicitor made an application for an assessment for an intermediary. These applications were determined before HHJ Karp at a case management hearing on 14 February 2022. The father was legally represented at this stage. On his behalf his counsel confirmed that he consented to a parenting assessment but refused to consent to a psychological assessment. It was also said on his behalf that as a Rastafarian he could not provide a hair strand test but was willing to provide a nail and blood sample for drug and alcohol testing. HHJ Karp ordered various drug and alcohol tests of the mother and father and approved the instruction of an independent social worker, Mr Eric Dooley. Cognitive and psychological expert evidence was directed in respect of the mother and a psychological assessment directed in respect of the father. Further directions were made to Communicourt in respect of an intermediary for the mother. The court noted she was vulnerable. A variety of other case management directions were made through to Issue Resolution Hearing. </span></p>

There is a gap in the evidence, in that the paternal grandmother and paternal aunt are said to wish to put themselves forward but no viability assessments are available. The local authority has been asked to produce these. In addition, the local authority will need to urgently liaise with the social workers at LB XY who are dealing with [F&#8217;s] older children. This is because F  says that LB XY have asked him to care for his four older children because of concerns about their mother, and he is doing so. It is not clear how or why the two local authorities have taken such differing approaches to [F] as a potential carer and information is needed urgently as to the position of LB XY and how they have reached this conclusion. If any written assessments, case notes, or child protection or child in need meeting minutes and reports are available, those would be helpful, but at the least the social worker will need to liaise with the LB XY social worker and produce a case note or updating statement to assist the court.</span></p>

The schedule of findings in the present case contains, as we shall see, allegations in relation to the father that "he appears to have" lied or colluded, that various people have "stated" or "reported" things, and that "there is an allegation". With all respect to counsel, this form of allegation, which one sees far too often in such documents, is wrong and should never be used. It confuses the crucial distinction, once upon a time, though no longer, spelt out in the rules of pleading and well understood, between an assertion of fact and the evidence needed to prove the assertion. What do the words "he appears to have lied" or "X reports that he did Y" mean? More important, where does it take one? The relevant allegation is not that "he appears to have lied" or "X reports"; the relevant allegation, if there is evidence to support it, is surely that "he lied" or "he did Y".</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221;</span></p>

It is understandable that because of the father&#8217;s lack of engagement the threshold may have been drafted in this way. When I checked Ms Prolingheuer&#8217;s understanding of the applicant&#8217;s case she also agreed that the threshold was mainly focused on report or allegations. On that basis much of the threshold would not be contested by the father as he did not dispute the mother, and some members of her family, had alleged or reported domestic abuse. Whether it did take place or not is, in my judgement, an important issue to resolve to permit the court to properly consider what welfare orders that should be made, should the threshold be crossed. </span></p>

The incident precipitating services involvement was a serious burn suffered by E in 2017. There were concerns about the explanation M gave for the burn and the fact that there was a delay in her seeking medical attention. At this time M was in a domestically abusive relationship and was reported to be smoking cannabis excessively. Professionals also had concerns due to M having learning disabilities and was vulnerable as a result. Ms M had her child placed with a paternal aunt in [ ]. Subsequently [ ] initiated care proceedings, which ended with a special guardianship order being made to the paternal aunt. A Psychological Assessment was completed during the care proceedings by Dr Julia Heller on 28/08/17 which advised that M has mild learning disabilities and likely Attention Deficit Disorder. The assessment concluded that M would require extensive ongoing support and supervision in order to parent adequately.

M also disclosed that this was not the first incident as when she commenced her relationship with F, he punched her in the face which resulted in an injury and bleeding. This incident was reported to the police however it did not progress due to the nature of the injuries to M not being consistent with her allegations. There was a further police report on 28/04/2019 where police attended M&#8217;S home to the sounds of a woman &#8216;screaming&#8217;. On engaging police, M &#8230; did not account for her extreme reaction, and the police left the scene with no further action. This report of domestic violence 17/04/2019 appears to be the second report of DV made by M in her relationship with F . After T&#8217;s birth professionals were concerned that M had the responsibility of caring for F's four children from a previous relationship, in addition to T. These 4 children were all under the age of ten-years-old, and professionals were concerned about M&#8217;s ability to cope with parenting so many young children. In order to address this issue a family group conference (FGC) was arranged. The agreed plan from the FGC of the 24th June 2019 not to leave M with T without support in place.</span></p>

Police attended the incident with the London Ambulance Service (LAS). F later explained that there was not an assault on M and her calling LAS was due to her tending to get anxious and call emergency services. She did not expect the police to come out on this occasion. When a social worker queried this incident with M was inconsistent with what happened and seemed scared and nervous about discussing the issue. These 3 significant incidents involving police, suggest that following T&#8217;s birth there was some disharmony in the couple&#8217;s relationship, and further that F appears to be controlling the explanation of the incidents.</span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">On 13/06/2021, Police officers attended MGM&#8217;s (T&#8217;s adoptive maternal grandmother) home in response to an allegation of domestic abuse (coercion and control) perpetrated by F. The police report was made by T&#8217;s auntie, [ ] on behalf of M. The allegations made to the police were as follows: (1) [ ] alleged her sister is undergoing domestic abuse by being controlled to keep her children by staying with the father (M&#8217;s self-appointed carer) as she suffers with learning disabilities. [ ] explained that that she and (MGM), had been concerned that the F has been controlling M for a number of years, excluding her at times from family events and controlling her money. [ ] disclosed texts from F to M of a hurtful nature for example, "YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME THE WAY YOU BEHAVE AND SLEEP WITH MEN, PEOPLE SEE ME ON THE STREET AND LOOK AT ME AS IF I AM LESSER THAN THEM BECAUSE I AM WITH YOU!" [ ]  added that M had had her hair shaved by F, in a manipulative manner which I interpret as F subjugating M&#8217;s wishes. [ ] told me that the hair was shaved so that M does not look attractive to other men. As a final part of the initial referral to social care [ ] reported being sent a video where M was carrying holding T and was visibly upset [reason unknown], and F was smiling and videoing her. I view this as a form of harassment, and an attempt by F to humiliate her, at a point of emotional vulnerability. When the Police spoke directly with M at the time of this referral, she denied the allegations to police and said it was a disagreement between her and F It is worrying that M failed to recognise F&#8217;s behaviour towards her which is extremely controlling as abuse.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic">M will usually be quiet when F is speaking, and my concern is that she is not being heard over F who is very vocal. In my view this could be a tactic to keep her quiet and also imply that she does not have the intellect to speak or make sense due to her learning disabilities. It appears that F has made M believe that she cannot look after T without him and therefore she believes she must maintain her relationship with him in order to be able to continue to care for T. It is difficult for M to express her views about what may go on in her relationship with F due to fear that she might lose T as she previously lost her first child, E. This is a complex case as in my view M often does not disclose to the domestic abuse to professionals she suffers, or withdraws complaints, or F creates an alternative explanation to mask abuse as noted in paragraph 5.</span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">The local authority has become increasingly concerned about the safety of T because the last time social workers were able to visit and see her was 18/06/2021, (until very recently I visited T 05/01/2022 at her paternal aunt&#8217;s home) as F was preventing social workers access to the family home. In addition, T was withdrawn from nursery 20/09/2021. It should be balanced against this that a police welfare visit took place on 16/10/2021 and M brought T to see the health visitor in clinic on the 28/10/21, and no immediate safeguarding concerns were noted. Notwithstanding this, the local authority is unable to assess T&#8217;s situation satisfactorily or protect her with such scant professional contact. To compound this lack of contact with T I worry that M, due to her vulnerability might not be able to protect herself from domestic abuse, therefore she will not be able to protect her daughter. And worryingly the parents have not engaged in the child protection process. As evidence of the parent&#8217;s lack engagement they avoided attending an Initial Child Protection Case Conference on 21/09/2021, and core group meetings on 21/10/21, and 18/11/21.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic">The local authority&#8217;s records reveal that F has a history of perpetrating domestic abuse to women in his life. F is known by LB XY in relation to repeated episodes of domestic violence, including controlling behaviour.

In a core assessment of F&#8217;s oldest child &#8216;X&#8217; dated 06/09/2011 it is noted there are allegations about domestic violence made by &#8216;X&#8217; s mother against F. These allegations dated back 2010. F denied any form of domestic violence or abuse and made counter allegation that his former partner was smoking cannabis, neglecting her children, and was making up the allegations so she could obtain her own accommodation.&#8221;</span></p>

When questioned by me directly on that, he refused to provide his address telling me he could not trust social services and was afraid of them. However, it is important to note when asked to re-focus and to answer questions directly he did try and apologised for his rambling accounts. He appeared under pressure, drinking a lot of water. He cared about what he was saying and whilst much of his evidence was not relevant, he wanted to be heard and he wanted me to listen to his evidence.

His refusal to provide his address evidences this. I also considered his evidence was often not credible. When I pointed out to him there had been, on any evidential basis (including his own), multiple engagements between the police, him and his former partners, he refused to accept any responsibility for this. This is not credible. It was also pointed out to him by Mr Bunce that paragraph 10 of his witness statement was incorrect but he refused to accept he had given untruthful evidence. He obfuscated. His poisoned attitude led him, in my judgement, to provide self-serving evidence that defended himself rather than truthfully and accurately engage with the allegations made.   </span></p>

But this does not affect the legal standard of proof, as Lord Hoffmann emphasised in the same case (para 15): &#8220;There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</span></p>

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities. However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence. Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable. </span></p>

The mother&#8217;s learning difficulties and her non-engagement in essential safeguarding meetings (whether her fault or not) mean that T and Z are at risk of significant harm by being neglected. T appears to have additional needs. She needs able and engaged parents or parents who can work with and engage professionals to meet the full range of her needs. Z&#8217;s age makes her vulnerable and her relationship with T, who I am told is already creating sibling relationship challenges, add to her vulnerabilities. Therefore she needs protection. Whilst the mother, rightly, does not contest threshold, it is no answer to state that after her separation from the father she was engaged with social services. The risk of harm arises out of her vulnerabilities caused by her additional needs and her susceptibility to permitting a partner to dominate her and occlude her engagement with professionals, which is necessary to protect her children.</span></p>

As a result she is at risk of significant harm because she is denied paternal involvement in her life and consequent emotional harm by being denied that involvement. The father and T lived together until early 2022. She has not had contact with her father since. He said he would have contact with her, but only on his terms with her older half-siblings. He has failed to focus on her needs and prioritise her needs to emotional attachment and stimulation. That arises because of his rigid thinking and his own conflict with the applicant&#8217;s social services team. T deserves more and has been denied her family love and support. At the relevant dates T was at a risk of suffering significant harm, mainly emotional harm as a result.</span></p>

I understood that all parties accepted this through their advocates at the hearing. The written and oral evidence makes clear there has been repeated involvement of the police in the life of this family. The mother&#8217;s evidence was that whilst the relationship was at times loving, she did at time &#8220;throw the first punch&#8221;. She also gave evidence that she involved the police in inappropriate situations such as seeking better housing or because the father cut his finger, was bleeding and she panicked. These are not  neutral acts, particularly when T was present. The involvement of uniformed police may well be bewildering or frightening. Such situations are mostly unplanned. They give rise to a risk of emotional harm. Furthermore, I am satisfied on all the evidence, particularly the evidence of the social worker, that their involvement was because of conflict between the parents. I pay particular regard to the example of the text message provided in the social worker&#8217;s statement, set out above. Such communication is bound to be conflictive, upsetting and disharmonious. It places obvious risks of significant emotional  harm to T and Z when in the presence of such conflictive parents or directly witnessing the fallout of this volatility. I also survey the wider canvass of the social worker&#8217;s evidence set out in her first witness statement and quoted above. This was a family unit which existed in a state of some conflict and chaos, hence social services involvement. That background paints the wider canvass of the risks of significant emotional harm to T and Z at the relevant dates. </span></p>

Having heard both the mother and father&#8217;s oral account of the &#8216;saucepan lid&#8217; assault I accept the applicant has proven this is more likely than not to have taken place, even although there is no corroborating medical evidence. The mother was clear it happened, was questioned about it and gave evidence that as a result she had a bump on the back of her head and has a result, when in the safety of a hotel, she had difficulty sleeping. I do not discern any material discrepancy from reading the police disclosure. The absence of medical evidence does not detract from the cogency of the other evidence, to find the applicant has proved its case on the balance of probabilities. The father&#8217;s evidence that he is a strong man and as such it is inherently improbable he assaulted the mother with a saucepan lid because the injury would have been worse is not persuasive. I decline to find the lid was broken on impact with the mother&#8217;s head. It hit the back of her head and may or may not have broken when it impacted the floor. </span></p>

The text message set out in the social worker&#8217;s evidence and the mother&#8217;s oral evidence about sexual jealousies reinforces the evidence that tensions arose between this couple. The father&#8217;s blanket denial as seen against the totality of the written and oral evidence was not persuasive.

This presentation with T present was typical of the type of engagement the family had with professionals. It paints of a picture of some chaos. I consider it more likely than not the father was belittling the mother. He came close to doing so in the witness box when he spoke about her (e.g. &#8220;the state&#8221; she was in after Christmas 2021 and at times by the deployment of the term &#8216;learning disability&#8217;) and he also has done so before, as is evident from the written evidence of the social worker (see the text message) and the reference to shaving her hair (albeit I note this was not canvassed in oral evidence).</span></p>

There is a lack of clarity in the evidence, on balance I find the mother left the family home, leaving T with her father to spend Christmas with her family. She did not return until around 27 December 2021. The father sent T to  his sister and she remained in the care of his sister for some days. The father could and should have assisted the mother and T to be reunited much sooner than in fact took place. This was obviously harmful for a small child, no doubt like all children looking forward to Christmas and family time. I acknowledge the father&#8217;s sister was known to T, but the parents once again prioritised their own needs over T&#8217;s and she was not provided with the emotional reinforcement she would need and was deprived  of her mother, which on balance I find to have been significantly harmful. At the relevant date risks of this nature remained. </span></p>

The finding above is a particular example of this. He would not let the mother take T to her family over Christmas and then sent her to her aunt&#8217;s. It is also entirely clear that the mother could not engage with social services when in a relationship with him. She did not attend the meetings, but from January 2022, once the relationship had ended, was able to do so and has engaged since. It follows therefore that I make the finding that the mother did not engage with social services until after the relationship.  I find, surveying the written evidence and from the parents&#8217; oral evidence and the social worker&#8217;s informed professional view, this arose out of the father&#8217;s coercive and controlling behaviour . Observing both parents over the last few days and reflecting in particular on how they gave evidence it is clear a significant power imbalance exists between them and the father was dominant and has used his dominance. T&#8217;s needs were not prioritised and she was at risk of emotional and wider developmental harm due to her parent&#8217;s dysfunctional relationship. Those risks remained to her but also to Z at the relevant dates. </span></p>

This is not a particularised allegation but leaving that aside it is not borne out in the written and oral evidence. It was not the evidence of the social worker. It was in the mother&#8217;s written evidence for her injunction application, but I have already concluded she is not always credible or reliable. Overall, I am satisfied this was not a relationship characterised by the father being continually regularly violent to the mother. There have been, as I have found, occasional moments of violence, possibly occasioned by arguments over romantic or other jealousies, but there has not been constant or regular violence. For much of the relationship it was a loving one and I understood both parents to accept that in their oral evidence. I also accept father&#8217;s counsel&#8217;s submission that the contemporaneous records do not support such a finding and in particular this assessment of the family recorded in the social worker&#8217;s evidence:</span></p>

I accept the social worker&#8217;s written and oral evidence to find the first and prefer that over the father&#8217;s unreliable evidence. There can be no doubt whatsoever that the father has shown aggression to professionals. He cannot understand why when his relationship deteriorated, social service became involved in T&#8217;s life again, despite the optimistic assessment I have just set out above. That inability to understand has caused much of his aggression and I have firmly in mind the oral evidence of the social worker that she is frightened of the father. That unquestionably, at the relevant dates, gave rise to the risk of significant harm to T and Z in circumstances where they need protection and support, their mother is learning disabled and had been in a controlling relationship and the father has carried out acts of domestic violence. The inability of professionals to supervise and support because of the fear of father plainly gives rise to the risk of significant harm to these vulnerable girls, at the relevant dates. </span></p>
