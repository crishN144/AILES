In relation to A the parents accept that any contact is a matter for her.

There were still concerns as to whether B and C&#8217;s current foster carer was the right long-term option, even with further training for the carer in relation to the needs of Autistic children and these children in particular, but keeping the children with this carer was still an option given the reality that finding appropriate care placements for the children was very difficult.</span></p>

Their relationship can be nurtured via well supported and structured contact sessions where direct therapeutic work can be undertaken to encourage them to interact. It can also take place indirectly via life story work and virtual contact if appropriate.  </span></p>

	      <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.35in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Because each of the children have a high level of need for supervision, interaction, and engagement, and practical support I think that it is hard for any adult to manage caring for them together. I think that within any setting, other than a residential setting, the carers/parents will need some respite and support within the home. As discussed above I would be concerned if this support is required on a 24-hour basis because of the impact on family life and this could lead to problems with the consistency of carers used. I think that any carer/parent is going to need some respite support or help with the children at home, for example in the form of overnight respite, or at those times of the day when the children&#8217;s needs are greater such as bedtime or getting ready for school. It is possible that alternative practical support, for example to help the parents clean their home, would also be useful and reduce the demands on the parents/carers. The level of support may differ depending on the placement, for example the family may need less support if the children are separated, and each placed with two non-working carers than they might should they all return home to one parent.</span></p>

I anticipate that A would possibly like to live with D because they appear to share the closet bond and because D may have less need and be able to engage more with others meaning that A gains a sense of being worthwhile and loved when supporting and playing with D.</span></p>

On observing B, C, and D within contact and within B and C&#8217;s placement I noticed that none of the children interacted with the others. There were occasions when I saw that each child would seek distance from the others, and I did not get a sense that they show interest in the other children of share a close bond. All of the younger children have very high levels of need, and these needs are different and will require different support and strategies as outlined in my own and the occupational therapy reports. Their level of need means that they each require high levels of supervision, engagement, and management and I am worried about how any carer might offer each of the children this when needing to care for more than one child. B and C&#8217;s carer requires 24-hour support and in my experience, this impacts on children&#8217;s and the wider family&#8217;s relationships and enjoyment of time spent at home, and especially home environments which have not been designed around the need to give carers and families some separation. I think that each of the children may stand a better chance of receiving the support they need if separated.</span></p>

The children were distressed on separation from M.  B stopped eating and D would become very distressed and hit out at others.

This would have long-term consequences for their physical and emotional wellbeing.  I expressed the view that if M could not engage with the supports and services considered necessary and/or exposed the children to the risk of harm in the future, the Court may have no option but to sanction their removal from her care (appendix 1 to that report paragraph 6.e.ii.3).  </span></p>

There is evidence to indicate the children&#8217;s basic needs were neglected. A particular difficulty is that M cannot be relied upon to work openly and honestly with those professionals tasked with monitoring the children&#8217;s care.  I sadly do not consider that it would be safe to return any of the children to their mother until she has completed all of the necessary work in terms of longer-term abstinence, PTSD and EUPD.  If she does engage fully with those interventions, it will be necessary to re-assess her parenting capacity at that stage.</span></p>

This would enable M to focus on their separate and specific needs, and provide the children with opportunities to maintain and develop their bond with her.  Given the difficulty of knowing whether or not M might expose the children to contact with inappropriate adults, I would recommend contact remains supervised.  In B, C and D&#8217;s case this would need to be professional supervision.  I agree with Dr Maguire that the setting for contact would need to be an appropriate space, taking into account each child&#8217;s individual needs.  </span></p>

The boys are more likely to have conscious memories of their father, but these may not be positive ones.

So, just parallel, spending time with each other&#8217;. MP, the occupational therapist, informed the meeting how she saw that B and C &#8216;can make the other anxious and irritated. Obviously, they&#8217;ve got such significant needs that they&#8217;re being aware that each other are there might be comforting, but even within the contact session, there was no interaction.

C&#8217;s teacher said &#8216;school, it is very much his secure, safe place. He knows how the day works, how his routines work, and hearing how contact has gone, I don&#8217;t think it would be particularly effective for those sessions to happen at school. I think that would muddy the water for an already confused little boy with not a clear grasp on what&#8217;s happening and why&#8217;. B&#8217;s teacher echoed this stating &#8216;it would just muddy the waters. Then B may start to feel that this isn&#8217;t his safe place to actually be in, whereas he&#8217;s got a safe place here, and he feels secure here with us. He&#8217;s built positive relationships with us as well. So, I&#8217;d like that to carry on with B&#8217;.</span></p>

The advantages and disadvantages of making care orders with care plans placing the children in long term foster care have been explored during the hearing, for each of the children, as discussed above. Both M and F now accept that this in the children&#8217;s best interests, and it is an option strongly supported by the guardian.   The advantages of long term foster care are, first of all, that the children are in a home where their physical, educational, health and emotional needs should be met; they will be kept safe and protected from the risks posed by care provided by the parents. As highlighted above, there is a need for specialist training for foster carers, and the particular needs of the children mean that it would be extremely difficult for these to be met by the mother and/or if the children are kept together. A&#8217;s wishes to remain with her maternal aunt should be respected. All parties are content with the present placement for D and the local authority has undertaken to carry out parallel planning for C and B which will include considering whether the children are best kept together in a placement. </span></p>

As mentioned both the local authority and the guardian have reached a firm recommendation that the children&#8217;s welfare requires care orders to be granted with foster care as the only option as of today, and the parents have made the difficult decision to agree to this conclusion.</span></p>

In terms of the welfare checklist in s.1(3) CA 1989 and the factors set out above it is clear to me that the children&#8217;s needs, the difficulty in M meeting those needs, the history of the case and the risks to the children mean that it is in the best interests of the children to make such orders.  There is no other option that would meet the children&#8217;s needs and I consider that this outcome is a proportionate interference with theirs and the parents&#8217; Art.8 rights.  </span></p>

We do not believe that the legislation ever intended the jurisdiction of the judge under s 34 to be deployed so as to inhibit the local authority in the performance of its statutory duty by preventing contact which the local authority considers advantageous to welfare.</span></p>

The experts cited above recommended regular contact at various periods, and monthly was actually the most frequent (six weekly and bimonthly also being proposed). The plan to ensure good quality contact with each child for two hours on one particular weekend each month, which would enable M, foster carers and professionals to focus on the individual child on that day seems to me to be likely to be in the children&#8217;s best interests, and not one which I should seek to interfere in. It was made clear that regularity and frequency of contact will be kept under review by the local authority and the team of experts assembled in this case.   </span></p>
