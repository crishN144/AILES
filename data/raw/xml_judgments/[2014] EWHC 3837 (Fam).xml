	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In this matter I am concerned with one child, Farah Afzal, who was born on 2 October 2013, and is just one year of age.  Her mother is Zainab Rasul, who is 30 years of age, and her father is Mohammed Afzal, he is 32 years of age.  The other parties to this matter are the maternal grandfather, Aliunnaki Rasul, who is 61 years of age, and the maternal grandmother, Nazma Rasul, who is also 61 years of age.  This matter is before the court as a result of the London Borough of Harrow&#8217;s application for a care order in respect of Farah, and, latterly, an application for a placement order.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Two dramatic events have occurred during this case.  First, when this hearing commenced on 18 August this year the Local Authority, supported by the guardian and the maternal grandparents, proposed a special guardianship order should be made in favour of the maternal grandfather&#8217;s brother and his wife, Mr. and Dr. Rasul.  The Local Authority paid for them to receive independent legal advice and to be represented in the early days of the hearing.  Unfortunately, having sat and listened to some of the evidence, and having reflected upon their position and that of their family, they withdrew their proposal to care for Farah on 26 August.  In light of that, there was a substantial change in the care plan of the Local Authority, which became one for adoption.   </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The second dramatic and deeply tragic event was that on the evening of 20 August the father&#8217;s brother was fatally stabbed in an attack on the street.  The father and mother spent the whole of that night and the early hours of 21 August at the father&#8217;s brother&#8217;s bedside, and the father had to suffer the enormous burden of watching his brother die whilst at the same time he tried to give a description of his assailants.  It was for those reasons that the court, save for hearing briefly from an independent social worker, Miss Bhogal, on 21 August, did not receive further evidence on that day or the following day.  </p>

In relation to the fact finding, I remind myself that the burden of proof is upon the Local Authority.

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:11pt">However, I note that the terminology frequently deployed in arguments to this court and, no doubt to those at first instance, omit a significant element of the test as framed by both the Supreme Court and this court, which qualifies the literal interpretation of "nothing else will do". That is, the orders are to be made "only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by the overriding requirements pertaining to the child's best interests." (See In Re B, paragraph 215). In doing so I make clear that this latter comment is not to seek to undermine the fundamental principle expressed in the judgment, merely to redress the difficulty created by the isolation and oft subsequently suggested interpretation of the words "nothing else will do" to the exclusion of any "overriding" welfare considerations in the particular child's case. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:11pt">It stands to reason that in any contested application there will always be another option to that being sought. In some cases the alternative option will be so imperfect as to merit summary dismissal. In others, the options will be more finely balanced and will call for critical and often anxious scrutiny. However, the fact that there is another credible option worthy of examination will not mean that the test of "nothing else will do" automatically bites. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:11pt">It couldn't possibly. Placement orders are made more often in anticipation of finding adoptive parents than with ones in mind. Plans go awry. Some adoption plans are over ambitious. Inevitably there will be a contingency plan, often for long term fostering. The fact of a contingency plan suggests that 'something else would do at a push', the exact counterpoint of a literal interpretation of "nothing else will do", and it would follow that the application would therefore fail at the outset. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The "holistic" balancing exercise of the available options that must be deployed in applications concerning adoption is not so as to undertake a direct comparison of what probably would be best but in order to ascertain whether or not the particular child's welfare demands adoption. In doing so it may well be that some features of one or other option taken in isolation would produce a better outcome in one particular area for the child throughout minority and beyond. It would be intellectually dishonest not to acknowledge the benefits. But this is not to say that finding one or more benefits trumps all and means that it cannot be said that "nothing else will do". All will depend upon the judge's assessment of the whole picture determined by the particular characteristics and needs of the child in question no doubt often informed by the harm which s/he has suffered or been exposed to. </span></p>

On 2 October there was an episode at the hospital where Farah was receiving treatment after birth, when the father sought to remove her from the hospital in a wholly inappropriate manner.  On 22 October 2013 Farah was discharged from the hospital and went with her mother to a mother and baby foster care placement.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 11 November that placement changed and Farah and the mother moved to live with the maternal grandparents.  There Farah remained until the early hours of 16 January 2014, when the mother and father abducted Farah to Spain.  There were proceedings to secure Farah&#8217;s return to this jurisdiction, which involved contempt hearings, at which the maternal grandparents and the paternal grandmother were present.  I found the maternal grandfather to be in contempt of court and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment.  On 24 February 2014 Farah was recovered by the Spanish police.  On 27 February she returned to this jurisdiction where she was placed in foster care, and where she remains to date.  On 9 May 2014 the mother and father pleaded guilty in the Crown Court to abduction offences, for which they were each sentenced to 18 months imprisonment suspended for two years, with a nine months drug rehabilitation order and a two year supervision order.  </p>

Mr Afzal walked into the unit, whilst his brother held the doors of the neo natal unit open. He went to see Farah, who had inserted into her a feeding tube (through the nose). Mr Afzal picked up Farah and attempted to leave with her. Mrs [Zainab] Rasul asserts that she had packed some belongings with a view to her and her daughter moving to another hospital in view of her concerns about the care Farah was receiving at NPH. Nadeem Butt, the father&#8217;s brother, was also present waiting for them. Police were called, Mr Afzal was arrested and Mrs [Zainab] Rasul taken back to the ward, and baby taken back to the unit. This was potentially dangerous for Farah as the removal was contrary to medical advice. Mrs. [Zainab] Rasul accepts she should have intervened earlier to retrieve Farah from Mr Afzal and return her to medical staff at the neo-natal unit. </p>

I was told by Miss Chahal, a Service Manager, that when she spoke to the parents in Spain after Farah had been found, the parents told her that they had been using drugs when in Spain.  This is contested by the parents.  In light of their evidence generally, I reject that denial and I accept the evidence of Miss Chahal.  Notwithstanding being on a drug rehabilitation order, notwithstanding having the benefits and support of drug workers, both of the parents, even in the currency of these proceedings, have tested positive for the use of drugs.  I found the explanations given by the mother to be weak in the extreme.  The idea that one accepts a cigarette from a fellow drug user outside a drug rehabilitation unit without giving a thought as to whether it may have contained drugs is, I have to say, incredible.  The idea that some medication that the mother was taking might account for the presence of these opiates is not supported by expert evidence and I reject it.  Whilst it may be that the parents have made some efforts to be abstinent from drugs, they are a very long way, in my judgment, from being able to abstain from the abuse of illegal substances.  </p>

They have, not surprisingly, at times been exasperated by her inability, or her failure, to abstain from drug taking.

I am not satisfied, however, that they were complicit in the planning of the abduction. I bear in mind that at that time neither the maternal grandmother nor, particularly, the maternal grandfather believed that their daughter posed a risk to Farah. It seems to me that they did not, to any great degree, appreciate or accept the concerns then held by the local authority, and, in my judgment, it is more likely than not that neither the grandmother nor the grandfather saw any harm or risk to Farah in the mother and/or the  father removing Farah from the home at about 3 o&#8217;clock in the morning on 16 January 2014.  Even if I am wrong about that, they, by their own admission, accept that they made a grave mistake in not stopping the mother and the father removing Farah from their home, and that they were naive to a degree which beggars credibility.  Either finding is a serious one.  </p>

In my opinion, his relationship and ability to attend to his daughter&#8217;s practical and emotional needs will be increasingly impaired as he becomes more psychologically and physically unavailable as a result of intoxication with elicit substances and/or substance dependence.&#8221;</p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;Mr. Afzal is currently assessed as posing a high degree of risk of serious harm to children, namely his daughter, Farah Afzal.  He has also been assessed as posing a medium risk of harm to staff, in particular hospital and social care personnel, and his wife.  The risks to the staff are likely to be threatening and intimidating behaviour, and the risk to his wife at this time are thought to be in the context of controlling behaviours.  The risk of serious harm to Farah at this time is assessed as high.  Although Mr. Afzal appears to be complying with the High Court&#8217;s directions, there are a number of factors that remain unaddressed.  Mr. Afzal has tested positive for heroin on one occasion since the commencement of the suspended sentence order, and his engagement with WDP is limited and tests have been sporadic.  He has attempted to abduct Farah on two prior occasions.  There are varying accounts with regard to his mental health, and he appears to use deception as a means to allay any fears held by the authorities.  Added to this, this couple have experienced transient accommodation issues, and Mr. Afzal displays a distinct lack of responsibility for his behaviour, using a number of justifications and minimisation of potential harm.&#8221;  </p>

However, when she came to court she was provided with additional material, in particular notes of discussions that had taken place between the social workers, from time to time, and the maternal grandparents. In her oral evidence she said that, as a result of reading those materials, she had changed her recommendation and would not support the placement of Farah with her maternal grandparents, because it appeared that they, in her view, had not been frank about what they had been told of the risks presented by the father and/or the mother. She said the maternal grandparents had told her they were unaware of the mother&#8217;s drug abuse when it was clear from the documents that they did know. Furthermore Ms Bhogal expressed the view that the maternal grandparents would not be able to &#8216;stand up&#8217; to the father.  At that stage, Mr. Howling, on behalf of the maternal grandparents, did not challenge that evidence, not least because the grandparents were supporting the case being advanced by the Local Authority, namely, a placement with the grandfather&#8217;s brother and his wife.  </p>

He observed that he thought it was &#8220;too risky&#8221; to place Farah with the maternal grandparents, that he had &#8220;concerns&#8221; about the maternal grandparents&#8217; abilities to deal with Mr. Afzal.  He was &#8220;not sure&#8221; that the maternal grandparents would be able to keep Farah safe.  He &#8220;wondered&#8221; whether, if Farah were placed with the maternal grandparents, they would alert the Local Authority, or the police, if something went wrong.  He said a little later: &#8220;I am not sure they have got it&#8221;.  He had no confidence in the maternal grandparents.  He did &#8220;not believe&#8221; the maternal grandparents could stand up to the risk of further abduction presented by the parents.  It is right that eventually, after matters had been put on a number of occasions by Mr. Perkins for the Local Authority, Mr. Wheway expressed himself in more definitive and clearer terms.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Neither the social worker nor the guardian assessed the degree of risk of the parent&#8217;s seeking to abduct Farah or disrupt a placement with the grandparents. The risk was not obviously or clearly balanced against the disadvantages of adoption. The risk was not balanced emphatically enough, in my judgment, against the ability (a) of the grandparents to thwart the parents&#8217; attempts to abduct Farah or disrupt the placement and (b) against their ability and readiness to seek help and support to safeguard Farah&#8217;s placement. </p>

He is volatile, he is controlling, he is impulsive, and he is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, I fear, a drug abuser.  </p>

But it is plain, in my judgment, that he sees that as only a very, very short term measure.  It is plain from what he has said to professionals, as recently as earlier this month, and what he said in his evidence to me, that within six, eight, ten, twelve months, he would want to resume care for his daughter.  The prospects of him undertaking the work that Dr. Kolkiewicz has advised he needs to in order to ameliorate the risks that he presents, not only to himself but to Farah and to others, is, in my judgment, remote.  Accordingly, the prospect of him being able to take any active role in the day-to-day care of Farah for the foreseeable future is, similarly, remote.  </p>

They may have, for the last few weeks, and for the purposes of these proceedings, lived physically apart, but they are certainly not emotionally or psychologically separated, nor will they be.  In the course of her evidence, save and except for saying, (1) she accepted the report of Dr. Kolkiewicz, and (2) that the father needs to think before he acts, which were the only criticisms she made of the father, she did not see that he presented any risk at all to Farah, to herself, or to any other person.  She did not see why she should remain separated from her husband.  She plainly wanted to be with him, and he with her.  On the last day of the hearing, he, the father, was at the hospital with the mother, and had been throughout the whole of the day.  I regret to find that I am entirely satisfied that the purported separation between the parents is a mere ploy and for the purpose of this hearing.  It has not been the fact on the ground, nor will it be.  The father is controlling of the mother, which she does not acknowledge.  She is, in my judgment, a vulnerable individual, and the likelihood is that for now and the foreseeable future the father will be controlling of the mother.</p>

I have no confidence that with the rigors and stresses of life, both in a relationship with the father and with continued separation from Farah, she will maintain abstinence from drug taking, and it is more likely that she will continue for the foreseeable future, from time to time, to abuse drugs.  I am afraid the position was very graphically described by the maternal grandmother in her evidence when she told me that her daughter had had a choice between Farah or drugs and, in light of the most recent positive drug test, she had plainly chosen drugs.  I agree.  </p>

She will, I find, continue to abuse drugs.  She has not, I remind myself, ever cared for Farah alone.  She has not, and she will not, in the current circumstances, consistently put Farah&#8217;s needs first, and in particular above her own needs or those of the father.  </p>

I take account of the wholly positive contacts that have taken place between them. I take account of what Mr. Wheway said to me of his observed contact, namely it was plain that Farah enjoyed being with her parents, enjoyed interacting with them, and she plainly had an attachment to her mother.  The advantages to Farah of being cared for by her mother are so obvious and evident I do not need to recite them.  Being brought up by your mother should be of an immense benefit to a young child.  But the disadvantages are, in light of my findings, that Farah would be at a serious and real risk of significant harm now and in the future.  </p>

They accept, both in their most recent statements and in their oral evidence to me, that they have made mistakes.  They have found it difficult to take on board the concerns the local authority had, and have, about their daughter.  Over these last eight months they have been on an immensely difficult journey.  They have always in the past sought, quite properly, to support their daughter, whom they, of course, love.  In large part, because of that close relationship and love, they have found it very difficult to accept criticism of her.  When they have given different accounts to social workers, or independent social workers, about what they have been told in the past, I do not accept that they were setting out to lie or to in any way fail to co-operate with those professionals. I am satisfied that they are both honest, hardworking people, and, especially latterly, I do not accept that they have deliberately sought, in colloquial terms, to pull the wool over the eyes of the professionals and the social workers. </p>

They then faced, which must have caused them great pain and anguish, a massive change in the plan that contemplated their beloved granddaughter being adopted and being separated from them, certainly for the whole of her childhood, and possibly the rest of her life; that has brought both grandparents up very short.   In my judgment the impact of that change of care plan on the grandparents cannot be underestimated. I fear the professionals in this case have not given sufficient consideration to nor properly taken account of the same. I am satisfied, having listened carefully to the grandparents&#8217; evidence that it has:</p>

The depth of their passion to do the best for their granddaughter was clear.  Their desire to protect her and put her first was evident.  I found the maternal grandmother, and this is no criticism of her, was more readily able to contemplate putting Farah first and their daughter, the mother, very much second.  I entirely accept that that was a much more difficult step for the maternal grandfather to take. I do not doubt his sincerity, nor that of the grandmother, when they say, faced with the situation that they are in now, they want to do the best for their granddaughter, however painful and difficult that will be because of the consequential adverse impact upon their relationship with their daughter and their son-in-law.  </p>

It was submitted that there was a lack of detail and clarity about this condition and the potential consequences for the grandfather. To a large extent I agree. The issue does not vex me greatly, however, because I am satisfied that even if the worst happened and he became incapacitated or sadly, died, the grandmother would be more than capable of caring for Farah. In this context the guardian said in evidence that he had &#8216;no doubt&#8217; that the grandmother could care for Farah as a single carer. </p>

There is a risk that despite their best endeavours the father and/or the mother will succeed in abducting Farah again, and this time taking her not to a European and/or Hague Convention country but elsewhere.  I accept there is a very real risk that the father, in particular, and possibly the mother, will seek to disrupt the placement, either by calling at the grandparents&#8217; home or in later time going to Farah&#8217;s school. I accept that there is a risk that they will seek to interfere and to seek the return of Farah to their care by fair means or foul, and those risks, and those events, could lead to a breakdown of the placement with the grandparents, and that would, of course, be damaging for Farah.  The issue is whether they can manage those risks.  </p>

In my judgment, and my assessment of all of the evidence, but in particular having had the benefit of sitting and watching and listening to the grandparents, not only when they gave evidence but also sitting and watching them and their reactions as they heard the evidence in court, there is a chance that they could manage the risks posed by the father and the mother, but there is a chance that they might not.  </p>

I do not resile from my comments made early on in this hearing that I would take a great deal of persuasion before I would sanction this little girl being placed outside of her natural family.  I have had the opportunity, during the adjournments there have been in the case, to reflect very carefully on the totality of the evidence. I am satisfied that the real prospect that they could lose their granddaughter to adoption has had a very significant impact on the maternal grandparents&#8217; understanding of the issues in this case. They now recognise that if they were not to withstand the advances of the father and/or the mother that the placement would break down, that Farah would be removed and in all probability adopted. In my judgment, there is a good chance, but only just a good chance, that they will manage the risks posed by the father and by the mother.</p>

Given my assessment of the maternal grandparents, I am not satisfied that the balance falls in favour of adoption.  I am not satisfied that, in her interests, nothing less than  Farah being placed for adoption will do. In this case,  there are no perfect solutions.  I have very firmly come to the conclusion that it is in Farah&#8217;s welfare best interests that she should be placed in the care of her maternal grandparents, to be raised by them during her minority. Accordingly I will decline to make a final care order and I will dismiss the application for a placement order.  </p>

I will make an injunction preventing the parents attending any school or nursery that Farah may in due course attend.  Subject to further argument on the legality of any such order, I would also intend, with or without the consent of the parents, that their passports be held by the Tipstaff.
