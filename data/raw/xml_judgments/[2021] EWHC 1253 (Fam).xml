There is no express exclusion from its Part V remit of the children of diplomats, who enjoy immunity or inviolability under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the VCDR.  The material parts of this Convention, done in 1961, were incorporated directly into UK law by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1964/81/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1964/81" uk:canonical="1964 c. 81" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964</ref> (&#8216;DPA&#8217;), as set out in Schedule 1 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1964/81" uk:canonical="1964 c. 81" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, unchanged from the text of the VCDR.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In 2019 and continuing in to 2020, LBB had growing and serious concerns about the welfare of the children of a diplomat and his wife, who were living within its area.  It took such steps as it could to protect the children, but the range of steps, including those which would have been the most effective, could not be taken because of the immunity enjoyed by the diplomat, his wife and children. An application for an interim care order came before Mostyn J in March 2020 who concluded that his hands were tied by the operation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1964/81/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s2</ref> of the DPA.  The interim care order could not be made when it otherwise would have been.   He found that the treatment which the children experienced at the hands of their parents reached the threshold which would have breached the children&#8217;s rights under Article 3 ECHR.  He, understandably, was deeply troubled by the consequences.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">A few comments are apposite at this stage. First, the concept of &#8220;significant harm&#8221; in the Children Act will cover treatment which reaches the level of severity necessary for a breach of Article 3 ECHR, but is wider than that. Incompatibility could only arise </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">under Article 3 where that treatment reached that level. It was not in dispute that that level had been reached in this case.  Second, the permission granted by Mostyn J did not allow for a declaration to be sought in relation to the Articles of the VCDR which deal with the  &#8220;inviolability&#8221; of premises and person to be raised. Such a declaration was included by LBB only when it later formulated its application, to obtain as much guidance and clarity as it could from the Court. Third, the language of the declaration sought makes it clear that the true target of the declaration has to be the language of the VCDR itself.   </p>

She was represented pro bono by a legal team led by Professor Delahunty QC. We are very grateful to them for doing so and for their contribution to the submissions. We are also grateful to Mr Webster who unexpectedly, and at the last minute, found that he had to present the human rights arguments after Professor Sarooshi QC was taken ill; he took up the baton with great skill.   </p>

(Ages given at the time when LBB first applied to the Court for orders under Part V Children Act in January 2020.)  A safeguarding referral of the younger children in November 2019 led to an investigation under s47 Children Act. An investigation under s47 is required where a local authority, among other circumstances, &#8220;have reasonable cause to suspect the child who lives &#8230;in the area is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm &#8230;&#8221;. The authority must then make such inquiries as it considers necessary to enable it to decide whether it should take action to safeguard or promote the child's welfare.  The parents refused consent to LBB to speak to the children at home or at school, and objected to the school being asked to provide information, relying on their diplomatic immunity. The school had no safeguarding concerns. No allegation was made of injury to the children. No further action was taken.  </p>

LBB were told by the relevant team in the Metropolitan Police that diplomatic immunity prevented it undertaking an investigation. The police have emergency powers under s46 Children Act. By s46(1), where a constable has reasonable cause to believe that a child would otherwise be likely to suffer significant harm, he may remove the child to suitable accommodation and keep him there. There are other powers as well. The constable has to inform the local authority, within whose area the child was found, of what has happened and provide such details  to it that he has, and he has to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to inform the child's parents of what has happened.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 21 January 2020, LBB applied to the Family Court in Barnet for an emergency protection order under s 44 CA, giving the parents short notice of the application. The Court, before making such an order, has to be satisfied that  there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is likely to suffer significant harm if not removed, that enquiries being made under s47 are being frustrated because of an unreasonable refusal to allow the authority to seek access to the child, and that the authority reasonably believes that access is required urgently. An emergency protection order operates as a direction, to anyone in a position to do so, to comply with a request to produce the child to the authority which applied for it; most commonly this would be the parents. It authorises the authority to remove the child to accommodation it provides and to keep him there, in order to safeguard his welfare, and gives the authority parental responsibility for the child to the extent of permitting it to take such steps as are reasonably required to safeguard or to promote his welfare. There are further powers relating to contact with named persons, and medical or psychiatric examination.  </p>

A barrister attended to observe on behalf of the diplomatic mission. LBB issued an application for an interim care order under s31 CA. A care order, putting it very simply, places the child in the care of the local authority, for it to implement a care plan approved by the court, sharing parental responsibility for the child, making decisions in the child&#8217;s best interests and keeping the child&#8217;s welfare paramount  when decisions about the child&#8217;s welfare are made.   A care order can only be made if a court is satisfied that the child concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm; it must also be satisfied that that is attributable to the care the child has received, or was likely to receive if the order were not made, and that that care is not what a reasonable parent would be expected to give, or is attributable to the child being beyond parental control: CA s31(2).  A care order cannot be made with respect to a child who has reached the age of 17, or 16 if married.   </p>

It is true that the parents have deliberately chosen not to meet the case against them before the immunity issue has been determined. But even so, it seems extremely unlikely that they would be able to defeat an application for an interim care order which requires proof of no more than reasonable grounds for believing that the children have either suffered or are likely to suffer significant harm: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Miss Markham QC also rightly submits that the signing of the working together agreements would in a case such as this be hardly likely to persuade the court not to make an interim care order. As she said, such agreements might be sufficient to see off an interim care application in a routine case of neglect but would be hardly likely to have that effect where there was such a strong case of the infliction of deliberate harm.&#8221;   </p>

In some, LBB had been able to work effectively with the families, but not always nor in all serious cases. The police were also limited in the powers they could exercise, for the same reason, by diplomatic immunity: they could not enter the home, interview the child, arrest the alleged perpetrators, or ask them to leave the home. The police had in fact exercised their powers in this case when the two older children, adults, went to them, alleging parental abuse and seeking help. Diplomatic immunity also would prevent a child being medically examined for signs of physical abuse, and then provided with treatment.   </p>

A pan-London safeguarding partnership gave operational guidance in its 2020 Pan-London Child Protection Procedures document as to how safeguarding of diplomat children should be achieved.   There should be a referral to children&#8217;s social care, but legal advice about the particular immunity and diplomatic rank of the family and children had to be sought from the outset and before a child was removed, even in an emergency. It would be advisable generally to remove the child from school or elsewhere rather than from the diplomatic residence. It summarised correctly the extent of the immunities. It continued: the inability to enforce an order did not mean that the local authority or police had neither power nor duty to act as appropriate.  </p>

He saw the following powers as potentially curtailed by diplomatic status. Assessment was the starting point for the child protection process. He questioned whether the FCO was right to advise  that a social worker could not speak to the  children,   without a waiver of immunity; he regarded this  as rather a one-off stance, as the FCO in the present case had actively encouraged the local authority to speak to the family to try to resolve its concerns.  Second, the duty to protect could involve physical removal of the child from their   residence, pursuant to  a court order if the parents did not consent; but for a diplomat, there would be immunity from a court order, and the police could not use s46. Asking a state to waive immunity was intrinsically too slow for emergencies. LBB did not have high rates of children in need of protection, but it had 228 houses exempt from council tax on the grounds of diplomatic immunity.  He was increasingly aware of children who were in need of protection but were left without it because they were members of a diplomat&#8217;s household. Clarity in their position was required. </p>

The preamble realised &#8220;that the purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions as representing states&#8221;, and affirms the continuing role for the rules of customary international law governing questions not expressly regulated by the Convention.

It divides persons entitled to immunities and privileges into three categories: diplomatic agents, administrative and technical staff, and service staff, from the highest to the lowest level of immunities and privileges. This case concerns the highest level, diplomatic agents. Article 1 defines these as &#8220;the head of the mission or a member of the diplomatic staff.&#8221;  They enjoy three principal groups of privileges and immunities: inviolability of the person, Article 29; inviolability of his or her property and residence, Article 30; and immunity from jurisdiction, Article 31. By Article 37(1), &#8220;The members of the family of a diplomatic agent forming part of his household shall, if they are not nationals of the receiving state, enjoy the privileges and immunities specified in Articles 29 to 36.&#8221; The children here were members of the family of a diplomatic agent, forming part of his household.   </p>

The worker claimed compensation before an Employment Tribunal for discrimination on the grounds of race, failure to pay the minimum wage, and mistreatment. She also alleged that she was the victim of trafficking. One issue was whether, once the diplomat had left the UK, and remained immune only in respect of acts done in the course of his official functions, the commercial activities exception applied to the employment of the claimant.  </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The legal immunity of diplomatic agents is one of the oldest principles of customary international law. Its history can be traced back to the practices of the ancient world and to Roman writers of the second century. &#8220;The rule has been accepted by the nations,&#8221; wrote Grotius in the 17th century, &#8220;that the common custom which makes a person who lives in foreign territory subject to that country, admits of an exception in the case of ambassadors&#8221;: <span style="font-style:italic">De Jure Belli ac Pacis</span>, ii.18. But, although recognition of diplomatic immunity is all but universal in principle, until relatively recently both states and writers differed on the categories of people to which the immunity applied and its precise ambit in each category. In particular, they differed on the existence and extent of any exceptions. In Britain, the matter was dealt with by the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1708, which conferred absolute immunity on ambassadors and their staff from civil jurisdiction, in accordance with what British authorities regarded as the rule of international law. In <span style="font-style:italic">Triquet v Bath</span> (1764) 3 Burrow 1478, 1480, Lord Mansfield described <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1964/81" uk:canonical="1964 c. 81" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> as declaratory of the law of nations, and it remained in force until 1964. The United States adopted the British Act in 1790, and France adopted a corresponding rule by legislation in 1794. In other countries, however, exceptions of greater or lesser breadth were recognised, among others for private transactions relating to title to real property, certain employment disputes and liabilities arising out of business activities in the receiving state. There were also differences about the application of the immunity to diplomatic agents of a sending state who were nationals of the receiving state. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0.5in">These differences gave rise to a number of attempts during the 19th and 20th centuries to codify the law of diplomatic relations with a view to achieving a common set of rules and enabling them to operate on a reciprocal basis. The Havana Convention among the states of the Pan-American Union (1928) and the influential draft convention drawn up by the Harvard Law School (1932) were notable examples. But there was no universally accepted code before 1961. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which was adopted in that year, has been described by Professor Denza, the leading academic authority on the law of diplomatic relations, as &#8220;a cornerstone of the modern international order&#8221;: <span style="font-style:italic">Diplomatic Law</span>, 4th ed (2016), 1. It has been perhaps the most notable single achievement of the International Law Commission of the United Nations. The text was the result of an intensive process of research, consultation and deliberation extending from 1954 to 1961. Draft articles were submitted to the governments of every member state of the United Nations, and were subject to detailed review and comment. Eighty-one states participated in the final conference at Vienna in March and April 1961 which preceded the adoption of the final text. Since its adoption, it has been ratified by 191 states, being every state in the world bar four (Palau, the Solomon Islands, South Sudan and Vanuatu). A number of states ratified subject to declarations or reservations, but none of these related to the articles which are primarily relevant on this appeal. As it stands, the Convention provides a complete framework for the establishment, maintenance and termination of diplomatic relations. It not only codifies pre-existing principles of customary international law relating to diplomatic immunity, but resolves points on which differences among states had previously meant that there was no sufficient consensus to found any rule of customary international law. </p>

It is a procedural immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving state. The receiving state cannot at one and the same time receive a diplomatic agent of a foreign state and subject him to the authority of its own courts in the same way as other persons within its territorial jurisdiction. But the diplomatic agent remains amenable to the jurisdiction of his own country&#8217;s courts, and in important respects to the jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving state after his posting has ended. I do not underestimate the practical problems of litigating in a foreign jurisdiction, especially for someone in Ms Reyes&#8217; position. Nor do I doubt that diplomatic immunity can be abused and may have been abused in this case. A judge can properly regret that it has the effect of putting severe practical obstacles in the way of a claimant&#8217;s pursuit of justice, for what may be truly wicked conduct. But he cannot allow his regret to whittle away an immunity sanctioned by a fundamental principle of national and international law. As the fourth recital of the Vienna Convention points out, &#8220;the purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of diplomatic missions as representing states.&#8221; </p>

The ambit of each immunity is defined by reference to criteria stated in the articles, which apply generally and to all state parties. The recital does not justify looking at each application of the rules to see whether on the facts of the particular case the recognition of the defendant&#8217;s immunity would or would not impede the efficient performance of the diplomatic functions of the mission. Nor can the requirements of functional efficiency be considered simply in the light of conditions in the United Kingdom. The courts of the United Kingdom are independent and their procedures fair. It is difficult to envisage that exposure to civil claims would materially interfere with the efficient performance of diplomatic missions. But as the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs pointed out, the same cannot be assumed of every legal system in every state. The threat to the efficient performance of diplomatic functions arises at least as much from the risk of trumped up or baseless allegations and unsatisfactory tribunals as from justified ones subject to objective forensic appraisal. It may fairly be said that from the United Kingdom&#8217;s point of view, a significant purpose of conferring diplomatic immunity of foreign diplomatic personnel in Britain is to ensure that British diplomatic personnel enjoy corresponding immunities elsewhere. </p>

Article 47.2 of the Convention authorises any receiving state to restrict the application of a provision to the diplomatic agents of a sending state if that state gives a restrictive application of that provision as applied to the receiving state&#8217;s own mission. In some jurisdictions, such as the United States, the recognition of diplomatic immunities is dependent as a matter of national law on their reciprocity.

Baroness Hale, Lord Wilson and Lord Clarke were not as sure as were Lord Sumption and Lord Neuberger that the employment of the claimant would not have been such activity so as to fall within an exception to the diplomat&#8217;s immunity.

So it would be a strong thing for this court to diverge from the US jurisprudence set out in the <span style="font-style:italic">Tabion</span> case, cited in para 23 above, and to adopt the robust interpretation of article 31(1) for which Ms Reyes contends. On the other hand it is difficult for this court to forsake what it perceives to be a legally respectable solution and instead to favour a conclusion that its system cannot provide redress for an apparently serious case of domestic servitude here in our capital city. In the event my colleagues and I are not put to that test today. Far preferable would it be for the International Law Commission, mid-wife to the 1961 Convention, to be invited, through the mechanism of article 17 of the statute which created it, to consider, and to consult and to report upon, the international acceptability of an amendment of article 31 which would put beyond doubt the exclusion of immunity in a case such as that of Ms Reyes.&#8221; </p>

This would be a particular risk if the mission or instructions were politically unpopular in the relevant receiving State, or if the conditions in that State deteriorated.

There is no basis in either legal principle or precedent for treating a state's compliance or lack of compliance with its obligations under other international treaties as relevant to whether it has acted compatibly with article 14 (or any other provision of the Convention). As the cases cited at paras 97-100 above make clear, when the European Court refers to international instruments in interpreting the Convention, the purpose of doing so is not to establish whether the respondent state is in breach of its international obligations.

If the substance of the UNCRC was or was becoming customary international law by 1990, it would have been familiar to international jurists in 1960, just after the UN Declaration, and when the VCDR was made.    What is also clear is that, Article 3 and its counterpart in Article 37 UNCRC notwithstanding and with the VCDR made nigh-on thirty years before, there was still no express provision dealing with the immunities of diplomats including their children. Finally, the language of Article 37 UNCRC follows the language of earlier human rights instruments. It does not enlarge upon the concepts in Article 3 ECHR; the effect of the words &#8220;States Parties shall ensure that &#8230;.&#8221; is reflected in Article 1 ECHR.  </p>

Nor is it suggested that the Children Act should be read so that its provisions were applicable to children in diplomatic households regardless of the protection given by the DPA to their immunity and inviolability.  Nor is it suggested that it is the Children Act which is incompatible with the ECHR because its provisions  cannot override diplomatic immunity and inviolability, where it would be in the best interests of the child,  judged by UK courts, for that to be overridden.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">We were referred to the travaux preparatoires for the UNCRC, in which the position of the children of diplomats had been raised, very briefly, in discussions. It is not easy to construe the debate, but the territorial limit to the obligations was removed in favour of the limit to children &#8220;within their jurisdiction&#8221;, in Article 1. It is by no means clear that all participants were using the word &#8220;jurisdiction&#8221; in the same sense. Australia seems to have agreed to a proposal thinking that it meant that immunities would be retained, Finland&#8217;s object was unclear in seeking the equivalence of the ECHR &#8220;jurisdiction&#8221;. But the relationship of that to their immunities is not discussed.  They are within the jurisdiction and so, if immunity is waived, they can be dealt with under domestic child care laws, consistently with the DPA. What we do not extract from the UNCRC is any specific consideration given to the inclusion of the children of diplomats, and  resolving the effect of diplomatic immunity. The UNCRC could not affect their immunities, let alone by a sidewind of removing &#8220;children within their territories and jurisdiction&#8221; and substituting just &#8220;children within their jurisdiction&#8221;.   </p>

If they are not, no remedial application of even the special interpretative provision in s3, the so-called &#8220;reading down&#8221; interpretation, would arise. Third, if they are incompatible, can the conflict be resolved by such an interpretation, applied in the light of the principles governing its application? Fourth, if the conflict cannot be resolved in that way, should the court exercise its discretionary power to make a declaration of incompatibility under s4?  Such a declaration does not follow as a matter of course. The language of the HRA makes that clear, and declaratory relief is inherently discretionary. The basis upon which a declaration may be refused where incompatibility has been found, is considered later. </p>

As we have said, it was not suggested that the Children Act could, let alone should, be read as applying regardless of such immunities. It is therefore not in issue but that in domestic law, the provisions of the Children Act are to be read as subject to the provisions of the DPA, without any express provision to that effect.  Although the Children Act is the later Act, there was no suggestion of an implied repeal by it of parts of the DPA. That would have been an impossible contention.

Article 1 ECHR states that the obligation on the States Parties is to secure the Convention rights to &#8220;everyone  within their jurisdiction.&#8221; It was accepted on all sides that diplomatic immunity did not mean that diplomats are not within the jurisdiction in that sense, though they are immune from it. Their immunity may be waived or cease. It is a procedural bar to the exercise of jurisdiction, or, to put it another way, it is an immunity from suit and not from legal liability.  Sir James did not seek a reconciliation between the ECHR and the VCDR on the grounds that the diplomats were not within the jurisdiction in the sense in which that word is used in the ECHR.

The ECHR is and remains directed to the actions of the state. The parents of a child do not breach Article 3, whatever their treatment. The state has not subjected the children to any form of forbidden treatment. The scope for conflict arises with the way in which Articles 1 and 3 have been interpreted as going beyond this &#8220;negative&#8221; obligation and as encompassing a &#8220;positive&#8221; obligation necessary to secure the rights, and to make them fully effective.  </p>

One aspect, the first to appear, was the obligation to conduct an effective and official investigation into arguable claims of illtreatment breaching Article 3 by the police or agents of the state. This gloss was applied in order to make the obligation in Article 3 effective in practice and to prevent state agents breaching Article 3 with impunity: <span style="font-style:italic">Assenov v Bulgaria</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1998) 28 EHRR 652" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">(1998) 28 EHRR 652</ref>. That does not apply here, as there is no question of the involvement of agents of the UK, and such conduct would  breach diplomatic immunity  of itself.

This case concerned the very considerable failures of the police investigation into the rapes committed by a taxi driver, John Worboys. There was a dispute about whether the failings of that nature were &#8220;operational&#8221; or &#8220;investigative.&#8221; It does not matter under which head it is put for these purposes, though it seems to fit more naturally as a failure in the investigative duty which is a necessary part of making the Convention rights under Articles 2 and 3 effective. There was also an issue about the extent of any &#8220;systemic&#8221; failings, such as in training or other aspects of the investigative system. Such a distinction is not material here. The duties in establishing a &#8220;system&#8221; for investigation which enables it to be effective, is also subject to limits on what is reasonable having regard to what is practicable,  resources, and other obligations.   These categories are more a useful shorthand terminology for various facets which stem from the one obligation to secure the rights under Articles 2 and 3, than distinct categories differing in principle in legal content and consequence.

A similar approach has been applied to Article 2. This itself has developed two facets. The first is that the state should have a legal framework for the prohibition of conduct passing the Article 3 threshold, and that the legal system of the state should be available to protect the individual: <span style="font-style:italic">A v United Kingdom</span> [1998] 2  FLR 959. This is a short judgment, and simply asserted that the acquittal, on the &#8220;reasonable chastisement&#8221; defence,  of a father accused of assaulting his child by caning him, in a manner which crossed the minimum level of severity required by Article 3, showed that the law did not provide adequate protection against treatment breaching Article 3.  This may not be the first case in which that point was developed. That obligation here is in part fulfilled by the Children Act, but the child in a diplomatic family with the alleged and future perpetrator, is only fully protected under the UK&#8217;s legal system, criminal and family, when immunity has been waived. Otherwise there are real, and significant, restrictions on what can be done, even after a child has suffered grievously at the hands of the parents. </p>

It is thus accepted by those appearing before the court that Article 2 of the Convention may also imply in certain welldefined circumstances a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual. The scope of this obligation is a matter of dispute between the parties. </p>

Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. Another relevant consideration is the need to ensure that the police exercise their powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which would legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to justice, including the guarantees contained in Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention.  [A violation of that  positive obligation would only be established if] the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.   [The positive obligation was] to take all those preventive operational measures   that could reasonably be expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life which they have  or ought have knowledge.&#8221;   </p>

Lord Mance DPSC recognised the force of those criticisms. They are significant here in two respects. First, they underline the difficulty of construing   the ECHR in reliance on its jurisprudence with the clarity necessary to decide whether another international convention is incompatible with it.  This Court is construing a considerable and variable body of ECtHR jurisprudence to ascertain the ECHR&#8217;s purport and scope.   Second, they demonstrate the problem, which the Strasbourg Court would recognise even if it rejected all other criticism, that what the Convention means today is not necessarily what it meant yesterday or will mean tomorrow.   That is the price and point of a living Convention. But it is difficult to see that those ECtHR decisions have already developed the scope of the ECHR in such a way that the Council of Europe countries are themselves now required to breach   an international convention such as the  VCDR, and even less so where the particular issue is neither  raised nor addressed in the jurisprudence which is said to have that effect. Likewise, it is difficult to see the ECtHR developing its jurisprudence in that way in the future.    </p>

This is relevant to the position of diplomats and their children were the Children Act to be applied to them. A state can breach its obligations under Article 3 when removing someone from the UK to another country where there is a real risk that they would be subject to a treatment of a sufficient severity to breach Article 3, with neither an adequate system of law, protection  or enforcement to protect them. Absent any diplomatic immunity, a state would not normally allow a child in these circumstances to return home with its parents, unless an examination of the situation in the sending state showed that there was no real risk of their Article 3 rights being breached on return.   Unless the ECtHR jurisprudence is qualified by the international obligations to which the Council of Europe member states were already subject, the <span style="font-style:italic">Soering/Chahal</span> jurisprudence risked requiring Council of Europe member states to breach either the VCDR or ECHR, without that issue even being considered.

The ECtHR jurisprudence requirement for a legal system to be in place to protect children through legislation,  investigation and then the taking of other measures, cannot be read as also requiring the UK and the other Council of Europe Member States, all parties to the VCDR,  to adopt a system which would require them to breach  the VCDR towards each other and to other states. The ECHR does not require that in its text, and there is no jurisprudence which requires the Contracting Parties to breach the VCDR in order to avoid a breach of the ECHR. That is not surprising given that the VCDR codified the customary international law on diplomatic agents, and would have been well known in 1953. Nor is it surprising that the evolving jurisprudence of the ECtHR has not suggested any such consequence follows from its various decisions. That is because the ECtHR could not contemplate requiring a breach of an international Convention in order that its obligations be met, let alone a Convention of global reach, well beyond the regional concerns of the ECHR. The issue simply has not been addressed. If it were to be addressed, it is not thinkable that it would simply be addressed by an ECtHR decision, rather than through a separately negotiated protocol.    </p>

The duty to investigate offences committed by a private individual which reach the Article 3 threshold undoubtedly exists, and is breached if the failings in the investigation are sufficiently severe. We see no incompatibility with that approach if the reason an investigation, by the local authority or police, cannot proceed further is that the diplomat stands on his immunity, and his immunity is not waived. This is not the same qualification and not directly the same issue as in <span style="font-style:italic">DSD</span>.  But it is clear that the duty is subject to practical constraints.

This concept of what is reasonable in all the circumstances includes operation of the whole of the VCDR. The position of children within it is part of enabling the diplomatic agent to perform their functions as required by the VCDR.

It would apply Article 31 VCLT so as to bring in the VCDR as a relevant rule of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. This use of other international conventions is not confined to human rights conventions. In so doing, we regard it as inconceivable that it would hold that the limitations which compliance with the VCDR places on the powers of a state, under its domestic law,  to investigate the well-being of the  children of diplomats, and to protect them from serious ill-treatment accordingly, had to be breached  in pursuit of the jurisprudence it has developed about Article 3.

However, the lex posteriori is not the starting point in international law for the interpretation of treaties; it deals with the resolution of incompatibility. The starting point, however, is to achieve a reconciliation between the international obligations. The prior task is to see if the two provisions are reconcilable or compatible. One aspect of that is the relationship between the specific and the general. The specific will usually continue to apply in the situations which it covers, leaving the general to apply elsewhere. This is discussed in the Study Group on the Fragmentation of International Law 2006, whose conclusions were adopted by the International Law Commission in 2006, p178-180, just before the section on the lex posteriori, on which the Applicant relied. This principle is that whenever two or more norms deal with the same subject matter, priority should be given to the norm that is more specific. It is applicable in the context of provisions within two or more treaties. Whether it is the general rather than the specific which should be predominant should be decided contextually. The rationale of the principle that the special has priority over the general is justified by the former being more concrete, taking better account of the particular features of the context in which it is applied than any applicable general law. Its application may also often create a more equitable result; it may often better reflect the intent of the legal subjects. Its effect is not to extinguish the relevant general law; this may still give direction for the interpretation and application of the special law, and it will become applicable in situations not provided for by the special law. The same result may also arise where there is a special regime in which a treaty contains the rights and obligations relating to a specific subject matter.  </p>

There is no provision for the special position of such children or their diplomat parents in the UNCRC. It is incontestable that some provision needs to be made for them. It is made in the VCDR and not controverted by any provision of the UNCRC.  The specific provisions in the VCDR would sensibly apply instead of the general provisions of the UNCRC or ECHR where they fall within the scope of the VCDR.  The UNCRC is not so much incompatible as inapplicable, where the VCDR bites.  </p>

They commend testing whether two treaties relate to the same subject matter by asking whether the two different rules lead to a different answer to the same question, and not by looking at the overall subject matter of the treaties. This, it was said, adopts a suggestion of the International Law Commission.  We observe that if the later treaty overrides the earlier on that basis, then on the Applicant&#8217;s analysis, the same argument would apply to the effect of the VCDR on the ECHR, however the latter may be regarded in UK domestic law.  </p>

The subject matter of each is very different, as we have already discussed.  The effect of treating them as dealing with the same and applying the rule that the later prevails, is plainly not what any party to either could have thought. The parties to the VCDR would never have agreed to such a provision. The VCDR, codifying customary international law, after extensive negotiations and consideration, leading to its specific text governing international diplomatic relations, cannot have been superseded in any part by a Convention dealing with the rights of children.  Still more difficult is it to conclude that that has been achieved in so sensitive an area, where the very purpose is to send diplomats and their families abroad safely, and entrust them to the compliance with the VCDR by the receiving state,  without so much as a word in the text of the later to the problem of diplomats&#8217; children.  It is not possible to conclude that the UNCRC should be interpreted as disturbing the VCDR, heedless of the real harm that would risk doing, and doing to the children of diplomats abroad, as the UNCRC would be doing were the Applicant right.

The meaning imported by application of section 3 must be compatible with the underlying thrust of the legislation being construed. Words implied must, in the phrase of my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, 'go with the grain of the legislation'.

Even this would not permit the full exercise of the powers of the Children Act, because &#8220;significant harm&#8221; and Article 3 are not co-extensive.    There is no room for a further exception to immunity to be implied alongside those which are express in the VCDR. They obviously read as the three and only three exceptions.

Such an interpretation would be a statement that other state parties to the ECHR should be doing or would be entitled to do likewise.

The customary international law which was in force before the ECHR was adopted, and codified in the VCDR, was and is part of that body of law. The ECHR would be interpreted so as to accord with it, rather than to be in conflict. The ECtHR could not require the Council of Europe member states to breach their obligations under the VCDR towards each other, and still less towards other states who were not parties to the ECHR but were parties to the VCDR. The jurisprudence of the ECtHR would not permit the removal of immunity to stop at the territorial borders of the member states. The protection of children would require not just intervention in the UK but would require it to continue to the extent of preventing their removal if they would face a real risk of treatment by non-state agents abroad which breached Article 3, against which the state would provide inadequate protection. Nor is it possible to see by what logic the legislative and operational protection which LBB relies on here could be confined to the children of diplomats, and not extended to their family who were members of the household.  If pragmatic limits were to be emplaced, why would children be the limits of that pragmatic exercise of interpretation? The reconciliation of the obligations is quite straightforward, although the outcome cannot achieve the child protection which LBB seeks.  </p>

The same points that we have made in relation to Article 3 and s3 HRA apply here to a reading down interpretation for the purposes of Article 6.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Articles 29 and 30 VCDR provide for the inviolability of the diplomat&#8217;s person and his property and residence. By Article 37, the family of the diplomat enjoy the same privilege.  LBB is concerned that this would prevent the sort of investigation which is required, even to the extent of not permitting the children to be spoken to. It had led to the social workers being refused entry to the diplomat&#8217;s home to carry out a welfare check in the home environment. The local authority is concerned to establish as much clarity as it can by way of investigations and genuine emergencies.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">We recognise the considerable difficulties which uncertainty poses for local authorities.  In the first place, the local authority is seeking a ruling as to what   the VCDR/DPA prohibits under those Articles, rather than a declaration of incompatibility under the HRA, without a specific set of facts to be ruled on. That is understandable but Courts do not give advisory rulings. We have already said that nothing that the local authority did infringed the rights and privileges of the diplomat or his family. We are not prepared to go further without a case which specifically raises the point and requires its resolution. If it is not necessary to do so, it would be unwise to do so.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Sir James Eadie made a number of points in his Skeleton Argument about  the limits which inviolability and immunity placed on what could be done in relation to diplomats: they could not be detained or arrested or compelled to attend a police station, but that did not mean that they could not be invited to do so and agree to do so to verify their identity or status.  A &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent&#8221; child could consent to participate in enquiries under s47 Children Act, provided that that was voluntary and without any measure of restraint, impediment or indignity.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">There does appear to be some recognition of circumstances in which a brief arrest could take place, in exceptional circumstances to restrain a diplomatic agent caught in the act of committing an offence in order to prevent its further commission. Measures of selfdefence may also be taken. This applies only to inviolability of person and property, and not to immunity from criminal proceedings. The exceptional circumstances appear to require an extreme and continuing character, where there is an immediate threat to human life.   The breach of inviolability may take place only where that is the only option available to save human life, and there has to be a special relationship between the diplomat and the person in danger, or where the breach is the only way for the State  to safeguard an essential interest of the State itself against a grave and imminent peril. But a local authority would be very unwise to see this, and we do not see it, as a tool of any practical use in the sort of circumstances likely to be encountered in child protection.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">This does not arise on the conclusions we have reached. Had we reached different conclusions, however, we would not have granted a declaration in the exercise of our discretion. We reach that decision having given careful attention to what the Supreme Court said in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Steinfeld) v Secretary of State for Education</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2018/32" uk:canonical="[2018] UKSC 32" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] UKSC 32</ref>, [2020] 1 AC  654 at [54-61], in the judgment of Lord Kerr. It recognised that this remedy was discretionary, and its grant did not compel Parliament to do anything. The fact that the solution might be controversial is plainly not a reason for refusing a declaration.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">First, nonetheless, it has to be anticipated that Parliament could do something compatibly with the UK&#8217;s other international law obligations to meet the breach of another. Here it cannot do so. Parliament could not remedy the position on its own, except by breaching international law. The speedy provision in s10 HRA for remedying an Act incompatible with the ECHR is plainly not applicable. This is a case therefore in which the remedy would be of no immediate value and potentially never would be of any value. Second, we recognise the force of the evidence given by Ms MacMillan as to the effect which such a pronouncement could have of itself on the way in which UK diplomats abroad could be seen, to their peril. Third, there is nothing to prevent the International Law Commission taking up the issues to seek some internationally agreed protocol to the VCDR to deal with child protection, whether there is incompatibility or not with the ECHR. We see no need to throw a &#8220;pebble into the pool&#8221; for that to happen. Fourth, it is equally clear that there is no obvious solution to hand. This is not a matter of drafting, but of principle. The jurisdiction over the protection of children of diplomats is much more obviously for the sending state to exercise, to which the measures available under the VCDR already enable the family to be returned.  </p>
