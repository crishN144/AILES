Whilst interim contact within England has been agreed by the parties, the mother seeks the court&#8217;s permission for the child to travel to Czech Republic next month in order to attend a family celebration for the maternal grandfather&#8217;s birthday. In reality, the outcome of that discrete issue will be dependent, in part, on the outcome of the mother&#8217;s application pursuant to the Convention. </span></p>

Unfortunately, the hearing on 21 July 2022 was effectively lost as an interpreter for the mother was not arranged by the court. The hearing then proceeded on 22 July 2022, with oral evidence from both parents and then closing oral submissions. The evidence was intended to be limited to the issue of consent / acquiescence. In the event, cross examination of both parents exceeded those parameters to an extent. Due to the loss of court time on the first day, it became necessary for the court to find further time to hand down judgment. </span></p>

The mother, who breast fed the child for the first two years of his life, was plainly his primary carer at that time. The child was also having regular contact with his wider Czech maternal family. The times he spent in England during this period were more in the nature of visits, albeit in the same paternal family home and, on occasion, for prolonged periods. The child also had regular contact with his English extended family during these visits.   </span></p>

The paternal family business, along with so much else, was effectively on hold, with the result that he could spend an extended period away.

On the mother&#8217;s case, the father had refused to allow the child to return to Czech Republic in September and had failed to take the child there subsequently. She must have been, on her present case, highly anxious. Yet she accompanied him on a holiday. Equally, on the father&#8217;s case, the mother was seeking for the child to return to Czech Republic when the plan by then was for him to stay in England long term. He had already sought legal advice. He too must have been anxious at this time. I will address whether either, or both, parties had other agendas at the material time later in this judgment. </span></p>

In particular, she was evasive in her evidence about her messages sent to father in early 2022. In her message sent on 6 February 2022 [408/415] she said that she had received an offer of employment in England and needed father&#8217;s assistance to obtain settled status in the UK. She said in evidence in chief that this was to &#8220;test&#8221; the father as he said that he had loved her during their Christmas together. Later the mother eventually told the court, following deliberate avoidance in legitimate cross examination, that she did not have any offer of employment and did not wish to seek settled status in the UK. She said again that she was &#8220;testing&#8221; the father. She wanted him to go to Czech Republic. I remind myself that she had already instructed lawyers in Czech Republic to seek the return of the child. It follows that, on her case, she deliberately lied to the father in the message. However, it remained unclear to the court what the apparent aim underlying the &#8220;testing&#8221; the father would, in fact, achieve in the circumstances. In short, I am satisfied that this aspect of the mother&#8217;s evidence was wholly unsatisfactory.  </span></p>

He was also initially somewhat reluctant to accept that he was forming a &#8220;bubble&#8221; with the child and mother in March 2021, before ultimately accepting that this was correct.

Furthermore, it was suggested that, as a teacher herself, she had a particular interest in the child&#8217;s education. This explains the extent of visits to possible nurseries. By contrast, the father contends that these visits were part of more careful and detailed long term planning for the child.</span></p>

However, the mother did not book any flight for the child in advance of early September. In fact, she did not actually book a flight for the child at that time at all until 17 September 2021, with a view to departing on 29 September 2021 [238/415].

I find that there was no clear plan on the part of the mother for the child to be taken to Czech Republic in time to resume school in September 2021 until she changed her mind at some point in that month.   </span></p>

In reaching this conclusion, I take into account the exchange of electronic messages shortly after this visit. Mother refers to having had a pleasant visit [199/415] in her communication with him. I doubt that the visit would have been as pleasant at all had this document been produced. It would no doubt have led to a disagreement. Furthermore, in my judgment it is highly likely that the document, together with any surrounding discussions or disagreements, would also have been referenced in that near contemporaneous exchange of messages in early 2022 if the mother had produced it over Christmas. </span></p>

They also continued after there was, on any view, an issue between them from September 2021 onwards concerning the future arrangements for the child. I would have expected most people in the father&#8217;s position to have immediately stopped all payments at that time. The fact that he continued to do so, including a relatively small payment for M&#8217;s benefit at around Easter 2022 is, in my judgment, more reflective of his generosity then forensically important in terms of casting light upon his state of mind. </span></p>

This was an opportunity for the children to have a &#8216;fun day&#8217; along with their cohorts and their parents. The child would have been enrolled in the nursery for about two months at the time. The description of the day was consistent with the child having fully settled into his nursery having found his place within his cohort of peers;</span></p>

I am satisfied that when the mother was also present in England for periods between March until September 2021, she was  discharging the role, by then, of co-primary carer. It follows that she was a visitor to England at that time. However, I am satisfied that the father was also directly involved in caring for the child as well. At times when the mother was back in Czech Republic, the father became the child&#8217;s sole primary carer, along with some help from his family and others. There is no issue about the extent of father&#8217;s integration in England. Indeed, there is evidence before the court as to the particular extent of the integration of father&#8217;s family in N [county];</span></p>

In this case, whilst the child plainly had a strong connection with Czech Republic, he also experienced a considerable amount of movement between the two countries, spending no less than 83 days in England during one such visit when he was about 2 years old; </span></p>

I am satisfied that there was a limited degree of rapid planning by the mother in advance of the looming further lockdown in Czech Republic in 2021. This militates somewhat against a rapid change in habitual residence. That said, this lack of detailed planning must also be seen in the context of the general fluidity in mother&#8217;s plans for the child&#8217;s future at the time; </span></p>

However, there is merit in the mother&#8217;s argument in this regard. In my judgment, absent truly exceptional circumstances, a comparative analysis of the competing home environments is not appropriate. I also bear in mind my earlier observations set out immediately above in relation to the mother as a previous primary carer. She discharged this role without complaint on the part of the father, at least in terms of her capacity to provide essential parenting during the child&#8217;s first two years. I am satisfied that she would &#8216;make the best&#8217; of her situation in providing an acceptable and familiar home for the child, with M, even if the same is relatively limited in terms of space.  </span></p>

Similarly, in the simple paradigm case of wrongful retention, one parent will have travelled with the child from the State of habitual residence to the destination State, for example for an agreed fortnight's holiday (and thus without the removal being wrongful), but will then wrongfully have refused to return. In each of those paradigm cases, the child will have remained habitually resident in the home State. An application under the Abduction Convention will be made in the destination (or 'requested') State for the return of the child to the State of habitual residence. The return will be a summary one, without investigation of the merits of any dispute between the parents as to custody, access or any other issue relating to the upbringing of the child (Art 16). Such merits decisions are for the courts of the State of the child's habitual residence.</span></p>

It is perhaps improbable in the case of removal, but it is not in the case of retention. It may particularly happen if the stay in the destination State is more than just a holiday and lasts long enough for the child to become integrated into the destination State. It is the more likely to happen if the travelling parent determines, however improperly, to stay, and takes steps to integrate the child in the destination State. Even in the case of wrongful removal, it may be possible to imagine such a situation if, for example, there had been successive periods of residence in the destination State, followed by a removal from the State of origin which infringed the rights of custody of the left-behind parent.</span></p>

Again, he may take an active part in proceedings in the country to which the child has been abducted to determine the long-term future of the child.

Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest on the evidence available to the court and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm are identified.  It follows that if, having considered the risk of harm at its highest on the available evidence, the court considers that it does not meet the imperatives of Art 13(b), the court is not obliged to go on to consider the question of protective measures.</span></p>

Still less does it follow that there is no value in oral evidence. But research confirms that people do not in fact generally rely on demeanour to detect deception but on the fact that liars are more likely to tell stories that are illogical, implausible, internally inconsistent and contain fewer details than persons telling the truth: see Minzner, "Detecting Lies Using Demeanor, Bias and Context" (2008) 29 Cardozo LR 2557.

But to attach any significant weight to such impressions in assessing credibility risks making judgments which at best have no rational basis and at worst reflect conscious or unconscious biases and prejudices. One of the most important qualities expected of a judge is that they will strive to avoid being influenced by personal biases and prejudices in their decision-making. That requires eschewing judgments based on the appearance of a witness or on their tone, manner or other aspects of their behaviour in answering questions. Rather than attempting to assess whether testimony is truthful from the way it is given, the only objective and reliable approach is to focus on the content of the testimony and to consider whether it is consistent with other evidence (including evidence of what the witness has said on other occasions) and with known or probable facts."</span></p>
