He found that the children were emotionally damaged as a result of their father&#8217;s conduct.  An order for indirect contact only was subsequently made.</span></p>

She described exceptionally lively children who could be badly behaved, though not at the most extreme end in her experience.  The older two boys had learning difficulties, while K was more open.

She then goes on to tell K that she wants to talk to him about what he had told his mother and aunt and that he is free to talk about bad behaviour.  She then introduces the idea that the bad behaviour involved another boy, before naming N, who K had not mentioned.  Once again K is asked to say what he had told his aunt.  As the interview proceeds, K is kept on the topic that the officer wishes to explore by fairly firm guidance and the use of suggestive and leading, sometimes grossly leading, questions.  (e.g. "Anything come out of the winky?&#8221;).  No attempt is made to "disconfirm" what K is saying.  Overall, with respect to the officer, the interview is at best rudimentary and at times clumsy.</span></p>

He shows a reasonable understanding of the difference between truth and lies. He is reasonably relaxed, although he becomes somewhat anxious when asked about the dares.  Having overcome initial reluctance, he fluently describes venues and other people present.  Having received strong encouragement to overcome his embarrassment, he speaks freely: "He told us to put a winky up somebody's bum and told us to suck our winkies, somebody put a winky in somebody's mouth."  Subsequently, he explains how N forced them to do it by threatening to remove them from the story that he was making up.  There is then a large amount of spontaneous detail relating to the postures of the various boys while the activity was going on, the removal of clothing, the fact that the grandmother did not like them going into the bedroom at her house, an occasion when it happened at the boys' house (and that it did not happen at school), the experience of feeling choked, hand movements, white goo in the mouth with a specific explanation of how it got there and how N gave him a drink to wash his mouth with, how long it had been going on for, how they arranged lookouts, how it felt a painful when a winky went in his bum, and how N told them not to tell anyone.</span></p>

In any case, he says that he was never alone with the boys or with any of them and that there was always somebody in eyeshot.  He never went into his bedroom when the boys were around and the boys were not allowed there because they were naughty.  He described normal play with them, including using them as characters in his imaginative story writing and electronic games.  He believed that he was the victim of bullying and that the boys had put their heads together to get him into trouble because he was a "perfect child" compared to them, but that the whole thing had led to consequences that they would not have intended.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Based upon the history of these two families, I reject any evidence to the effect that these children were being so closely supervised that behaviour of the kind alleged could not have taken place.  On the contrary, a lack of proper protective supervision is characteristic of both homes.  The evidence on this question from the grandmother, other family members and N himself was consistently unconvincing.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">While N undoubtedly has a very different nature to the three boys &#8211; he being quiet and they being anything but &#8211; I do not accept that this makes their allegations less likely to be true.  What J described as "dirty dares&#8221; would be likely to be appealing to boys whose behaviour was often very unruly.  In his interview, J said that he was not at first concerned at what was happening, but that he later did not like it and they had decided to tell their mother.  I do not find that these children would need to be forcibly coerced when more subtle pressures existed in the form of forbidden activity and the possibility of being included or excluded from N&#8217;s stories.  Likewise, I do not accept the argument that N would lack the nerve to behave in this way; on the contrary, spending long periods of time with children with such different standards of behaviour may have led to him becoming disinhibited.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Although it is not for N to prove anything, I can find no plausible motive for these allegations have been invented.  The suggestion of the adults that this is a plot by CB, carried out by her sons, is far-fetched.  The relationship between the two mothers was notably close before this issue arose.  Nor is there anything in N&#8217;s theory that the boys did it to get at him.  As Mr Buchan says on behalf of the Guardian, allegations of this kind would be well beyond their normal repertoire for getting someone else into trouble.  I detected no real malice towards N from the boys or their family, and there is in my view no chance of them having the sophistication to launch a concerted attack on him in this way.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Nor is there any substantial risk that the children's account has been contaminated by their very limited conversations with their mother or by their more detailed conversations with their aunt.  The mother had no reason to want to whip up or distort what she was being told and I found the aunt to be a sympathetic person who did not press the children inappropriately.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I accept that these boys cannot always be relied upon to be truthful.  The way in which J&#8217;s mother got him to deny that she had hit him is a striking instance of the poor example they have received.  However, this is a long way away from the present case.  In that instance, J was telling a bald lie for a very obvious purpose, while the allegations against N are detailed and without obvious motive.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Despite the well-made points about the calibre of the interviewing of the children, I find that those interviews have significant evidential value.  The children's demeanour suggests recall of real events, described with appropriate affect, and without any sense of being rehearsed.  The account given by K is undoubtedly fuller and more coherent than the accounts given by his brothers.  I believe that this is because he was younger (then only six) and less guarded about speaking to professionals.  He also describes more extensive behaviours, possibly as a result of him having spent time alone with N.  I find that the interviews with the older boys add some support to K&#8217;s account and that the evidence of the three children taken together is capable of establishing the allegations.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Having reached the conclusion that each of these boys has had inappropriate sexual experiences of the kind they describe, I have considered whether this might have been at the hands of someone other than N, for example C.  Having done so, I find no hint of this.  Apart from anything else, there is a clear description that these events mainly took place at N&#8217;s home, while inter-sibling abuse would be more likely in their own home.  </span></p>

However, his denial of any sexual interest at the age of 12&#189; and his determination to show that he was never alone with the boys were not at all persuasive.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Taking full account of all the matters urged by the Official Solicitor, I find that the local authority has made out its case in relation to the allegations against N.  I find that at the age of 12, he took advantage of the opportunity to behave sexually towards three younger children, aged 10, 8&#189; and 6&#189;, by causing them to put his penis into their mouths and their penises into his.  He also encouraged them to do this to themselves.  He made K masturbate him until he ejaculated and to taste his semen.  He attempted to perform anal sex upon K, though it is not clear whether there was any significant penetration.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">It goes without saying that even at N&#8217;s young age, behaviour of this kind was seriously wrong.  It goes well beyond the relatively innocent sexual experimentation of children reaching the age of puberty.  It involved younger children, and in K&#8217;s case a very much younger child.  It is not possible or necessary for this court to identify whether these events represent a passing and uncharacteristic phase in N&#8217;s development or something more concerning.  Because N has not been able, or allowed and encouraged, to acknowledge what he did, it is more difficult to know what sort of help he requires.  I am, however, quite clear that N should receive skilled and sympathetic support and that he should be considered as being in some significant degree a victim of the situation and not just a perpetrator.  If he is offered help and is able to accept it, he may have the potential to put this sorry episode behind him.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Ms Akerman relies upon the fact that it was the grandmother who first brought W&#8217;s circumstances to the attention of the court, that her care of W as an infant was very good, and that the quality of contact is likewise high.  The grandmother does not herself pose any direct risk to W, and her relationship with the mother is currently good.  She has some ability to work with professionals, and she regards family life as important.  There are no issues about her daily lifestyle, such as drug or alcohol abuse, nor any learning difficulty.  She is plainly very committed to W.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">However, I share the concern of Mrs Paddle about the grandmother's ability to offer a reliable protective environment for a child throughout his childhood.  She has some ability to cooperate with services, and at times appears to value them, but her level of understanding of the difficulties is in my view superficial.  She is able to give a confident account of events from her own standpoint, but there is little sign of any deeper understanding.  Based upon the lengthy family history, there is a high chance that W would at some point be at risk of the sort of sexual and emotional harm that his own mother has suffered, not to mention many of the other children in the family.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Although the grandmother was herself a victim of her second husband, it sadly took a very long time for her to take the children to safety, and as a result they suffered emotional and possibly sexual harm.  As to S, I do not accept that her difficulties are particular to herself and that the grandmother bears no responsibility.  The grandmother's evidence about the way in which S was allowed to go to Lincolnshire on the occasion when she became pregnant was extremely unimpressive, and represented a clear failure on her part to care about what was likely to happen, let alone offer protection.  Her ready acceptance of the return of DK into the life of her daughter JK is also worrying.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The grandmother's response to the allegations against N were not helpful to him.  She completely closed her mind and will have made it very hard indeed for him to admit anything.  As a result, all the children had been put through years of uncertainty.  It represents another clear failure of parenting.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I also consider that returning W to a household where his mother and grandmother both live would be an insecure arrangement.  It is not clear whether the better relations between them will continue, or whether there is just a truce while these proceedings continue.  There is no doubt that S is sexually active and the effect of future partners or future children on her relationship with her mother is unpredictable.  It is in my view quite likely that conflict will surround W as a result.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Moreover, the grandmother already has very heavy commitments.  Her daughter JK very much needs her, particularly in the light of DK's problems.  Her daughter S is in real need of guidance and support if she is not to get into serious difficulties again.  And now, N, who is very close to his mother, will need a great deal of love and attention.  Introducing W into this situation would in my view overstretch the grandmother's capacity, even at a basic care level, and would certainly not allow her to exercise the vigilance that she has not succeeded in exercising in the past.    </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">My conclusion therefore is that, while the matter is more finely balanced in the absence of the finding against N, the local authority has established that W would even so be at risk of significant harm if placed in the care of his grandmother.  The finding having been made in respect of N, the outcome is clearer still.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The threshold having been crossed, I find that it is in W's interests for a care order to be made so that the local authority's plan for adoption can be put into effect without further delay.  I have considered the criteria for making a placement order.  Again, such an order is plainly in W's lifelong interests, taking account of all the matters in the adoption welfare checklist, and the order is necessary and proportionate.  The mother, being the only person with parental responsibility, understandably does not consent, and I shall therefore dispense with her consent on the basis that W&#8217;s welfare requires it.</span></p>
