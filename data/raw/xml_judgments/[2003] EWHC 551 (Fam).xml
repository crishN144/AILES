	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This particular case has had a happy ending. But the facts reveal what I can only call a &#8216;mindset&#8217; and a &#8216;culture&#8217; so seemingly oblivious to the imperative requirements of article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and so unwittingly careless of the need to treat parents with fairness, that I cannot let the matter pass without some comment.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the parents, of course, this case was one of the utmost gravity and significance: they were threatened with the loss of four of their children. But there was, in truth, nothing particularly difficult or out of the ordinary in this case. In many ways it was a very typical kind of care case involving a very typical local authority. This in many ways makes the &#8216;mindset&#8217; and &#8216;culture&#8217; to which I have referred all the more concerning. For it suggests that even some two years after the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> came into force, and, as we shall see, despite no lack of relevant judicial authority, some very important and basic messages have still not worked their way through into day-to-day practice on the ground.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not wish to be too critical of the particular local authority involved in this case. The experienced children&#8217;s guardian suggested that what had happened in this case was not so very much out of the ordinary. I fear she may well be right, but whilst this indicates that it would not be right to single this particular authority out for special blame it does serve to re-emphasise the need for the message to be spelt out to the widest possible audience. Hence I am giving leave for this judgment to be reported, albeit on the usual strictly anonymous basis.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 22 June 2000 after contested care proceedings the Circuit Judge made care orders in relation to four children in favour of a local authority which I shall refer to as Authority X. Though it was recognised that there were risks involved, the care plans which the judge approved provided for rehabilitation of the children to their mother and father. That took place in September 2000, by which time the parents were living in the area of another local authority which I shall refer to as Authority Y. Thereafter the care plans were supervised on a day to day basis by Authority Y. There were looked after children review meetings on 16 July 2002 in relation to each of the children. These were attended by the mother and by A, a senior practitioner in the social services department of Authority Y. The minutes of these meetings (which for some reason were not prepared until 16 September 2002) contain nothing to indicate that there were at that time any real areas of concern in relation to the children, let alone anything to suggest that the children might have to be removed.</p>

On 4 September 2002 a team manager at Authority Y contacted B, the relevant team manager at Authority X, to express Authority Y&#8217;s growing concerns about the children. It was agreed that there would be a meeting between A and B. On 5 September 2002 there was a discussion between B and C, the relevant service manager at Authority X, during which it was agreed that B would meet with A to ascertain further information. It was agreed between B and C that, should the concerns raised be significant, this information would be brought to a Pre Admission to Care Panel meeting so that it could be considered by senior managers within Authority X. </p>

Authority X&#8217;s head of legal services replied on 14 October 2002 saying that Authority X &#8220;is actively considering whether or not the [children] should be removed from your clients&#8217; full time care&#8221;. That, I have to say, is a less than satisfactory statement, given that the decision to remove the children had in fact already been taken and, indeed, communicated to the parents.

She replies: <span style="font-style:italic">Qui statuit aliquid parte inaudita altera, aequum licet statuerit, haud aequus fuit</span> (He who decides something without hearing the other side, even if he makes a fair decision, has not himself been fair). </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Too often in public law proceedings both the level of disclosure and the extent of a parent&#8217;s involvement in the crucial phases of the out of court decision-making processes fall short not just of the well-established requirements of domestic law &#8230; but also of the standards which are now demanded by articles 6 and 8 of the Convention. The present case is in many ways an all too characteristic example of an all too frequent phenomenon. Not the least important of the many important messages which, as it seems to me, we all need to absorb from what Charles J has so clearly told us in <span style="font-style:italic">Re R </span>is the need for change in the prevailing culture &#8211; a culture of reluctant and all too often inadequate disclosure &#8230; The state, in the form of the local authority, assumes a heavy burden when it seeks to take a child into care. Part of that burden is the need, in the interests not merely of the parent but also of the child, for a transparent and transparently fair procedure at all stages of the process &#8211; by which I mean the process both in and out of court. If the watchword of the Family Division is indeed <span style="font-style:italic">openness</span> &#8211; and it is and must be &#8211; then documents must be made openly available and crucial meetings at which a family&#8217;s future is being decided must be conducted openly and with the parents, if they wish, either present or represented. Otherwise there is unacceptable scope for unfairness and injustice, not just to the parents but also to the children.&#8221;</p>

Social workers should at all times keep clear, accurate, full and balanced notes of all relevant conversations and meetings between themselves and/or with parents, other family members and others involved with the family. And where important meetings are held there should be a written agenda circulated in advance to all concerned. Clear, accurate, full and balanced minutes of the meeting (identifying in particular what information has been given to the meeting and by whom) should be taken by someone nominated for that task before the meeting begins. And, as soon as possible after the meeting, the minutes should be agreed by those present as being an accurate record of the meeting and then be immediately disclosed to all parties.</p>

I am quite content to accept for present purposes that this is so, but it does not meet the point. Article 8, as I have sought to emphasise, imposes both substantive and procedural requirements. The fact, if fact it be, that the circumstances are such as to justify intervention by the state, acting here in the guise of the local authority, does not absolve the state of its duty nonetheless to act fairly. It is not enough for the state to make a fair decision: the state must itself act fairly in the way in which it goes about arriving at its decision.</p>

I do not wish to be overly critical of the social worker D, who after all operates in a setting where it is for others to determine and maintain what that &#8216;culture&#8217; is to be. But D&#8217;s evidence illustrates perfectly &#8211; I suspect unwittingly but for that very reason all the more revealingly &#8211; just how pervasive that mindset is. In his affidavit he tells us that &#8220;following the decision being made by &#8230; Social Services on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September the decision was shared with [the parents]&#8221;. He also tells us that the parents had been &#8220;reassured that they would be consulted regarding the process of moving the [children] in to foster care ie, which day may be more appropriate, times, venues, etc&#8221;. He adds that the local authority &#8220;feels that since the decision to remove the children from home was made that every effort has been made to keep the family informed of progress and that the family have been able to talk about the concerns leading to the decision being made.&#8221; Precisely so. The local authority takes a decision and then it &#8220;shares&#8221; it with the parents. That, I am afraid, is not good enough: what it should have been doing was to involve the parents much more centrally in, and throughout, the process which led up to the decision being taken.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before leaving the case there are two final points I should make. The first is this. There may be occasions of emergency or extreme urgency when, for one reason or another, it is not possible for a local authority to involve parents as fully in the decision-making process as would normally be appropriate. Circumstances necessarily change cases. But I would expect such cases to be rare. Certainly the point did not arise in the present case. The letter dated 31 October 2002 demonstrates beyond contradiction that there was nothing in the circumstances of the present case remotely urgent enough as to justify any abbreviation of the procedures that article 8 would normally mandate in a case of this kind.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other matter is this. Parents who find themselves involved in cases such as this are often themselves vulnerable, sometimes very vulnerable: they may suffer from physical or mental disabilities or be educationally, economically or socially disadvantaged. They are often ill-equipped to cope with those whom they understandably see as &#8220;them&#8221;. The parents in the present case are both somewhat limited and largely illiterate. Mother functions within the mid part of the low average range (IQ 80-89) and has a reading age of about 7 years. Father functions within the mid to upper part of the borderline range (IQ 70-79) and also has a reading age of about 7 years. The evidence suggests that they had difficulty accepting and understanding the local authority&#8217;s reasons for concern and that the local authority had difficulty in getting them to understand the legal basis on which it was intervening. The local authority, I am sure, did its best. I mention the matter only to emphasise that article 8 imposes <span style="font-style:italic">positive </span>obligations on a local authority to ensure that parents are properly involved in the decision-making process. Part of that obligation, as I have indicated, is the obligation to ensure that the local authority&#8217;s decision-making process is properly documented and that there is proper and timely disclosure to parents of relevant documents. But in appropriate cases &#8211; and given the parents&#8217; limitations this is such a case &#8211; the local authority&#8217;s obligations will go further. Where for whatever reason &#8211; whether physical or mental disability, illiteracy or the fact that English is not their mother tongue &#8211; parents cannot readily understand the written word, the local authority <span style="font-style:italic">must</span> take whatever ameliorative steps are necessary to ensure that the parents are not for that reason prevented from playing a full and informed part in the decision-making process.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Before parting with this case one final comment is, I think, in order. This is not the first case, and I doubt it will be the last, to reveal the extent to which there are still on occasions more or less serious shortcomings in the decision-making processes in public law cases, shortcomings which on occasions deny parents the openness and fairness in procedure which articles 6 and 8 guarantee them. There are painful lessons to be learned by the various professions from Holman J&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>, from Charles J&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re R</span> and, I dare to think, from my own judgment in this case.&#8221;</p>
