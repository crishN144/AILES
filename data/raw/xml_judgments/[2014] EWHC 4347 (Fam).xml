C is a teenager. C has made sexual abuse allegations against three of the parties in this case.  She, in fact, is already the subject of a full care order made in July&#160;2013, but has more recently been rejoined as a party for the purposes of these proceedings. She is represented by her guardian, Ms King.</p>

There are also other findings sought to which I&#160;shall refer later.  All allegations are robustly denied by the father, mother, B and V.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in">Normally the task of the court in considering whether serious child abuse allegations are proved is one which is sadly but routinely undertaken across the jurisdiction each week of the year.  The fact that the evidence alone in this case has lasted 19 days, and that nine of the ten parties are represented by both leading and junior counsel, indicates that the instant task is not straightforward.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in">From a conventional beginning in front of HHJ Davies at the Luton&#160;County&#160;Court, the case has taken unprecedented twists and turns with the intervention of the Court of Appeal, a re-hearing in front of myself, and the collapse of that re-hearing after three days in the most dramatic manner.  This occurred when a key social worker in the case contacted me directly by email through the court office to allege &#8216;corruption and malpractice&#8217; within the local authority in relation to this particular case <span style="text-decoration-line:line-through"/> as well as other cases.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in">Following what was effectively a whistle-blower email sent to myself, the local authority sought to abandon the fact finding hearing and withdraw all allegations, saying that it could no longer rely on the key social worker as a witness of truth.  The local authority&#8217;s counsel, Mr.&#160;Bain, withdrew from the case for professional reasons.  Fresh counsel were then instructed; they withdrew the application by the local authority to abandon the proceedings, and thus these have continued ever since. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in">The proceedings have been surrounded by suspicion and mistrust, for reasons which have become obvious.  These emotions have been shared, it must be said, at times by the court, and have been exacerbated by serious problems about disclosure.  Despite strict orders made by the court for full disclosure by the local authority, these have not been complied with in full.  Indeed, more than 1,300 pages of important material were disclosed to the court during the current hearing, and 1,000 pages of these were disclosed only in the second week of this hearing, after Mr Geekie for the local authority organised a search of its premises following a social work assistant&#8217;s evidence.  This failure to disclose added some three days to the case. Disclosure continued even into the fourth week of this hearing.  Furthermore, many important documents have been shredded or are still missing. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in">According to the lead social worker there were six, not four, ABE interviews of the child, C, as contended by the police and the local authority. Indeed, there is even the suggestion that an alleged meeting on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2013, reported by social workers to have happened, may not have taken place at all.  The court therefore has the unenviable task &#8211; unparalleled in the history of this particular tribunal &#8211; of deciding how many ABE interviews there were, and whether one meeting ever occurred.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in">So much has gone wrong in this case. In fact, almost everything that could have gone wrong has, almost to the point of defying credulity. In consequence the court has no choice but to undertake the arduous task of scrutinising all aspects of the case very carefully.  This judgment will therefore be longer than would normally be the case. This is for several reasons:</p>

Matters not in dispute will be outlined in more detail.  Later, as part of its findings, the court will have perforce to assemble the full and accurate chronology.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in">The father has been employed in various capacities over the years.  He has a minor but undoubted learning difficulty.  Unfortunately he now suffers from poor health which has undoubtedly been exacerbated by these proceedings.  Over the years the mother has preferred traditional maternal duties caring for her children and one stepchild. The mother and father, neither of whom have any previous convictions, nor the advantages of education or riches, have brought up their children with little, and certainly no relevant, local authority intervention, at least until the end of 2012.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in">In May 2012 C self-harmed at school.  Then from September 2012, according to her teachers, she continued from time to time to self-harm at school. In addition she made increasingly frequent allegations that the father was being violent and threatening towards her at home, and that her older brother, S, was also threatening her.  She said that she was beating up her brother and wanted to kill herself. Eventually C was alleging that she had been beaten up at home virtually every day. She was also making alarmingly macabre drawings, and writing notes in which extreme unhappiness was expressed.  All this took place at school.</p>

She also wrote that she had hurt her siblings. She would also show, from time to time, signs of extreme reluctance to go home at the end of the school day.  Most regrettably, with one or two exceptions, the various teachers did not keep records of dates when C made allegations or when she self-harmed.  The school was satisfied that, despite allegations by C of repeated violence at home, they never saw any marks on her that could be attributable to any incidents in her home.</p>

The following day the school made a child protection referral to the local authority. This was an entirely appropriate course of action. A social worker spoke to C.  She also spoke to her parents and school staff, and then closed the case in early December, deciding to take no further action.</p>

According to SW, on this date, C alleged both physical and sexual abuse by her father.

Virtually everything that SW reports from this date, in respect of any allegations of violence or misbehaviour by the parents or other parties, is disputed.</p>

(She has remained with that carer ever since.)  The following day a bench at the Luton&#160;Family Proceedings&#160;Court made an interim care order (ICO) in respect of C.</p>

The local authority asked for the immediate removal of the children from their parents&#8217; care.  Wisely the court did not remove the children, nor granted the orders sought, but made Interim Supervision Orders on the basis that the father had agreed to leave the family home pro tem., and would have no unsupervised contact with the children.

Around the same time T was alternately retracting her allegations of sexual abuse to various persons and then reasserting them.  The local authority also reported that C was making further allegations of physical abuse by the father, the mother and her brothers.</p>

It is a delicate and difficult line to tread between taking action too soon and not taking it soon enough. [&#8230;]</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in">Counsel for the guardian for the younger children, in particular, asked copious questions about alleged improvements in those children since their removal into foster-care. I made it clear that I found these questions unhelpful. First, they were largely irrelevant to the fact-finding. Secondly, comparisons between the children&#8217;s presentation, when they would have been at their lowest ebb, following their removal from their home and months of anguish about their prospective removal, and the present, would not help the court in making the findings sought. Thirdly, it is undeniably the case that the children have been placed in households with more one-to-one attention and greater material benefits than those of their parents. Bearing in the words of Wilson LJ in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re L</span>, the court places little or no weight on this aspect of the evidence. Putting it bluntly, it is no part of the judicial process to remove children from the less affluent and place them with the more affluent.</p>

Three times he had told C to stop and then he smacked her and she apologised.   He did not accept HHJ Davis&#8217;s unappealed finding that smacking C on the bottom at 13 was abusive in the context of her age. The court noted that when counsel for the younger children was asking questions about neglect in relation to an allegation no longer pursued by the local authority and which I&#160;shall therefore not record, the father&#8217;s face lit up and he smiled with great and natural affection as he described how D loved to open the front door for visitors.

For example, the mother said that she did not accept that the father had physically abused C by smacking her on the bottom when she was 13.  She said, &#8220;I&#160;know he smacked her bottom, but this did not cause her emotional harm&#8221;.   She said that she still kept an open mind about the truth of the allegations, and she was prepared to end her marriage of many years if she was satisfied that the father had abused C. She went on, however, to make it quite clear that she did not have an open mind, and in fact disbelieved the allegations.  She also insisted that, although she accepted the finding of the court in this respect, she did not take D to the grandparents&#8217; home, as HHJ Davis found, an allegation which remains unappealed. In this respect the court is satisfied that she was being untruthful. Nonetheless, with these exceptions and others to which I shall refer later, she impressed the court as being - in general - an honest witness<span style="font-weight:bold">, </span>at least in comparison with some of the professionals for whom the court has heard.</p>

There would be disagreements with her brothers and sister about tidying up her room or doing the washing up, normal family issues.  She was always talking; they just could not keep her quiet, he said, save at family gatherings.  He described her as a &#8220;happy kid&#8221;, playing football and going out.  She was helpful, she was cheery, she liked to help me with the grass cutting and repairing the car.  She drew bright, happy pictures at home. When further questioned, however, he freely volunteered behaviours which were very worrying. He described how she could become angry and could have a go at the other children and punch walls at home.  She once kicked a wall so hard it made a hole and he had to buy plaster to fill it up.  </p>

They talked to her many times about the self-harming, but C always became angry, accusing the school of lying. Towards the end of 2012 A told him C was self-harming once more, and he believed this.

The family struggled to make ends meet. The children wanted things, but the family could not afford them. Despite this, even by the end of 2012 C was still bubbly and fine at home. There were, however, problems at school. The Mother had first been made aware of the self-harm in May 2012. There was no inkling of such behaviour before that. She received a call from the school and talked to C when she returned home. C denied self-harming and when she examined her she could find no marks on her body:  &#8220;She showed me her arms and there was not a single mark on them&#8221; she said.

She sat down with C but she would not show her mother her arms, so she kept an eye on her and checked her to see that she was not harming at home.  Then, just a short while before C was removed on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, a box belonging to C was found containing blades removed from pencil sharpeners, screw, nails, straightened paper clips and other materials which C had picked up around the school.  On that occasion the mother noticed there were scratches, though not deep ones, on &#8220;C&#8217;s arms.  She told her she must not do this.  She said she had been &#8216;worried sick&#8217; when she saw the box containing the sharp materials.  She locked the box away in the shed until she gave it to SW in December. Between October and December, 2012 C was not self-harming at home. she knew that the school was watching, &#8220;and I&#160;was watching&#8230;.To be honest I&#160;didn&#8217;t know where to go&#8221; she said.

Before the incident hearing she asked if she could give evidence behind screens so that she would not have to see the mother, the father, B and V.  This was not because any of them had ever threatened or intimidated her.  Indeed, she had met only the father out of the four, and in entirely amicable circumstances.  It was made clear by Mr Geekie for the local authority that she needed the screens because she herself had a troubled history including self-harm, and would find it very difficult to give evidence unless screened from these four people.  As the court wished to obtain the best evidence, it eventually acceded to this unusual request by the local authority. (In fairness to Miss G and other witnesses, the court can understand that giving evidence in a large court in the Royal Courts of Justice in front of a large number of persons must be a considerable ordeal.)</p>

According to Miss G, she told C that this was because of matters at home, including arguments between her mother and father, but never told the child she had been abused, let alone sexually abused, by her father.  If C said that, it would be untrue.  Then from 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2012 C began to make complaints about her family. The court looked at a note prepared by Miss&#160;Z and Miss&#160;G dated 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;September 2012.  This recorded that C was behaving badly at school.  She said that everything was getting on top of her and everyone was annoying her.  It said that C was threatening to &#8220;burn her back&#8221;.  Later C said, &#8220;I want to sort out anger, I&#160;not want anger, I&#160;want it out&#8221;.  When asked what made her angry she replied, &#8220;Family annoying, want to kill myself.

All in all she had hundreds of conversations with C, some, an unquantifiable number, about sexual abuse.  While she did send notes to her superiors at times, she stopped keeping records of the various conversations and that when she did this she could not remember.  Thus she did not keep notes of conversations when sexual abuse was discussed. Of the hundreds of conversations she had with C perhaps fewer than dozens were actually about being hit.  Curiously, in her oral evidence, she said C did not very often say that she had been hit at home which seems to contradict what Miss G is recorded as alleging elsewhere.  In particular, C never said that her mother had hit her, nor that her mother had a rolling pin, let alone hit her with it. </p>

They looked like scrapes, they were grazed and red but there was no actual blood.  This was the first time she had ever seen examples of self-harm on C. She reported this to Mrs.&#160;B, her superior, who said that she would monitor the situation.  On other occasions, whose dates she could not specify, Miss G saw marks on C.  These were always self-inflicted injuries she was sure.  Despite the child&#8217;s allegations she had never seen any bruises or marks of any sort attributable to any sort of violence in the family home.  Once she had seen C limping and holding her side but had not seen any marks.  Once C said she had a bruise on her knee from an injury caused at home, but Miss G had not seen such a bruise. Like many other pupils, C played sport and changed into her sportswear on occasions, giving opportunities for injuries to be noticed.  There was no suggestion that anyone at the school had ever reported any injuries that could be attributable to harm suffered at home.</p>

Miss G was worryingly imprecise about dates, although she recalled that when sexual abuse was first mentioned she wrote a note about it. After consideration she said that the first time she had written anything down about sexual allegations in connection with the child was recorded in a note, dated Thursday 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, 2013, which is documented in the court papers. This would place the first mention of sexual abuse by C to her as on that date.  (The court also notes that Miss G in her statement, when describing C in the spring and middle of 2012, said, &#8220;She did not, at this time, make any allegations of sexual abuse.)</p>

She too comes across as well-intentioned and honest, though somewhat naive and inexperienced. Although she does not display a very strong personality, she is palpably less vulnerable than her colleague. She, like Miss G, was very vague about dates. Both asserted that they made notes of events prior to December 2012, together with dates, and gave these to a senior staff member, and the court accepts this. Unfortunately, these notes have not, with a very few exceptions, been produced to the court. She first met C in September 2011.  C ended up being very closely bonded to both Miss G and Miss Z.  </p>

Nonetheless, C still wanted to talk to her very often, she would often come to see her repeatedly during the day asking to talk to her.  Miss Z would always agree to see her at the end of the school day.  She took notes of what C said at these various meetings.  Although altogether she said she had hundreds of conversations and meetings with C, it was the same for Miss G. Neither of them had never received training herself from social services or received any advice of what to do if a child started talking about worrying events in her life.  But she knew she had to listen and not ask leading questions and when making notes to put quotations in quotation marks.</p>

In fact, when giving evidence, while each parent made this bland assertion, each then readily accepted the various worrying behaviours that it witnessed.  The reality is that these parents, battered and bewildered by all that has happened during the past two years, are desperately clinging to the happy memories they have of C.  The court is satisfied that in that part of their evidence they were not deliberately lying in voicing their sepia-tinted memories of what C was like.  The court is satisfied that there were indeed happy times at home as well in 2012. Certainly, there is no evidence that her behaviour there was anything like as alarming as her behaviour at school; that is demonstrated by the fact that she does not seem to have been self-harming at home. </p>

It seems that, according to the school records before the court, the mother was telephoned once about the situation, Fiona Johnson spoke to the parents in November. There was also a conversation about when C was reluctant to go home.  Otherwise, there are no records that the school kept C's parents properly informed of how serious the situation was at school, nor about her alarming drawings and writings.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in;text-indent:0.12in">While all this was going on in C's life, at school she developed a very close relationship with two teachers, especially Miss G of whom the court is satisfied she was fixated.  C was told by Miss G that she herself had self-harmed and this was because of her father.  The court cannot be certain whether this conversation preceded C's self-harm or not but, on the balance of probabilities, the court is satisfied it came after the May self-harming and in response to that.  This conversation had a huge impact on the impressionable C. C found that, in contrast with life at home, at school she was now the centre of attention, particularly with Miss G and Miss Z.  By self-harming she was doing the same as the one she idolised.  By making allegations against her father, she was becoming even closer to her through what she considered to be shared experiences. The more she made allegations about life at home, the more attention and fuss the other teachers made of her.  She seems to have been speaking to her teachers up to three times a day and more.  She had, perhaps, for the first time in her life become, in her own eyes, someone of importance. In short, there was every incentive for her to make up allegations.</p>

This allowed C to comfort Miss G, to write poems to her to manipulate her teacher's emotions.  It was a very damaging relationship in the sense that there was a role reversal.  The pupil became the comforter of the teacher, not the other way round as it should have been.  This, too, gave C an enhanced status.  Miss G and the school should never have allowed this situation to occur.   </p>

It seems they became almost daily and increasingly dramatic. (It is regrettable that the teachers in the school do not seem to have kept precise records of all the dates, nor of precisely what was said on all occasions.  This was most lax of the school.)  I am also satisfied that C, with her intellectual limitations, did not foresee where her allegations of physical abuse were leading, namely, the formal involvement of the Local Authority.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>And of course, she could not have foreseen - indeed, no one could have, save perhaps for the Local Authority - the unique role SW was about to play. </p>

Marks made at home would surely have been there had her allegations of abuse at home been true.  Their absence shows that they were not. (In any event, the allegations of physical abuse have already been determined by the court by HHJ Davies in June of last year.  Those findings, looking at the Judgment, are limited to the father&#8217;s smacking C on her bottom when she was 13.  In the circumstances the court must, and does, proceed on that basis in relation to physical abuse, save of course in respect of fresh allegations.)  </p>

A matter which has caused the court considerable disquiet is the disclosure, very late in the proceedings, of C&#8217;s exercise book and two diaries.  Only on the second day of this hearing were the court and the parties provided with copies of these.  The entries run to 122 pages in all and contain drawings as well as written entries.  Most are by C but a few are by Miss Z and Miss G in response to entries written by the child.  The entries in the exercise book start on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, 2012 and conclude that year, well before the proceedings began. One or both of the diaries also commence in 2012. These diaries are very important. They were never kept secret. If it is correct that the Local Authority knew nothing of them at a time when, as is undisputed, its social workers were seeing the teachers on an almost daily basis, then it should have done. Its failure to do so is inexcusable. It is incomprehensible that lines of communication between professionals were so poor that no social worker knew of their existence.</p>

The newly disclosed materials reveal a far more complex situation, however, including expressions of dislike for her school. The first entries are 14 pages from the exercise book. These start with apologies for misbehaviour and anger at school, and requests for help with her anger.  Miss G and Miss Z responded kindly, more than once saying they will always be around to help her.  In the case of Miss G she would be around for a chat at lunchtime.  Later Miss G wrote of &#8216;sessions&#8217; with C <span style="text-decoration-line:line-through"/> to help her with her anger.</p>

There are further messages to her teachers saying she &#8216;hated her family so much&#8217; and she &#8216;hated everyone so much&#8217;.  She thanked her teachers and then said this, &#8220;Please would you go away now too&#8221; and that she wished she was dead.  The next messages are similar, but now C stated that she hated school too and no one cared about her.  It seems this message was meant for Miss G.  C said she was hurting herself because no one cared about her and everyone hated her.  She asked if Miss G could please help her.  Twice she said Miss G was like a big sister to her.  She wished she was not at school and did not want to go home.</p>

She had heard C say she hated school but then she said, when referring to all these conversations,  (again in a rather dismissive manner), &#8220;But C says lots of things typical of young people.  You have to place them in context&#8221;. C was often agitated.  One could see the anxiety on her face.  She would have taken the comments seriously, but her positive comments about school outweighed the negative comments.  She believed that by the end she understood C well enough, although not as well as if she had been a member of her own family.  C found it difficult to trust people, &#8220;I can&#8217;t trust no one&#8221; she had said, as well as similar things to CAMHS.  Therefore it took time for her to trust others.  If she liked people then she would engage more quickly and talk more freely.  She felt that C never fully engaged with her.  </span></p>

She was reminded that, according to Miss G, she had hundreds of conversations with C, some of which referred to sexual abuse or abuse allegations.  SW assumed that Miss G would have had the appropriate training about how to talk to children who had made allegations.  The school should have given her advice about this.

According to SW, it started at 12 noon and ended at 3:30 or 4 p.m.  (The note she wrote in her car afterwards was timed at 3:30 p.m.) During those 3&#189; hours she had left the room to contact the child abuse unit at Luton Borough Council and in particular Mr Graham Cole, the head of legal services there.  And of course a lot of time, she repeated, there was, silence.  As her evidence progressed, the court&#8217;s impression was that she trying to row back from her original time estimate. Eventually she said that the interview was perhaps &#8216;1&#189; hours, maybe shorter, maybe longer&#8217;.  C had been given the chance to leave the meeting several times. Once she did leave but returned of her own volition.  In this meeting it was difficult to understand what C said.  Miss Z would say what C had said and C would either nod or shake her head.  She soon realised that C hated to be asked to repeat what she had said. Neither she nor Miss Z took a note during the meeting, &#8220;It would be an abnormal thing for a social worker to take notes when interviewing a child other than during an ABE interview.&#8217;</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in;text-indent:0.12in">As for SW&#8217;s contention that C alleged sexual abuse to a total stranger on this occasion, this is plainly mistaken. The police note of the same date specifically records that no sexual abuse was alleged. The application for an Emergency Protection Order dated the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December and signed by the Local Authority&#8217;s Head of Legal services does not say that sexual abuse was actually alleged, only that C&#8217;s remarks &#8216;were suggestive of sexual abuse&#8217;. The notes made by SW after the conversation make no mention of sexual abuse. Her contention that a page of notes is missing, and that this page was before HHJ Davies in the earlier hearing, is simply ludicrous, for this would have meant that all counsel and solicitors, not to mention HHJ Davies, must have, unless through quite startling collective amnesia, willfully colluded in ignoring vital evidence during the hearing, and that the learned judge deliberately omitted mention of it in her judgment. It is also ludicrous to suppose that, when writing her notes in her car, SW wrote down relatively trivial allegations, but omitted to record the infinitely more serious accusation of sexual abuse. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in;text-indent:0.12in">The reality is that when one stands back and looks at what happened, one can see just how serious this situation was and is.  Based in part on, the Local Authority now sought and obtained the peremptory removal of C from her family on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>December 2012, and the following day sought and obtained an Interim Care Order. In each case the tribunal notes show that the decision was made, in part, on the basis that C had alleged sexual abuse. The removal of children from their parents, especially without notice, is one of the most draconian actions any court can take. It strikes right at the heart of basic human rights, on family life; it is frightening and traumatic for the children involved, and profoundly distressing for parents and other family. Sadly, the courts are required from time to time to sanction such removal, but only when safety and urgency requires it. In making such urgent orders, the courts must rely on the accuracy of Local Authority evidence. Whilst they cannot know whether any allegation is true or false, the courts are entitled to be told the truth by Local Authorities as to whether such an allegation has been made at all. The Family Court and the child-care justice system cannot function if Local Authorities do not tell the truth about this, for justice will inevitably be perverted. </p>

Others in the Local Authority must share responsibility, although, as I have said, on the evidence before it, the Court cannot and will not apportion this to particular individuals. The court freely acknowledges that all Local Authorities&#8217; resources are over-stretched, and that social-work professionals are often alarmingly over-worked and under time pressures. Nonetheless, there should have been proper, efficient supervision of SW. Furthermore, the application for an EPO did not record an actual allegation of sexual abuse, whilst an application of the same date for an ICO did. With proper supervision and scrutiny this discrepancy should surely have been picked up by senior professionals at Luton Borough Council.  </p>

Furthermore the court is satisfied that SW's method of dealing with C is more likely than not to have been that outlined in her note of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March: </p>

After talking together both had come to the conclusion that &#8216;it was definitely a possibility that C had been sexually abused&#8217;.  It was put to her that this was, in fact, their working assumption.  She replied that it was in their mind, but only as a possibility.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.8in;text-indent:0.12in">According to the foster carer, when C arrived she had no self-confidence and no self-esteem.  She was no good at meeting strangers.  At first she barely talked. She would go off and hide herself. She was angry with her teachers, saying that they should never have told anyone else, and that she did not need help from others.  From December 2012 until June or July, 2013 she said that she hated school.  At first she said this weekly or so, but less frequently as time went on.  In these early days she self-harmed &#8216;a lot&#8217;, as much as weekly, mainly after a bad day at school when she had quarreled with a fellow pupil.  She would harm herself by scratching with a paper clip or a blade from a pencil sharpener. This happened less and less now - since the beginning of this year only every few months. It occurred in June, 2014.  It had last happened only a fortnight before she came to give evidence, in early September, 2014. In January or February 2013 the foster-carer started finding excrement wrapped up in paper in C&#8217;s litter bin.  She did not mention this directly to C but she reported it to her fostering agency. In February or March 2013 C started attending CAMHS, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services every three or four weeks, and was much happier now.  </p>

She said that one of her brothers was threatening to beat her up, telling her to retract whatever she had said. </p>

Until the court receives this, it is impossible to come to any conclusions.

He duly met her there. She was accompanied by S. She told him that she had something to say to him. Prudently, the father declined to speak to her without his solicitor, so said that any conversation should take place at court. They duly went over to the court, where his solicitor was not yet present. Nonetheless, SW put him and S together on the small landing outside the court foyer. SW stood close by, either just inside or just outside the glass-panelled door of the stairwell. S then alleged to him that he had been abused by an uncle. He was shocked by the allegation, about which he knew nothing.</span></p>

The evidence of the local authority and the mother in respect of this day reveals what was plainly an unimaginably awful ordeal for the children.  The mother had returned from court just before the social workers arrived.  S had texted A with the news of the judge&#8217;s ruling that the children should be removed.  According to SW, A was angry saying that C would pay for this and she would, &#8220;Smash her face in&#8221;.  P was nodding at that.  The mother was saying that T was also lying and the father had done nothing.  D just looked dumbfounded, with a white face and dark circles under the eyes.  K was in the living room opening the door to cry out.  Also present was a family friend, who had been babysitting.</span></p>

In fact the removal went far more smoothly than she had hoped.  She said that the mother was &#8216;het up&#8217; and the children were indignant with arms crossed, but overall it was a smooth affair.  One thing which concerned her was that the mother told P that she was now in charge of D and no one else was to touch the child.</span></p>

At first all the children were upset but it only took a short time for them to turn around.  Within ten minutes of leaving the mother&#8217;s home they were asking lots of questions and were in a very normal, stable mood asking whether they would be attending the same school and would be going out or whether they would have a television in their room.  She then went on to say that P was vocal and upset however when they got to the foster carer&#8217;s P said, &#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to like it here&#8221;. I should note at this point that in view of the general unreliability of the social work evidence, the court cannot know whether this description of the children&#8217;s behaviour is accurate or truthful, or whether the younger children even knew that they were leaving their parents, at the very least, for a long time.</span></p>

On the evidence before me, I am satisfied that this document was typed much later. It is, quite simply, a false document.

She was asked by the Officer, &#8216;Everywhere? So&#8230; was it&#8230;whereabouts&#8230;at the front was it? Or whereabouts in the front?&#8217; C then said that it was &#8220;on the part for having babies&#8221;. She was then praised by the Officer, &#8220;Ok, that&#8217;s really good&#8221;. The leading questions about &#8216;the front&#8217; were also followed later by &#8220;breast&#8221; being mentioned by C. (Until then there had been no allegation of touching the breast.) </p>

Mr. Geekie says that this interview is probative of the sexual allegations against the father. Of course, the Court must always take seriously what is said by a child &#8211; or indeed any other vulnerable witness. C is entitled to that. The interview is of further importance in that it is the first occasion on which the Court can be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that C actually made sexual abuse allegations.</p>

C was very reluctant to go; it took 45 minutes just to get her out of the car when they arrived.  They arrived about 5:30 in the late afternoon.  They were put in a room and they did not get to see a doctor until midnight.  According to the hospital notes, &#8220;She is reported to be the victim of severe emotional, physical and sexual abuse with a family member&#8221;.  The foster carer said the information in that note did not come from herself; it could have come from CAMHS. C did not want to stay at the hospital.  The foster carer had known she would not as she was not comfortable with new places and with strangers.  Even before they set out to the hospital, she had thought it was not a good idea. In view of the strength of C&#8217;s opposition, the admissions doctor refused to admit her, and in the small hours of the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, the foster care took C home.</p>

The Court still has little idea as to why it was really thought necessary for C to be taken to the Hospital, to be left there as an inpatient if indeed she was, as the Court had been told by the Local Authority, thriving in foster care. True, she may have said she wanted to die, but she had been saying that or writing that sporadically for more than a year. What was the role of CAMHS? </p>

At the commencement of this hearing in September so far as the Court and all the parties were concerned there was no dispute that C had never been told of this. At directions hearings in 2014 C&#8217;s Guardian told the Court that she was unaware. Indeed, as I have noted, one of the reasons why the local authority decided not to call C to give evidence was that she was unaware of the appellate court&#8217;s decision and thus that the current proceedings concerned her in any way.</p>

Present was SWA &#8216;Y&#8217;, the foster carer and herself. When it was pointed out that there was no record in any note or narrative of this, she insisted she was sure that this had happened. The conversation had taken place shortly after the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, 2013. It was done lightly so as not to distress the child but even so C was exceptionally distressed when she was told. The meeting was at the foster carer&#8217;s home, &#8220;I strongly suggest it was there in the kitchen&#8221;. It was probably she, SW who told the child.  She then changed her evidence and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember C&#8217;s reactions&#8221;. <span style="text-transform:uppercase">A</span>fter telling C she did not set up any extra watch on her at the foster carer&#8217;s home, she said, nor did she tell the foster carer to be especially alert because there was an on-going watch by them on her in any event.

She did not recall whether she informed the school by telephone, email or letter but   said, &#8220;I definitely did inform them&#8221;.  She said she told CAMHS as well although CAMHS tends not to take notes.  She did not think she had told the general practitioner.

First, C embarked on her January interviews in the mistaken belief that, either her father had forgotten her birthday, or else he had not bothered to send her a card. Secondly, the local authority&#8217;s omission typifies the way it treated the father throughout.</p>

She and Miss&#160;Z were comforting her on that day, saying that no one was judging her.  C said she was very scared about telling things and had been told that she could talk to them if she wished to say anything. They took her to the library and asked what she wanted to say.  She then froze again and did not say anything for 15 minutes and then wrote down the word, &#8220;sex&#8221;.  The picture painted is as an extraordinary one: C sitting in the school library, the two doubtless expectant teachers in utter silence for 15 minutes.  15 minutes, the court notes is, a very long time, especially for a child and especially so in silence.  Astonishingly, Miss G then asked C, &#8220;Was it your dad who did this to you?&#8221; pointing, as she did so, to the word &#8216;sex&#8217;.  C then wrote down a second word, &#8216;Yes&#8217;. (The piece of paper with these two words is in the court papers.) Miss G asked this of the child because the father&#8217;s name had been mentioned before by others in relation to sexual abuse.  Also, &#8216;she had previously messaged me that her dad had touched her&#8217;. Miss G saw nothing wrong with the question nor considered it to be leading.  She had never been told not to ask questions, nor, if she did, what sort of questions should or should not be asked of a child alleging abuse.

C was nervous and scared about what was going on. We were comforting her and saying that no-one was judging her.&#8217; It is unclear to the court what the &#8216;guidance&#8217; was, but what is clear from Miss G&#8217;s evidence, which I accept, is that the two schoolteachers were in some rehearsing the child, who was in her turn very unhappy about the prospect of giving yet another interview.</p>

I&#160;explained to C that the body part name thing was not going to go away and that I&#160;could help her.  I&#160;asked if she wanted to do this and she said yes.

First, SW, together with SWA &#8216;Y&#8217; and Miss G, met C at the school.  C apparently said she wished to do her ABE interview that day.    When asked whether it was appropriate for her, SWA &#8216;Y&#8217; and Miss&#160;G to speak to C the day before an ABE interview, SW seemed reluctant to answer saying that she could not remember the context of the meeting. She generally made a number of excuses for its taking place. According to Miss G, when questioned by SW or herself, C gave slang names for various body parts including,  &#8220;The place where babies come from&#8221;. Although Miss G, at one stage, asserted that at this interview C was not questioned about the allegations, she later said that the group had indeed talked to her about her father and the allegations of hitting and touching.  Despite this, no one at this interview took any notes of what happened or what was said during the meeting. Miss G seemed utterly oblivious to any possible concerns about a vulnerable child with learning difficulties meeting with four people, three of whom with powerful personalities, and another of whom was a teaching assistant with whom she had a fixation.</p>

SW and SWA &#8216;Y&#8217; were there again but not Miss G this time.  She said she was not asked to attend and she said she could not think why another meeting would have been needed to get names for body parts as C had already given these.  Miss G said that she had never been made aware that the child had also been shown dolls and pictures on a previous occasion.  The court also notes that at this point, namely January 2014, one of the foster carer&#8217;s notes records that C knew the slang for the body parts.  </p>

She said the Local Authority felt it was not right to do more ABE interviews but the Court itself pressurised for an ABE interview. She then retracted this last assertion. (I make it clear that never at any stage has this tribunal, which only became seized of the case after January ABE interviews, ever advised the Local Authority to arrange an ABE interview. Further there is nothing anywhere to suggest that HHJ Davies so advised).</p>

She then went on the blame the court again, &#8220;The fact is that it didn&#8217;t suit the court that we didn&#8217;t have an ABE interview.

The purpose of the CAMHS, she said, was for a counsellor to speak to C to give her a non-pressured opportunity to talk freely about things. Interestingly, a note from CAMHS reads &#8220;Our views on the allegations of abuse? Cannot comment.  C has never spoken of it, aware of something bad in her head&#8221;. SW claimed to be aware by the time the January interviews took place that C had in fact been using her own words for body parts. Instantly she blamed the Court.  The first she knew about that was in Court today. If the Court was holding this information back she would want to know why.</p>

She had been asked to attend the interviews as a witness supporter and to be able to say to the child &#8216;that she was doing well&#8217;.

She was not aware of being telephoned about this by SWA &#8216;Y&#8217;.  She would never have said that dolls could be used prior and during ABE interviews.  Indeed in January when she carried out the ABE interviews she was not aware that dolls and pictures had ever been used with C.

She was asked how she had typed these notes.  She said she would &#8216;audibly&#8217; type notes on the local authority&#8217;s Care First system and sometimes this would go down and so she would type the notes on a standard word document format and transfer them later onto the system.  Many times she was asked by the local authority to type up her documents on her own computer.  She complained about being required to do this by the local authority to their legal department.  When she did type documents at home, she never saved them. She would scan them and then ask someone else to scan them into the system back in the office.  She would have expected all the loose pages found by her to be on the local authority&#8217;s Care First system.  She typed up the notes of every substantial meeting with C and would expect them all to be on the system.  She did not know why these notes were not on the system.  </p>

She explained that the question marks were because the social workers were not sure whether C wanted to go through with the interviews.  She still believed that C had done five ABE interviews in January, and six in all if the October ABE interview was counted, for that was what her records showed.  She said, &#8220;My memory was that it went on for several days in January&#8230; I&#160;am &#8216;sure&#8217; it was six interviews in all&#8221;.  For the avoidance of doubt, there were no times when they took C to a police station and an interview did not take place.  </p>

She then changed her evidence, something she did very frequently whenever she was in the witness box, saying that there had been, in fact, one attempted ABE interview that week in January and one aborted ABE interview.

The evidence of the police officers, SWA &#8216;Y&#8217; and Miss G collectively suggest that were but three. SW believes there were five. I prefer their collective memory. Accordingly I find that there were four ABE interviews only. </p>

It seems there was a fault with the recording machine.  This is highly unsatisfactory, for the court is left wholly unable to see and hear the child at the beginning of the interview, nor to understand precisely how the interview began.  All we have are some brief officer&#8217;s notes of what took place.  According to the notes the interview started at 9:32.  There were no notes of any introductory talks, or a chat soliciting what the child knew about truth and lies or any such preliminary matters.  The notes read as follows:</p>

According to the notes, C was on the floor doing maths homework. She was wearing pyjamas.  The father penetrated her &#8216;where babies came from&#8217;.  It lasted two hours.  She knew it lasted two hours because she did maths homework at about 4 p.m. and she had a watch.  She looked at it when the rape finished and saw that it was two hours later.  The rape occupied the whole of the two hours. The officer asked, &#8220;Did sperm come out on that day?&#8221;  There was no answer.  The child then said that she had told no one about the incident afterwards. </p>

From now on the court has had the benefit of a video recording and a transcript. The value however of the recording was, at times, reduced by the child&#8217;s face being obscured by a screen within the screen.  It is hoped that officers conducting ABE interviews do ensure that the child&#8217;s face is not obscured for all or part of any interview.  It is very important that those watching can see the child&#8217;s face; that, after all, is the whole point of a video recording.</p>

She was also upset on another occasion when she was 7 years old.  She was in B&#8217;s room playing on the X-Box or PlayStation.  Her father came in and sat on the bottom bunk bed for an hour.  He started beating her up.  The father then hit her with flip-flops which were like hard slippers.  This left marks on her arm and chest.  He always left marks on her. </p>

In response to this she was told by the interviewer, &#8220;You&#8217;ve done well so far&#8221; and told that she was special.  In relation to B the social worker said this, &#8220;It&#8217;s important we know what he&#8217;s done as it isn&#8217;t right&#8221;.  She then went on to tell C that the people in the room next door, for example her teacher (although she did not mention any names), loved her.  She said: &#8220;You&#8217;ve started to come out on the other side.  You&#8217;re getting there and you&#8217;ll get stronger&#8221;.</p>

Secondly, she said it was because she had threatened to tell the police. The B allegation was elicited after the following questions were put to C by the interviewer:</p>

PO then reminded the child about their previous talk when they had talked about what happened when she was 6.  She was unhappy, she was reluctant to talk.  She was silent on many occasions and there were long pauses.  She was squirming around on the sofa, occasionally leaning right back or to one side.

According to her, C was the most difficult interviewee she had ever come across.  She knew that C was having therapy at CAMHS and that if a child is having therapy the police had to be very, very careful about their interviewing.  She was also aware that C had learning difficulties and it was the duty of the police to consider using an intermediary in the interview process.  She said that PO had made enquiries about using an intermediary.  She did not know what the child&#8217;s verbal IQ was nor that it was as low as 59 which, she agreed, was very low.  </p>

The court must be cautious not to confuse spontaneous remarks made by a child or short informal chats with formal questioning.  Nonetheless, doing its best, the court is satisfied that the child has had no fewer than 33 interviews about abuse with one or other social worker between 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2012 and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2014.   By "interviews" I mean either formal interviews or detailed question and answer discussions which went beyond the odd throwaway mark, or the odd question and reply.  In addition, there appear to have been five similar discussions of a detailed nature with school teachers, seven with a foster carer and, of course, with Dr. van Rooyen and one with PO.   On top of this, there were four ABE interviews.  This makes, if the court's mathematics is correct, an alarming total of 51.  12 of them were conducted wholly by untrained interlocutors in the form of the foster carer and the school teachers, and the rest were professionals whose ability to follow guidelines seems to have been non-existent.  In addition, there can be no doubt that there were many, many other informal unreported conversations at school, in the foster home and when social workers brought C to and from school, which happened &#8216;99 per cent of the time&#8217;.</p>

As professionals working in the field of childcare, they should have intervened to stop the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January interviews.

All the professionals seemed to have operated on the false premise that what was said outside the interview room did not count.</p>

This seems unbelievable, not least in view of the fact that as SWA &#8216;Y&#8217; told the court, pregnancies and related topics had clearly been discussed with C and among professionals on several occasions after the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>.

It was put to her that the allegations were either very serious or very ludicrous to which she replied, &#8220;I agree.  It needs investigating&#8221;. She accepted that it would have been reasonable to keep a note of such important allegations but then qualified this by saying, &#8220;But this wasn&#8217;t said in an ABE interview&#8221;.  Then she contradicted what she said at the start of her evidence, namely, that ABE interviews lasted between the arrival of the child at the police station and the child&#8217;s departure from the police station, by saying she would not have made a note of this allegation about babies as it was a private discussion. She was not sure whether that was a conscious decision by the police or the local authority to take the matter of the pregnancies no further.  She had no knowledge of such discussions.  She agreed that the issues of the pregnancies seemed to have disappeared into the ether.</p>

Their names were Jack and Rose. She had also been given the morning-after pill. We do not know precisely what C said because the note-taking was hopelessly inadequate. The allegations were and have been taken seriously, for allegations that C conceived twice were added to the schedule of findings to be sought during the currency of the present hearing.

They simply could not be true. They did not fit in with C&#8217;s medical records or the age when she attained puberty. </p>

In relation to this aspect of her allegation, the court must have regard for the inherent improbability of V&#8217;s raping the child on a blow-up bed where one of the adults could have woken at any time.

She did not tell the mother, but S saw texts sent by the father saying how much he had always liked her and things like that.  The father was saying that she had been flirting with him and had tried to kiss him.  The mother was confused and did not know which of the two family members to believe.  The court makes it clear at this stage that it is insufficient evidence to determine who flirted with whom, if at all, at the time of this incident.

This conversation took place in December 2012.  The court is satisfied the mother was lying when she denied that such a conversation had ever taken place. But the court is not satisfied, having heard the mother&#8217;s sister's evidence, that touching between the legs was actually mentioned during this conversation.  It may well have been heard later by her, and then interpolated innocently into her recollections.

I&#160;have deliberately described some detail about her allegations for, despite the nature of them, T was clearly not distressed at all when she recalled what one would have expected to be very painful memories.  Indeed, she was very relaxed both in posture and delivery as she described the abuse she said she had suffered.  She was extremely, indeed, unusually fluent with virtually no pauses.  In particular, she answered questions involving precise detail about the abuse without even pausing to think.  She said she recalled how when she was 11 or 12 her father had commented that she was now becoming a woman and that he wanted to measure her breasts.  She even recalled what the father was wearing at the time and what films she had just seen.  On one occasion when he abused her it was, &#8220;The Parent Trap&#8221; at the ABC cinema in Luton.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">Taken in isolation, the evidence of abuse given by T on the three occasions detailed above is generally, though not wholly, consistent, and must be considered very seriously. But of course, it cannot be viewed in isolation, either from other evidence directly relating to her, or more generally. In particular, it must be viewed in the light of the genesis of the allegations and the many retractions T has subsequently made.</p>

December 2012. She was being interviewed by Mrs Goody, a social worker investigating the care of T&#8217;s own children. At the end of the meeting she asked if she had been abused as a child. T nodded.  When asked whether this was emotional, physical or sexual, T said nothing.  According to Miss Goody, there was some talk about the fact that T was not seeing her parents at the time. Mrs.&#160;Goody could not recall whether she herself asked whether it was because of the abuse that T did not see her parents or whether T had volunteered it. </p>

This was her first meeting with her, although she had seen her before on one occasion at the beginning of January, when C and T had contact with each other.  According to SW, just as had happened with C, T immediately opened up to her.  SW&#8217;s record of the meeting is as follows:</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;I noted that when I&#160;was reading her own file/notes that she had told a worker that she was abused as a child.  She said, yes, she had, and that her stepfather, confirmed as F had sexually abused her.  She told her mum who did not believe her and who then sent her off to live with Aunty B who did not believe her either until she caught it happening.  T said this is why she does not get on well with mum and dad and why she won&#8217;t leave her children with them.  T did not think he had sexually abused other family members but noted that she was now thinking maybe C had also been (she does not know why C was accommodated).  T is willing to give a statement to the police but would like me to be there.  She later said over the weekend that she is frightened of the family taking revenge and would like to be moved.&#8221;</p>

She was particularly adamant that on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;February&#160;2013 she had never mentioned sexual abuse by the father.  They had not really talked about this at all. Furthermore, she had never told SW that she had reported the abuse to her mother.  &#8220;This was wrong!&#8221; Nor had she ever said that her mother had sent her off to live with her Aunt B, because of the abuse, nor was SW&#8217;s note accurate when it recorded that T had said that Aunt B had not believed her until she caught it out actually happening. &#8220;I did not say these things&#8221;.</p>

The reason she did not get on with her parents was, &#8220;because they always have a go at me&#8217;. She clarified this by explaining that her parents had not approved of her sleeping with a boyfriend from school. When she had left home she did it not because she was forced to and because she wanted to.  Furthermore, she had, indeed, left her children in the mother and father&#8217;s care on many occasions. Indeed, she had not had a conversation with SW about her own children at all.  </p>

Furthermore, the notes of the interview were very, very short.  SW said that a lot of the interview was silence.  When it was suggested that C clearly did not want to talk at this interview, she said that she could not remember.  As for C&#8217;s request to go home, SW was dismissive about this.  C fairly frequently said she wanted to go home.  (The court notes that this flatly contradicted other assertions by her that she had only asked once or twice to go home.) There were also silences at CAMHS.  Once at CAMHS, C had also said that she wanted to go home but &#8220;They talked it through&#8221;.  (What is meant by that much repeated phrase the court is unaware.) As for the length of the interview, some three hours, far from being criticised for it SW said she should be praised for taking up so much of her time to deal with C.  She was working in her own time, even working at nights. </p>

She then went on to say, &#8220;This was not a pre-ABE interview or an ABE interview&#8221;.  (The inference the court draws from this is that, in the mind of SW, in a non-ABE setting the guidelines about questioning vulnerable witnesses do not apply.)

This letter, the contents of which have already been laid out, states that her father did nothing to her and SW was trying to intimidate her and manipulate her into making allegations against him.  T read aloud slowly but accurately the first part of the letter in court. She said that the handwriting in the body of the letter was that of S, whilst the signature and date were hers. She said she did not read the letter before signing it.  Her brother, S, had told her that it was to do with the case and she should sign it.  She did not even know what the word &#8220;manipulation&#8221; meant but she knew what intimidation meant.  The contents of this letter were not true.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">She was questioned about a telephone call by the mother to social services.  This is recorded by the local authority as being received on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, 2013, a day before the first alleged retraction letter was received.  In this call the mother said that T had just rung her to say that she was being made to make a statement about dad that was not true.  In the oral evidence T denied making such a call; she had no phone credit at the time and had never told her mother any such thing.  She had no idea how the mother knew that she was about to say something as she had not spoken to her.  Maybe the information had come through a cousin, to whom she had spoken about the case.</p>

T seemed evasive as she answered this question, and after a little pause she said she could not remember saying this, as she had a lot of things going on at the time.  It was pointed out to her that only a week before, on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2013 she had told another General&#160;Practitioner that she had been abused both sexually and emotionally by the father.  This GP had noted that she was very distressed when she said this.  She was asked to explain the difference between the two reports to two General Practitioners.  She said she found it easier to admit the sexual abuse to a female doctor, and much more difficult to a male doctor.  On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July the doctor was male.  It was pointed out to her that on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June when she had alleged sexual abuse the GP had in fact been a male, and on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July when she had retracted the allegations the GP had been a woman, on Dr. Joanne Campbell T then changed tack, saying that she had retracted because, her ex-partner, was there and she did not want him to hear the allegations and judge her.  She had asked him to come with her as a &#8220;support&#8221;.  (The court notes that there is copious evidence elsewhere that he knew about the allegation). </p>

In reference to another part of the conversation, T confirmed that C had indeed told her that one of her teachers had said she herself had been sexually abused.  She went on it for about 30 or 45 minutes, so much so that she, T, had tried to change the subject.  She eventually told C to tell their mother as she felt the teacher should have been protecting the children from this sort of thing not exposing them to it.</p>

In fact, so frequent were the texts that on the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2013 she texted her to engage his help in getting S and L, to delete her number from their mobile telephones. L&#8217;s texts were particularly abusive.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">The court must be cautious when weighing the force of retractions. It is not uncommon for genuine victims to retract. There may be many, understandable, motives for this. Fear of reprisals and pressure by others are common examples. And in the case of T, the court is amply satisfied that some family members were putting pressure on T to retract, though not the parents. <span style="text-decoration-line:line-through"/>Some of the pressure may indeed have contained threats. But just as the court must be wary of relying too heavily on retractions, so it must be cautious not to reject them out of hand merely because of pressure to retract. Retractions can be genuine even when they co-exist with pressure. Here we have so many retractions, all made at different times to different people - doctors, social workers, the police, a solicitor, friends and relations. Furthermore the court cannot forget that while T was being pressured to retract, she was undoubtedly being subjected to counter-pressures by SW to make allegations.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">For the avoidance of doubt, the court is satisfied that the two retraction letters reflected T&#8217;s true sentiments. Nothing sinister can be read into the fact that the letters were each written by another. T has learning difficulties. As for the other reasons given by T   in her oral evidence namely, that she was reluctant to speak openly to males, that her phone was hacked into, possibly by her husband, that she was reluctant to speak in his presence, these are wholly unconvincing. I am afraid that T was being very untruthful in this respect. The reality is that there were just too many retractions made by T to ignore. The court also takes into account the fact that T   has continued to see her parents since the accusations were made, and sought their help from time to time.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">These allegations cannot be viewed in isolation from the evidence relating to C. The court cannot compartmentalise, but must look at the evidence as a whole the court cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the father sexually abused T. In coming to this finding the court does not ignore T&#8217;s   ABE, statement and oral evidence that abuse did occur. The court considers this most carefully, but it is out-weighed by the other factors. In addition to those recorded, the note takes into account two matters which seems inherently improbable. If the allegations were true, then the father must have abused T in a room where others slept &#8211; an act of considerable recklessness. Furthermore, C would have been only four or five years old at the oldest when the abuse occurred.  There must at the very least be some cogent doubt as to whether with her learning difficulties, she would have had a real memory, and in such detail, of what happened when she was so very young. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">Nor should it be forgotten that, sadly, T is herself very vulnerable. She bombarded T with texts and telephone calls, and put her under enormous pressure to make and in due course maintain the allegations. Just one example of this is text from SW telling her to stop being in denial. This did come from her, and was a shockingly unprofessional message to send. T undoubtedly believed that by making the allegations, she would retain the support of a powerful social worker who would support her. She must have been desperate, torn between pressure from her family to tell the truth and from SW to lie.  And so she hovered uncertainly between the two, retracting and reiterating allegations repeatedly. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">T, with her learning difficulties, may even have come to have a false memory of her father. After all, for two years now she has lived in an environment where all the social workers and other professionals believed that she had been abused. And the impact on her of learning that the court itself in 2013 found that she had been abused must have been enormous.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">Counsel for the younger children asked T a large number of questions about a number of alleged incidents of violence by the father against T and S.  In view of the need for complete transparency in this case, I&#160;permitted the Guardian&#8217;s counsel at first to pursue this line of questioning being uncertain as to where it was leading.  I&#160;am now wholly satisfied, however, that this was leading to no destination which is relevant to the findings of fact which I&#160;am asked to determine during the incident proceedings.  HHJ Davies has made findings about abuse involving violence and they are limited findings.  They were not set aside by the Court of Appeal. No party has asked for them to be revisited.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">The court is concerned with the allegations on the composite Scott Schedule before me and they do not include any allegations of violence, save for one fresh allegation that the mother hit C with a rolling pin.  Exceptionally, I&#160;permitted this to be added to the matters remitted by the Court of Appeal for fresh determination because the allegation was a new one and had not been before HHJ Davies in June 2013.  That is the only allegation of violence I&#160;shall consider during the present hearing.  The only answer of relevance from T which resulted from questioning by the Guardian was that the mother would hit A and C on the back of the leg with a wooden spoon. Taking that into account, together with all the other evidence, I am wholly satisfied that the mother did not hit C with a rolling&#8211;pin.</p>

That allegation has been determined.  In any event, the current allegation seems to the court worryingly vague.   It is not alleged, for example, that the parents have put the children in potential danger by leaving them unattended with either uncle or grandfather.  They do not seem to be criticised for doing any particular act at all, but rather for their state of mind.  They are criticised because they do not, in reality, have open minds about these two individuals, because they point out that the allegations against them have yet to be proved, because they believe that one is innocent until proved guilty.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0.08in">The problem is that the allegations are, and I repeat, so hopelessly imprecise.  The court has no idea whether the allegations against the two other family members are true or entirely fanciful, whether they indeed pose a threat to children, or whether they do not.  The court does not know whether the parents are justified in their doubts about the allegations against grandfather and uncle - no idea whatsoever. Certainly the parents will be entitled to have doubts about any allegations in whose making SW had a role.  Equally, a wise, careful and prudent parent would not expose their children to any relation against whom allegations of sexual abuse were made.   Had the parents done anything to expose their children to risk, then the court would have little difficulty in finding this particular allegation is proved.  As it is, in the absence of any suggestion that the parents have failed to protect their children by any action or inaction, the court cannot make this finding.</p>

Yet the cost to the public purse in one form or another will be immense. There has been a significant disruption of court lists, with other cases being delayed. Family justice cannot perform the vital task it does in protecting children without honesty, objectivity, transparency and fairness. I thus hope that no court ever again has to see and hear what this court has seen and heard during the past weeks.</p>
