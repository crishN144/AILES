The guardian had been called upon to produce a report in a very short timeframe and had helpfully done so in the context of this hearing being used to reach final decisions.  She had reached the view in that context that she could not support GA&#8217;s applications and so urged their dismissal.  In light of the discussions between the bench and the bar, however, while not resiling from her &#8216;final&#8217; recommendations, she inclined to the view that this hearing should be used simply to regulate the interim position to pertain until the case could be heard to conclusion in the light of a rather more precise picture of the possibly various realistic options for BH.</span></p>

Given that there is a final care order in favour of the local authority, my power to prevent removal could, as a matter of law, derive from one of only two sources: either the power flowing from the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>&#8217;) to make an order which had the effect of discharging the care order or the power to injunct the local authority from an act which would constitute an unlawful breach of a person&#8217;s human rights.  Given that the former course would, in the context of the outstanding and incomplete assessments, clearly be premature, it was GA&#8217;s application for an injunction preventing removal on which the hearing focussed.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">As to the length of the period in contemplation, I was told by the local authority that, while PGM had been approved on a temporary basis pursuant to Regulation 24 (as above), it would be a considerable time before either a special guardianship assessment or a full kinship care assessment could be completed.  Only four weeks were needed for the principal social work element of this; this is perhaps not surprising given how much work had already been done as part of the original full assessment and then the Regulation 24 assessment.  The necessary information from the General Practitioner, which can often slow the process significantly, would take only between five and seven days in this particular case.  The difficulty was caused by the necessity of obtaining full checks from the Disclosure and Barring Service which, I was told, routinely take up to and often more than 12 weeks to process.  Rather unsatisfactorily, an application for such checks had not been made in December, for example on or shortly after the 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> December family meeting at which PGM had emerged as the frontrunner.  Accordingly, and while the case will be reviewed in a few weeks, in the hope that quicker progress can in fact be made, the assessment may take up to four months from the point at which the application is made for DBS checks, with the consequence that it is an &#8216;interim&#8217; period of potentially as long as five months which I am here considering.</span></p>

Further, she acknowledged that GA has cooperated with the drug and alcohol testing asked of her thus far.  SW&#8217;s concerns &#8211; necessarily distilled somewhat for the purpose of this judgment &#8211; were first that the entire picture may not be known, second that there is a nebulous but nonetheless real range of other risks and dangers which attach to even occasional and social emersion in drug culture and third that a jaded, exhausted carer the morning after such a night out is scarcely likely to be appropriately attentive and engaging.

It quickly emerged, in the face of well targeted questions from Miss Best on GA&#8217;s behalf, that the two notions are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  It is correct that GA, for various reasons, received very little support in the early part of the placement and validly regretted the inability to have a few hours to herself to sit down with a coffee or to do her shopping; it is also correct that she had (roughly) fortnightly nights out; on the local authority&#8217;s own evidence, she complained of the former but not the latter.

When first confronted with the allegations which had been made by a family member, GA denied them.  Faced with some limited evidence, she made equally limited admissions in relation to cocaine use.  It was not until shown the testing results that she admitted the truth of what was contained in them (in fact, rather more).  SW accepted that it is entirely predictable that an adult, especially one with as much to lose as did GA, would initially deny and then understate wrongdoing as significant as drug-taking. </span></p>

Contemplating the question instead of an interim placement pending final hearing, Ms Horner favoured BH remaining with her great aunt, while still the subject of a care order.  Given the secure attachment, in the event of continued abstinence and a demonstrated ability to work with professionals, she did not rule out the prospect of the final balance tipping towards BH remaining in the long-term in her great aunt&#8217;s care.  In order to ensure BH&#8217;s safety in the interim period, Ms Horner recommended a very clear and prescriptive written agreement regulating exactly who was allowed to be in BH&#8217;s presence and providing her with care, in what circumstances and at what times.  Ms Horner was particularly worried, given the fact that assessments are not complete, at the notion of moving BH now and it later transpiring that this would be the first of a number of placement moves.</span></p>

Regular drug testing, continuation of prevention courses already begun, engagement with local services and enhanced monitoring of the placement of the child&#8217;s welfare would, she argued, provide a safe interim position, and, as such, a proportionate response.</span></p>

Highlighting differences between the current case and the facts underlying some of the established case-law, she pointed out that this is not a case in which removal from a parent or a person holding parental responsibility is envisaged, that this is not a proposed placement outside the family and that the new carer is someone already known to the child; further, that the plan envisages significant ongoing contact between GA and BH, at least in the interim.  The adequacy of the proposed interim protective measures, she argued, must be assessed in the light of admitted dishonesty on GA&#8217;s part and prolonged concealment by her of certain worrying aspects of her lifestyle.</span></p>

Perhaps more importantly, I can see no reason to treat a subject child differently depending simply on (a) whether the carer to whom s/he is securely attached (and with whom s/he undoubtedly has a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;close personal relationship&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;sufficient constancy and substance&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> to warrant protection under ECHR) is a birth parent or some other family member, or (b) whether the application ultimately for adjudication is for the discharge of the care order directly (an application a parent is entitled to make) or its discharge indirectly (by virtue, for example, of a successful application, with leave, for a child arrangements order, as a non-holder of parental responsibility is required instead to make).  It seems to me that, whether or not there is separately a requirement that a local authority justify its proposed action by reference to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33(4)</ref>, the removal of a child from a longstanding family carer is virtually certain to engage the Article 8 rights of both child and carer.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Considering the local authority&#8217;s evidence and arguments, it is wholly understandable that it should harbour real concerns in relation to the possibility of further drug use and a scepticism as to whether GA would voluntarily give up information which might tend to cast her in a bad light.  In passing, I should say that I was not especially impressed with the suggestion that a reluctance voluntarily, and when taken by surprise, to own up to drug use and that a tendency to make admissions which underplayed the true extent of such use, represented evidence of a more deep-seated tendency towards dishonesty with social services.  Nor was I much taken with the evidence - or that portion of the available evidence which was made available to and aired before me - of a lack of co-operation or refusal to abide by important pre-agreed rules in relation to association with other adults and choice and use of babysitters.  It may be that I hear rather more about these or other matters at the final hearing.</span></p>

I did not discern any duplicity in either her expression of shame and regret or her assurances that she will not contemplate any behaviour which could put the placement at risk pending final hearing.  My fuller assessment of GA and of her long-term suitability to provide a home to BH which meets her welfare needs will be undertaken at a later date.</span></p>

I formed my own view - which, incidentally accorded entirely with the social worker&#8217;s concession when pushed on the issue - that, subject to a carefully constructed interim written agreement which is diligently enforced by the local authority, BH will not be at any significant risk of harm in the few months leading up to the final hearing.</span></p>

There will be both pre-agreed and unannounced visits to the home at various different times.</span></p>

In those circumstances, removal cannot be proportionate, regardless of the facts that BH would be placed with a carer with whom she is familiar and that she would have ongoing face-to-face contact with GA.</span></p>
