Sadly, as will be apparent from this judgment, given the depth and complexity of the issues, and the polarisation of views within the family, the case has transformed from a dispute about contact to a more generalised battle in which the essential emotional well-being of the children is now, in my judgment, in peril.</p>

At that hearing I directed that Dr. Berelowitz should prepare a further report, seeing the parties (but not the children) if he considered that this would be helpful. He did consider it would be helpful for the purposes of an addendum, and accordingly appointments were set up.  In the event, M1 did not see Dr. Berelowitz. </p>

If the intention of her narrative was to demonstrate or explain that B had a genuine resistance to contact, then she has failed in that endeavour; M2&#8217;s narrative simply succeeds in re-inforcing the evidence of disorder of relationships and the distorted thinking in the women&#8217;s home. </p>

In June 2013, M2 unilaterally arranged DNA testing of the children; she sought to justify this by explaining that A was questioning the fact that she believed that she and B did not look alike. M2 sent off the samples.  When the results of the testing returned, they appeared to show a &gt;90% likelihood that the girls were not full siblings.  M2 then told M1 what she had done.  This was then raised with F1 and F2 (see below).  As discussed below, this was then brought to my attention at the pre-trial review.  I then ordered further testing involving the adults.</p>

Moreover, quite apart from the impact the results may have on the outcome of these cross-applications, I was conscious of the importance of clarity for A and B, a substantial question now having been posed (by M2 or otherwise) about their paternity (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re T (Paternity: Ordering Blood tests)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 1190" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 1190</ref>).

If that was not her main hope, she certainly sought in my view to stymie the forthcoming final hearing, intending that the hearing would have to be adjourned for several weeks to await the results.  This was a course specifically proposed by the women in their position statement for the hearing (although sensibly not pursued by Mr Storey in submissions); they originally suggested that the DNA results would not be available for 2-3 weeks. Given the imminent vacation, they may have hoped that the hearing would have had to be put back by months.</p>

Once friends, and collaborators in this wonderful endeavour of creating a family, it appeared to me that they have become to some extent strangers, harbouring strong feelings of mutual mistrust, and reciprocal aversion.

Like Hedley J, I do attach the greater blame for this problem with the women; unlike him, I do believe that the greater proportion of responsibility lies not simply in the fact that the children spend more time with the women, but with the fact that it is in their home (not in the men&#8217;s home) that the hostile attitudes have taken seat.

This factor links in with my assessment of the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">harm which [they are] suffering or [are] at risk of suffering</span>&#8221;.  This, in my judgment, is very real, and is discussed more fully above.  As acknowledged by Dr. Berelowitz, there is no solution currently available that does not involve significant loss for the children.  Although that is my finding, I recognise that M2 and M1 will not perceive the children having no further contact with F1 and F2 as involving any degree of &#8216;loss&#8217; to the children.  If I am correct about that, and as Dr. Berelowitz observed in the hearing, it would be very hard for the women to help the children cope with a loss they don&#8217;t believe the children to have suffered.</p>

She told the Guardian that M1 &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">in her distracted state</span>&#8221; would leave &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the gas on and the back door open</span>&#8221;.  </p>

I find that, while stresses of various kinds undoubtedly have a deleterious effect on her health, these proceedings concerning the children have (and have had) a particularly acute impact upon her.  To some extent, these stresses have been brought upon herself, or have been brought upon her by M2.  But whatever the source, I am clear that it is not in the interests of the children for M1 to be unwell; they find it hard.  I have had to weigh carefully here the risks for the children in continuing the proceedings against the risks of not doing so.  Important in this evaluation is my concern about the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">capability</span>&#8221; of M1 going forward to play her part in meeting the needs of the children. </p>

I consider that she has demonstrated poor judgment, in a ruthless endeavour to expunge the men from the children&#8217;s lives.  Worryingly, I believe that she lacks insight into the consequences of her actions, and &#8211; to some degree &#8211; empathy for those affected, including the children.

It may be that, once the psychological effects have been evaluated, the advice is to remove the children from this situation altogether; it may be that the balance of harm comes down in favour of leaving the children with the women, and ceasing all further efforts to re-create the relationship between the children and the men.  Contact issues (and &#8216;enforcement&#8217; by means which protect the children) will have to be considered within this wider picture; the future relationship between the children and the men, and any efforts to restore it, will have to take its place within the bigger plan to create a healthier emotional life for them.  </p>
