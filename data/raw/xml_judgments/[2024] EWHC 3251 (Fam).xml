The husband accepts that he told her about it on that day.  Sometime on either that day or shortly thereafter the wife told the husband that she had return tickets which would enable her to return on the 13 July: she tells me, through Miss Howitt, that she did not say she would return, just that she had the tickets.  I find it was quite reasonable for the husband to hold out hope she would return.</span></p>

This is a point of some significance.  The parties had lived in Territory X not Territory Y.  Though both Territory X and Territory Y are part of the Country Z, they are different  territories . The husband would need to either work in Territory Y or live there before the Territory Y court would have jurisdiction. The husband says that the court in Territory Y is an international court, and he wanted to issue there because it would reassure the wife, rather than the Islamic court in Territory X.  The wife, through Miss Howitt, tells me that there is an international court in Territory X.  So, she does not accept this explanation.</span></p>

The acknowledgement of service was out of time. It should have been served on the 22 August 2024.  The Answer was in time.  The acknowledgment says that the respondent will dispute the divorce application.  He says he does not agree the court has jurisdiction, giving as his reasons that the Territory Y court is the appropriate forum and &#8216;their life was mainly based in the following country: both parties live with the children in Country Z&#8217;.  It drew attention to the fact that there were proceedings in Territory Y and said the mother had abducted the children, which was being dealt with in the High Court.  The Answer also says that the respondent wishes to dispute the divorce application.  The ground ticked for the dispute is the court&#8217;s jurisdiction and the explanation given is that Territory Y is the better place for the divorce to proceed. It also sets out that there are proceedings in the Territory Y court. Both the acknowledgment of service and Answer have a statement of truth from the husband.</span></p>

No case management hearing has been listed yet, and she tells me that is likely to be because of court backlogs.  That appears plausible.

She says this was not so: she supported his adjournment application.  This gave rise to a further hearing before me on the 11 October in which the husband asked for a set aside of the Hemain injunction on the grounds of the wife&#8217;s conduct.  I ruled instead that the wife should clarify her position with the Territory Y court, which she has done, and those proceedings have not been dismissed.  They are adjourned for 3 months with the possibility of returning before then if the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Hemain</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> injunction is dismissed.

I find that he did so knowing that it would assist him obtaining jurisdiction in the Territory Y court but that was not his sole reason, he also knew he was going to be working there so it was a sensible area for a second flat.  Given the offer of work was on the 16 July and the 16 July is just 3 days after he reasonably concluded that the wife was not returning, I do not consider this to be a manufactured repositioning of himself in the light of his knowledge of the English proceedings.  Rather, the job offer was a happy coincidence for him, which gave him the opportunity to bring proceedings in Territory Y.</span></p>

He points me to section 1(5) of the act which sets out that to obtain a conditional order for divorce the applicant needs to wait 20 weeks and make a request.

It is worth exploring because it sheds a light on the statutory scheme after the amendments brought about by the 2020 act. If there were no Answer here would the wife still be stuck having to wait the 20 weeks.  Mr Amos says yes.  Miss Howitt says no.  She points me to Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 section 1(8).  That says that the court may by order shorten the period.  Mr Amos says that is intended to apply for cases such as a need to remarry.  He says comity dictates that it could not apply to allow the English Court to advance an order for fear that a foreign order might be made.  I do not accept that.  Given the court can, where it considers it appropriate restrain a party from applying for a foreign order, I see no reason in principle why it can&#8217;t advance the date by which an English decree of divorce can be obtained because of the threat of a foreign order.  Parliament has given the court that power and if the circumstances are considered appropriate there is no bar on it being used.

On the balance of probability, I find that the offer of a job in Territory Y was not linked to the wife&#8217;s divorce application.  Renting a second property in Territory Y was informed by obtaining jurisdiction but was equally justifiable by vacating the family apartment and being near to his work.

In </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">S v S </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">the wife (who was seeking the injunction) did start proceedings here much later that the husband had started divorce proceedings.  Indeed, the Talaq had already taken place and financial terms agreed even before he issued his summons to register the Talaq in Lebanon.  Miss Howitt tells me that the comparison I should draw from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">S v S </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">is that her client is more likely to be considered entitled to an injunction because she issued first.  I consider the time gap here to be much smaller than in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">S v S</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> so I do not think the timing point is of itself compelling but I do think she is right to make the point that the husband&#8217;s proceedings here are not merely second in time but are reactive to the wife&#8217;s proceedings.</span></p>
