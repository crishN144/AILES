It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the &#8220;lie&#8221; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane&#8217;s judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is &#8220;capable of amounting to a corroboration&#8221;. In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Middleton [2001] Crim.L.R. 251. In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt&#8221;.</span></p>

It follows that the harm to a child in an abusive household is not limited to cases of actual violence to the child or to the parent.

Stage one is for the court to establish the underlying facts based upon admissible evidence and by applying the civil standard of proof.  The burden of proof is upon the applicant.  Stage two, based on the facts that have been found, the court should determine whether or not the purpose identified in FLA 1996, s 63A(1) is established, namely that there is a need to protect a person from being forced into a marriage, or that person has been forced into a marriage. At stage three, based upon the facts found, the court must assess both the risks and the protective factors that relate to the particular circumstances of the individual who is said to be vulnerable to forced marriage. This is an important stage, and the court may be assisted by drawing up a balance sheet of the positives and negatives within the circumstances of the particular family in so far as they may relate to the potential for forced marriage. At the conclusion of stage three the court must explicitly consider whether or not the facts as found are sufficient to establish a real and immediate risk of the subject of the application suffering inhuman or degrading treatment sufficient to cross the Article 3 threshold. At stage four if the facts are sufficient to establish a risk that the subject will experience conduct sufficient to satisfy ECHR Article 3, the court must undertake the exercise of achieving an accommodation between the necessity of protecting the subject of the application from risk of harm under Article 3 and the need to respect their private and family life under Article 8, and, within that, respect for their autonomy.  In undertaking the last stage, the court should have in mind the high degree of flexibility which is afforded to the court by the open wording of FLA 1996 s64A.  The court should be encouraged to establish a bespoke order.  The length of the order, breadth of the order and the elements within it should vary from case to case to reflect the particular factual context. </span></p>

Marriage outside the sect is generally forbidden although exceptions for men are now becoming more common due to an increased frequency of babies being born with genetic abnormalities. </span></p>

Psychological manipulation and coercion against women and children is common, as is physical abuse such as beating, slapping and whipping with belts.  Physical violence is a common punishment for disobedience and depending on the circumstance could even extend to killing.  There was no specific data on the prevalence of rape or sexual crimes. There is a &#8216;mafia like&#8217; culture where men protect the reputation of other men and honour above all else. </span></p>

Obedience and loyalty to the sect is accomplished by forcing men to engage in illegal activities such as bribery, assault, extortion and even murder. Each member has their own &#8220;dossier&#8221; which will be released if he defects, which is another way in which the lives of those who leave will be destroyed.  There was a unanimous view amongst experts in the area that a defector will have to be very careful for the rest of his (or her) life.  Leaving the sect was thought to be much harder for women due to their lack of agency, and would be very difficult to accomplish without the help of their husbands. One expert considered a woman who left could be the subject of &#8216;blood revenge&#8217; if she left with a child who was &#8216;not properly looked after&#8217;. </span></p>

His account of the altercation which had led him to leave the home and go to the police was detailed and, I thought, consistent with accounts given elsewhere in the written statements and other documents. Such inconsistencies as there were (for example the contemporaneous note where he was said to have told the police his mother had told him to go to them) were minor and explicable either as a result of obvious language problems, trauma, or simple passage of time and the effect that would have had on the memory.

So too was what he said about not wishing to support a prosecution of his father, because he and his mother thought that it would only make their situation worse; he said &#8220;he was cruel to us all the time, and if he goes to prison, there might be repercussions when he gets out&#8221;.

Everything that is said by the parents, and corroborated by the expert report demonstrates the cruelty and violence of the society in which both of these parents grew up.  The family did spend some time away from their home base, and the schools the children attended appeared to have some non-sect pupils, but apart from this, they appear to have had very little exposure before coming to this country to the life outside.  This meant, to both the mother and father, and then the children, that they grew up in a world where violence to women and children was frequent and entirely normal.  The victims of this were usually women and children, but it is obvious to me that such an environment is very harmful to men as well. They are expected to keep their wives and families under control, or to suffer the consequences.  The mother experienced this in her own childhood, and so it seems did the father.  The mother said in her written evidence that cruelty was normalised within the sect. </span></p>

A number of documents were only disclosed into the proceedings at a late stage.  Although Ms Connolly QC was able to ask questions, the manner in which she had to do so was significantly circumscribed. At my request she provided her intended questions in advance. Although she was able to expand on some of these, she was not able to mount the sort of challenge that would be expected in a forensic exercise of this sort.  At various points when she was answering questions the mother became extremely agitated, even though Ms Connolly QC adopted a neutral tone and was careful in the way she approached matters in accordance with my rulings. There were significant parts of the case involving allegations of rape and violence that she was not able to put to the witness at all because she became so agitated and anxious.  I have taken all this into account in coming to my conclusions. </span></p>

In the sect, he was expected to treat his wife as his property and keep her under control. There is an overall consistency to the mother&#8217;s allegations, and they are corroborated by K.  In the records, the younger children have given accounts which are supportive of that evidence as well.  Whilst I acknowledge the limitations of evidence from social services records which is untested and that it is possible for a false narrative to have developed within the family, it would not be easy for this to be sustained over a number of visits and discussions with different professionals. Added to this, the father&#8217;s evidence about this has been inconsistent.  He has at some points denied using any physical violence and at other times accepted that he had.  In his oral evidence he attributed this to his psychological state which made it difficult for him to think properly. Whilst I am sure that he has been under severe stress as a result of everything that has been going on,  I do not accept this was the reason for the inconsistencies, or failure to mention some things until a late stage (for example slapping the mother until January of this year, or hitting K with an implement until this hearing).  He has had time to think about these things, and has had the benefit of solicitors for some time now.</span></p>

The father&#8217;s evidence about this has also been very inconsistent. At some points he has denied violence, only to admit it later. For example in his oral evidence he admitted hitting  K with a metal shoe horn for the first time, albeit saying that K used to laugh when it happened.  The father clearly had some problems with K, and found his behaviour frustrating. He acknowledged this to an extent in his oral evidence when he said that K would not behave well towards his younger siblings and also, on occasion, with other children at school.  He said that this was why he had hit him but he denied the allegations against him otherwise.  I consider that he was minimising his behaviour towards K and accept that in addition to hitting him would call him names such as &#8216;invalid&#8217;, &#8216;dumb&#8217; and stupid&#8217; when he became angry and frustrated.  It seems from the evidence overall that the father&#8217;s treatment of K was different to that of the other children.

He described how he left the home in fear and wandered the streets for a while before going to the police station.   For a young man to go and report his father to the police in a still unfamiliar country is a striking thing to do.  I have concluded he did that because he was so frightened about what had happened, and particularly so when he was told by his sister that the father was threatening to kill him.  Ms Connolly QC is right to point out that there are inconsistencies surrounding the account of the father having a knife, and indeed that no knife was ever found, but the evidence of the father&#8217;s behaviour including threats to kill is compelling. There are also some discrepancies in what K was recorded as saying to the police, but it is clear that there was no interpreter present at the police station, and he was doing his best to make himself understood.  These events not only terrified the mother and K but the younger children too.  The social worker was able to see how frightened the mother was, and it is not difficult to understand why both she and K were concerned at the consequences of speaking openly and pressing a criminal complaint. The social work records recount that the father, when spoken to alone, said that he understood the seriousness of his action and would like a psychology report to help him deal with his anger and help him to change.  In his evidence in these proceedings the father said that his words had been misunderstood and that all he had meant to convey was that if they were so worried about him, they should have him assessed, but I do not accept this was so. The comment by the father to the social worker was very telling and fits to an extent with the father&#8217;s presentation in court, where, despite denying and minimising the allegations of violence, I thought he also showed some signs of remorse. </span></p>

The father&#8217;s evidence about this demonstrated how humiliating he found it for his wife to challenge him in front of his daughter; &#8220;I wanted to talk to her about not humiliating me in front of the children&#8230;this is something I never do. I never exposed her in that light in front of the children&#8221;.  In the Sect t was unthinkable for a wife to challenge her husband&#8217;s authority, especially in front of the children.   The father in denying any physical violence on that occasion stated that &#8220;I definitely did not beat her up, if I did, I would remember&#8221; and &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I even hit her because it would be possible to check&#8221;. He stated on several occasions it would be possible to check the mother&#8217;s account that she used make up to hide the bruising on her face by looking at what items they had brought into the country with them or checking the hotel&#8217;s CCTV.  In their written submissions, Ms Connolly QC and Ms Guha point out that the family were staying in a hotel at that point in time, and so third parties might be expected to see the bruising. </span></p>

I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that she was able to cover it up so that other guests in the hotel did not notice it. I also note that M gave an account to the social worker about that even a few months later, in October 2019. She has not been formally interviewed about this, and I acknowledge that what she said could have been very much influenced by hearing others speak of it, including her mother and K.  I have not heard from that social worker at all and so must be careful about the weight given to such statements but there is significance in the fact that M is said to have cried when spoken to and said that she was very scared of her father.  </span></p>

He denied having ever sent them, or even seeing them before the start of the trial. They were filed and served by the mother many months ago, without any response or comment from the father&#8217;s team, who would have been in a position to seek further evidence about them had they wished to do so. There is no identifying information from the messages themselves, but there are only two explanations for them, either that the father sent them, or they have been fabricated. If it was the latter, it is very unlikely they would have included references to mundane matters such what the children had had to eat.  I do not think that fabrication is likely. The messages are a clear illustration of  the way the father communicated with the mother at such times.</span></p>

A wish to leave the sect does not of itself mean a wish to jettison every belief.  Indeed it does not surprise me that the father would continue to hold some conservative views. Given the life he had come from I consider he did find it difficult that his wife and son would not obey him as they had been expected to do, that they might wish or expect to be independent, or that his daughters might wish to wear more western clothing. Likewise he was suspicious of the provenance of the meat which was available to the family. I consider that the father&#8217;s behaviour demonstrates that, like a number of other people in this country, he still followed (and follows) a conservative version of Islam and expected his family to do so, but not that this meant he was still involved with the sect.  I am puzzled by the reliance upon the father being in contact with A&#8217;s ex-husband when the mother was also in touch with A, something that caused anxiety and conflict. That the father, left by his family and apparently alone in the world should communicate some of what happened to a man who he believed had left the sect and also been left by his wife is not particularly surprising, even if there had been rumours in the past of the man&#8217;s links with the police </span></p>

He explained that he had been given financial assistance by his teacher and as a result of working at the Mosque and added that he had also had to represent himself.  I do not consider that his ability to be represented for two hearings and to issue an application is evidence that he was being supported in some way by the sect. Indeed the evidence is that the sect and family members are very wealthy, and if that was so I do not understand why he represented himself at all.  He also gave a plausible explanation as to why he said the mother had changed her surname, as he had seen a different surname on one of the court documents. Given the background of danger from the sect, a change of name would not be surprising anyway. </span></p>

In leaving it, he and the mother took an extremely serious risk that they would be murdered if traced and found, as has happened to others. Neither the mother or father is aware of anyone who has left the sect and returned alive, or even gave evidence of anyone who was rumoured to have done so.  On the evidence before me, the father would put himself at grave risk of being murdered if he resumed contact. [</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">REDACTED SENTENCE]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">. It would be possible to construct a scenario whereby he was being blackmailed, or where he would be prepared to enter into a bargain to save his own life for that of his wife and/or his sons, or that he wishes to restore his honour in some way but all this is highly speculative.  In a case such as this nothing can be ruled out, but I do not consider it likely.  On more than one occasion the father said that all that awaits him if he returned was a shameful death. Although I have found that he has a violent and dangerous temper, when giving his evidence  the father came across as a desperately sad, if not broken, man albeit I am alive to the risks of placing too much reliance upon demeanour.  There is evidence that he sought to try and find out where his family had disappeared in the weeks after they left, but this was not beyond anything that would be expected in such a situation. There is no evidence of any recent attempt to locate them. </span></p>

She said that she had persuaded him that they should leave and he agreed with her.

Whilst his arrival in this country did not transform his attitudes to his family and religion wholesale, and he became angry and aggressive when he felt that certain observances were not being followed, I do not find that this extends to forcing any of the children into marriage or allowing K to undergo female genital mutilation whilst they are living in this country, nor to trying to remove them from the jurisdiction to do so. If the family remained living within the sect or were forced to return, then I accept he  would not be able to prevent it. </span></p>

The mother is left with severe trauma as a result of her experiences, following long term abuse and ill treatment not only from the father but from her own family.  The father is a victim of violent treatment too when young. He has known nothing but a life where men are admired for being brutal and violent. He was not able to change his ways when he arrived in the UK or to adapt to the enormous difference in the society around him.  I do think he loves his children and has had some good times with the girls in particular. I  believed him when he said he still has feelings for his wife.  He has, however, been unable to treat the mother or children properly and has demonstrated a violent and uncontrollable temper when his authority was challenged or he felt slighted and ignored.  Even after they arrived in this country he hurt the mother and K and terrified the whole family. As a consequence he has lost all that he had after leaving the sect. </span></p>

Given my conclusions as set out above, plus the fact that the father has no contact with his family and does not even know where they are, I do not find that he is the current source of the risk of forced marriage or female genital mutilation.  Such risk is from members of the sect, who might wish to try and trace the family and force them back to the Sect.  Forcing marriage on any of the children or female genital mutilation upon K would nonetheless amount to degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 ECHR and so  I would welcome further submissions from the parties as to whether and if so, how, protective orders can be made if it is not possible to name specific respondents. </span></p>
