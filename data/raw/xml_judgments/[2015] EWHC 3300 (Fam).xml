L has one full brother, B, who is 15 years old and is, in circumstances which I allude to below, represented in these proceedings, although not a subject of them; B is educated in England pursuant to a Bulgarian Court order.  L has an adult paternal half-brother, N, and a paternal step-brother, C (aged 15).  </p>

Notwithstanding L&#8217;s views, in the exercise of my discretion, I have concluded that L should be returned to Bulgaria; accordingly the father&#8217;s application for summary return under the Hague Convention succeeds.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents are both Bulgarian nationals.  They married in 1998, separated in 2008 when L was an infant, and divorced in 2010.  The breakdown of this family has on any view been highly conflictual, with intractable disputes between them generating years of contentious litigation in Bulgaria; applications and cross-applications by the parents for orders governing personal protection, child arrangements, and financial provision have continued almost unabated over the last five years.   In the course of those proceedings, both parents have made allegations of abuse against the other, and each have alleged that the other has abused the children; the mother contends that the father&#8217;s conduct has been aggravated by alcohol misuse, the father alleges mental instability on the part of the mother.   The predominant theme of the Bulgarian litigation appears to be (to borrow the term from the translated Bulgarian documents) &#8216;parental alienation&#8217;, that is to say, each parent contends that the other is seeking to &#8216;alienate&#8217; the children from them.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Tragically, both B and L have been exposed to, indeed caught up in, this conflict, and have been affected by it.  The Cafcass officer reporting in these proceedings, Ms Janet Sivills, was clear that the children had been &#8220;harmed&#8221; by the actions of their parents in the way they have conducted their lives post-separation &#8211; a view which is amply justified on the evidence.  In the course of the litigation in Bulgaria, both B and L have been assessed and interviewed by multiple professionals, both psychologists and social work.  The experts instructed there appear to speak with one voice in concluding that the conflict generated by the parents has affected the boys&#8217; &#8220;psycho-emotional development&#8221;.  B is recorded as &#8220;being deeply traumatised by the continuing conflicts between his parents&#8221; (2014).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The extensive history of the litigation requires no specific elaboration here.  It is sufficient for me to mention only a few key events.  In March 2011 the mother applied for, and in August 2011 obtained, an order in the Bulgarian Court permitting her to arrange for B to be educated in England; the application had been opposed by the father, who appealed it unsuccessfully.   There is evidence which suggests (albeit this is disputed) that the father allowed his anger and disappointment with the outcome to spill over into his communications with B and with B&#8217;s English school; the mother, and B, allege that the father sent abusive messages to B and to the school in the early part of 2012.  I have seen transcriptions of these messages and if they were indeed sent by the father it portrays him in a disgraceful light.   Be that as it may, for the last four academic years, B has been educated as a boarder in a private school in England.  As L remained in Bulgaria with his mother during this period, there have therefore been significant periods of time (i.e. term times) between September 2011 and April 2015 when L and B have been living apart; they have come together only for school holidays.  In the last six months they have inevitably seen more of each other.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 24 October 2013, the Bulgarian Court <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>imposed a specific prohibition on the mother removing L from the jurisdiction without leave of the court.  For a period of time in the summer of 2014, following a judicial finding that the mother had wilfully obstructed contact between L and his father, L was moved to live with his father; the transfer of care was accompanied by an order that L was to have no contact with the mother.  It is not clear now how successful this arrangement was.  Photographs taken in the relevant period show L enjoying time with his father; L now looks back on the period through a somewhat different lens, expressing unhappiness about the experience.   The mother successfully appealed the order by which the transfer of residence was effected, bringing the arrangement to an end after three months. </p>

	  <content>

This order was made by the Bulgarian Court (as for all such proceedings concerning children) with &#8220;the best interests of the child&#8221; as &#8220;a primary consideration&#8221;.

The mother contends that if I refuse the return, and welfare-based litigation is engaged here, it will not be so ferociously pursued; alternatively she argues that she and/or L will be more insulated from such litigation conducted here.   I have no reason to believe, by reference to the parents&#8217; past conduct, that this is likely to be so, and cannot locate in the evidence any proper basis for her confidence.  Whether L is &#8216;harmed&#8217; by future litigation lies in some respects in the mother&#8217;s own hands.  A regrettable but unavoidable fact is that by unilaterally abducting L to this country, she has considerably raised the temperature of the parental dispute, and if escalated litigation ensues, it must be she who carries the greater obligation to protect L from it; she can hardly rely on this scenario to claim that an <span style="font-style:italic">Article 13(b) </span>exception applies.  </p>

Inevitably, L has expressed himself in different ways in separate conversations (and within the same conversations) on the central question, and the reporters have themselves reported his expressions in different ways.  I have tried wherever possible to concentrate on the actual words used by L, not on the description of them given by the reporters.  While, as Black LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re F</span>, the Cafcass officer&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="color:#000000">description &#8230; may tell him [i.e. the judge] something about the nature of the children's stance&#8221; (see [39]), it </span>could obviously produce a false result if I were to ascribe to L himself the reporters&#8217; interpretation or description of his comments. I have also conscientiously resisted the temptation to focus on one comment (or set of comments) in preference to another (each party here inevitably latching onto one helpful comment while discounting another); it is necessary to take all of L&#8217;s comments together, and assess whether, when looked in their totality (see Black LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re F </span>at [41]), L is articulating an objection to returning to Bulgaria.</p>

Insofar as this was an issue in this case, it arose because Ms Sivills was of the view that L&#8217;s &#8216;maturity&#8217; was more highly developed intellectually (in respect of which she thought he was &#8220;quite advanced&#8221; functioning closer to the age of 8), rather than emotionally (her opinion was that he functions more as a 6&#189; year old) (see [43] below). Therefore, if &#8216;objection&#8217; was purely an emotional or visceral expression, I would need to consider a rather lower &#8220;degree of maturity&#8221;, and this would take L very close to the borderline of what is generally regarded as the youngest age at which it would be appropriate to &#8216;take account&#8217; of a child&#8217;s views.  The issue in this case is perhaps more perceived than real, because I am of the clear view, and proceed on the basis, that &#8216;objection&#8217; combines, or is likely to combine, a mix of intellectual and emotional components; I look at L&#8217;s stated view in this way, assessing whether the &#8216;age and degree of maturity&#8217; criteria is established.  </p>

I consider that L&#8217;s views, taken as a whole, are sufficient to cross threshold: he does, in my finding, &#8216;object&#8217; to returning to Bulgaria.  I detected in Ms Sivills&#8217; hesitation about describing L&#8217;s views as an &#8216;objection&#8217; for these purposes a sense that she may have been drawing on the now outdated (i.e. pre-<span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>) approach to this question; her evidence tended to suggest that she had in mind at this gateway stage the more complex evaluation of the concept which was favoured in <span style="font-style:italic">Re T (Abduction: Child&#8217;s objections to return)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 2 FLR 192" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 2 FLR 192</ref> at 202, rather than the more &#8216;simple&#8217; approach preferred now, i.e. since <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>.

The factors do not revolve only around the child's objections, as is apparent. The court has to have regard to other welfare considerations, in so far as it is possible to take a view about them on the limited evidence that will be available as part of the summary proceedings. And importantly, it must give weight to the Hague Convention considerations. It must at all times be borne in mind that the Hague Convention only works if, in general, children who have been wrongfully retained or removed from their country of habitual residence are returned and returned promptly.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">While satisfied that L does object to returning to Bulgaria, I do not find that this is a particularly strongly held view, and in his discussions with Ms Sivills and Ms Coyle he articulated positive views about certain aspects of his life there.  I note that Ms Sivills at times referred to L&#8217;s &#8216;preference&#8217; to stay in England, which in itself gave me some indication of the strength of the view which L expressed to her.  I consider that his attitude to a return is inevitably coloured by a fear that he will be immediately placed in the care of his father.  This much emerged from both Ms Sivills&#8217; and Ms Coyle&#8217;s discussions with L.  Ms Sivills did not specifically address with L that he may return to Bulgaria with the mother; she believed nonetheless that &#8220;it&#8217;ll be part of his thought-processes&#8221; that he would &#8220;end up in his father&#8217;s care&#8221;, which is &#8211; as she fairly pointed out &#8211; a reasonable conclusion &#8220;grounded in experience&#8221;.

Ms Sivills, indeed, considered that L had &#8220;obviously&#8221; been influenced by the mother, even though in general terms, parental influence on him was &#8220;not just down to her&#8221;.  It is notable that the Bulgarian child protection services were of the view in 2013 that B had been the victim of &#8216;parental alienation&#8217; by his mother against his father, and that L was (at that time) at &#8220;risk&#8221; of the same form of abuse by his mother.  That said, I am not in a position to find, on the evidence, that the mother has <span style="font-style:italic">deliberately</span> influenced L in the views he expressed to Ms Sivills or Ms Coyle.

Miss Chokowry invited me to weigh in the balance against returning L that litigation would inevitably resume in that country, to which L would be inevitably exposed, and which would be harmful to him.  This submission avoids a sad but all-too-apparent truth, namely that until these parents learn to put on one side their hostilities and give up their damaging behaviours towards each other, their children are bound to be victims of their litigation battles following the disintegration of their family.  There is no assurance that if L were not returned, there would not open a new chapter of harmful litigation in this country, or indeed in Bulgaria.  In short, a return to Bulgaria is no more likely to expose L to harmful litigation than if he stays here.  Miss Chokowry further invited me to accept the mother&#8217;s contention that if she seeks permanent leave of the court to remove L from Bulgaria to live in England, this process may take two years; I cannot assess the validity of this submission on the evidence, but (in contrast to that submission) I note that the mother&#8217;s application for permission to arrange for B to be educated here took five months from the date of application to final hearing (March &#8211; August 2011). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My view is that the child&#8217;s &#8220;right to maintain on a regular basis a personal relationship and direct contact with both his or her parents, unless that is contrary to his or her interests&#8221; is a matter which the court can take into account in the overall welfare determination at the discretion stage, but that this arises from the ordinary procedure under the Convention itself; see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M: Zimbabwe</span> at<span style="font-style:italic"/>[43].  My view is that while <span style="font-style:italic">Article 24</span> helpfully articulates the child&#8217;s right to a relationship with both of his/her parents, it should not be treated in the discretionary stage of a Hague Convention case as a separate <span style="font-style:italic">and additional</span> weight in the overall balancing exercise.  The right to a relationship is already there in the general, albeit summary, &#8216;welfare&#8217; review conducted &#8220;within the constraints&#8221; of that exercise (<span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> [above] [59]).  My determination on this point does not therefore assist the father&#8217;s case, but does not detract from it either.  This novel point was raised in submissions somewhat at the &#8216;eleventh hour&#8217; at this hearing; Miss Chokowry made her submissions on it skilfully, albeit &#8216;off the cuff&#8217;.  While not encouraging litigation on this point, it could well be, I recognise, that in another case, with the benefit of full argument supported by research, the view I have tentatively expressed here does not withstand challenge. </p>
