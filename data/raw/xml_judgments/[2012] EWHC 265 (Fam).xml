He has dual Country A-Country X nationality. H and W married in Spain (Catalonia) on 2 September 1995. There are two children of the family, Ruth who is twelve years old and Esther who is ten years old. Since June 2004 the family has lived permanently in England. The marriage foundered in February 2006 but H and W remained living under the same roof sharing domestic life until W brought divorce proceedings in December 2009 with Decree Nisi being pronounced on 30 July 2010. On 3 August 2010 W brought an application for leave to remove the children from England to live in Spain. That application was heard by Miss Recorder Ball QC in July 2011 and was dismissed. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An important issue in this case is the weight, if any, to be ascribed to an alleged tacit agreement by the parties to adopt a matrimonial regime of separate property made by them on their marriage in Catalonia on 2 September 1995, bolstered by an express separation of property agreement made by them in City A, Country  A on 14 September 2000, which is governed by Country A&#8217;s law, but which was plainly intended to deal with a specific property being bought in W&#8217;s name at that time which would otherwise have been governed by the default Country A community of property regime. The reason I have described the first agreement as &#8220;tacit&#8221; is because almost uniquely among civil jurisdictions Catalonia has separate property as its default matrimonial property regime.  (I say &#8220;almost uniquely&#8221; as Croatia has also been mentioned in this context).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment there is a marked difference between a negotiated pre-nuptial agreement which specifically contemplates divorce and which seeks to restrict or influence the exercise of discretion to which the law gives access, and an agreement made in a civil jurisdiction which adopts a particular marital property regime. The key features of a civil law marital property agreement are described exceptionally clearly, and in terms on which I cannot improve, in The Law Commission Consultation Paper No 198 &#8220;Marital Property Agreements&#8221; (11 January 2011). In para 4.6 it states:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;&#8230;the vast majority of European countries operate marital property regimes. These share three features. One is that they are systems of rules for the division of property on death, divorce or bankruptcy. That division is equal unless a couple have made it otherwise by contract. Another is that they are not concerned with what is usually referred to in the European context as maintenance, or income provision for spouses and children after divorce. The third is that they all involve the facility for couples to opt for a change of regime, before or after marriage, by contract.&#8221;</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Immediate community involves automatic joint ownership of the community property and liabilities from marriage onwards (e.g. the Netherlands). Deferred community of property means that the two spouses keep their separate ownership of property during marriage, but that on death, bankruptcy or divorce their property is pooled and regarded at that point as a community, which is then divided equally (e.g. Scandinavia).</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Within each group one can distinguish systems of total community from communities of acquests. In a system of total community, all the property of the couple is, generally speaking, jointly owned (e.g. Netherlands and Scandinavia). In a community of acquests, property acquired before marriage or by gift or inheritance afterwards is excluded from the community (e.g. France, and, up to a point, Germany).  </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Thus one can see the great variety of default regimes in operation. In the Netherlands it is immediate and total; in Scandinavia it is deferred and total, in France it is immediate and acquests; in Germany it is deferred and acquests.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The regimes prescribed by law in civil countries do not proclaim themselves as the only fair solution. They are simply the arrangements that the law of any particular jurisdiction prescribes in the absence of any other arrangement made by a marital property agreement between the spouses.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Generally speaking a marital property agreement is binding and there is little or no scope for the court to go behind it. Every country with a community regime allows a couple to contract into another regime. The range of choice of alternative regime differs from country to country; in France, for example, there is almost unrestricted choice, but that is not the case everywhere.</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">There are a number of reasons, other than divorce, for contracting out of the default regime. An obvious example is (in a regime of immediate community) the avoidance of joint liability for debts where one of the parties runs his or her own business. Retirement may provide a reason for changing regime: a French couple, for example, may contract so as to change the proportions in which their property will be divided when the community is brought to an end by death, for example by providing that the survivor will take the whole of the other&#8217;s property. Where the default regime is a system of total community couple may contract into a regime of community of acquests, so that any pre-acquired property is kept out of the community. It is also possible in some systems for a gift to one member of a couple to be kept outside the community if the giver so specifies.</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.13in">Germany apart, civil law marital property agreements cannot concern maintenance. Entitlement to maintenance varies from country to country in terms of the level of periodical payments available and the period for which they can be paid. Maintenance is the provision of income although in some jurisdictions a capital payment is available by way of compensation for losses sustained as a result of the marriage (e.g. France, Belgium and Spain). Only Germany allows couples to deal with maintenance by contract. The rest set a clear demarcation between the couple&#8217;s property regime &#8211; which is determined by default or by contract &#8211; and the availability of maintenance, which cannot be the subject of contract. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The European analogy is flawed, as will be clear from a reading of Part 4, because agreements in those jurisdictions are made against the background of a default matrimonial property regime and operate as a choice to adopt another regime. We have no equivalent of immediate community of property, such as is the default regime in France or the Netherlands for example, or of deferred community such as that of the Scandinavian countries. In none of these cases is anyone opting out of a discretionary regime and into certainty; instead, they are opting for different sets of rules.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unsurprisingly, given the diversity of different default regimes, and the variations in the rights to make by contract different agreements, the European Commission has embarked on a project of harmonisation. Thus on 16 March 2011 a p<span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">roposal was advanced for a C</span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman,Bold">ouncil Regulation on &#8220;jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in matters of matrimonial property regimes&#8221;. This would allow spouses </span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">to choose the law applicable to all the property covered by their matrimonial property regime, regardless of the nature or location of the property. Where no applicable law is chosen the Regulation would introduce harmonised conflict-of-laws rules to establish the applicable law a on the basis of a scale of connecting factors. The first criterion would be the first common habitual residence of the spouses after marriage; the second, the law of the spouses' common nationality at the time of their marriage; the third, the State with which the spouses have the closest links. Once the applicable law is established, this will apply even if it is not the law of a Member State in which the dispute is being heard.</span></p>

The default regime is community of goods but agreements that provide for separation of goods are very common. In this particular case, the agreed evidence was that both parties' parents and the majority of their friends entered a separation of property agreement prior to their marriages. In effect, this was the norm for these families and it would, in my view, have been very surprising if they had not entered such an Agreement. </p>

I accept that the Husband mentioned this to her but I do not accept that it was the overriding reason for the Agreement. The Wife may well have since justified it to herself on this basis but I believe that, at the time, she knew that entering such an Agreement was what was expected and she went along with it.

The matrimonial property regime established by the Compilation is the separation of property although this is &#8220;balanced&#8221; by pre-nuptial agreements. The Compilation was amended by State Act No. 8 of 1993 which among other things introduced &#8220;correctives into the default matrimonial property regime to prevent possible situations of inequality at the moment of its dissolution&#8221;.</p>

The only case that it clearly excludes is where both spouses have carried out gainful activities or have been employed during marriage, regardless of whether the distribution of roles in the household has been balanced or not and whether the household chores have substantially fallen upon one of the spouses (typically the wife). </p>

These assertions have been subsequently expanded by saying that the exclusive work for the family and the household ... is essential for the other spouse to be able to devote all his efforts, without any disturbance to the generation of wealth", or that "already by the fact that one of the spouses drops the possibility of working outside the home or, by devoting his or her efforts to the business of the other, enables the other spouse to obtain an enrichment, since he knows that the household and, if this is the case, his or her children will be well looked after or that his or her business in the hands of a stalwart collaborator"</p>

In this respect case law has rejected the adoption of general standards and has confined itself to pointing out that the judge will decide, at his or her discretion, case by case, in sight of the proofs furnished during the proceedings.<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>It rejects applying a market value to work carried out, and more specifically making recourse to the average salary of a housemaid when evaluating work for the household.<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>According to case law such a standard would "mix terms beyond comparison". On the other hand, although establishing the amount of economic compensation according to a standard that entails a share or a participation in the patrimony of the debtor spouse is also rejected, the difference between the patrimony of the spouses and the importance of the economic resources of the debtor are usually decisive in the assessment of the amount of the economic compensation<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>Therefore, legal writing underlines the idea that case law does not value the work in itself but takes into account the gains or the financial resources of the debtor spouse.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Legal scholarship is very critical with the solutions adopted by case law. It contends that by emphasising patrimonial imbalance, case law has made of the economic compensation a device by which it attributes to one spouse an undetermined share of the acquisitions of the other spouse during marriage (and even during prenuptial cohabitation). However, since the courts do not have the power to turn the separation property regime into a regime of participation in the acquisitions or into a differed community, by refusing to evaluate the work of the spouse according to independent standards, case law has given rise to a situation of great uncertainty. This acts as a disincentive to settlements, increases the litigation costs and comes to the advantage of the more powerful spouse, since he or she has more resources to afford court proceedings that can be very expensive.&#8221;</p>

The court may depart from the default position where it would be unjust to implement it. Injustice is likely to be present where there is a serious economic imbalance between the estates of the spouses at the end of the marriage. The Courts have interpreted the provisions generously and unscientifically which has led to a situation of legal uncertainty increasing the likelihood of costly litigation.</p>

It must have been their mutual understanding that if they were to divorce in Catalonia the default position would be subject to lax judicial discretionary adjustment to effect compensatory redress for resultant economic inequality. And their mutual understanding cannot, at least at that point, be taken to extend to the consequences of a divorce outside Catalonia, let alone in an equitable redistribution jurisdiction such as England and Wales. The newly married couple did not intend to live in Catalonia. Immediately following the ceremony they went to live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA where H had been posted by Global Grain. Six months later they moved to Chicago and in 1996 they moved to London where they stayed until 2000 when they moved to City A, the city of H&#8217;s birth (although there had been much travel throughout the area beforehand). </p>

However, City A, the City of Gold, has always held a dreamlike hold on the imagination of Spaniards. I could understand W&#8217;s decision. In contrast, to me City A had always seemed rather backward and hazardous compared to the relatively modern and &#8220;European&#8221; life one could lead in City X, or City Y. Professionally speaking Country X or City Y are only about a 90 minute flight from each other, which makes made living in either city a very convenient base to do business in the other. In comparison, City A is a good four hours flight from either one. However, this was a family decision, and it was very important for me to know that my wife would be leading a happy life somewhere of her choice. We moved to City A in March 2000 after we found a beautiful apartment overlooking the sea and surrounded upstairs and downstairs by the apartments of a Noble prize laureate.&#8221;</p>

They had married in Catalonia, Spain, under the rules of separate matrimonial property. Mr S wished to make a gift to his wife of a property consisting of the third and fourth floors at no 196 Brennan Street, Seaview, City A. I explained to both the spouses that, for Country A law to recognise that the property would belong exclusively to Mrs B under the rules of separate matrimonial property to which the spouses' assets had been subject since their marriage, it would be necessary to sign a property partition agreement in Country A ("the Agreement"), which would have the effect of reconfirming the validity of the pre-existing rules of matrimonial property both in and outside Country A. It was in these circumstances that both spouses, acting jointly, instructed me. Firstly to formalise a property partition agreement in accordance with Country A law, and thereafter to draw up and advise on a property transfer minute with the object of acquiring the said property in the name of Mrs B  &#8230;. Inasmuch as a property partition agreement is a contract to which both parties must consent, the more so because it has property implications for both spouses, I took special care to meet with both spouses and explain to them the consequences of signing an agreement that would result in the abandonment of the rule of joint after-acquired matrimonial property and the adoption of the rules of separate matrimonial property. Thus I made it very clear to both Mr S and Mrs. B that with effect from the signature of the Agreement all property acquired by each of them would be that person's sole and exclusive property, which the owning spouse would be entitled to use, enjoy and dispose of without the other spouse's consent. I further explained to both of them that the signature of a property partition agreement had irreversible permanent consequences as regards the right of each of them to the other's property. I therefore explained that in the event of a future separation or divorce, neither of the parties would have any claim to the other's property. This type of practice of simultaneously explaining the implications of this type of agreement to both spouses is my usual professional practice and I have done so in every similar case in which I have been instructed&#8221;.</p>

It is even more unusual for them to be charming women in their 30s. Ms. C was very energetic and was not afraid to speak her mind. What struck me the most about her was that she was very vocal about the fact that she had recently gone through a divorce herself. She told both W and I that she wanted to make sure W understood the full implications of signing a separation of property agreement in the event of a breakup. I had no objections to this.  Ms. C then took each of us aside separately and gave us an explanation of what the agreement meant for us at the time as a couple, and what it would mean for us as individuals in the event the marriage broke down. When W came back from her session with Ms. C, W seemed satisfied and after Ms. C read the text of the agreement out loud in our presence, W signed the Agreement in the presence of Ms. C, Mr. Y, and me.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In April of 2000 (<span style="font-style:italic">sic, recto</span> 2003) W and I took the decision to move our yearly season in Spain forward by month in order to avoid the negative attention and potential dangers brought about by a campaign in the Country A yellow press aimed at discrediting me personally by accusing me of monopolizing the supply of widgets to the country. It emerged this was not perceived to be nearly as contrary to the public interest as the fact that I happen to be a Country X national. This had serious repercussions in Country A&#8217;s popular psyche. This is a nation brought up under the shadow of a humiliating defeat to Country X which cost it two years of occupation by Country X forces and the loss of a whole province in the South. Several Country A congressmen spoke of the parallels between Country X control of the Country A widgets industry and German control of the Czech Republic's energy sector in the years before the invasion of the Sudetenland. As with any other high profile cases, the Country A Congress was quick to organize hearings to investigate the matter of the state-owned National Widget Company&#8217;s supply practices. I was invited to present my testimony as a witness, and I did. No charges were ever brought against me nor was there any legal investigation into the matter. It was all just a political show. &#8230;  Unfortunately the fact that there was no truth to the allegations in the press this did not make the experience any less traumatic for me and my family. In the end, one can take some comfort from the fact that the accusations left as quickly as they had arrived. Unfortunately, though, when the smoke had cleared, the life of our family had been irretrievably affected. The more jingoistic of the newspapers involved had printed pictures of our house, given out our address, and written of hundreds of millions of dollars that I had presumably accumulated during my control of the country's widgets sector. The fact was that my profile in City A, a city where drive-by kidnappings are common, had been raised to a level where it would have been irresponsible not to employ full-time security for me and my family. Rather than doing this to our girls, W and I decided not to go back to live in City A for the foreseeable future, and to stay in Europe instead. We spent between May 2003 and December 2004 thinking about where to live. Madrid was fun and inexpensive, but England, although probably the most expensive place to live in the World, provided the best long term environment to educate our girls in. The girls&#8217; education was our main priority, and that meant we would probably end up in the UK sooner rather than later. So we made it sooner &#8211; little over a year after arriving as exiles to the Spanish countryside, the family moved to London.&#8221;</p>

In that year H established Green Widget Ltd (&#8221;Green Widget&#8221;). The following year H established Green Widget Trading (BVI) Ltd (&#8220;Trading&#8221;). In 2006 H transferred 90% of the shares in Green Widget and Trading to the Green Widget Trust, a BVI trust, retaining 10% of the shares in his name. In 2010 the name of the Trust was changed to the Siena Trust. The Trustee is a BVI company, Siena (PTY) Ltd, which is owned by the Siena Purpose Trust which, in turn is owned by the Quadrangle Trust Company (BVI) Ltd.  The reason for establishing the trust was to mitigate tax and to avoid probate difficulties (including publicity) on H&#8217;s death.  Since 2009 the trust has been fully discretionary, and H, W and the children are beneficiaries. H has the effective power to replace the trustees. It is a nuptial settlement and therefore potentially variable by this court. Given its terms and looking at it with worldly realism it is appropriate, having regard to the applicable legal test (see <span style="font-style:italic">BJ v MJ (Financial Remedy: Overseas Trusts)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2011/2708" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 2708 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 2708 (Fam)</ref> at paras 15 &#8211; 17  where I attempted to summarise the authorities), to  attribute its assets to H as part of his resources for the purposes of this application. H has not seriously sought to argue otherwise. Similarly it is not appropriate to look at the elements of the structure separately; rather it is apt to look at Green Widget as a composite whole.</p>

H has resigned as a director of both companies. Given that H effectively owns Green Widget I was not able to understand the reason for this, and H, normally so articulate, was not able to give me a coherent explanation.</p>

H told me that in that country about 60% of the widget shops are independent and only 40% are owned by the &#8220;majors&#8221; such as United Widget and  World Widget. Green Widget has about 30% of the independent sector, amounting to about 500 customers, to whose widget shops he supplies widget products. H told me that these were in places which you would be unlikely to visit as a tourist. Being a widgets merchant in Country His replete with risks. The country itself is not without its problems. As H wrote in his affidavit &#8220;no amount of preparation will eliminate the main risk surrounding Green Widget&#8217;s distribution business, which is the fact that Country H is the most dangerous country on Earth that is not in an open state of war. Several international organizations have already declared Country H a failed state, and the reality is that in Country H, might makes right.&#8221;</p>

In April 2010 the Tavo port was invaded and occupied by an armed gang at the behest of the now imprisoned owner of the site whose assets had been sequestered by the Government. Only by dint of robust action by former SAS and US Special Forces operatives was H able to prevent seizure of the widgets in the warehouses themselves. In June 2010 a cargo of  faulty widgets was delivered by a grasping middleman. As H wrote &#8220;the cargo was fully discharged before we started getting phone calls from our clients saying there were lines of customers outside their shops demanding their money back in return for the broken widgets &#8221;. H has described 2010 as his &#8220;annus horribilis&#8221;. </p>

In times of economic recession the demand for some widget products (as opposed to others) is highly elastic. When times are hard people just do not buy as much. In addition there is the ever present risk that the manufacturers will seek to undercut his market position and drive him out of business. This happened in neighbouring Country J where Green Widget&#8217;s activities there were effectively destroyed. The risk of this happening depends on the political complexion of the Government of the day. To add to all this is the fact that  Country H, unlike Country J, has a weak currency and so Green Widget is exposed to currency fluctuations between the US $ (in which it buys the widgets) and the currency in country H(in which it sells it)</p>

It is an illusion. When looking at the value of an asset the court generally, but not invariably, deducts notional costs of sale and latent taxes (see <span style="font-style:italic">White v White </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 AC 596" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 AC 596</ref>, HL).

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I have said in the past that exiting the widgets distribution business is nearly as difficult as breaking into it in the first place. This is particularly true of our Country H operation. The reason is that many of the expected business practices which permit the liquidation of a business in the Western World to be a relatively orderly process, are not present in Country H. First and foremost, many clients are not reliable payors. Of course we have our blue-chip clients, but the great majority of our clientele are small shop-owners who see a company such as Green Widget as a multinational with deep pockets. It would not faze any of these clients to stop paying for their product if they thought that Green Widget was exiting the market. There are two things that keep our clients paying on time. First, the notion that if they honour their payment commitments, then they will get good prices and better credit terms in the future. The second is an unwritten rule amongst Country H distributors that nobody will sell to a client who has unpaid bills with another distributor. In a country such as Country H where there is no state company to act as a supplier of last resort, if shop is not allowed to buy from distributors, it needs to shut down. these two factors results in a very significant incentive for clients to keep up to date on their bills. If one were looking to wind up the distribution operation, it would be most advisable to keep it secret. However, this is unrealistic because almost any unusual action will serve as a signal to the market of one's true intention. In  Country H it is extremely unlikely one would be able to stop sales and to collect substantially all the debts that are still outstanding at the time.&#8221;</p>

Mr Robinson, the SJE from Deloitte, agreed that in a liquidation not all debts would be recovered. In relation to a number a &#8220;haircut&#8221; would have to be had.</p>

So even on a non-break-up basis there is no scope for viewing any part of the assets of Green Widget as currently extractable. This is not to say that Green Widget is valueless or that W is not entitled to share in its value in the future. In my disposition below I will explain how this should happen.</p>

I do not adjust my apportionment of value between matrimonial and non-matrimonial as I have no evidence that the renovation costs enhanced the value of the property. </span></p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">W has a 31.2% interest in a company called M which has a highly regarded restaurant in Barcelona and an apartment where her mother lives. Of this 19.2% was given to her before marriage, and is therefore non-matrimonial, and 12% was acquired during the marriage. W advanced no valuation in her Form E, but Mr Le Grice QC ascribed in his asset schedule &#163;299,520 as the value of W&#8217;s interest, although this appears to be based on a transaction which occurred seven years ago, the relevance of which to today I could not follow. There are accounts, in Spanish, in the bundle to September 2010 which shows net assets of the company of &#8364;86,663 and post-tax profits for the year of &#8364;214,472. I have no evidence as to what multiplier should be used to achieve an earnings valuation. I therefore take the net assets as the basis of value, giving a figure of &#163;22,388 as the value of W&#8217;s interest of 31.2%, but of this I designate 19.2% as non-matrimonial property. W has had money from this business paid to her in cash as unofficial and unrecorded dividends. This practice has stopped. In the absence of any evidence from her I take the profit figure of &#8364;214,472 as the basis of my estimate of her future income net of Spanish tax. A straight 31.2% of the profit figure would correspond to &#163;55,684 gross. Allowing for tax, and retention of some profit by the business, I take a figure of &#163;36,000 p.a. or &#163;3,000 net per month as a reasonable future net income for W from this source.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">According to her affidavit W has borrowed &#163;437,000 from her mother to fund her costs both of these and the leave to remove proceedings. This was revised in final submissions to &#163;494,000 inclusive of &#163;22,221 interest. Mr Le Grice QC has not included this, or any part of it, as a debt on his asset schedule, accepting that it is a (very) soft family loan. This is a fair concession, especially as it is not completely unadjacent in value to the sum I will  designate as non-matrimonial property. Put another way, it is fair to leave this costs debt off the ledger of matrimonial assets, and to regard them as being notionally payable out of non-matrimonial assets, if they ever are in fact repaid, which I doubt.</p>

H points to the fact that on six separate occasions in formal legal documents W accepted that they separated in 2006, namely her divorce petition; her Form E; her solicitor&#8217;s letter containing instructions to the mediator; her affidavit in the leave to remove proceedings; the chronology prepared for her in November 2010; and her counsel&#8217;s PTR Note of 14 December 2011. Mr Le Grice says these were lawyers&#8217; errors which were continuously perpetuated by her previous lawyers and which were erroneously adopted by him in his PTR Note.

The wife is undoubtedly entitled to generous income provision for herself and for the sake of their children, including sums which will enable her to provide for her own old age and insure the husband's life. She is also entitled to a share in the very large surplus, on the principles both of sharing the fruits of the matrimonial partnership and of compensation for the comparable position which she might have been in had she not compromised her own career for the sake of them all.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reason that the sharing  principle is sometimes advocated as being applicable to a periodical payments claim is to reflect the theory that post-separation earnings derive from an earning capacity built up during the marriage which is, in some intangible way, a piece of matrimonial property there to be equitably or fairly shared. The high point of that theory is the dictum of Lady Hale which I have quoted above viz &#8220;the main family asset is the husband's very substantial earning power, generated over a lengthy marriage&#8221;. As a theory it is problematic, because at the end of the day the only reason there is income after separation is because of  work done after separation. A footballer who earns &#163;100,000 per week earns that because he is on the pitch playing football. Certainly, the skills he was born with, and the development of those skills (which may well have happened during his marriage), are all reasons why he can command his salary, but he will not get paid it unless he plays football.

Simple and fair guidance is needed so that the majority of cases can be settled. Settlement is almost always better than adjudication for a divorcing couple. And the functioning of the family justice system depends on a high rate of settlement of these cases. Save in the exceptional kind of case exemplified by <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane</span> a periodical payments claim (whether determined originally or on variation) should in my opinion be adjudged (or settled), generally speaking, by reference to the principle of need alone. Of course needs are elastic in concept and there is much room for the exercise of discretion in their assessment. But to allow consideration of the concept of sharing to intrude in the assessment of a periodical payments award seems to me to be based on a doubtful principle, and is replete with problems of quantification by any sure standard. The sharing principle in relation to matrimonial property is simple enough: it is usually 50/50, because in the division of the marital acquest equity (or fairness) is (usually) equality. But if the concept of sharing is going to uplift above the assessment of need a periodical payments award which will be paid from post-separation earnings how does a judge set about doing it? Is it a third? Or 40%? Or 20%? There are not even any signposts along the road to a fair award.</p>

		  <p class="FootnoteText"> Since the judgment was distributed in draft Mr Le Grice QC has made a written submission which he says &#8220;may or may not be within <span style="font-style:italic">Paulin v Paulin and Cativo Ltd</span><span/><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/221" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 221" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 221</ref>&#8221; in which he states &#8220;neither party addressed the Court on the quantum of a clean break lump sum. W would wish to make submissions on whether the 3.84% return net of tax assumed in paragraph 87 of the judgment is a non-amortising percentage. She would say it is not.&#8221; It is a completely false supposition that in a non-amortizing capitalisation the initial sum remains untouched and the only relevant return is the net of tax interest generated by it. On the contrary, on a non-amortizing calculation the program&#8217;s algorithms apply <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">exactly</span> the standard Duxbury rates of income yield, capital growth, inflation, rate of capital disposal (&#8220;burn&#8221;) and reinvestment (&#8220;churn&#8221;), income tax and CGT. The only difference to a standard calculation is that the final figure in the final year instead of being zero is the same figure which you started with. But it is not the very same money as you actually started with.</p>

		</authorialNote>). This method of capitalisation is reasonable and appropriate on the specific facts of this case where the lump sum of &#163;3m has been assessed by reference to the sharing principle, and where H will continue to be a big earner long into the future. Therefore on payment of the second instalment on 1 June 2014 the periodical payments will fall to &#163;4,300. On payment of the third instalment on 1 June 2015 the periodical payments ought, strictly speaking, to fall to &#163;1,100 per month, but the sum is comparatively small and ought to be capitalised at that point. I calculate the appropriate figure to be &#163;344,000. On payment of that further amount the spousal maintenance will be discharged and a clean break effected. As Sir Mark Potter P stated in <span style="font-style:italic">VB v JP</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 742" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 742</ref> at para 59 &#8220;a clean break is to be encouraged wherever possible&#8221;.
