The issue in the case is does DMM, who it is accepted suffers from Alzheimer's Disease have the capacity to marry.  At a Hearing in early September I heard arguments from the Applicant and the First Respondent on the legal issues raised in this case.  I refer to the written judgment I handed down in that case for a full account of the background to the case and the legal arguments on both sides.  Since then I have made DMM a party and he is now represented by the Official Solicitor as his litigation friend. Dr Hugh Series, an eminent consultant psychiatrist who specialises in old age, has been jointly instructed to report on DMM's capacity to marry.</span></p>

He has also provided an addendum report answering questions put to him on behalf of the Applicant in particular.  In the original hearing the issue turned on DMM's understanding of the effect of his remarriage on his previous will, it invalidates it, and on the effect this would have on the financial position of the 3 daughters, who under the will split the majority of DMM's estate between them (if he died intestate the majority of the estate goes to the First Respondent).  I held on the basis of the Mental Capacity Act and my understanding of the authorities that the fact that a new marriage revokes the will is "</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">information a person should be able to understand, retain use and weigh to have capacity to marry</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">".</span></p>

He was clear that DMM knew the will would be cancelled, that he might not be able to make a new will, that the rules would therefore produce a different result to the old will and his children might receive less and the First Respondent more.</span></p>

In particular he understood that his children might receive less than before and the First Respondent might receive more</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">".  I am satisfied that on the test that I thought appropriate DMM has at present the capacity to marry.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in;border:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">The Applicant made an application for Dr Series to re-interview DMM in rigorous conditions because it was claimed that undue influence had been brought to bare on DMM or possibly the Doctor by the First Respondent.  After reading the answers to the questions set out in the addendum it was clear to me that no possible allegations of undue influence on Dr Series were sustainable and that was the view of Mr Troup for the Applicant.  I heard full argument on the issue of undue influence on DMM and held that I would not order Dr Series to re-interview DMM but of course the Applicant could explore this issue in cross examination.  I refer to my full oral judgment on this point.</span></p>

I therefore made an Order that DMM had capacity to marry that comes into effect at the end of Friday, the effect of this is to stay things until then and the Court of Appeal can then be asked to stay pending the consideration of permission to appeal. I then heard brief evidence on the issue of if DMM's condition was likely to deteriorate and if so on what time scale.  A note of what Dr Series said was taken and if it comes to an appeal will be shown to the court in order for there to be an expedited hearing if possible.</span></p>

I would like to thank counsel for their very helpful argument in this case.  Finally I would express the hope that the First Respondent and DMM's 3 daughters, the four people who are closest to DMM, find a way of moving forward together after this very bitter dispute.  DMM suffers from a degenerative disease and he is going to need the help of all those who love him in the very near future.</span></p>
