	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This hearing arises from an originating application issued on behalf of the Applicant father, Mr B T, on 13 March 2008 under the Hague Convention.  He seeks the summary return of his daughter E to Australia.  She is now 2 years 3 months old having been born on 12 February 2006.  This is resisted by the mother, Mrs J T, on two grounds under Article 13 of the Convention.  Firstly she says the father acquiesced in her remaining in England with E.  Secondly there is a grave risk that, to order E&#8217;s return, would expose her to physical and psychological harm and otherwise place her in an intolerable situation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father is a 41 year old Australia national.  He has been married before and has two older daughters.  The mother is a 28 year old British national.  She met the father in Australia in 2003.  They lived there until November 2003 when they came to England.  They returned to Australia shortly before their marriage there in May 2004.  They lived in England until December 2004 when they returned again to Australia.  E was born there in February 2006.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">They had a tumultuous relationship.  They separated and the mother returned to England with E on 30 September 2006.  She says it was because she feared the father.  It was his drunkenness when he became out of control, his drug taking, his violence and aggression to her, his lack of care of E, and his abuse to her and E.  She went back in October 2006 after the father&#8217;s solicitors had written threatening Hague Convention proceedings.  There was reconciliation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She returned for the second time to the England with E on 30 November 2007.  It was originally intended that a father should come with them for a holiday until 7 January 2008.  He did not go but consented to them coming.  Return tickets were purchased.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">About 18 December 2007 the mother told the father over the telephone that the marriage was over, and that she was not coming back to Australia.  There were further telephone conversations between the two of them, culminating in one on 31 December 2007 the latter part of which the mother recorded.  It is substantially agreed.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground that by the end of the conversation the father had agreed to the mother remaining in the UK for a period of five year provided she brought E to Australia every year for a holiday after 2008.  This the mother accepted.  In a further telephone conversation on 9 January 2008 the father sought to withdraw his agreement.  The reasons for this change by the father are in dispute.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 January 2008 his solicitors wrote to the mother seeking E&#8217;s immediate return.  Her solicitors answered 2 days later saying that the father had agreed to the mother staying in England.  This the father denied.  On 22 January the Central Authority of Australia made an application to the English Central Authority for the issue of proceedings.  They were not issued until 13 March 2008.</p>

I heard preliminary arguments from Mr Williams for the father and Mr Cellan-Jones for the mother on the first day.  There was a video conference early the next morning when the father gave evidence and was cross-examined.  The mother's evidence was begun but completed later followed by final submissions.  I reserved judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She says that the father clearly acquiesced in her remaining with E in England prior to the proposed date of return.  This is to be seen in what he told her, the messages he sent, and his letters.  This is consistent with what he told others and his actions at the time.  Furthermore, given his gross and violent conduct prior to their departure, to return E would expose her to a grave risk.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He does not dispute what he told the mother and wrote to her nor his actions to any significant extent.  However the telephone call of 31 December on which the mother relies on does not on the face of it amount to clear and unequivocal acquiescence.  It was part of negotiations.  If it did amount to acquiescence, then it was obtained by deceit.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother never intended to return when she left as she said in her Statement of Defence.  She had already entered into a relationship with a friend in England prior to her departure.  She contrived a situation to obtain his acquiescence.  Such acquiescence, if any, as may be proved was conditional on her returning to Australia with E every year after 2008.  This she subsequently demonstrated that she had no intention of keeping thus invalidating any acquiescence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Cellan-Jones rightly accepted that, if the father gave appropriate undertakings to maintain and safeguard the mother and E pending court proceedings should they be ordered to return to Australia, he was unlikely to succeed on the defence of grave risk (see TB v JB (Abduction: Grave Risk Of Harm) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2001) 2 FLR 515" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">(2001) 2 FLR 515</ref>).

This was in a small quite isolated mining town of Moranbah where the father works and to which he had moved after the mother had left.  The mother had never lived there and I did not regard it as appropriate.</p>

This might ordinarily have a limited impact.  Here given the mother's statement and that of her supporting witnesses the position may be rather different.  I shall come to this later.</p>

She said he thumped her and kicked her, the last serious occasion being in August 2007 when he tried to strangle her, and the neighbours called the police.  When drunk he did not know what he was doing and could not control himself.  He frequently smoked cannabis, again leaving him unable to control his behaviour.  He behaved badly towards her after drinking in pubs or other public faces, verbally abusing her.  He spent the family money on drinks and drugs.</p>

In a further conversation two days later they discussed and agreed that the father would come to England to visit Eleanor in August, staying with friends of hers whom he knew and whom she immediately contacted.  There were more telephone calls and text messages before the important telephone call of 31 January 2007 which the father asked the mother to make so they could discuss financial matters.</p>

He accepted in evidence that he said that E could remain in England provided he could see her in Australia.  But he said it was not all worked out.  The message he sent on 9 January above was because of what he found on the mother's computer.  He did not remember what it said.  It was a coded message, but reading between the lines that were someone else over.  He mentioned documents from Reunite and Hague Convention.  He highlighted violence, making an agreement and what she needed him to say.</p>

It is why he said that he was going to sell the mother&#8217;s car, the family boat, and her computer after photos were removed, why he gave away much of E&#8217;s clothes, and why he told her that the mother was not returning.</p>

In that his first wife spoke of the father&#8217;s irresponsibility with her children.  Her solicitor had therefore insisted on supervised contact.  It led to the mother&#8217;s solicitor also mentioning supervised contact.  It did not mean that she was rejecting the agreement which I am satisfied she never intended to do.

There must be a real risk that there will be an increase in that anxiety should the mother have to return to Australia which will impact adversely on her relationship with E.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Next there is a strong likelihood that the mother would be granted residence of E in any future proceedings.  The father&#8217;s contact would be likely to be restricted until he had demonstrated a sustained ability to care for her without supervision.  Even now the mother complains of the father ringing up and being continually abusive to her as I accept, as well as speaking to E when he is drunk.  She considers this causes E the nightmares she has after he has spoken to her, remembering his bad behaviour in Australia.</p>

Waite J considered the same question in W v W (Child Abduction: Acquiescence) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1993) 2 FLR 211" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">(1993) 2 FLR 211</ref> (approved by the Court of Appeal in H v H <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1996) 2 FLR 21" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">(1996) 2 FLR 21</ref>, overruled by the House of Lords on acquiescence in Re M but I have found helpful on discretion).  It was whether the mother would be compelled to remain in Australia against her will for the sake of readier and more frequent contact to the father.</p>

Given the background, the prospects for the mother are every bit as high in this case probably higher.</p>

I see a marked similarity with this case.  On the facts, having found acquiescence, he did not order the child&#8217;s return.</p>

The father&#8217;s consent gave her a freedom to contemplate new relationships which, if he had insisted on E&#8217;s return on 7 January, she would not have had.  It was a risk he took given that the mother is a young personable woman.</p>

Against that I have to have regard to the whole history, the father&#8217;s behaviour to the family, his disregard and threats about court orders, his consent to E to staying, and the agreement which was reached.  I have also have to have regard to the impact on the mother and her care of E, and the upheaval for E who is recovering from the trauma of her father&#8217;s conduct.  That no home for the mother is yet agreed is only relevant if that remains unresolved.</p>
