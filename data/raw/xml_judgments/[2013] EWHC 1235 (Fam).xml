	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application for leave to make an adoption application pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/42/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.42(6)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>. Permission is required because the subject child has not lived with the applicants, his paternal uncle and aunt, for three years during the five years preceding the application. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no consistent evidence, in fact, as to when the child first lived with the Applicants. Estimates vary considerably. On the basis of information supplied by Counsel on their behalf during the course of the hearing, the child has lived with the Applicants since November 2011; so for only six months as at the date when the permission application was begun, namely 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application, so it is said, is supported by the child&#8217;s parents who are in Pakistan; and also by the Children&#8217;s Guardian who has no reason to believe on the basis of her inquiries that this is anything other than a genuine request to apply to adopt for welfare-based reasons. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The leave application is resisted and firmly so by the Secretary of State for the Home Department (SSHD). It is argued that the three year requirement is there for a good reason and that it would only be appropriate for it to be waived if there is a substantial and compelling reason. It would be necessary, at a minimum, so it is said, for the application to appear appropriate in all other respects. Moreover, it is submitted that a number of matters point very firmly against permission being granted &#8211; (i) the fact that all the legal requirements where an applicant was applying to adopt a foreign child as well as the Immigration Rules have been circumvented or otherwise not complied with; (ii) the general conduct of the Applicants and other family members as well as the way in which applications have been made gives rise to suspicion; (iii) the inconsistencies, contradictions and general lack of credibility in the Applicant&#8217;s case; and (iv) the length of time any permitted adoption proceedings would take to conclude during which period the child would remain here in breach of the immigration rules and apart from his parents.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of Birmingham City Council, the position taken might best be described as one of neutrality. Whilst the report prepared under Part 14 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 favours the making of an adoption order, it is pointed out that in certain respects the investigation thus far has been superficial. Mr Shaw&#8217;s Position Statement ends with this observation &#8211; &#8220;&#8230; it may be argued that this adoption application could be a route to secure a desired immigration status.&#8221;</p>

Had it been said by anyone, and it was not, that it was necessary for me to have heard oral evidence it would not have been possible on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May because no interpreter was present. As the hearing unfolded, it became clear that no oral evidence was required because the discretionary exercise could properly be undertaken on the basis of the written material. </p>

Judge Frankish considered the parents&#8217; written statements and heard evidence from two of their female relatives who live in the UK. According to the evidence given, IH&#8217;s father is an agriculturalist who makes a living, sufficient to support the family, from their land. The eldest son, KH, assists with the farming effort.</p>

The conclusion of the judgment was in these terms &#8211; <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The first appellant (the father) has been twice before, paid for it himself and returned in accordance with visa conditions. He has a viable livelihood by which to support his family&#8230;.The mother (paternal grandmother in England) is clearly unfit to travel. This may very well be the last opportunity for her son, daughter in law and grandchildren to visit her. That is a powerful motive for a visit.

IH has, in fact, become a member of their family now. &#8220;There has been a genuine transfer of parental responsibility and IH has broken all ties with his natural family.&#8221; IH&#8217;s parents were said to have left him with his paternal aunt and uncle because they &#8220;are not able to take care of him and neither is he able to take care of himself.&#8221; Mr MM and Mrs RB were said to be &#8220;currently in the process of complying with all legal obligations relating to the adoption process and are &#8230; submitting an application for an adoption order.&#8221; They would therefore like IH to be granted an extension of stay in the UK &#8230; &#8220;whilst they pursue this matter through the adoption process. This could take 8 &#8211; 12 months depending on the circumstances.&#8221;</p>

For, were there to be a real prospect that an applicant would persuade the court that a child's welfare would best be served by [the substantive order sought], it would surely almost always serve the child's welfare for the applicant to be given leave to seek to do so. Conversely, were there not to be any such real prospect, it is hard to conceive that it would serve the welfare of the child for the application for leave to be granted. But I hesitate to suggest that analysis of welfare will always be satisfactorily subsumed within an analysis of prospect."</p>

As to that, he is quite correct. The application for permission in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Coventry</span> case was brought by a local authority foster mother with whom the subject child had been placed when only six days old. She was nine months at the date of the appeal and had lived throughout with the foster mother who wished to apply to adopt. The local authority which held a placement order had indicated its intention to remove the child from the foster mother&#8217;s home. That is the context for the guidance contained within paragraph 10.</p>

He also suggests that as a general rule, in order to surmount the permission hurdle it should be necessary to show &#8220;something exceptional,&#8221; something over and above ordinary welfare arguments. That, Mr Greatorex urges, should be the proper approach when the court is considering whether to sanction an application which does not comply with the residence arrangements contained within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/42/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.42(5)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> as well as the requirements of the Immigration Rules.</p>

Misuse of adoption proceedings to gain a right of abode (as opposed to exercising parental authority) is most unlikely to be in the child's welfare as well as undermining immigration policies and procedures. Paragraph 4 of Adoptions with a Foreign Element Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/393), made pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/83" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 83</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>, demonstrate that the procedure for the adoption of a foreign child by applicants in the UK may be long, perhaps arduous, and uncertain of success. The temptation in such cases to pull the wool over the eyes of the immigration authorities may be well nigh irresistible. If the regulations are not complied with the offender may be guilty of a criminal offence &#8211; see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/83/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 83 (7)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. The procedural requirements include (i) the prospective adopter receiving notification that the appropriate certificate has been issued by the Secretary of State confirming him as eligible and suitable to be an adoptive parent and that the child will be authorised to enter and reside permanently in the UK, (ii) the prospective adopter visiting the child in the state of origin, (iii) before visiting the child notifying the adoption agency of certain matters, (iv) after the visit confirming to the adoption agency the visit, providing any further information requested, and confirming the child's expected date of entry into the UK, and (v) accompanying the child on entering the UK and thereafter giving notice to the adoption agency of the child's entry and of the intention to apply for an adoption order. </p>

The subject child, who was 17 at the time of the hearing in 2009, had been brought to England on a family visit in 2007.

In 2002, in Pakistan, the applicants became the beneficiaries of a guardianship order. They materially assisted the child by paying for him to be educated privately and in other respects as well. Bennett J found a number of facts broadly uncritical of the applicants in connection with immigration issues. He described them as &#8220;open, honest and sincere.&#8221; He resolved the adoption application in their favour and granted them leave to apply. He said,</p>

Indeed, now that I have conducted a full hearing into the merits and concluded that an adoption order should be made, it would be quite unjust not to grant leave. Even if leave had been sought at the outset of the application, which it should have been but was overlooked, I am confident that it would have been granted.&#8221;</p>

And yet when the local authority undertook the initial assessment, it was rapidly established that no such severance or estrangement had occurred. IH, according to IfT, had been led to believe his parents would be returning to the UK, and he spoke with them regularly over the telephone.</p>

Most recently, and in response to the court&#8217;s directions that they should supply medical reports, a family physician Dr AA has certified that the mother is very weak physically and has had three operations for different abdominal problems. His opinion is that she is unable to look after her family and even herself. In a separate report, the same doctor says the mother &#8220;must deal with emotional stress given the added burdens of life (required in the household chores) and task overload would no doubt lead to depression.&#8221;  He confirms that &#8220;both parents have mental capacity and are able to make decisions for themselves.&#8221; Nothing is said about any intellectual or cognitive impairment.</p>

Mr AA, presumably the Headmaster, certified that Mr ImH, son of MH &#8220;is having low intelligence quantity problem.&#8221; There was no suggestion from the aunt who accompanied IH to the GP in November 2011 that IH had two rather than one brother who is &#8220;mentally handicapped.&#8221;</p>

Her role and mine are different. The guardian has carried out a welfare inquiry by listening to what she has been told by family members and others, as well as by witnessing relationships at first hand. She has had no opportunity to verify the various statements made about the health and other difficulties of both the parents and IH&#8217;s siblings. My task has been to assess a quantity of material, to consider whether there are reasons for caution in accepting at face value what emerges from the papers and to decide whether, in all the circumstances, leave to apply should be given. </p>

But I am troubled by the way in which he came to be in this country, by the likely emotional impact upon him of the sudden and probably unexpected departure of his parents and eldest brother from his everyday life and by the equally sudden disappearance some months later of his older brother. I note that in nothing IH has said to any one is there any hint he was not loved or cared for by his parents. Indeed, IH is said to be a very sociable, loving boy who enjoys family life. He is &#8220;as keen to give emotional warmth as he is to receive it&#8221; which, to my mind, strongly suggests he experienced a sound emotional upbringing from his parents during his formative years.</p>
