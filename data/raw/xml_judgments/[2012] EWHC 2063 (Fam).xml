He was studying Rural Estate Management at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester and living in a cottage nearby. The parties married in July 1984.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The Husband is a member of an illustrious family with many successful forbears who managed to accumulate great wealth. In fact, his ancestors, who include prominent military commanders, made a large contribution to the life of the Nation in the 19th Century. More relevantly, the foundation of the modern family fortune was set by his grandfather who reinvested the proceeds of an earlier family business into what is now a well known merchant bank.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In about 1944 the Husband's grandparents found a country estate in Oxfordshire which they purchased as their home. The main attraction of the estate was a Grade II * country mansion (with 4 staff cottages) surrounded by 11 acres of gardens and some 138 acres of grazing/pasture. It was, in Estate Agent speak, a "gem". Moreover it was an economically viable unit because it had additional farms/farmland of some 1,500 acres running with it. In the 1940s that area was broadly sufficient. The Husband's grandfather had additional independent means through his successful investment in banking and his grandmother was also a member of a wealthy family with assets of her own. The grandparents furnished their home in great style using antique family pieces and paintings. They had one son. He was not interested in country life preferring London (where he had a home in Chelsea Square before eventually moving to Fulham). In the light of his distaste for Oxfordshire, the grandparents decided that it made sense to skip a generation and leave the entire Estate to the Husband. Consequently, tax efficient Trusts were set up in his favour. The Estate was settled in 1967 and the Husband became beneficially entitled to it in 1983 (1 year before the marriage) when he reached the age of 25.</span></p>

He appreciated that it was his destiny, hence his later education at Cirencester. In 1988 (4 years after the marriage) the Trustees passed the Estate absolutely to him. As it bypassed his father, the Husband is only the second member of the Y family to own the Estate which has been in the family for some 70 years.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The Estate is no longer subject to trust or settled land arrangements, rather it is owned outright by the Husband. It represents inherited wealth acquired as a result of the endeavours of previous generations. This important factor is at the forefront of my mind in the resolution of this case. I note, however, that in the past the Y family have been prepared to switch tack and move their asset base as circumstances dictated or as seemed appropriate. Thus the grandparents sold lands before basing themselves in Oxfordshire.</span></p>

I accept that, in some ways, it means everything to him. From it he garners purpose, quality of life and status. It is his wish to retain the Estate (as intact as possible) and pass it to his son. No one is suggesting that this Court should order the sale of the entire Estate, even though, as I shall explain later, it is touch and go whether this Estate is economically viable in the current circumstances. The Husband wants to try and retain it. That is his decision and privilege.</span></p>

To a degree this is because some properties are occupied by retired employees and/or their families. Mr Peel QC (for the Wife) has submitted that the most recent accounts suggest that the income figure may have increased to &#163;475,620 gross -  in the broad scheme of things I do not consider that this asserted increase makes much difference to the viability of the Estate. The residential properties are let on Assured Shorthold Tenancies ending no later than 2014. The commercial properties are held on commercial leases ending no later than 2015 (except the public house lease which ends in 2024). There is a small amount of rent from paddocks, grazing licences and the like. The Husband informed me that there is good potential (over time) to increase the amount raised from this source. But, once again, I consider the sums involved to be de minimis. The farmland is not rented out, so no rental income is derived from it because it is farmed in hand.</span></p>

However as the 20th Century progressed and farming became less profitable, it became increasingly difficult to run this type of Estate absent substantial other capital and/or a large external income. Hence by the 1990s (when the Husband's grandmother died) the house/estate were described as rather dilapidated.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The Husband was determined to upgrade the house/buildings and manage the estate soundly. From 1990 onwards he set about maximizing value from the land/buildings - for example, by seeking extended planning permission and commercial opportunities. He was relatively successful in this endeavour but, even so, it was increasingly necessary to incur large borrowings to cover the difference between net income and outgoings. The Husband took a long-term view. He decided that, whilst land values increase over time, the value of money decreases. Accordingly he determined that borrowings could be afforded and were in one sense a shrewd investment. Of course, the basic premise behind his scheme is a truism. But to be a successful tool the time period by which it becomes an economically prudent proposition is perforce lengthy. The Husband's strategy (Mr Marks QC (who represented him) referred to it as his "gamble") was to borrow substantial amounts assuming that his maxim would hold good.  The current level of borrowing is &#163;6.7 million (increasing annually).</span></p>

I am clear that this policy will only work well if interest rates are low and land values rise ahead of inflation. The Husband has been fortunate over recent years that economic circumstances have been favourable with the result that the Estate has been able to sustain ever increasing levels of debt. However, I am certain that any major fluctuation in any one of the variables could (and almost certainly would) lead to the collapse of his seemingly efficient equation. Obviously a tipping point will arise when the cost of borrowing becomes unsustainable and/or the banks call for repayment of all or part of the loan.</span></p>

The loan is on an 18 month term expiring in about September 2012.  The husband is looking for new lenders in the light of the need to raise capital to fund the borrowing and this award.</span></p>

The Husband is very enamoured of her and, at the outset of their relationship, set her up in an establishment in Chelsea. Thereafter she moved to Belgravia and most recently she has gone to outer Fulham. The latter, I suspect, is a temporary move, for at the end of this divorce the Husband hopes she will move to the Estate. The Husband has lavished a great deal on her. But this is not a Court of morals. Save to note it is part of the history, the Husband's new relationship forms no part of my decision.</span></p>

When analysed, he has lost 12% of the overall value of his investments in the years where an equivalent general market loss is 8%. To my mind, this would not indicate great success but the Husband informed me these bare facts belie the entire truth because a mere concentration on the IG accounts does not account for the fact that, overall, he had made significant profits for the family/trusts. I was not given any evidence to corroborate this claim and so I cannot make any positive findings save that the Husband considers he is financially astute.

During the marriage they lived in an extremely privileged manner. They were not flashy by nature but they were patrician and mixed in the highest echelons of English Society. They moved with ease in those circles and were accustomed to giving and receiving gracious hospitality. Their home had 15 bedrooms. The Wife told me that she was used to running a full house with staff and planning the social life that goes with owning an important Estate. I accept her evidence in that regard. Frugal in some senses (for example travelling (premium) economy), this family wanted for nothing. I gained the impression that the Husband, in particular, had what he wanted - whenever he wanted it. As an example he spent &#163;85,000 on a Porsche motor car and sought to justify to me it as "inexpensive" on the basis it was written down over 8 years. This was obvious nonsense, although I do not criticise him for the purchase &#8211; after all he is a very wealthy man. It was, however, an interesting peep into his inner world as far as his perception of his own need was concerned.</span></p>

Mr Peel QC put it at some &#163;8.3 million in the period 1983 to 2012.  The Husband was able periodically to sell parts of the Estate and other property to provide capital injections. For example, I know that he sold part of one estate farm  (&#163;1,300,000), a house at another farm  (&#163;130,000), and two woodlands (&#163;243,000).</span></p>

Additionally, he spent a further &#163;1million on renovating the main house in the early years. Moreover some of the capital raised will now be reflected in the current liquid (non Estate) assets.

The answer might well have been that it applies only to matrimonial property, namely the property of the parties generated during the marriage otherwise than by external donation; and the consequence would have been that non-matrimonial property would have fallen for redistribution by reference only to one of the two other principles of need and compensation to which we refer in para [68], below.

The fact that wealth is inherited and not earned justifies it being treated differently from wealth accruing as the so-called 'marital acquest' from the joint efforts (often by one in the work place and the other at home). It is not only the source of the wealth which is relevant but the nature of the inheritance. Thus the ancestral castle may (note that I say 'may' not 'must') deserve different treatment from a farm inherited from the party's father who had acquired it in his lifetime, just as a valuable heirloom intended to be retained in specie is of a different character from an inherited portfolio of stocks and shares. The nature and source of the asset may well be a good reason for departing from equality within the sharing principle.</span></p>

So too their standard of living and the extent to which it has been afforded by and enhanced by drawing down on the added wealth. The way the property was preserved, enhanced or depleted are factors to take into account. Where property is acquired before the marriage or when inherited property is acquired during the marriage, thus coming from a source external to the marriage, then it may be said that the spouse to whom it is given should in fairness be allowed to keep it. On the other hand, the more and the longer that wealth has been enjoyed, the less fair it is that it should be ringfenced and excluded from distribution in such a way as to render it unavailable to meet the claimant's financial needs generated by the relationship.</span></p>

The fact is that no formula and no resort to percentages will provide the right answer. Weighing the various factors and striking the balance of fairness is, after all, an art not a science.And at [76]: " Since they had drawn upon capital to support their lifestyle, there can be no complaint about the fact that the judge required the inherited property to continue to be the source to fund the wife's future income needs. Given the husband's age, lack of earning capacity, and the loss of the farm income, he could hardly provide future support for the wife otherwise than by continuing to use his capital resources."</span></p>

What is fair will depend on all the circumstances; those cannot exhaustively be stated but will often include the nature of the assets, the time of inheritance, the use made of them by the parties and the needs of the parties at the time of trial. In the present case, although the assets were inherited from the husband's family, the parties had jointly elected to live off them and, in effect, to use them as a substitute for earned income. There can be no possible complaint about an order which treated the capital in this case in the way the parties had themselves jointly treated it. Moreover, in this sort of family circumstance the conventional distinction which may be made elsewhere between capital and income ceases to have the significance it may have for others. That is true also of other family situations, especially when the capital is the result of income accumulated with a view to it supporting the family lifestyle in future, for example in retirement"</span></p>

My view of overall fairness to both parties, developed at an early stage and not displaced in the course of protracted subsequent reflection, is that an award of 40% to the wife, for which Mr Pointer contends, would be unfair to the husband and that the bracket fair to both would be between 30% and 36%.

Consequently, if she chose to move to London (albeit that was a matter for her) her housing needs should be pegged to the cost of a reasonable country home. Mr Marks QC abandoned this argument in his closing submissions, partly on the basis that the cheaper cost of country houses with land (as proposed) was in large measure off-set by higher running costs which would impact on the Duxbury calculation. Neither party sought my ruling on this interesting question. For my part, although such an argument might be used as a check on the reasonableness of a Wife's demands, it is not a particularly useful submission and certainly would never have provided the solution to this case. When a marriage breaks down I doubt, in the normal course of events, that it will be unreasonable for a "country" spouse to seek to live in London or some other part of England and Wales. Lest there be any doubt I do not regard this Wife as having been disingenuous or tactical in seeking to re-start her new life in London. She has brothers (to whom she is close) and friends in London. She is no longer the Chatelaine of the Estate and her desire to begin afresh in an environment where she can feel fulfilled is natural. I accept that in London she can offer her children different and exciting attractions. Her plans to come to the capital are well thought out and, I consider, sensible.</span></p>

She has been training as a psychotherapist for many years and qualified in July 2011 (although she is not yet accredited). She has no earned income. Having seen her give evidence, I accept that her earning capacity is not great and will not have a material outcome on the calculation of her needs. However, I would expect her to be able to cover the cost of further counselling sessions with her therapist by taking a few patients of her own. She gave her evidence with dignity and was truthful. She was both charming and self-assured. I had the impression that she was accustomed to leading a very cosseted life. She was not used to dealing with every day matters of finance. She lived in a grand house with a housekeeper/cook (who did the supermarket shopping); she had the use of an ironing lady and gardeners. Therefore her main job was caring for the children and being a social asset. That was what the Husband wanted and I am confident that, whilst the marriage was successful, she was a partner of whom the Husband could be justly proud. I am sure that she fulfilled her role (as, essentially, the lady of the manor) with aplomb. Hers was an old fashioned lifestyle with family retainers (to whom one owed a duty of care) and up-market friends. In short, it was an idyll redolent of English life of yester year. It was a life that few can afford now, with great privileges and prestige. To coin a fitting phrase, both parties lived as landed gentry. In addition the Wife was accustomed to coming to London with her Husband in pursuit of their joint passion for all things cultural including opera. In the later years the parties habitually stayed in the Carlton Tower, Knightsbridge.</span></p>

She liked the area where she was currently living because it was central yet peaceful, near the parks, convenient for friends and, although she did not describe as such, it is fashionable. She could see that, at their age, her children would find this appealing. I considered that she was correct in this summation and life in this area would give her younger children a valuable insight into cosmopolitan life. The Wife's general aspirations were not outlandish or avaricious. They were borne of her lifestyle to date and her expectations from birth. She told me that she wanted to be near her brothers who live in the Notting Hill area of London.</span></p>

She accepted that in about 15 years she should move to a property costing &#163;5 million which was smaller and, therefore, less expensive. She was cross-examined at length about alternative areas such as Fulham, Pimlico, Little Venice (albeit not the best part) and similar areas. She did not like any.  She had sensible reasons for her concerns, such as they were too far out or not particularly pleasant. I found her answers on this subject compelling and sensible. I accept them. I know all the areas suggested by Mr Marks QC and, in the context of this marriage, the value/type of properties put to the Wife was simply unacceptable and unreasonable. I came to the clear conclusion that the Husband's proposals were parsimonious because the supposedly suitable houses were driven by the amount the Husband was prepared to pay rather than by his objective appraisal of what was fair. I do not accept the evidence he gave about some of "his" particulars being suitable and appropriate for his former partner. That said, I believe the Wife's insistence and concentration upon a few streets was short-sighted. I asked to be shown a range of homes outside the parameters pushed for by either party. As I have already mentioned, I am familiar with all the London areas in this case not only from a look at arid Estate Agents' blurb but from personal experience of walking the streets and viewing the interiors of many similar properties. Most were built in the 19th Century and are formulaic even if upgraded differently.</span></p>

The reason that I have alighted on this figure is because it will permit the Wife to buy a house in a good area of Kensington or Chelsea. I am clear that a central yet quiet location with safe streets is something to which she is entitled. Such sum will enable her to buy a small house in one of the best areas or a somewhat larger one in streets which are a little less fashionable. For example, properties such as those produced by the parties, at my direction, in Campden Hill Road or Pembridge Villas W11 (marketed at &#163;4.85 million) would be suitable and can be purchased at about this sum. Ultimately the Wife can choose to invest some of her Duxbury fund in her first home. If she decides to have less cash to invest in income-producing sources, that will be a matter for her. If she really wants Campden Hill Square it will be an option but it is not a need per se.</span></p>

To my mind, having studied the sale particulars made available, this Wife should not be expected, after this lengthy marriage and given the parties' lifestyle/wealth, to be pensioned in a small flat (similar to her current stop-gap property) when she is in her mid 60s or at all.  I consider that it would be manifestly unfair to oblige her to move from a property costing &#163;4.75 million. Even if she decides she wants a smaller property (in terms of bedrooms) she will still need suitable entertaining space and that requirement always demands a premium in the price. She is always going to be entitled to accommodation of the kind I have found is fair. After all, she will still be a distant part of this grand family in the sense that she will continue to be a mother and, in due time, a grandmother. In any event, her overall needs as I have assessed them below do not permit of any additional contingency fund because I consider that good housing is the priority in the context of the non matrimonial nature of the bulk of the wealth. Therefore if she feels she wants such a fund she can (at her discretion) move to release capital but such a move should not be under compulsion because the award is predicated on that basis. As I find, such a requirement would, in all the circumstances of this case, be unfair.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I found the Wife's evidence on budget much less persuasive. I think probably because she has never had to formulate a budget. The Husband dealt with the household bills, holidays, luxuries and the like. The Wife drew up the menus and the housekeeper paid for most of the food. The Wife had a credit card but shopped only for clothes, presents, luxury comestibles, toiletries and the like. Having heard her evidence, she was rather a canny shopper, habitually securing good quality items for the best price. Her budget of over &#163;220,000 (reduced to &#163;200,000) was more of a guesstimate rather than a worked document. The Husband put her needs at &#163;142,000 which I considered was more broadly correct. I round that figure up to &#163;150,000 because some items were a tad low and the Wife will have a slightly larger property than he envisaged. I consider this sum of &#163;150,000 is particularly apt because whilst the youngest two children remain dependent, the Wife will receive some &#163;17,500 per child by way of periodical payments towards their costs. Mr Marks QC submitted that the Wife should be expected to reduce her costs in about 8 years time by up to 33%. I accept the principle that life becomes more confined as we age and some overall reduction is inevitable. Mr Marks QC produced a table to show how the formula works at different rates. An income of &#163;150,000 with a 20% reduction in year 8 when the Wife is 60 years would produce a Duxbury requirement of &#163;3 million. If the reduction came in year 15 (when the Wife is about 67 years) I was informed it would uplift that figure by about &#163;50,000. I am of the clear view for all the reasons which I have expressed that the Wife's income fund should be &#163;3 million which contemplates a 20% reduction in 8 years. The amount can be justified as such, but a further check convinces me it is a fair figure because &#163;3 million produces just over &#163;125,000 net per annum on a whole life basis which means the Wife will never be in want.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The Husband is 53 years old.  He is a qualified land agent who manages and farms the Estate. I found him to be eloquent and amiable. He is a cultivated man who is committed to the Estate and is steadfast in his desire to keep it. That is primarily because he sees himself only in terms of being its owner. His role on the estate gives him rank and eminence amongst his fellows which he enjoys. To my mind, it is abundantly clear that his wish to retain the Estate has to a degree blinded him to the contributions of his former spouse and, more importantly, to her future needs. His overriding strategy has been to reduce her claim so that it is affordable to him. He told me that he considered an &#163;8 million award was the tipping point for him and he would find it (and I am paraphrasing) gut wrenching to pay more. His evidence was to the effect that the sum of &#163;6.2 million (initially on offer) would be funded by what was effectively bridging finance provided by Messrs Hoares who required security of &#163;15 million &#8211; being a charge on the remainder of the Estate (Messrs Coutts having a charge over the house, park and 138 acres). In cross-examination it emerged that the sum which the bank had indicated they would advance was simply the amount for which he had asked. Thus, he had not asked for the maximum that could be provided over time. He also vouchsafed for the first time in the witness box that he was intending to approach Knight Frank Finance to obtain a consolidated loan at a better rate than Messrs Coutts were providing and / or he had been offered by Messrs Hoares. His figures were vague and I am not convinced by the &#163;8 million tipping point and reject it. No precise workings on real figures were produced. The Husband told me that he was placing the outlying Farm on the market for some &#163;2.5 million (some &#163;0.5 million more than the agreed valuation). Apparently, the Local Council had indicated the prospect of several building plots on the land which gave it an enhanced value. He was also seeking a 40% share of any additional uplift as part of the deal.</span></p>

The Husband was openly optimistic and sought to present himself to me as a successful man of affairs. If his perception of himself is correct then he will be able to do various deals, he will manage to consolidate his borrowings and, using his tried and tested strategy, he will pay his debts over many years and retain the Estate. If he is incorrect and is, as Mr Marks QC would have it, being over optimistic then I am afraid the Estate is doomed whatever lump sum is due.</span></p>

Some &#163;36 million of gross assets with about &#163;13.6 million of borrowing (which he would need on the basis of his new offer) is not sustainable on the income the Estate produces. Even assuming interest at about 3% (and interest rates are projected to rise) annual borrowing costs would be about &#163;400,000 (almost all the Estate income) before allowing for anything for personal expenses or normal estate expenditure. This Estate is very expensive to run. On the Husband's scenario no capital is being repaid for several years and any properties sold have to be used primarily to augment cash flow. As I find, on the balance of probabilities, the only way the capital can ever be repaid is by a sale of most of the working farm land. When this occurs only the house, parkland and 138 acres will remain with very little income to sustain them. If the farmland is sold separate from the main house the 10% marriage value on the whole is lost. Even a sale of the outlying farm does not solve the problem as it merely makes the payments easier to sustain in the short term.</span></p>

From the Husband's perspective this will be sad but the figures demonstrate this is likely even on his own offer. His financial difficulties are not solved by demoting the Wife's needs below a fair attribution given this was a 26 year marriage/contribution with all that entails.</span></p>

Mr Marks QC indicates that it is not fair to analyse income and expenditure thus because many estate expenses are in reality encompassed within that figure.  I accept that general argument although I cannot put a precise figure on the Husband's annual costs or give a precise value to him of living in such beautiful surroundings on an Estate of this sort. But his expenditure on himself plus Estate is vast.  Whether the precise figures are clear or correct (and the Husband thought his costs were much less) it is certain that his outgoings exceed his income by a very considerable margin (and that is before the further borrowings are raised). Any margin of loss will inevitably widen as new interest payments kick in.</span></p>

I have reached the clear conclusion that the fair result in this case is a lump sum of &#163;8,738,000. This amount of capital represents a 32.5% share in the net assets. It leaves the Husband with 67.5% of the assets (some &#163;18 million) which is appropriate given the origin of the wealth. The award fairly meets the Wife's needs and it encompasses any right that she has to share the assets. I so state because, although my calculation is needs based, it does involve sharing inherited assets which will be invaded to cover the award. In this case needs and the right to sharing are essentially the same.</span></p>
