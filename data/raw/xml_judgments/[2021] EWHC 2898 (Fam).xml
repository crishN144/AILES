	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is not necessary for the purposes of this judgment for me to analyse the reasoning of the Court of Justice. I cannot improve on the summary in [2021] Fam Law 771 by Rebecca Bailey-Harris:</p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;The CJEU concluded that the special jurisdiction in Art 10 is confined to cases of abduction of the child from one Member State to another Member State. There was no justification for the provision's application to a case of abduction to a third State, not in the wording of the article, nor in its context, nor in the travaux pr&#233;paratoires, nor in the overall objectives of Brussels IIA. Art 10 consists of a single sentence and uses the expression 'Member State' and not the words 'State' or 'third State', implying that that it deals solely with jurisdiction in cases of child abductions from one Member State to another. Article 10 is a special ground derogating from the general rule of jurisdiction founded by Art 8 in the habitual residence of the child, and a special ground of jurisdiction must be interpreted restrictively. The EU legislature wanted to establish strict rules with respect to child abductions within the European Union, but did not intend those rules to apply to child abductions to a third State. In a case of child abduction the legislature wanted to strike a balance between the need to prevent the perpetrator of the abduction from reaping the benefit of his or her wrongful act and the value of allowing the court closest to the child to hear actions relating to parental responsibility. Furthermore, the extension of Art 10's operation to third states would run contrary to the objectives of the Hague Conventions of 1980 and 1996.<span style="background-color:#FFFFFF">&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is no applicable bilateral treaty governing jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments in parental responsibility matters between United Kingdom and India. India is not a party to the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children. Article 7 of that convention, which is the counterpart of article 10 of Brussels 2 bis, does not retain jurisdiction in England and Wales as it only applies where the wrongful removal is to another contracting state &#8211; see article 7(3). It is my opinion that the reasoning of the Court of Justice must apply equally to article 7 of the 1996 Hague Convention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Therefore, the question whether England and Wales has jurisdiction is to be determined in accordance with article 14 of Brussels 2 bis.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In my previous judgment I explained how there was no jurisdiction in this case under article 8 or article 12 of Brussels 2 bis. My view was that there was no jurisdiction under article 10; and that has now been confirmed by the Court of Justice. I explained that <ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/55/section/1" canonical="1986 c. 55 s. 1" type="legislation">sections 1</ref> &#8211; 3 <ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/55" canonical="1986 c. 55" type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> did not, on the facts of this case add any possible additional jurisdictional grounds. At [43] &#8211; [48] I held that there was no scope for jurisdiction to be established, and relief granted, pursuant to the court&#8217;s inherent powers in wardship. I had stayed all aspects of the proceedings pending the ruling from the Court of Justice; for that reason I did not then and there dismiss the wardship proceedings and de-ward the child.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The question having been answered, and I having previously decided there was no other basis for founding jurisdiction, the case was listed for the father to be given a final opportunity to show cause as to why his application dated 4 August 2020 (seeking that the child be made a ward of court and an order for her return be made) should not be dismissed. Regrettably, it has taken an unduly long period of time for that application to be listed and heard.</p>

She did not stop there but went on to submit that, on the return of the child, she should either live with the father or have substantial contact with him. In effect she is asking me to reconsider and to reverse my decision as to the inapplicability of the court&#8217;s inherent powers in this case.</p>

I merely observe that cases such as this demonstrate the continuing need for a remedy which, despite its antiquity, has shown, is showing and must continue to show a remarkable adaptability to meet the ever emerging needs of an ever changing world. I add that the use of the jurisdiction in cases where the risk to a child is of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention &#8211; risk to life or risk of degrading or inhuman treatment &#8211; is surely unproblematic. So wardship is surely an appropriate remedy, even if the child has already left the jurisdiction, in cases where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad for the purposes of a forced marriage (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Re KR</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>) or so that she can be subjected to female genital mutilation or (as here) where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad to travel to a dangerous war-zone. There is no need for me to go any further, so I need not consider whether there are other kinds of situation where a child who is already abroad should be made a ward of court or whether wardship is an appropriate remedy where the risk to the child is of harm falling short of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;Secondly, the inherent jurisdiction should not be exercised in a manner which cuts across the statutory scheme. If, as Lady Hale and Lord Toulson suggest, the use of the inherent jurisdiction is not reserved for exceptional cases, the potential for it to cut across the statutory scheme is very considerable. I have no doubt that it would do so in this case. In the first place, it would fall to be exercised at a time when the child will have been with her mother in Pakistan for at least two years, and will probably have become habitually resident there. Secondly, it seems plain that if an application under the inherent jurisdiction had been made by, say, an aunt or a sister of the respondent, there could be no ground for acceding to it. It is necessary to make this point in order to remind ourselves that it is to protect her relationship with the child on the basis that she should be regarded as a co-parent that the appellant is invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The real object of exercising it would be to bring the child within the jurisdiction of the English courts (i) so that the court could exercise the wider statutory powers which it is prevented by statute from exercising while she is in Pakistan, and (ii) so that they could do so on different and perhaps better principles than those which would apply in a court of family jurisdiction in Pakistan. Thirdly, this last point is reinforced by the consideration that the appellant&#8217;s application in the English courts is for contact and shared residence. This is not relief which the statute permits to be ordered under the inherent jurisdiction, in a case where there is no jurisdiction under the Council Regulation or the 1996 Hague Convention. I do not accept that the inherent jurisdiction can be used to circumvent principled limitations which Parliament has placed upon the jurisdiction of the court. For these reasons, in addition to those given by the judge and the Court of Appeal, I do not think that an order for the child&#8217;s return could be a proper exercise of the court&#8217;s powers&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The statutory limitations are, needless to say, of the greatest importance. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span> the Court of Appeal pointed out that the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction cannot be exercised where the claim is for &#8220;care of&#8230; or&#8230; contact with&#8221; the child within the meaning of <ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1/d/i" canonical="1986 c. 55 s. 1" type="legislation">sections 1(1)(d)(i)</ref>, and 2(3), that is to say a child who is neither under the jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales pursuant to the 1996 Convention, nor habitually resident in England and Wales, nor present here.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> There seems to be a drafting inconsistency in the inter-relationship of these provisions. Sec 2(3) says that the court shall not make a sec 1(1)(d) order unless <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">either</span> it has jurisdiction under the 1996 Hague Convention <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">or</span>, if it does not, where <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">either</span> the child is present in England and Wales <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">or</span> "the condition in <ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/55/section/3" canonical="1986 c. 55 s. 3" type="legislation">section 3</ref> is satisfied" (sec 2(3)(b)(i)). However, while sec 3(1) mentions the condition referred to in sec 2(1)(b)(ii), it does not mention any condition referred to in sec 2(3)(b)(i). Sec 2(3)(b)(i) appears to refer to a non-existent condition. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;If proceedings in wardship were instituted, but &#8230; no application was made for care or control or for access, and where, by definition, no custody order was being sought, it could be argued that the habitual residence basis of jurisdiction did not apply. That would leave the court in wardship free to order the minor's return to the jurisdiction; once returned to the jurisdiction, the plaintiff could then apply for a custody order. Arguably, in that event, jurisdiction could arise on the ground provided by s. 2(2)(b), namely that the ward is present in England or Wales on the relevant date &#8211; the date of the new application &#8211; and the court considers that the immediate exercise of its powers is necessary for his protection. By this procedural device, the court might then make the custody order. But should that be permitted? Whilst this ancient prerogative jurisdiction survives, I shall scrupulously and rigorously enforce it where I can. Nevertheless, despite this reluctance to curtail my jurisdiction, I consider that to exercise these powers would be wrong, and that I cannot justify what could be a devious entry to the court by the back door where Parliament has so firmly shut the front door to custody orders being made in these circumstances.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is clear from the judgment of Moylan LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M </span>that the burden of surmounting the substantive threshold falls on the applicant. He has to show that there are circumstances here which are sufficiently compelling to <span style="font-style:italic">require</span> or make it<span style="font-style:italic"> necessary</span> that the court should exercise its protective jurisdiction. The burden is to demonstrate that a crisis has erupted and that in consequence the child has suffered, or is at risk of suffering, serious harm, of the type, as Sir James Munby P suggested, that would engage articles 2 or 3 (i.e. a threat to life or of inhuman or degrading treatment). In <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Wardship: Jurisdiction and Powers) </span> the President stated that he did not need to consider whether the jurisdiction would be exercisable where the risk to the child is of harm falling short of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention. In my judgment, if Moylan LJ&#8217;s substantive threshold is not to be robbed of meaningful content, the bar must be set at that level of harm. That level is not positioned at the &#8220;very extreme end of the spectrum&#8221; (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M </span>at [105]) but rather at a point which rightly reflects the criteria of caution, circumspection and necessity. It also gives effect to the key underlying principle that the jurisdiction is protective in nature to be exercised in a supporting, residual role (<span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span> at [107]). I entirely agree with Baker LJ&#8217;s comment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span> at [52] that these observations by Moylan LJ are a general reflection on the (extremely limited) scope of the jurisdiction rather than a technical point about the need for some kind of alternative cause of action. I also agree with Baker LJ&#8217;s observation, also at [52], that the function of the court is to make: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The applicant has failed to discharge that burden. There is no evidence that a crisis has erupted and that the child is in such peril. In the absence of such evidence a return order would plainly amount to what Ward J described as a devious entry to the court by the back door where Parliament has firmly shut the front door, and to what Lord Sumption described as an improper exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion. Indeed, inasmuch as the father seeks an order for contact in para 2 of his application he is not seeking a devious entry to the court via the back door. Rather, he is seeking to break down a very firmly locked front door. </p>

The mother has advanced some strong allegations of domestic violence at the hands of the father which would need to be investigated very carefully before a return order based on welfare grounds could even be contemplated.</p>
