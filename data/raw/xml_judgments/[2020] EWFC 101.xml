On behalf of the mother and father it is also asserted that the Guardian&#8217;s discussion with BS evidences that he had no idea that his move here was to be a permanent one and that he is anxious to return to Romania as soon as possible. </p>

The same concession is made on behalf the children. Applying the factors that I have set out within this judgment, it is clear to me that these children never acquired habitual residence in this country. Their life, associations, education, family and language are all in Romania. These children have no integration in a social and family environment in this country.  </p>
