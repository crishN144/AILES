A nurse also reported that Mother had been upstairs and Father downstairs, and Father tired to pick up the Sibling and the Child fell out of his arms, but the source of the information is not provided. The same day there is a note in the GOSH records questioning the consistency of the parents&#8217; account on the basis of the record the Child had fallen onto a carpeted floor.</span></p>

The follow-up strategy discussion from that date recorded Father&#8217;s explanation as him picking up the older Sibling whilst holding the Child and the Child slipping from his grasp and falling to the floor. The right side of the brain was showing significant injury. No concerns had been noted by ward staff in respect of either parent&#8217;s interaction with the Child or presentation at GOSH. The neurological team felt the degree of injury to the brain was extreme given the history, the injuries could be the result of 2 separate trauma impacts, there were perceived discrepancies in the accounts provided by the parents and while accidental injury was not impossible it was considered to be unlikely. The complex pattern of fractures from one single event was regarded as highly suspicious. Whilst the view of the Consultant Neurologists appeared to differ, and it was possible the injuries were accidental, on the balance of probabilities, and considering literature and experience, it was felt that the baby had suffered NAI.</span></p>

This and subsequent reports/letters stated [Dr G] believed them to be true and to reflect accurately the opinion of the clinical teams at GOSH. The report went through the various recorded explanations of the incident. It confirms the CT of the brain showed a breakage of the skull on the right side with involvement of multiple skull sutures (joints between the bones of a baby&#8217;s skull) and an externally displaced fragment. There was a separation of the joint connecting the bones on the side of the head (parietal) and the back of the head (occipital), with associated soft tissue swelling. The brain was seen protruding through the right fracture at the level of the broken fragment, with significant tissue injury to the right parietal lobe of the brain. There were also 2 breaks (fracture lines) on the upper back area (parietal) of the skull on the left side. There was also suspicion of minimal signal changes to the T2 to T4 vertebrae, with trabecular fractures not being ruled out. The report recorded a consensus neuroradiology opinion that the mechanism of fall described by Father was compatible with the radiological findings, which were suggestive of a single high impact direct traumatic injury. However, [Dr G] also opined &#8220;the pattern of injury seen in this child with multiple skull fractures seen on both sides, with associated widening of the sutures, and significant damage to the underlying brain, is highly unusual in the context of the history provided by the parents&#8221; and noted &#8220;with concern that there are discrepancies in the history provided&#8221;.</span></p>

[Dr W], named doctor for safeguarding at GOSH, &#8220;expressed that it was considered that [Dr G] had been put under a degree of pressure when speaking to the parents&#8221; (on [Day 15]), and that [Dr W] &#8220;held a discussion with [Dr G] in respect to the 'revised history from [Father] provided at the meeting on [Day 15]. It was considered that this it is an elaborated history&#8230;&#8221;. In discussion about the fractures it was stated the Child &#8220;has fractures on both sides of his head, which radiate out, and two fractures that radiate from the left side of his head. Those fractures don't join up so if the initial history is that he fell and didn't bounce or tumble on the way down, how is it possible he had fractures on the other side of his head. [Dr W] expressed that if (the Child) had fallen from a great height onto a hard floor it is possible that he would have sustained the fractures. [Dr W] recommended the Local Authority seek an expert second opinion. The Local Authority were recorded as questioning whether this was proportionate given it was not felt that threshold was met for the case to go to court. The police were also recorded as having visited the family home and finding the account given by Father as completely plausible. In considering [Dr G]&#8217;s report the police did not regard there as being significant inconsistencies and notable omissions, viewing the minor differences in the accounts given as in line with what each parent saw and how they interpreted it. They also noted how the memory works could explain differences in the details recalled at differing times and the fact the parents had witnessed something traumatic. The police went as far as to state &#8220;had both parents arrived at the hospital, given identical accounts and maintained them completely throughout I would be more likely to expect this to be lies&#8221;.</span></p>

The report is dated 13 May 2021. [Dr N] summarised his view that &#8220;the constellation of imaging abnormalities cannot reasonably be explained by a fall from a height such as being held by an adult. In my view the two main possible explanations for the totality of the abnormalities are that either they are due to a crush injury (as may for example have happened if (the Child) did indeed fall onto the floor but his head was then stepped upon by an adult) or an episode of impact head trauma involving an impact injury involving a much greater degree of force than is likely to have occurred as a result of a fall from carrying height.&#8221; He described the &#8220;parenchymal brain injury, although focal in that only one area of the brain was affected, it was very extensive as it did involve the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes and was also an injury which involved the full thickness of the brain from the surface to the ventricular margin. I cannot recall ever having seen such an injury as a result of an episode of domestic impact trauma.&#8221;</span></p>

Whatever happens, the court will need to set out the evidence and explain its reasoning. The court is required to cross-check that conclusion based upon the straight best interest test under s1(1) of the Children Act 1989. Withdrawal at this stage would appear to leave many open questions, including conduct of medical professionals and a lack of a clear decision in the interests of the children. It would leave the parents open to questions about the cause of the juries in future. Overall, having considered all of the above, the court is satisfied it is not appropriate to grant leave to withdraw and the application is accordingly dismissed.</span></p>

Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or recollection of the person hearing or relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and/or an intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction. While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction from say negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely, findings of fact that at least satisfy the significant harm, attributability and objective standard of care elements of section 31(2)."</span></p>

Although what I have said with regard to a right to fair process under ECHR, Art 8 or the common law may in principle apply to such an expert witness, it will, I would suggest, be very rare that such a witness' fair trial rights will be in danger of breach to the extent that he or she would be entitled to some form of additional process, such as legal advice or representation during the hearing. That this is so is, I suspect, obvious. The expert witness should normally have had full disclosure of all relevant documents. Their evidence will only have been commissioned, in a family case, if it is 'necessary' for the court to 'resolve the proceedings justly' [Children and Families Act 2014, s 13(6)], as a result their evidence and their involvement in the case are likely to be entirely within the four corners of the case. If criticism is to be made, it is likely that the critical matters will have been fully canvassed by one or more of the parties in cross examination. I have raised the question of expert witnesses at this point as part of the strong caveat that I am attempting to attach to this judgment as to the highly unusual circumstances of this case and absence of any need, as I see it, for the profession and the judges to do anything to alter the approach to witnesses in general, and expert witnesses in particular.&#8221;</span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.59in;text-indent:0.41in"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Fourthly, and leading on from the last two points, there is a powerful public interest in knowing whether or not someone putting himself forward as an expert has been criticised by another judge or other judges in the past. Thus the sorry saga of Dr Paterson can be traced through the successively reported judgments of Cazalet J in&#160;Re R (A Minor) (Experts' Evidence) (Note)&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/1990/1.html" class="Hyperlink" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">[1991] 1 FLR 291</a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">, of Wall J in&#160;Re AB (Child Abuse: Expert Witnesses)&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/1994/5.html" class="Hyperlink" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">[1995] 1 FLR 181</a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;and of Singer J in&#160;Re X (Non-Accidental Injury: Expert Evidence)&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2001/6.html" class="Hyperlink" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">[2001] 2 FLR 90</a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">. In each of those cases, it may be noted, Dr Paterson and the other expert witnesses were named in otherwise anonymised judgments.

This work, though very important, is voluntary. The concern is that if expert witnesses in care cases are publicly identified this will be likely to lead to a further drain on the already diminishing pool of doctors and other experts willing to do child protection work. Doctors and experts in other disciplines may be yet further disinclined to do such work if they see that the evidence they give to the court on the understanding that it (and their own identities) will remain confidential may become public knowledge and be the subject of public criticism. The already inadequate number of experts willing to assist the courts in vitally important child protection cases may, it is feared, be even further reduced.</span></p>

And quite apart from the most severely pragmatic of reasons for needing to know who are the experts giving evidence in such cases, does not the public in this context have an interest in not merely knowing what is being done in its name but also in knowing who the experts are whose evidence may have led (though of course not in this case) to a child being removed from his parents and placed for adoption.&#8217; </span></p>

The father was cradling the Child in his right arm and was moving him up and down. It is reported that the older child, (the older Sibling) wanted a cuddle from her father. Father tried to pick (the older Sibling) up on his left side on his hip. Mother reported she turned around for a few seconds and when she turned back, she could see the Child arching backwards, flipping over and falling onto the floor. The floor is described as a hardwood floor on top of concrete. There were no obstructions or toys on the floor. Mother was not sure whether the Child fell on his right or left, front or back. The parents reported that the Child did not lose consciousness, no vomiting and no bleeding. Mum reported that one eye was open, and one eye was shut and there was swelling to his head. As the family reside 10-15 minutes away from the hospital, they decided to drive to the hospital. On the way an ambulance was called to make sure they were expected at Watford General Hospital&#8230; The professionals involved in the Child&#8217;s care have not been able to agree on the mechanism of the Child&#8217;s injury and whether this was an accidental or non-accidental injury. Concern has also been raised as to some discrepancies in the accounts provided by parents.</span></p>

The 2 main possible explanations he put forward were a crush injury (such as if an adult had stepped on the Child after the fall to the floor) or an episode of impact head trauma involving an impact injury involving a much greater degree of force that is likely to have occurred as a result of a fall from carrying height.

Based on the background as [Dr N] understood it, he described the fall as akin to a fall from a domestic piece of furniture, a toddler falling over and banging their head on a hard surface or a child being dropped from standing height onto a surface such as a pavement. He identified skull fractures as uncommon outcomes following such events and the type of skull fracture that might be seen following such an event would be a simple linear skull fracture. He stated it would be very unlikely that an episode of domestic head trauma would give rise to such a set of complex fractures. He went on to consider the brain injury which had also occurred, which was very extensive and had involved the full thickness of the brain. The 2 clinical scenarios he felt would perhaps most commonly explain such a full thickness injury would be if there had been a penetrating injury such as might occur if the Child had fallen onto an object which caused the fracture and penetrated through the skull into the underlying brain or if there had been a crush injury which caused the bilateral fractures but also led to the penetration of the brain by the free fracture fragment which could be seen on the right side in the scans.</span></p>

It was his opinion that a &#8220;history of a fall from about 4 to 5 feet, on its own, is very unlikely to cause the severe (Radiological) brain injury. Such a fall does not typically cause bilateral skull fractures. Bilateral skull fractures were occasionally noted by Weber during his experiments with infant cadavers (dropping them head first from 82cm). But these were caused by falls onto the midline of the skull. In the Child&#8217;s case there are two areas of soft tissue swelling. One overlying the right parietal bone and the other effecting the left parietal bone. This very much suggests a minimum two impacts.&#8221; He also stated &#8220;the extensive skull fracturing seen is very unlikely to have been caused by a fall as initially described by the father. Two impacts are suggested by the bilateral soft tissue swelling. The burst type fracture seen is typically caused by a crush injury (possibly stamping or being thrown against a surface). The presence of a burst fracture or crush injury is typically caused either by a severe accidental injury e.g. falling out of a window two stories up or a severe RTA (see below Ellis et al) or by a non-accidental injury.&#8221;</span></p>

That was the reason why the consensus radiology statement was produced. Her statement identified that when a neonate or very young child falls from the carers arms as in this case, according to the literature, the injury sustained can be much more severe than uncomplicated fall from a short height. Fractures can be seen on both sides from a single injury in this age group and in the given mechanism. The overlying hematoma of scalp further corroborates the acute nature. The displaced skull fragment on the right with dural tear and herniation of meninges and brain as well as widening of lambdoid sutures on both sides suggest a high impact nature. The brain parenchymal injury was only on the same side of the brain, consistent with direct high impact trauma. Bleeding was seen predominantly on the side of the more complex fracture, further suggesting single high impact trauma. She was able to rule out a second older injury or shaking injury. She identified trabecular fractures were commonly associated with axial loading injuries like fall from height landing on the head, consistent with the given mechanism.</span></p>

Although the infant head is undeniably more compliant than the adult head, due to the nature of the birth process, the role of this compliance and possible viscoelastic response warrants further study in regard to impact biomechanics. It has been postulated that outbending plays a significant role in infant skull fracture, although this has not been confirmed with physical experiments. Skull fracture patterns have rarely been investigated experimentally to elucidate further information on the biomechanics of fracture, and the fracture locations relative to the impact location are unknown, as are fracture initiation and termination locations &#8230;</span></p>

Most importantly, fractures can often occur away from the site of impact and a single impact can generate multiple fractures.

She accepted that in the first 6 months of life the skull has limited ability to resist or absorb energy. The most frequently broken skull bone is the parietal bone. A fall striking the eminence may sustain a greater injury and there may be fragments of skull into the brain as well, with sharp edges potentially injuring both the covering of the brain and the brain itself. Given that infant heads are proportionately larger compared to their body size, they are more exposed to impact than other body parts, the bones are softer and more spherical, and the higher centre of gravity may increase the frequency of head injury. The Child was a small baby and [Dr TM] confirmed this can delay skeletal maturation, although many of them catch up. Where there is a direct traumatic injury with a detached fragment this can spring back once the force stops, as the skull tries to go back to its normal shape.</span></p>

[Watford Consultant Paediatrician]&#8217;s belief and recollection was that the parents did not describe a height but that this was estimated by different doctors to be between 4-5 feet. The main difference in the records was noted as the receiving doctor recording a fall onto a carpeted floor, whereas the triage nurse and [Watford Consultant Paediatrician] recorded that the floor was wooden.</span></p>

It is one they are required to respect, even if they respectfully disagree with it. However, for that to occur they need to understand the basis of the decision which has been made and there may be lessons to be learnt by GOSH in their approach to this case.

This applies as much to cases where significant injuries are sustained as when a child sustains little or no significant injury whatsoever, although those circumstances may never be reported and mean statistics are not a fair representation of the true picture. There is also a question of whether research is statistically significant, ie are there sufficient cases for a pattern or range of injuries to be derived/defined. As a result, the research pool of reliable date is very limited. It has been supplemented by experiments on dead babies (Weber) and pigs (Powell). Within the research, there is limited information on how injuries were sustained, when the devil is in the detail. This may be indicative of unclear histories overall.</span></p>

The court is satisfied it is in the public interest to give permission to the Mother to disclose the full judgment to the GMC and, should it be required, to obtain transcripts of the evidence of both witnesses.</span></p>

The court has included dicta from A v Ward to focus the mind in that regard, but they may wish to take legal advice. Therefore, a copy of the draft judgment should be provided to them and they be asked to provide, within 21 days, written submissions on the issue of publication of the judgment with their names to be included, rather than anonymised.</span></p>
