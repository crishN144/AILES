The 2 children are E born on 24 September 1992 who is 11 and J born on 23 July 1995 who is 9.  The application is opposed by their mother, 46 year old Mrs Heather H (&#8220;the mother&#8221;).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the conclusion of counsel&#8217;s submissions the hearing was adjourned.  The father had relied in support of his application upon an affidavit from his solicitor in Australia.  It related to legal advice given to the father in late 2003.  it was to the effect that his lawyer was not aware of any legal means under Australian law that would enable the father to compel his wife to return the children to Australia.  I pointed out that that appeared to be a waiver of the father&#8217;s privilege in relation to the advice that he was given.  Mrs Wood sought discovery of the solicitor&#8217;s file.  Miss Ramsahoye did not oppose this.</p>

I had already indicated that I would only give judgment, if necessary with reasons to follow, if I could do so without further submissions from Miss Ramsahoye.  I gave my decision on 16 August.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By Articles 3 and 4 the removal or retention of a child under 16 from one convention country to another is wrongful if it is in breach of rights of custody.  If that is so and no defences are proved, the Convention country to which the children have been either unlawfully brought or in which they have been unlawfully retained must return the children to the other Convention country from which they have come.  It is for that second Convention country to decide where they are to live.  In this case there is no dispute that in June 2003 the children were habitually resident in Australia and the father had rights of custody.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I consider the facts in relation to both these separate defences under the same heading.  They are of course quite separate issues.  If consent is proved by the mother, it arises before her departure to England with the children on 10 June 2003.  Acquiescence again if it is proved arises after her departure.  The parties&#8217; evidence is in dispute.  However what is now said and in particular what was written at the time does much to indicate the attitudes at the time in relation to both subjects.</p>

Firstly I have not found it easy to resolve the fundamental disputes based upon the parties&#8217; later statements and evidence.  Secondly there is an explanation for the single ticket based on the father&#8217;s accumulated air miles which removes the otherwise potentially clear indication.  Next, there is the mother&#8217;s omission to tell friends, doctor and schools of her intentions.  That is indicative one way.  It is also consistent with her wish that the children should not know until they had settled in England bearing in mind the small community in which they lived in Australia.</p>

Suppose, for example, that shortly after the abduction the applicant suffers an incapacitating illness of which the abductor knows nothing.  I do not accept that his resulting inaction could fairly be described as acquiescence.  Equally, I do not think that a party can be said to have acquiesced by doing nothing if he reasonably thought, on the basis of the advice he had been given, that there was in practice nothing which he could do.&#8221;</p>

First of all the judge has to make findings of fact on the 2 questions:  Does the child indeed object; and has he or she attained an age and a degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of the child&#8217;s views?  Those have come to be called, for convenience, the &#8216;gateway&#8217; findings.  It is only if both questions are answered &#8216;yes&#8217; that the judge may go on to consider whether, as a matter of discretion, the return order would otherwise be mandatory under Article 12 ought to be refused.&#8221;</p>

I note that in Re: M (Abduction: Psychological Harm) (1997) 2 FLR at p.699 the Court of Appeal was considering the decision of Wilson J. who found that 2 children aged 9 &#189; and 7 were sufficiently mature for their wishes to satisfy the test in Article 13.

Firstly the court is not stopped from considering the objections of a child to returning to a parent.  Secondly the court has to be vigilant to ascertain and assess the reasons for the child&#8217;s objections to living with that parent.  Thirdly the court has to assess the ability of the child to understand the situation and whether he or she has valid reasons for not returning.</p>

However I am satisfied that he told them the contrary on the telephone.  It may have been because of his anger at the time or an attempt to influence the children to say they wanted to return to Australia, or some other reason.  It deeply upset the children.  It was one but far from the only reason for their objecting to a return.</p>

I have accepted the reason why the father did not act before May of 2004.  I am however entitled to look at the objections raised by the children and take into account in assessing their weight and validity that for the best part of a year they thought they were settled here and could get on with their lives.  I do so.</p>

I consider that the children are of an age and maturity where I should take account of their objections.  In so far as their objections are for their present situation, that is only the reverse of an objection to returning.  For that they have additional grounds.  They prefer their school, where they live, and their friends.  They also have a negative view of their father.  That negative view has a sound basis on the father&#8217;s conduct before they left and his attitude since then.</p>

But that period of time must inevitably add to the weight which the children give to their objections because for such a significant period they have rightly and understandably believed they are settled.  As I have indicated, a preference to stay here can be as much an objection to returning to Australia.</p>

Despite the whole tenor of the Hague Convention, I am quite satisfied it will be wrong to exercise my discretion in favour of returning the children to Australia.  Accordingly for those reasons this application fails.</p>
