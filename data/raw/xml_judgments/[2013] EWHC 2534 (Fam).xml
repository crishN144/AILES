Doing the best he can he puts the assets in the case (at least those assets his legal team have been able to trace in the absence of any proper disclosure by the husband), at about &#163;107m; of that figure some &#163;91.6m is represented by eleven commercial properties in Russia from which H&#8217;s business used to trade during the marriage. These properties were owned under the Pankratrov structure in the early days of these Part III proceedings but have been transferred to a newly created Belize structure during the course of the litigation. The remainder of the identified wealth is held in eight English properties worth together about &#163;141,002,337, of which &#163;5,857,830 represents 4 properties and a garage held by Pankratrov, Highlands and Carter. </p>

Pankratrov, Highlands and Carter argue that they own both the legal and beneficial interest in the properties in question and accordingly the wife can make no claim for the transfer to her of the properties, albeit she can seek the transfer of the husband&#8217;s 100% shareholding in Pankratrov. The wife argues that the husband has at all times retained the beneficial interest in the four properties (and garage), which include the husband&#8217;s London home and garage, and his country home in Northumberland. </p>

It is against this background that orders were made joining Yuri and the companies to the proceedings accompanied by orders for the wife to file formal pleadings against any entities in respect of which she contended the husband to have a beneficial interest. </p>

The only assets he has sought to protect are those in the UK and more particularly those under the Pankratrov umbrella which, significantly, include his homes.  That this is no co-incidence is demonstrated by the fact that, when the wife agreed to meet the husband in order to see if they could reach an agreement in relation to these proceedings he was reluctant to discuss the case except for saying that he had bought Broadwalk Way <span style="font-style:italic">for his own</span>.

I do not accept that to be the case. Not only, as I will set out in more detail in due course, is the husband a wholly unreliable historian but the Court also has the benefit of third party evidence from a woman called Ana Heurner, a family friend and employee of the husband from that period of their life. Ms Heurner&#8217;s evidence that the husband became prosperous after 1989 ties in with the fact that it was only in 1988 and 1989, after the extensive Gorbachev economic reforms and the demise of the Soviet planned economy, that the citizens of Russia had the opportunity to capitalise upon the existence of the new free market. </p>

Rather than renting premises from which to run his retail outlets the husband bought the properties.

Hitherto any property (3 to date) bought in London was owned by both of them either directly or through Snowden Properties. As the marriage collapsed, the wife says, the husband took steps to put the property out of her reach. To this end the wife alleges that in November 2007 the husband forged her signature on a share transfer form transferring her share in Snowden (and therefore her interest in Flat 1, Effes Road and Flat 6, Effes Road where she was living with the husband and the children), to a Nevisian company called Marsh Estate Limited.

The husband paid &#163;1.18m once again saying in his statement that it was funded from his <span style="font-style:italic">personal savings</span>. Although Highlands is a Nevis company owned by the husband, Yuri (then age 21) was made the sole director (but not a shareholder).  The result was that the two flats were to be held beneficially, the husband suggests by two different companies. </p>

Despite having transferred his instructions to Withers on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2010, it was only now he said that he understood completely what the Court required of him. The husband maintained the fiction that Pankratrov owned only the English properties, worth, he said, in the region of &#163;3.4m. No mention was made of the six Russian properties so far identified by the wife, worth together something in excess of &#163;48m. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">During the remainder of 2011, in the absence of proper disclosure from the husband, the wife continued in her endeavours to trace assets. On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2011 (11 months late), the husband finally replied to the wife&#8217;s questionnaire. The husband failed to answer the questions in any meaningful way, and used the document as a vehicle to attempt to unscramble the one reference to the properties in Russia which he had made in the October affidavit. In the October affidavit the husband had said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">after I stopped the business the properties were sold; I did not continue to own them or let them</span>&#8221;. That was clearly untrue as he still owned them. The questionnaire followed up asking the husband to identify, by address, all the properties that were sold. His response to that request was to say that the various properties had in fact been leased to him and not owned and therefore they were not sold but the leases were simply not renewed. He said that the mention of the properties being sold in his first affidavit had been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">an error of translation</span>&#8221; and should have referred to stock and assets and not to real property. In my judgment, that is a perfect example of the husband&#8217;s willingness not only to lie at will but to lie in the face of the incontrovertible evidence to the contrary as contained in Mr David Lister&#8217;s affidavit in support of the freezing orders in June 2011. </p>

I am not asked to make any orders in relation to these two companies but regard this as a further example of the husband sheltering behind his family and employees in order to maintain his anonymity, and confirming in the courts mind that through Snowden, Gagarin Tours and Palmers the husband has access to funds which even the effect of the wife&#8217;s legal team have been unable too unravel. </p>

There will be incidental differences for instances the tax implications &#8211; and these may be of some practical importance as we have seen. But at a basic level a wholly owned company cannot be seen by its shareholder either as a potential rival to him in claims of ownership of property, or as a potential recipient of bounty from him.

Notwithstanding that finding, I accept that the court should not over state the difficulty in rebutting the presumption in circumstances where an individual purchases a property in the name of a company where the company is controlled by the individual. The observations in <span style="font-style:italic">Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC, Stockholm Finance v Garden Holdings Inc</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Nightingale Mayfair Ltd v Mehta</span> do however now have to be viewed against the backdrop of Lord Sumption&#8217;s observations in <span style="font-style:italic">Prest</span> in relation to the matrimonial home: [51] </p>

In many, perhaps most cases, the occupation of the company's property as the matrimonial home of its controller will not be easily justified in the company's interest, especially if it is gratuitous. The intention will normally be that the spouse in control of the company intends to retain a degree of control over the matrimonial home which is not consistent with the company's beneficial ownership</span>&#8221; </p>

But in applying those rules one must have regard to the context, and the relevant context here is the law of ancillary relief and, more particularly, as Mr Dyer has correctly said, the rules which apply where the question is whether an ancillary relief order should be set aside as between the husband and the wife's estate. And in that context the relevant legal principles are those to be found in the authorities to which I have referred. Someone in the husband's position is to be treated as knowing what, with the exercise of due diligence, he would have discovered. But in this context there is not to be imputed to him something of which he was entirely unaware merely because it was within the knowledge of an agent or employee.&#8221; </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.99in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">The modification to which I have referred concerns the drawing of adverse inferences in claims for ancillary financial relief in matrimonial proceedings, which have some important distinctive features. There is a public interest in the proper maintenance of the wife by her former husband, especially (but not only) where the interests of the children are engaged. Partly for that reason, the proceedings although in form adversarial have a substantial inquisitorial element. The family finances will commonly have been the responsibility of the husband, so that although technically a claimant, the wife is in reality dependent on the disclosure and evidence of the husband to ascertain the extent of her proper claim. The concept of the burden of proof, which has always been one of the main factors inhibiting the drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of evidence or disclosure, cannot be applied in the same way to proceedings of this kind as it is in ordinary civil litigation. These considerations are not a licence to engage in pure speculation. But judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to draw on their experience and to take notice of the inherent probabilities when deciding what an uncommunicative husband is likely to be concealing. I refer to the husband because the husband is usually the economically dominant party, but of course the same applies to the economically dominant spouse whoever it is. </span></p>

The judge's findings about the ownership and control of the companies mean that the companies' refusal to co-operate with these proceedings is a course ultimately adopted on the direction of the husband. It is a fair inference from all these facts, taken cumulatively, that the main, if not the only, reason for the companies' failure to co-operate is to protect the London properties.

This Mr Wagstaffe suggests is a second important issue not argued in the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Prest </span>and requires determination. The husband, Mr Wagstaffe argues could not make good a claim against the companies based on his own dishonesty nor does the fact that it is the wife who pursues the claim rather than the husband cause that &#8220;fundamental principle&#8221; to apply with any less force. The dishonesty to which Mr Wagstaffe refers is the placing of the properties in the companies in order to avoid tax whilst at the same time retaining the beneficial interest. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In my judgment this is an argument without merit with which I deal only briefly. In the present case the husband had done nothing intrinsically unlawful in placing the properties in the names of the companies. I have found that the properties were not placed in the companies for tax reasons there is therefore no dishonesty on his part (by tax avoidance morphing into tax evasion), in retaining the beneficial interest. Moreover the doctrine of &#8216;clean hands&#8217; acts as a shield in the hands of a third party in the face of a claim made for an equitable remedy. In the present case there is no effective third party to rebut any claim of the husband as the company and the husband are one and the same, their mind and will are as one; not because the husband owns the companies, (the companies have a separate legal entity), but because the directors of the companies are mere nominees acting to the direction of the husband. The husband is Pankratrov and Pankratrov acts entirely upon the direction of the husband; he cannot seek to use the shield against himself. </p>

His tacit acceptance that the &#8216;budget&#8217; was not unreasonable is reflected in the fact that on 21 February 2011, Withers sent a cheque for &#163;357,040.54 to Mishcon de Reya representing the whole of the outstanding arrears of spousal maintenance and legal fees. </p>

I do not accept that the &#8216;work&#8217; done by the husband in the recent past would have been to the standard that he would have wanted for himself and therefore one cannot regard &#163;6.2m as the full &#8216;post renovation&#8217; value of the property. </p>

The starting point must be that the assets are shared equally. The husband has failed, whether in writing or by attending court to make any submissions to the contrary. The wife does not seek an order of in excess of 50% of the known assets to reflect the overwhelming likelihood that even yet the court does not know the full extent of the husband&#8217;s wealth. </p>

I have not had direct evidence in relation to the debt, but again the husband did not challenge its genuineness (at a then lower amount) at the interim maintenance hearing. Again the husband has not taken the opportunity to attend court to cross-examine the wife in relation to the debt and as to whether it is &#8216;hard&#8217; or &#8216;soft&#8217;. I am conscious that, unless and until the wife succeeds in enforcing the lump sum order the only assets from which she will be able to repay the debt are the proceeds of sale of the English properties. It seems likely that the undoubted generosity of the wife&#8217;s friends mean that they will not expect repayment until the wife&#8217;s circumstances permit her to do so but it seems to me that allowance must be made for its repayment.  </p>
