On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2022 he sustained a profound hypoxic ischaemic brain injury following a cardiac arrest, which occurred shortly after he was found limp in his cot with abnormal breathing.  An ambulance was called, and he was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. A return of spontaneous circulation was not established until his arrival. It is estimated that his brain was deprived of oxygen for approximately 30 minutes.  A was stabilised and transferred on the same day to the Evelina Children&#8217;s Hospital (&#8220;the Hospital&#8221;) where he remains intubated and ventilated on the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).</p>

Most examples from the world literature regarding infants verified dead using neurological criteria (brain dead) in who the situation reversed and who were, therefore, alive, followed medical errors in the performance of the tests. The most frequent of these was complying adequately with the preconditions required before brain death testing. Essentially, this means ensuring no other cause of the clinical situation &#8211; coma and absent brain stem reflexes &#8211; is present. In infants, this can be hypothermia (as a treatment or due to exposure), sedative drugs, endocrine system abnormalities or electrolyte issues. None of these was the case in A. </span></p>

I commenced by explaining that [A&#8217;s] brain injury was complicated with at least two aetiologies over at least two time periods. An initial brain injury led to his collapse on the 10th of June, was associated with subdural and subarachnoid bleeding, in the setting of bilateral multilayer retinal haemorrhages and multiple fractures of different ages AND then a &gt; forty-minute cardiac arrest led to a lack of oxygen and blood flow to an already damaged brain.&#8221;</span></p>

It is less likely to be damaged by lack of oxygen or blood flow than the more complex parts on the outside of our brains &#8211; the frontal lobes giving us personality and thought, the middle bit emotion, memory and understanding, hearing and the back bit the understanding vision and coordination. In the most severe brain injuries caused by lack of oxygen and blood flow to the brain, the outside structures are most severely affected, whilst sometimes the brain stem is not badly affected and continues working usually. The mechanism of action by which children become &#8216;brain dead&#8217; is not usually due to direct damage to the brain stem but due to severe swelling of the brain above it. As the brain swells, the pressure inside the brain cavity grows, but the brain cannot expand upwards as the skull acts as a close box; it can only push downwards, so the brainstem is pushed down through a small bony hole where the spinal cord comes off the brainstem, this can cut off the brainstem blood supply causing it to die. </span></p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">However, in infants such as A, the skull bones are not fused, so some of the swelling can be dealt with by the bones spreading apart and the skull expanding. It is possible that A&#8217;s brainstem was directly affected by the lack of blood and oxygen from the cardiac arrest, and then itself became very swollen. The extent to which parts of the brainstem have become irreversibly damaged and which parts temporarily impaired due to swelling, which eventually allows function to return, only becomes apparent over time. As with any child who survives the initial phase of a severe brain injury, the full extent of the damage can only be assessed after the initial swelling and inflammation have passed. For A, this is now very clear - he has sustained a severe level of damage to the brain, demonstrated by the clinical picture supported by imaging (MRI) and neurophysiology (EEG).&#8221;</span></p>

(20/07) A setting as high as 30 mmHg usually precludes elective tracheostomy insertion in infants and is not a level usually considered suitable for the institution of long-term ventilation. Usual potential complications of continuing PICU include the risk of infection, decreased ability to develop, experience and interact, and the pain and discomfort associated with mechanical ventilation and other interventions. For A, there is no current alternative to continued ICU other than withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and certain death. Sadly, in my opinion, issues of development, experience and interaction are not a realistic concern. Pain and discomfort are subjective, but due to the severity of his brain injury, it is impossible to assess either in A realistically.&#8221;</span></p>

In circumstances of this kind, and with a baby of this age, this is done per rectum. Dr Z told me, self-deprecatingly, how she initially thought this was unlikely and rather grandly, took the thermometer to undertake the task herself. The nurse was entirely correct, and it was impossible. Though the muscles around the chest are extremely rigid, some of A&#8217;s muscles are both flaccid and areflexic, including the sphincter. This is particularly important as, in recent weeks, A has lost the capacity to control his own body temperature and requires frequent warming by the nurses. Dr Z is a senior and very experienced consultant, she became visibly distressed as she recounted how A has pyjamas on him, a number of blankets and &#8216;all five bars&#8217; of the heating system in the cot switched on. </p>

His eyelids are also beginning to retract due to muscle stiffness, resulting in difficulty maintaining corneal hydration and his head circumference has begun to diminish. Despite the best efforts of his treating clinicians, A is now at risk of pneumothorax (collapsing of the lung) and iatrogenic pressure related lung injury (i.e., caused by the treatment itself) due to the need for high pressure ventilation.  A&#8217;s heart rate has also fallen from 140-190 beats per minute in July 2022 to 100 to 140 in August.  This is considered to be further evidence of general and significant decline.  It is impossible to escape the conclusion that treatment is futile, it protracts death rather than promotes life. Objectively, it now causes harm rather than alleviates suffering.

A did not display any response to pain when I assessed him, nor any external signs of experience such as pleasure or comfort. However, with disorders of consciousness, a single examination is inadequate. More useful are the accumulated observations of the medical and nursing team and of A&#8217;s dedicated parents, who spend considerable time with him. The nursing and medical staff do not describe or record any purposeful movements or reactions to pain. In addition, they do not see any signs of interaction or comfort from stimuli such as touch or voice, and there was no response to external noise/stimuli described on the concurrent EEG trace. A&#8217;s parents, whilst understanding the clinical diagnosis of severe irreversible brain injury, consider some of the changes in 1 above to indicate he is &#8216;there&#8217; and can experience and respond to the external environment. We spent time discussing these signs and their possible implications.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Brierley also addressed a number of the parents&#8217; specific concerns. The one that struck me most poignantly was F&#8217;s interest in the significance of a family trait he had noticed in his son. He told me that both he and his father experienced a hot and red right ear in childhood when they were embarrassed or had other strong emotions. He had seen this in A and was perplexed as to what signal that might be sending as to the severity of brain injury. Dr Brierley told him that this cutaneous flushing is well described in children and is an essentially benign physiological response in some children with vasodilation to the earlobes, leading to increased blood flow. F interpreted the presence of this as indicating a capacity to feel emotion. I found F&#8217;s observations and analysis to be subtle and intriguing. They also reflected his intimacy with his son. The simple truth is that Dr Brierley can offer no explanation other than to suggest that the autonomic nervous system also mediates vascular tone.</p>

However, the clinical team do not recognise the side-to-side movements as purposeful but consider them secondary head movements &#8211; though more up and down &#8211; due to A&#8217;s very pronounced truncal hypertonia and the effects of the mechanical ventilator. No such movements happened during my examination; however, I have not seen such minimal head movements in children indicate neurological improvement in severe brain injury.

The bottom of A&#8217;s brain, the brain stem, has some function left, as demonstrated by his respiratory effort (see 3). Autonomic nervous system activity is also a brain stem activity, so some heart rate variation may be present without indicating consciousness or emotion. I understand that there are no described heart rate changes to stimuli, such as suctioning. If changes in heart rate could be demonstrated to correlate with interaction such as parent voice or touch, this could support the existence of a level of awareness&#8221;. </span></p>

There is a recognition, by both, that when all else is paired down in this case, I am asked to balance concepts which are at very least difficult to reconcile, some might say, impossible. Dr Brierley is correct when he identifies the central tension in this case as being that between faith and medicine. </p>

The purpose of the best interests&#8217; test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;</span>&#160;(per Baroness Hale)</p>

A, I accept, is dying. The evidence of it is beyond any coherent contrary analysis. The parents recognise this. I give great weight to their faith and beliefs, which are deeply held and sustain them. During the course of this hearing, I declared that, with immediate effect, and prior to the delivery of this judgment, notice should be given to the clinical team that the Court had had declared that CPR should not be undertaken. The evidence was that it would have no prospect of success and would be compromising to the dignity of all involved were it to occur. I invited the parents to think carefully about it because it was a decision that I preferred to come from them as parents and not me as a Judge.

Nonetheless, the culture and faith into which A has been born is an important factor, however difficult it might be to calibrate the weight to be afforded to it. Ultimately, the severity of A&#8217;s brain injury, the complete absence of any ability to benefit from treatment, the impossibility of excluding potential for residual pain and the burden of the treatment itself illuminate mechanical ventilation as contrary to A&#8217;s best interests. </p>

To continue ventilation will serve here only to protract death. In simple terms, it would confer harm without conveying benefit.

The identified conditions necessary for the prognosis and confirmation of death (para 5) may need to be reviewed, as Dr Brierley suggests, particularly in the context of babies under 6 months of age and those with open fontanelles (as here). I have been told that the Royal Academy of Medical Colleges are considering their guidelines and that these are being reviewed, both at a national and international level. In other countries, for example, the USA and Australia, a test of whole brain death is applied. I should record that I have been told, that the application of this test here, would have yielded the same results. Dr Z has told me that the advice and guidelines are anticipated relatively quickly. Though I do not want to be prescriptive, I record that it strikes me that the appropriate application in most cases concerning infants, or at least until further guidance is received, is to make an application predicated on the patient&#8217;s best interests rather than to seek a certification of brain stem death. </p>

The hospital has made sensitive and family focused plans to continue to promote this.
