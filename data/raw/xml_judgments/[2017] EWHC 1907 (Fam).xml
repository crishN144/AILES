Permission and a stay were granted by Baker J on 25 May and the appeal hearing took place before me on 7 July.  Having heard from counsel for the appellant mother (Ms Warters), the father in person, and the solicitor for the child (Ms Early), I allowed the appeal and directed that the underlying proceedings be heard afresh by a different judge.  I gave brief reasons, now amplified in this judgment.</span></p>

The proceedings began with cross-applications by the parents in January 2013, when the child was aged three.  The child and father have not seen each other since then.  The mother opposes any contact, alleging that she suffered very serious abuse at the father&#8217;s hands.  The family proceedings remained in abeyance until May 2015, when the father was acquitted by the criminal court of all charges arising from the mother&#8217;s allegations.  The family proceedings were then promptly resumed, with detailed, appropriate directions being given by a Deputy District Judge with specific reference to Practice Direction 12J, requiring the father, who has throughout been unrepresented, to write down any questions that he wished to put to the mother, so that they could be put to her by the court.</span></p>

By the end of the week, astonishingly, her examination in chief had not concluded.

For her part, Ms Warters tenaciously sought to uphold the arrangements that had been made for her client&#8217;s protection, going so far as to suggest that the judge ought to recuse herself.

The repeated inability of the court to hold a fact-finding hearing has led to prolonged and indefensible delay in making an important decision for this young child.  When the court finally and belatedly began its task, it made no attempt to timetable the hearing to a conclusion.  Instead, the judge&#8217;s approach was, in her own words at the end of Day 2, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">&#8220;I will finish it when it finishes&#8230; It is no good charging along with this case as if we can finish it quickly.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt"> (transcript 8 March p.46).  </span></p>

The basis for taking special measures in these cases is the nature of the relationship between the parties, not the nature of the questions themselves.  The decision was also unworkable, in expecting the court and the father to divide up questions depending on whether they were &#8220;sexual&#8221; or not.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">Finally, the judge&#8217;s attempt to delegate the questioning to the child&#8217;s solicitor was entirely inappropriate and was rightly rebuffed.  Where a child is represented, the approach to questioning is a matter for the advocate&#8217;s professional judgment.  Often questions will be asked not only to advance the child&#8217;s case, but also to fill any gaps in the evidence in a way that the court will find helpful.  But it is wrong in principle for the court to expect the child&#8217;s lawyer to cross-examine the child&#8217;s own parent, &#8220;robustly&#8221; or otherwise, as a way of escaping the court&#8217;s responsibility to do this itself.     </span></p>
