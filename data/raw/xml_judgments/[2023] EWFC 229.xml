This included the still unpaid costs order in favour of W.</p>

If an ante-nuptial agreement deals with those matters in a way that the court might adopt absent such an agreement, there is no problem about giving effect to the agreement.  The problem arises where the agreement makes provisions that conflict with what the court would otherwise consider to be the requirements of fairness.  The fact of the agreement is capable of altering what is fair.  It is an important factor to be weighed in the balance.

The House of Lords in White v White <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 AC 596" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 AC 596</ref> and McFarlane v McFarlane <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 AC 618" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 AC 618</ref> drew a distinction between such property and matrimonial property accumulated in the course of the marriage.  That distinction is particularly significant where the parties make express agreement as to the disposal of such property in the event of the termination of the marriage.  There is nothing inherently unfair in such an agreement and there may be good objective justification for it, such as obligations towards existing family members.  As Rix LJ put it, at para 73:</p>

The circumstances of the parties often change over time in ways or to an extent which either cannot be or simply was not envisaged.  The longer the marriage has lasted, the more likely it is that this will be the case.  Once again we quote from the judgment of Rix LJ, at para 73:</p>

		    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;... I have in mind (and in this respect there is no real difference between an agreement made just before or just after a marriage) that a pre-nuptial agreement is intended to look forward over the whole period of  a marriage to the possibility of its ultimate failure and divorce: and thus it is potentially a longer lasting agreement than almost any other (apart from  a lease, and those are becoming shorter and subject to optional break  clauses).  Over the potential many decades of a marriage it is impossible to cater for the myriad different circumstances which may await its parties.  Thorpe LJ has mentioned the very relevant case of a second marriage between mature adults perhaps each with children of their own by their first marriages. However, equally or more typical will be the marriage of young persons, perhaps not yet adults, for whom the future is an entirely open book. If in such a case a pre-nuptial agreement should provide for no recovery by each spouse from the other in the event of  divorce, and the marriage should see the formation of a fortune which each  spouse had played an equal role in their different ways in creating, but the fortune was in the hands for the most part of one spouse rather than the other, would it be right to give the same weight to their early agreement as in another perhaps very different example?&#8221;</p>

The parties are unlikely to have intended that their ante-nuptial agreement should result, in the event of the marriage breaking up, in one partner being left in a predicament of real need, while the other enjoys a sufficiency or more, and such a result is likely to render it unfair to hold the parties to their agreement.  Equally if the devotion of one partner to looking after the family and the home has left the other free to accumulate wealth, it is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement that entitles the latter to retain all that he or she has earned.</p>

Thus it is in relation to the third strand, sharing, that the court will be most likely to make an order in the terms of the nuptial agreement in place of the order that it would otherwise have made.&#8221;</p>

The courts have shown themselves to be flexible on these matters, consistent with the discretionary exercise. By way of examples of meeting needs, and respecting the limitations intended by a PNA, courts have been willing to make housing provision on a trust basis, rather than outright. That was the solution in Radmacher itself, WW v HW (supra) and Luckwell v Limata <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 2 FLR 168" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 2 FLR 168</ref>, whereas in Ipecki v McConnell (supra) and AH v PH [2013] EWHC 3873 the housing provision was made outright. The term of such a trust basis has generally been for life, but sometimes with a step down in quantum at the conclusion of the children&#8217;s tertiary education; in Radmacher itself, occupancy of a property for life was not in fact coupled with a step down. </p>

Courts have not shied away from a capitalised maintenance sum. To reflect a PNA, that sum can be limited by the level of maintenance (the multiplicand) or the length of term (the multiplier). Thus, in Radmacher the capitalised maintenance sum was intended to last to the end of the children&#8217;s minority but not beyond. By contrast, in KA v MA (supra) the capitalised fund was on a whole life basis.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, in the ordinary course of events, where there is a valid prenuptial agreement, the terms of which amount to the wife having contracted out of a division of the assets based on sharing, a court is likely to regard fairness as demanding that she receives a settlement that is limited to that which provides for her needs. But whilst such an outcome may be considered to be more likely than not, that does not prescribe the outcome in every case. Even where there is an effective prenuptial agreement, the court remains under an obligation to take into account all the factors found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>, together with a proper consideration of all the circumstances, the first consideration being the welfare of any children. Such an approach may, albeit unusually, lead the court in its search for a fair outcome, to make an order which, contrary to the terms of an agreement, provides a settlement for the wife in excess of her needs. It should also be recognised that even in a case where the court considers a needs-based approach to be fair, the court will as in <span style="font-style:italic">KA v MA, </span>retain a degree of latitude when it comes to deciding on the level of generosity or frugality which should appropriately be brought to the assessment of those needs. </p>

If W wishes to choose these locations, she must pay the costs of any necessary works from her capitalised income award or the value of her own assets, to which I shall return. I therefore award a housing sum of up to &#163;2.6m.  This will attract SDLT which is added to the award of up to &#163;223k-&#163;300k depending on whether the second property provisions bite.

	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Property expenses - &#163;35k, the biggest deduction from W&#8217;s figure of &#163;51k being the removal of &#163;13k of her requested &#163;24k service charge.</p>
	    </content>
	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Utilities - &#163;5k</p>
	    </content>
	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Household expenses - &#163;30k, the biggest deduction being &#163;15k of W&#8217;s &#163;50k for the reduced cost of the housekeeper.</p>
	    </content>
	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Car expenses - &#163;10k. I note that W has given her car to one of her daughters but it is available for her when she wishes and she says that she still pays for its maintenance. If I have been over-generous to W in this item, I have compensated elsewhere.</p>

	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Personal expenses - &#163;30k, the biggest reduction from W&#8217;s claim of &#163;64k being the removal of &#163;10k of her clothing allowance and a general reduction of costs across the board.</p>
	    </content>
	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Leisure - &#163;30k, the biggest reduction being &#163;12k on holidays and a general reduction across the board. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_80">
	  <num>80.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not allow any sum for life insurance or additional sums for the small figures for accountancy and bank charges which can be subsumed within her budget.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_81">
	  <num>81.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties have provided a schedule from which I have drawn the appropriate figure. Capitalisation of &#163;140k requites payment of &#163;2.269m. </p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_82">
	  <num>82.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I then have to consider what sums W has available to her to put towards her income fund.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_83">
	  <num>83.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I regard H&#8217;s suggestion that I should deduct her assets of &#163;555k if I select a figure for capitalised maintenance of over &#163;2m but ignore it if less than &#163;2m as without logic. Whether the figure is just above or below &#163;2m should not lead to such a dramatic consequence.  I do however agree with Mr Trowell KC that there is an attraction in saying that these funds should be left intact for her to use to buy furniture for her new home, pay the small sum (a bit over &#163;10k) required to obtain a full state pension, and meet the incidental expenses of moving.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_84">
	  <num>84.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In deciding not to reduce the award by any part of this figure, I also bear in mind that the vast bulk of it represents the small property in Malta which W owns and which I am told needs work being done to it (for which I have not made provision) before it can be sold. I do not know how long it might take to sell. It may not be speedy. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_85">
	  <num>85.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties have agreed that H should have up to three months to raise the necessary funds and that W should have three months from the date of receipt of her lump sum to move out. Plainly, she must be kept comfortable in the matrimonial home until she vacates. I do not intend to go further than that in this judgment despite the parties&#8217; disagreements.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties have run many other arguments before me. It is clear that there is significant bad feeling between them. This is most unfortunate. I have attempted to limit the ambit of this judgment to what is important to the outcome.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My search must be to find a fair solution.  I have to apply all the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(2)</ref> MCA factors in my search for a fair outcome.  Fairness is done to the parties by looking at all the circumstances of the case, including the terms that the parties had agreed.  What I have provided is intended to provide fairness between them in those circumstances. </p>
