While reserving his position should the matter proceed to a higher court, he accepted that the ultimate test is one of best interests, albeit the views of parents who have a viable alternative is a powerful consideration. </p>

The dispute between the Trust and the parents is about provision of ongoing invasive treatment. To seek a transfer to a different clinical team is all part of the issue before the court now (albeit not at the hearing before me on 9 October 2023), namely whether it is in IG&#8217;s best interests for particular treatment to be administered or withdrawn. </p>

Nevertheless in the end the responsibility for the decision whether to give or to withhold consent is that of the court alone. It follows from this that a child who is a ward of court should be treated medically in exactly the same way as one who is not, the only difference being that the doctors will be looking to the court rather than to the parents for any necessary consents. No one can dictate the treatment to be given to the child, neither court, parents nor doctors. There are checks and balances. The doctors can recommend treatment A in preference to treatment B. They can also refuse to adopt treatment C on the grounds that it is medically contra-indicated or for some other reason is a treatment which they could not conscientiously administer. The court or parents for their part can refuse to consent to treatment A or B or both, but cannot insist upon treatment C. The inevitable and desirable result is that choice of treatment is in some measure a joint decision of the doctors and the court or parents."</span></p>

The essence, as I understand it, is that the Trust&#8217;s refusal to cooperate in IG&#8217;s proposed move to a hospital in Rome constitutes a breach of IG&#8217;s human rights as exercised by her parents. It seems to me that if the court declines to sanction a move to Rome, as it clearly has power to do, it would have to do so on the basis that any interference with human rights would be both necessary and proportionate to give effect to the best interests finding. I do not consider that the human rights submission goes further than that. Further, as the Guardian points out, the Supreme Court dismissed on 20 April 2018 an application for permission to appeal in the Alfie Evans case which included similar human rights arguments. Again, however, it did not seem to me that F&#8217;s counsel were in fact challenging the long-standing proposition that the guiding principle in these cases is the best interests of the child.</p>

I have expressed the view that Professor Khan&#8217;s opinion is undermined for a variety of reasons, which therefore in turn undermines Dr Walsh&#8217;s report.  I also consider that the provision of &#8220;assumptions&#8221; in this way by F&#8217;s new solicitors to Dr Walsh was not appropriate. The stated assumptions are simply incorrect. They do not reflect my judgment, and my findings. There was nothing before me to suggest that these treatments are &#8220;neutralising&#8221; the detrimental effects of the condition. On the contrary, I found at para 8 of my judgment that &#8220;Recent therapies (medication, use of citrate and a ketogenic diet) have led to a reduction in the frequency of the desaturation episodes, but the overall prognosis is unchanged, and the plan is being implemented as a compassionate measure rather than in expectation that it will lead to improvement&#8221;. For the avoidance of doubt, I was satisfied that there was no material benefit from these treatments to the progression of her conditions. They have been administered for several months, but she has deteriorated irreversibly. And to posit that the damage to her brain is not such as to deprive her of a reasonable quality of life is the opposite of what I found, namely that her various conditions have resulted in her being unable to engage with the outside world or experience any meaningful quality of life.</p>

He sensibly defers to other professionals as to the severity of IG&#8217;s condition. He does not suggest that a catheter or stent would improve outcome. He opines nothing to contradict the evidence of the Trust, including two external hospital cardiological teams who would not be willing to offer cardiological treatment given her unstable condition and the futility of such treatment. Cardiac treatment was fully considered by the treating clinicians, and by me at the final hearing, and I accepted the evidence that it would not be appropriate (see for example paras 32(x) and 40 of the judgment).  </p>

Although the hospital intends to prepare a detailed treatment plan, no Italian clinician has assessed IG, and it is therefore not possible to predict what their medical approach would in fact be in the event of transfer.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">My reading of 41c. above is that they might well continue to intubate IG and they do not rule out invasive treatment. Counsel for F accepted this is probably the case. Certainly, F would wish those options to be kept open. Given that I have found cardiac intervention (suggested at 41a.) and other invasive treatment (encompassed by, or at least not ruled out by, 40c.) to be inappropriate, what would be the benefit of transfer to Rome? The answer is that, on the evidence and my earlier judgment, there is none. On the contrary, continuation of such treatment would, on my findings, perpetuate a high level of pain and suffering for IG. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already commented on the proposal by the Rome hospital for cardiac intervention. The evidence before me was that cardiac intervention is inappropriate because of the severity of the underlying conditions, IG&#8217;s instability and the lack of prospect of any meaningful quality of life, and the ongoing burden and pain of invasive treatment. It will not cure her conditions. Nothing which I have seen since my judgment has given cause to re-assess that finding. As previously mentioned, the cardiological aspects cannot be considered in isolation from other aspects of her presentation, including D-2/L-2 and severe bilateral progressive ventriculomegaly. IG is an individual who is the subject of an array of complex, interlocking morbidities. No one treatment can unlock all the diagnoses and transform her prognosis. Any treatment for one condition has an impact on other conditions, and an impact on IG herself. It seems to me that to assert baldly that the insertion of a stent for her cardiological condition can improve the combination of all conditions and symptoms assailing her is somewhat simplistic and not consistent with the evidence I received, nor with my findings. The best interests decision on cardiac treatment has been reached, and F is unable to demonstrate that it should be reversed. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I reached a clear conclusion that invasive life sustaining treatment is no longer appropriate for IG. The substantial burdens of such treatment significantly outweigh any perceived (but in my judgment negligible) benefit, in a context where her life expectancy is very short, and her conditions irreversible. Put another way, there is nothing to suggest that IG&#8217;s prognosis would be beneficially altered by the Italian hospital&#8217;s treatment. On the contrary, it may well prolong pain and suffering if and to the extent that it incorporates invasive procedures which in my judgment are not in IG&#8217;s best interests, and should not be sanctioned. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have in mind also the potential impact on IG of the logistics of the proposed move to Rome. This has not been explored in any detail, but it is acknowledged by leading counsel for F that the proposed transfer carries extra risk for IG, albeit on F&#8217;s case that risk is outweighed by the potential benefit. I cannot discount the possibility that the process of transfer will increase the distress and suffering which IG experiences. She is highly unstable. To remove her from her current specialist clinical team for the transfer, and commit her into the care of the air ambulance doctor and nurse who have minimal knowledge of her immensely complex health issues, as a matter of common sense is not without risk. I have some doubt about whether the air ambulance would be willing to undertake this task once they carry out a full assessment and appreciate the complex specialist medical requirements, which is a pre-requisite before they commit to such a transfer. </p>
