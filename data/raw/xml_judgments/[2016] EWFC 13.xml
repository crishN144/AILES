Its direct impact on adult and child victims is well known, but it can also have secondary effects.  One of those is the demoralisation of an adult victim, disabling the ring of protection that the adult would normally offer to a child.  In an extreme case, of which this is one, the result can be fatal.</span></p>

A decision needs to be taken next week about whether he can return to his parents or to the care of his mother alone or to other family members.  A central question is whether the father represents a risk to J and his mother, based on past events.  </span></p>

This was a result of an assault by the father on the mother, which led to her going into a refuge.  When the family background was investigated, the father&#8217;s history was discovered.</span></p>

Unusually, it concerns events that took place over 20 years ago.  The events did not involve J&#8217;s mother, who only met the father in 2011 and did not come to hear of them until March 2015.</span></p>

She was born in March 1994 and died in May 1994 at the age of 10 weeks.  She was the only child of the father and of C, who (as we are speaking of her child) I will from now on call the mother, although she is not of course the mother of J.  </span></p>

The parents were arrested and questioned.  The father was charged with murder, and spent some months in custody, but the charge was later dropped.  </span></p>

In 1995, she had another child by a different father and the local authority brought family proceedings.  The baby was placed in foster care at birth, but went home at the age of 11 months under a care order.  This outcome was successful, and the care order was discharged in 2001.  In 1998, the mother had a third child in respect of whom no proceedings were taken.</span></p>

Unfortunately, neither the parties nor the court thought it necessary to establish the facts.  The father was not involved in those proceedings at all.  Accordingly, these proceedings in relation to J are the first time that a court has investigated A&#8217;s injuries and death.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The inquiry is a narrow one.  There is no doubt that A suffered serious and fatal injuries that could only have been caused by one of her parents.  The questions that arise are: which parent was responsible, and did the other parent fail to protect?  The possible answers to the main question are that one or other parent was responsible, or that it is not possible to exclude either of them.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The local authority brings this case and must like anyone else discharge the burden of proving facts on the balance of probabilities.  It alleges that the father was responsible for A&#8217;s death and that the mother failed to protect her.  In this, it is supported by the submissions on behalf of J&#8217;s mother and his Guardian.  A&#8217;s parents blame each other.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">On behalf of the Guardian, Miss Bispham has drawn attention to some conflicting judicial statements, some of which suggest that Guardians may be expected to maintain neutrality in fact-finding hearings.  For my own part, I do not believe that one can generalise.  Guardians and their lawyers should decide for themselves how they can best represent the child.  In almost all cases, the court will be assisted by some analysis of the evidence from the child&#8217;s independent standpoint.  As to the further step of seeking or supporting findings, there may be circumstances in which the Guardian concludes that the other parties have provided the court with the full range of possibilities and that it is not necessary to take sides, bearing in mind the effect on the parties&#8217; perceptions at the welfare stage.  In other cases, the Guardian may wish to seek distinctive findings.  There may be a number of other good reasons why it is appropriate for a Guardian to play a full part in the fact-finding process.  In my view, the decision of the Guardian to do so in this case is an entirely proper one.</span></p>

The fact that a person lies about one thing does not mean that they are lying about other things.  The possible reasons for the lies have to be considered in the light of all the circumstances.</span></p>

Given the distance in time since the events that they were describing, I approached their evidence with caution.  I was prepared to concede that it might not be possible to base conclusions about the behaviour of parents who were then in their 20s on evidence given by them in their 40s.  In fact, I have found the parents&#8217; evidence and the manner in which they gave it to be of real significance in identifying where the truth lies.</span></p>

His self-description as a very patient person who never lost control of himself was constantly contradicted by more convincing accounts.  His evidence lacked any genuine emotion.  He was unapologetic and incurious.  Even when he was confronted with obvious truths, he refused to accept them.  Asked about things that he would be bound to know, he repeatedly took refuge in assertions that he had no recollection or that he vaguely remembered.  During his four hours in the witness box, there was no sense of a man who was being wrongly accused of a terrible offence.  He showed no anger towards the mother.  Indeed, although his case is that she was responsible for A&#8217;s death, he could scarcely bring himself to suggest it.  His self-centred view can be seen in his attempt to explain why the mother should have accused him of harming A:</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> &#8220;To make me look like a bad person.&#8221;  </span><span style="font-size:12pt">It did not occur to him that if (as he claimed) the mother was really lying, her motive would be to cover up the fact that she had killed his daughter.    </span></p>

She was a most impressive witness.  Her evidence bore out the universal description of her as being a gentle, quiet and shy individual.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"/><span style="font-size:12pt">Her memory was incomplete where one would expect it to be, and compelling in relation to events that mattered.  Her maternal feeling for A (and her two living children, brought up by her without incident) shone through her evidence.  Her anguish and guilt that she failed to act on the warning signs were painfully genuine.  The one occasion when she had been untruthful to the police was in my assessment a lie suggested by the father and she immediately corrected it when she realised that it might be important.  Asked how she felt at being accused of harming A, she replied </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"Upset, angry I suppose, and frustrated because people have only my word against his.&#8221;</span></p>

I have considered whether the explanation for this is to be found in the passage of time.  I am clear that that is not the explanation here: rather, it is because one parent is telling the truth and the other is lying.  </span></p>

He had a three-year relationship with a young woman, Ms P.  She gave birth to a child in 1989.  The father was present at the birth, but soon drifted out of the child&#8217;s life.  Ms P accused the father of violence towards her, including during her pregnancy.  The father denies this, though he accepts that he thumped a door during an argument and I also note that in 1991, he was fined for a public order offence.  The father then had a relationship with a Ms B, which lasted for about a year.  In April 1993, he met the mother.  She quickly became pregnant, and in October of that year, they moved into a ground floor flat, consisting of no more than a bedroom, a sitting-room, a kitchen and a bathroom.  </span></p>

He was upset when she became pregnant and began to show signs of temper, of which she gave instances.  She described how a disagreement would turn into a row, he would become angry, she would become upset, then he would say that she was soft or that he had been joking.  He would punch or kick the living room and bedroom doors in temper, damaging them as seen in the photographs, or throw glasses or ornaments.  On occasions he would strike her or grab her and he once threw a drink in her face.  He would complain when she went out, but went out himself whenever he wanted.</span></p>

The first was a kitten.  The mother describes the father as having squeezed it to make it defecate.  For whatever reason, the kitten died and the next pet, a terrier, was sent back as being too snappy.  A puppy was then brought home.  One day at New Year, the mother came home to find it limping.  The father said that he had kicked it because it had made a mess, though he later backed down from that explanation.  The mother took the dog to the vet and its leg was found to be fractured in two places.  The leg was treated and the dog returned home.  Shortly afterwards (its leg still being in plaster) it received a cut on its head that needed stitches.  This was caused by the father breaking a plate on its head in temper.  The mother was nearby and came in to find the father holding the broken plate.  He said that he had got aggravated with it, though he later claimed it had been an accident.  Asked at this hearing to explain how an accident could have caused the injury, he had nothing to say.  The mother took the dog back to the vet, and explained what had happened.  The vet refused to allow the dog to go back to the house and it went to the mother&#8217;s parents before being rehomed.  The mother&#8217;s father was furious, but the father did nothing to retrieve the animal or explain himself.</span></p>

He discouraged her from meeting her friends (one of whom had tried to warn her about his behaviour towards his former girlfriend, Ms P), so she took the line of least resistance and stayed in.  His repeated abuse of the puppy shows a man with no patience and a capacity for cruelty to helpless creatures.  Of great concern is the mother&#8217;s account that she felt frightened of aggravating him and that she tried to keep the peace by not giving him a reason to get upset or angry.  I also note and accept her evidence that the father did not like her sharing her attention with anyone else, whether it was a friend, a pet, or a baby.    </span></p>

She and her mother were discharged from hospital three days later.  The father attended the birth.  The mother describes A as having been absolutely perfect, and the father as being helpful initially.  At first A was an easy child, but by the end of March, she was having difficulties in feeding.  She was admitted to hospital between 31 March and 4 April with a urinary tract infection.  A chest x-ray was taken during this admission and gave no cause for concern.  On 20 April, the parents took A to the clinic for her six-week developmental assessment.  The health visitor was concerned about her poor skin colour and her blank expression and she was admitted to hospital overnight.  She returned to hospital once again between 29 April and 2 May with another urinary tract infection.  She was described as irritable, fretful, miserable, pale, and feeding poorly.  Three possible bruises were seen on the right side of her face.  On 4 May, A was seen with her mother at the clinic and nothing abnormal was noted.   </span></p>

The father would tend to be up first in the morning, while the mother would do any overnight care.  When A was feeding well and remaining quiet, the father was willing to do his share of feeding and dressing her, but when A refused to take a feed or to be consoled, he would swiftly pass her to the mother or (as on her last day) the mother&#8217;s sister.  On at least one occasion, he squeezed A on the pretext that she was constipated and would be more comfortable if she could empty her bowels.  On occasions he would become aggravated and hold A in one hand or put her down roughly into her chair or cot or onto the bed, sometimes holding her with one hand around the upper body.  That is the mother&#8217;s evidence, and I accept it.</span></p>

She went into the living room.  She found A face down in her cot.  As she picked her up and turned her over she realised that A was cold and that her face was covered in purple blotches.  She screamed and dropped her back into the cot.  She ran to a neighbour&#8217;s house to call an ambulance.</span></p>

The father says that this was either the mother&#8217;s idea or a joint decision.  I do not accept that.  The mother was in no state to make plans of that sort, but she agreed that it looked better that A had died in the bedroom than alone in the sitting room.</span></p>

My assessment is that the mother was unwilling to misrepresent the position once she realised that details of that kind were important.

During this period, he wrote a document bearing the date 13 June 1994.  In it, he gives an account of events that he did not give during the course of his lengthy interviews.  It appears that this document, which was not seen by anybody until the end of 2015, found its way into the papers now before the court as a result of the process of disclosure from the police archive.  The father had it in his possession when he attended a Magistrates Court hearing later in June 1994.  It seems that it was removed from him during the course of the search, but the investigating officers never came to see it.  Had they done so, they would have interviewed further.</span></p>

Until the letter was discovered the father gave no account of the mother being up in the night, or of A crying.   Even at the time, the father said nothing of this kind to anybody, whether to the police or his family or his lawyers, even though he was in custody facing a charge of murder.  The first his own mother knew of these allegations was when she gave evidence at this hearing.  The father was unable to explain any of this.  </span></p>

Even on the basis of the mother&#8217;s account, this point deserves consideration.  The mother knew that the father was capable of being rough, but she says that she did not see any significant injury to A.  My conclusion is that this aspect of the matter has to be looked at in the overall context.  The mother was herself in a vulnerable position.  She was an inexperienced parent, no more than 20 years old and under considerable pressure from the father.  She repeatedly took A for medical care when, as she put it, she was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;not herself&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:12pt">.  It is also to be noted that the doctors and other health professionals did not identify any bony injuries, including the arm injury which might have been the most obvious.

This analysis includes the absence of any information from the non-abusing parent, the lack of any account of intense, persistent crying, the limited opportunity for injury to be caused in such a small flat without the knowledge of both parents, and the evidence of Dr Smith on these issues.  Having considered it, I agree with the submission made by Ms Bispham that these considerations do not point inexorably to the conclusion that the other parent must have known what was happening.  Dr Smith said that the expectation would be serious crying, then gradual quietening as the consequences of the injury and swelling cause unconsciousness; she would expect moaning or </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"whimpering to the point where the child became unconscious."  </span><span style="font-size:12pt">This is not unlike what the mother describes, and certainly not sufficiently unlike it to render her evidence unworthy of belief.</span></p>
