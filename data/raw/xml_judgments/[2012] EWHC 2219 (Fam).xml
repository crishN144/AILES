He was told that he could and booked the date.  The Petitioner knew nothing about the need for notice or a certificate or any of the formal requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref> and made no enquiries beyond his discussion with the Chairman of the Mosque.  He accepted the Chairman&#8217;s response that he and the Respondent could get married at the Mosque.  In the course of his oral evidence the Petitioner said that he relied entirely on the Chairman and the Imam to tell him what was required.  He also said that he and the Respondent feel they have been let down by the Chairman and the Imam.  I agree with this observation.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The ceremony in this case took place on [a date in] 2002 at the Mosque.  The parties attended with the Petitioner&#8217;s sisters and the Respondent&#8217;s sister.  They were met by the Chairman and the Imam.  The ceremony was conducted by the Imam.  Mr Luft was present during the ceremony.  The parties were asked words to the effect of whether there was any reason why they could not marry and whether they both freely consented to marry.  It was clearly a ceremony of marriage in which the parties each agreed to take the other as husband/wife.  After the ceremony the Respondent asked the Imam whether they were now married or whether there was anything else they needed to do.  He assured them that they were and that there was not.  The parties signed a register book of some description and were provided with a document signed by the Imam and headed &#8220;Contract of Marriage&#8221;.  This certifies that the &#8220;Marriage Contract was concluded according to Islamic Sharia &#8230;&#8221; and that the marriage was &#8220;proposed by&#8221; the Petitioner and &#8220;accepted by&#8221; the Respondent in the presence of two named witnesses.  One of the witnesses is the Chairman of the Mosque who, as I have said, has been an authorised person under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref> since 1998.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">Mr Allam, the Imam, understandably, has no specific recollection of the ceremony in this case.  He was first appointed an Imam of the Mosque in 1996.  He worked there, as a deputy to a more senior Imam, from 1996 to 1998.  He was then appointed as the Imam of the Central Mosque in Middlesbrough where he stayed until March 2002 when he returned to the Abubakr Mosque following the departure of the previous Imam.  As I have said, Mr Allam was not an authorised person until February 2003.  In his oral evidence he said that his practice has changed since he became an authorised person.  At the time of the ceremony in this case he did not discuss with the parties whether they wanted &#8220;just&#8221; a religious marriage or whether they wanted a civil marriage as well.  He believed that he was performing a religious ceremony only.  He knew about the requirements for a civil marriage but he did not discuss these with the parties in this case at all.  </p>

However, she relies on the presumption of marriage, which arises both from cohabitation and reputation and from a ceremony of marriage followed by cohabitation, and on the meaning and effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.  Whilst Miss Proops recognises that the presumption of marriage may not be sufficient in this case, she submits that the presumption is a manifestation of &#8220;public policy which is generally to support marriages&#8221;.</p>

He submits that public policy requires strict observance of the rules which govern the formation of marriage and that it would be contrary to public policy to permit the rules to be circumvented in the manner sought in this case.  It would cause confusion and uncertainty in an area where certainty is clearly in the public interest.  He also submits that ignorance on the part of the Petitioner and the Respondent cannot transform what took place in this case into a valid marriage.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">I fully accept that there is a clear public interest in marriages being subject to certain formal requirements, including in particular proper registration, so that their existence can be relatively easily established.  This is in the interests of the State and of the parties to the marriage.  The status of marriage is an important status which carries with it a variety of rights and obligations under English law.  It is in the interests of those wishing to marry in England both to know whether the ceremony they propose to undertake does or does not create a valid marriage under English law, with all the consequent rights and obligations, and subsequently to be able to prove that they have entered into a marriage recognised as valid under the law of England and Wales.   Accordingly, as Mr Gupta sets out in his written submissions, statutory provisions provide that marriages in England and Wales must be in one of the forms now set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>, must be preceded by preliminaries in one of the forms authorised in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and must be followed by registration.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">However, the courts have long been inclined to uphold the existence of a marriage by, for example, applying the presumption as relied on by Miss Proops.  As Ormrod J (as he then was) said in <span style="font-style:italic">Collett v Collett</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1968] P 482" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1968">[1968] P 482</ref>, at p. 492:</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.83in;margin-right:0.83in">&#8220;In my judgment, the principle which emerges from the corpus of legislation regulating the formation of marriages in England and from the reported cases arising there from is that, if a ceremony of marriage has actually taken place which, as a ceremony, would be sufficient to constitute a valid marriage, the courts will hold the marriage valid unless constrained by express statutory enactment to hold otherwise.  This is consistent with the traditional concept both of the common law and of the canon law that the essence of marriage is the formal exchange of voluntary consents to take one another for husband and wife&#8221;.</p>

In order to alleviate the consequences of non-compliance it was provided, by section 22, that a marriage would be void only if &#8220;any persons shall knowingly and wilfully&#8221; marry in breach of certain of the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo4/4/76" uk:canonical="1823 (4 Geo. 4) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>.

The requirements  which were included within this provision were &#8211; marriages without due publication of banns or without a licence from a person having authority to grant the same; marriages in any place other than a church or chapel where banns may be lawfully published; and marriages solemnised by any person not being in holy orders.  As stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Bromley</span>, in all other cases a marriage was valid notwithstanding any breach of any of the other requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo4/4/76" uk:canonical="1823 (4 Geo. 4) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1823 Act</ref> (such as, the presence of two witnesses).

By that act it was intended to enforce with the utmost rigour the form and mode in which all marriages should be solemnised, by the serious penalty of nullity if the very words of the statute were not complied with. By the present act in order to render a marriage null and void, both the parties to the marriage must have wilfully violated the act with a full knowledge of the consequences; here is, therefore, a striking difference between the two statutes, and what may have been done with reference to the former marriage act can have little effect with regard to the construction of the present act.&#8221;</p>

Second, that, viewing the successive Marriage Acts, it appears that prohibitory words, without a declaration of nullity, were not considered by the Legislature as creating a nullity, and that this is a legislative interpretation of acts relative to marriage.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">It is also instructive to consider some of the authorities dealing with the application of the presumptions in favour of marriage because they provide examples of the circumstances in which a marriage has been determined to have been effected when, self-evidently, it cannot be demonstrated that the requirements of the relevant statutory provisions have been fulfilled and the marriage has not or cannot be shown to have been registered.  The presumption applies to fill the evidential gaps and clearly does so on the basis that the ceremony, as a ceremony, is sufficient to bring it within the potential scope of the relevant statutory provisions: i.e. a ceremony of the kind contemplated by those provisions.</p>

A clear example of what would be outside it might be a staged dramatic marriage &#8216;ceremony&#8217; conducted in a play or in the course of a television soap opera. Another might be the exchange of promises between small children.

In England a marriage can only be effected under the Marriage Acts, either according to the rites of the Church of England (Part II of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>) or under certificate of the Superintendent Registrar (Part III). A marriage which purports to be conducted under these Acts may nevertheless be void for want of formality. Not every breach of the required formalities has this effect, but some do. They are set out in s<span style="font-family:Arial">&#8201;</span><span style="font-family:Verdana">25 and 49 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>. But unless a marriage </span>purports to be of the kind contemplated by the Marriage <span style="text-transform:uppercase">A</span>cts, it is not, I hold, a marriage for the purposes of s<span style="font-family:Arial">&#8201;</span><span style="font-family:Verdana">11 of the Matrim</span>onial Causes Act 1973. No doubt it is possible to envisage cases where the question whether a particular ceremony or other event does or does not purport to be a marriage of the kind contemplated by the Marriage Acts is a fine one. <span class="Emphasis" style="color:#000000">Gereis v Yagoub</span>&#160;<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 854" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 854</ref> was one such, where His Honour Judge Aglionby concluded that but for the absence of notice to the superintendent registrar and the lack of registration of the building the ceremony would have been one valid in English law; the decision may have been a merciful one. It is clear, however, that the present ceremony did not begin to purport to be a marriage according to the Marriage Acts, with or without fatal defects. It was not conducted under the rites of the Church of England, nor was there ever any question of an application for, still less a grant of, a superintendent registrar&#8217;s certificate, and it was conducted in a flat which was clearly none of the places which were authorised for marriage. The ceremony was consciously an Islamic one rather than such as is contemplated by the Marriage Acts. Just as in <span class="Emphasis" style="color:#000000">Regina v Bham</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1966] 1 QB 159" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1966">[1966] 1 QB 159</ref>, nobody purported to conduct or take part in a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Marriage Act 1949</ref> ceremony, and the fact that no one applied their mind to how English law would view what they did does not alter that conclusion. It is not any question of polygamy which ipso facto takes this ceremony outside s<span style="font-family:Arial">&#8201;</span><span style="font-family:Verdana">11, but the fact that it in no sense purported to be effected</span> according to the Marriage Acts, which provide for the only way of marrying in England. The fact that the husband was known by all concerned to have another existing wife is of course one important reason why this was so. It follows that I hold that the 1980 ceremony is neither a valid marriage in English law nor one in respect of which jurisdiction exists to grant a decree of nullity.&#8221;</p>

The ascertainment of intentions and beliefs will often be difficult and unreliable and their use alone could run into the problem of different participants in or at the ceremony intending and believing different things, as occurred here amongst the guests, although not as between the three main participants. Reliance, as per Mr Le Grice&#8217;s suggestion, on the assumed perception of &#8216;the reasonable guest&#8217; is problematic, since it involves a fiction and begs many of the same questions as the &#8216;hallmarks&#8217; test.

I have no doubt that intention is relevant to the status achieved or not achieved by a questionable ceremony, as being one of the many considerations which need to be taken into account. It is particularly relevant in the presumably unusual circumstances where the parties did not intend to create a valid marriage, or where they realised that for some reason they would not be able to do so. But the converse does not apply. It is not the law, in my judgment, where no or minimal steps are taken to comply with the Marriage Acts and so the marriage does not set out or purport to be a marriage under those Acts, that it nevertheless suffices if the participants hopefully intended, or believed, that the ceremony would create one.</p>

Accordingly, the marriage was &#8220;non-existent&#8221; under English law as &#8220;it did not even purport to be a marriage under the provisions of the Marriage Acts&#8221; having regard to the failure to comply with the requirements as to &#8220;notification, use of a registered or approved venue, form, authorisation of the officiant and subsequent registration&#8221; [36].</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">In my judgment, the central issue is whether what took place in this case is sufficiently within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref> for the marriage to be capable of being a valid marriage under English law.  As Bodey J identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Hudson v Leigh</span> the approach to whether a given ceremony has resulted in a non-marriage has been formulated in a number of different ways.  Is the marriage &#8220;of the kind&#8221; permitted by English law or &#8220;<span style="color:#000000">in a form known to and recognised by our law as capable of producing, when there performed, a valid marriage&#8221;?

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">I have come to this conclusion because, despite the submissions of Miss Proops, I do not consider that the presumption of marriage can be applied in this case so as to enable me to find that all the necessary requirements were fulfilled.  The evidence clearly establishes, as is accepted, that some of the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> were not fulfilled &#8211; notably, the failure to give notice to the registrar and, as a result, the marriage being solemnised without any certificate having been issued.  It is an evidential presumption and as such can be rebutted.  As was said by Evans LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Bath</span>, &#8220;when there is positive evidence that the statutory requirements were not complied with, then the presumption cannot be relied upon to establish that they were&#8221;.  There is clear and compelling positive evidence to that effect in the present case and accordingly, in my judgment, the presumption cannot be relied upon to establish that the relevant missing statutory requirements were fulfilled.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The Law Commission also commented on what was referred to as a &#8220;growing mischief &#8211; namely, the deliberate solemnisation of invalid marriages&#8221; (para. 136).  I believe &#8216;deliberate&#8217; was used in the sense that the manner in which the marriage was solemnised was deliberate, rather than that there was a deliberate intent to contract an invalid marriage, although, of course, the latter could also occur.  Concern was expressed that in many cases &#8220;both parties, and probably the bride in nearly all of them, think that a proper marriage has been contracted and enter into cohabitation in that belief&#8221;.  I do not know the extent to which this is still true (although the recent authorities referred to above might suggest that it is a not uncommon issue) but, as referred to earlier in this judgment, in my view there is a public interest in marriages which have been contracted in England resulting in the obligations and rights consequent on marriage (including a void marriage) being imposed on and afforded to the parties to such marriages.  Further, I consider there is a significant obligation on those solemnising marriages which might fall within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref> to adhere to its requirements.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Collett</span> Ormrod J had to decide whether there had been a valid marriage under the provisions of the Foreign Marriage Act 1892.  The facts of that case are instructive.  The ceremony had taken place in Prague in 1948.  The parties had agreed to marry but as the wife was leaving the country she was detained by the Communist authorities and interrogated for several hours.  She was released on condition that she returned to the Ministry of the Interior the next morning.  As Ormrod J says, &#8220;hurried arrangements&#8221; were made for the parties to be married.  The ceremony took place in the presence of the authorised person (the marriage officer who was the ambassador), in the authorised premises (being the official house of the ambassador, namely the consulate) and the parties had exchanged the requisite declarations.  Ormrod J decided that, &#8220;the actual ceremony of marriage was properly performed and was in all essentials a marriage&#8221;, p. 489 G.  Due to the evident urgency, among other defects, none of the notice requirements were fulfilled and the marriage was not registered.  An informal certificate was provided by the priest who had officiated.</p>

In an earlier decision, <span style="font-style:italic">Kalinowska v Kalinowska</span> (1964) Sol Jo 260, Ormrod J had used stark language to explain the need for there to have been a ceremony which would be sufficient as a ceremony to constitute a valid marriage:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Collett</span>, applying the principles he had identified, Ormrod J decided that most of the provisions of the 1892 Act contained directory rather than mandatory provisions.  These included the giving of notice, the filing and entering of such notice, the taking of an oath and the registration of the marriage.  The crucial provisions were those which dealt with the solemnisation of the marriage.   Section 1 provides that all marriages &#8220;solemnised in the manner in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Will4/6-7/85" uk:canonical="1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4) c. 85" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref>&#8221; are valid and the only section which deals with solemnisation is section 8(2). Ormrod found that all the requirements of this sub-section had been fulfilled: place, time, presence of witnesses, solemnised by marriage officer.  This was so even though section 8(1) required 14 days to elapse between notice of an intended marriage and the marriage being solemnised.</p>

In particular there is no provision similar to that set out in section 1 of the 1892 Act.  There is also no clear route to identifying which requirements are &#8216;essential&#8217; for a ceremony to be within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>.

As was pointed out by the Law Commission (para. 120), &#8220;Unfortunately these two classes do not cover the whole ground.  There are some requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Will4/6-7/85" uk:canonical="1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4) c. 85" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> which are not included in either&#8221;.  Further, if the failures expressly covered by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref> have the consequence stipulated, it is difficult to see how they can also cause a ceremony to create a &#8216;non-marriage&#8217;.  This could certainly not be the consequence of those failures which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref> expressly provides will not affect the validity of the marriage.  It is also difficult to see how this could be the consequence of a failure to comply with those requirements which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Will4/6-7/85" uk:canonical="1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4) c. 85" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> expressly provides will result in a void marriage.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">Further, the public policy considerations do not directly address the issue of when a ceremony is potentially within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>, save to the extent that the greater the departure from <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>, the more powerful the argument that the ceremony is one wholly outside its provisions.  In my judgment, the answer to the question of when a ceremony in England is not wholly outside the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref> and will accordingly create a potentially valid marriage should be determined by reference to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref> applied in a manner which is consistent with the principles summarised by Ormrod J in <span style="font-style:italic">Collett</span> and taking into account the factors referred to by Bodey J in <span style="font-style:italic">Hudson v Leigh</span>.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">It is clear in the present case that the parties intended to contract a marriage which is valid under English law.  The Imam thought that he was &#8220;only&#8221; conducting a religious ceremony but he did not discuss this with anyone else, including the parties or the Chairman of the Mosque.  The Chairman, an authorised person, was present and, indeed, acted as a witness.  I have not heard evidence from him but there is nothing to suggest that he did not consider that the parties were contracting a valid marriage in accordance with what he had told the Petitioner.  Even if he too considered that what was being performed was &#8220;only&#8221; a religious ceremony, I would not consider this would have any material effect on my decision in this case.  The parties were still intending to contract a valid marriage.  However, I agree with Bodey J that intention alone is unlikely to be sufficient to make a marriage potentially valid under English law.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">In addition in this case, the ceremony which took place was sufficient &#8220;as a ceremony&#8221; to constitute a valid marriage.  The fact that the ceremony was conducted according to Islamic Sharia does not mean that the ceremony &#8220;as a ceremony&#8221; could not be within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>.  As referred to above, parties are permitted to adopt such form or ceremony as they &#8220;see fit to adopt&#8221;.  The ceremony in this case was clearly a ceremony of marriage.  It was made plain that the parties were taking one another as wife and husband.  If necessary, it was also made plain that there was no lawful impediment to their marriage.   I say, if necessary, because it is by no means clear that a failure to comply with this requirement would render a marriage void.</p>

The essential elements are the place of the ceremony and the presence of one of the designated officials.  It is these elements which have been sufficient to justify the application of the presumption in favour of marriage.  As explained above, the application of the presumption must be based on the marriage being capable of having been a valid marriage.  In addition to the factors referred to in paragraphs 97 and 98, the marriage in this case was solemnised in a registered building and in the presence of an authorised person.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The parties failed to give notice to the superintendent registrar and there was no certificate.  There is no statutory provision which results in a marriage being void because it was solemnised without notice or certificate, but is otherwise within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>, unless the parties knowingly and wilfully married without having complied with these requirements.   It is clear from, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Wright v Elwood</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Greaves v Greaves</span> that the failure to comply with the preliminaries &#8211; the publication of banns or obtaining a licence - does not, by itself, affect the validity of a marriage.  Such a failure will only result in the marriage being void if the failure is deliberate, in the sense that the parties are knowingly aware of the failure: <span style="font-style:italic">Dormer v Williams</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Greaves v Greaves</span>.  Further, it is clear that the failure to give notice or obtain a certificate do not prevent a marriage from being within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">Accordingly, in my judgment, the ceremony of marriage in this case was within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>.  It was a ceremony of marriage conducted in a registered building in the presence of an authorised person.  It was &#8220;of the kind&#8221; permitted by English law and in a form capable of producing a valid marriage.  In my view, what Ormrod J said about the ceremony in <span style="font-style:italic">Collett</span>, namely &#8220;the actual ceremony of marriage was properly performed and was in all essentials a marriage&#8221;, is equally applicable to the ceremony which took place in this case.  The ceremony therefore created a potentially valid marriage.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The next question is whether the marriage is in fact valid or is void.  Applying the approach which has been maintained since the beginning of the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century, a marriage will only be held to be void if this is expressly provided by the statute.  The relevant provision is <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 49</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1949 Act</ref>.  Because the parties did not knowingly and wilfully marry in breach of the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> as specified in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 49</ref> (essentially notice and certificate) the marriage is not void.  </p>
