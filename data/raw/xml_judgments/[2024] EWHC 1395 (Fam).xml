	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father is a British citizen. The mother is a Thai citizen. In June 2017 the mother became pregnant by the father. Nora was born in Thailand in March 2018. At that time the mother was married under Islamic law to a Norwegian citizen Mr Brown, and he was registered as Nora&#8217;s father. The father discovered Nora&#8217;s birth and established his paternity following DNA tests. Her birth certificate was amended. Not surprisingly the mother&#8217;s marriage to  Mr  Brown fell apart. In January 2019 mother travelled to England on a tourist Visa and Nora travelled with her parents on her British passport. By then the mother was pregnant with Felicity. In July 2019 she returned to Thailand, her tourist Visa having expired. In September the father and Nora travelled to Thailand for Felicity&#8217;s birth. Following an argument in November 2019, the police and children&#8217;s services in Thailand became involved. Documents record an agreement that permitted the father to return to England with Noraon the basis that he would marry the mother and resolve her Visa position to enable her and Felicity to travel to England. That never happened and with the intervention of COVID the two branches of the family lived separate lives in England and in Thailand. They were reunited in December 2022 when the father and Nora travelled to Thailand. The mother retained Nora in Thailand despite the father&#8217;s attempts to covertly remove her from the country. He returned to England and commenced wardship proceedings.</p>

That is the case whether the subject case involves England and no other country, another Contracting State or a non-Contracting State: Re A (A Child) (Habitual Residence: 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention)<span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">&#160;</span>[2023] EWCA Civ 659 [49-51]  and Re S (Children: Parentage and Jurisdiction) [2023] EWCA Civ 897.

It is that &#8216;first port of call&#8217; approach which underlies some of the difficulties that have been experienced in interpreting and applying the 1996 HCPC including the issue of change of jurisdiction and the applicability of Article 7 to non-Contracting States. The Lagarde Explanatory Report   at paragraph 6 points out that the purpose of Chapter II on Jurisdiction is to eliminate competition between (Contracting) States in taking measures for the protection of children rather than to create a universal jurisdictional framework which displaces domestic systems which would apply generally and in particular when a non-Contracting state was the competing jurisdiction. The wrestling that the courts have undertaken with the proper interpretation of Art 5 and 7 (for instance) would be unnecessary if we interpreted the effect of 1996 HCPC as only applying to determination of jurisdiction as between Contracting States and we applied &#8216;domestic&#8217; law to other situations. However the current state of the law as determined by the Court of Appeal with Supreme Court jurisprudence in the background is that the 1996 HCPC is the first port of call and unless and until the UKSC rules differently we will have to continue to try to undertake the mental gymnastics necessary to apply 1996 HCPC provisions to cases where the Convention doesn&#8217;t apply to the competing jurisdiction. </span></p>

In that case the Court concluded that the court must consider jurisdiction at the start of proceedings &#8211; in order to establish whether it had any jurisdiction [113]. They went on to consider the effect of a change in the child&#8217;s habitual residence in the course of proceedings. At para 116, the Court concluded that in a case where the other country concerned was a Contracting State that England would lose jurisdiction and the other country would acquire jurisdiction if habitual residence changed in the course of proceedings. What the Court of Appeal did not explore was the effect of Article 13 in such a situation to enable the court seised to conclude its determination and which prevents the courts of another country embarking on proceedings when proceedings are already pending in another Contracting State. The 1996 HCPC provides its own internal mechanisms for resolving such jurisdictional issues which are inapplicable in cases involving non-Contracting States.  However, for the purposes of this case what is important is what the Court of Appeal said about a change of habitual residence where the other country is a non-Contracting State because Ms Chokowry argues that Nora has, as at February 2024, acquired habitual residence in Thailand. The Court of Appeal   said at paragraph 117:</span></p>

In the former case, the other State acquires Article 5 jurisdiction.  In the latter case, the other State does not.  The consequence is that, in the  former, the original State cannot retain jurisdiction by reference to domestic law, while  in the latter case, it can.  In my view, this is unlikely to cause difficulties if the child  has moved from the State in which the proceedings have been taking place, because the  court would be likely to have sanctioned the move and would have needed to consider the consequences of such a move, including as to jurisdiction and  </span></p>

As it is obiter it may be that this will need to be considered further in an appropriate case. However, for the purposes of this case, the Court of Appeal is clear that jurisdiction can be retained even if habitual residence has shifted to Thailand. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Court of Appeal also concluded [107] that the 1996 HCPC did not operate to deprive a Contracting State of any jurisdiction they might have under their own domestic law. In the Hackney case the court was considering the position where a child might be present in England but habitually resident in a non-Contracting State rather than the position here where the child was habitually resident in England and subsequently was not present and arguably became habitually resident in Thailand. The thrust of the Court of Appeal judgment would suggest that where habitual residence changes to a non-Contracting state, the Court looks to its &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">domestic law&#8217; </span>to see if it has retained jurisdiction. That is potentially somewhat circular as the 1996 HCPC has been incorporated into domestic law and is the &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">first port of call&#8217; </span>but I think that what the Court is referring to by &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">domestic law&#8217;</span> is the non-1996 HCPC jurisdictional rules and so in this case FLA 1986 s.2(1)(b)(ii) and 2(3)(b)(i). </p>

Ms Chokowry on behalf of the mother  submits that the first port of call is the 1996 HCPC framework but she accepts that if for any reason (for instance Nora is now habitually resident in Thailand) the 1996 HCPC does not apply,  that the FLA 1986 jurisdiction would apply and that if Nora was habitually resident at the relevant date in England that the court would have the full substantive habitual residence jurisdiction which could be exercised now. Although I think that Ms Cabeza&#8217;s analysis is probably more consistent with the intent of the drafters of the 1996 HCPC the way it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal means that Ms Chokowry&#8217;s approach is that which must be followed. </p>

In addition, the court has jurisdiction to grant parental responsibility (issued on 31 August 2023) because by operation of FLA 1986 s.7 the relevant date for second or subsequent applications is the date of the first application so reconsideration of jurisdiction should not be necessary in most cases.  Given this domestic jurisdiction would exist, determination of Nora&#8217;s habitual residence now is not relevant to whether the court has jurisdiction although it might be relevant to whether it should exercise that jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given that the provisions of s.3 FLA 1986 would give jurisdiction based on habitual residence at the time of issue, if the case falls outside the scope of the 1996 HCPC, any further consideration of other potentially relevant issues such as Article 7, are rather arid territory as being of little practical effect. I suppose theoretically if Art 7 operates to retain Art 5 jurisdiction there might be scope for arguing that in deciding whether to exercise it and if so, how, there could be a difference to the s.3 FLA jurisdiction but at present I can&#8217;t see them, as primarily the court will be looking at the no order principle and paramount welfare in the absence of any forum conveniens or stay application. As it was raised in submissions, I shall nonetheless refer briefly to the arguments about Article 7 which were raised.   In Re H [2014] EWCA Civ 1101, the Court of Appeal had held that Article 10 BIIA applied when the other state concerned was not a member state; the consequence being that jurisdiction could not be lost in some circumstances as habitual residence could never be acquired in another Member State as specified in Article 10. However the CJEU in SS-v-MCP (Case C-60320 PPU) held that Article 10 only applied where the two countries concerned were European Union member states. Ms Chokowry submits that the trend of authorities in the High Court has been to conclude that Article 7 has no relevance where the other state involved is a non-Contracting State (see for instance SS v MCP (No.2) [2021] 4 FLR 140 ; MZ v RZ (Hague Convention 1996: Habitual Residence: Inward Return) [2021] EWHC 2490 (Fam) ; H-v-R the Embassy of the State of Libya [2022] EWHC 1073 (Fam)). In the &#8216;Hackney&#8217; case at para 117 Moylan LJ identified the potential relevance of Article 7 in retaining jurisdiction but as it did not arise for determination in that case the Court did not express a view on its relevance in cases involving a non-Contracting state.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have not heard detailed submissions on the applicability of Article 7 where the other state where habitual residence may have been acquired is a non-Contracting State as time did not allow a full exploration of all material which might bear upon that issue and in the event it may not matter in this case because Ms Chokowry accepts that if habitual residence is now in Thailand that the determination of the jurisdiction of the court would move from the 1996 HCPC framework into the &#8216;residual&#8217; domestic jurisdictional framework in section 2(1) (b)(ii) and 2(3)(b)(i); namely the habitual residence of the child at the time the first application was issued.  I observe that the determination of the CJEU on Art 10 BIIA is not directly applicable to Art 7 1996 HCPC because they dealt with different instruments but also in particular because Article 7 1996 HCPC refers to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;..until the child has acquired a habitual residence in another State..&#8217;  </span>not <span style="font-style:italic">another Contracting State</span> and so it may be that there is a distinction. It is clear from other Articles of the 1996 HCPC that where it refers to a <span style="font-style:italic">state</span> it tends to differentiate between a <span style="font-style:italic">Contracting State</span> or a <span style="font-style:italic">non-Contracting State</span> and so the reference to a <span style="font-style:italic">State </span>without any descriptive preceding adjective is curious. Applying the principles deployed by the CJEU would tend to support an interpretation that Article 7 only applied between contracting states and thus was irrelevant for the purposes of this case. However applying the more literal approach seen in Re H, which was subsequently referred to by the Supreme Court without disapproval suggests that Article 7 should be applied according to a literal reading of the words. On that basis it would apply to any other state. The issue would not arise if we only applied the 1996 HCPC to cases involving two contracting states; if that were so, clearly it would not apply to a non-Contracting State. However, as we have chosen to apply the 1996 HCPC to ALL jurisdictional disputes as the first port of call it is harder to apply the SS-v-MCP logic particularly when on its literal reading it is not limited to Contracting States. No doubt in an appropriate case the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court will be able to shed further (and binding) light on this. </p>

The fact that the father did not have choate parental rights under Thai or English law would suggest Article 7 could not apply, as submitted by Ms Chokowry, but countering that is the argument that the mother&#8217;s delegation of care to him in November 2019 would be sufficient under English and 1980 Hague Abduction Convention law to give him inchoate rights and a further counter that if the mother&#8217;s consent was achieved by the father&#8217;s deception whether her delegation of care was effective to give inchoate rights. Ms Chokowry submitted the deception would vitiate the delegation of care. S.3(5) ChA1989 might be relevant.  All very interesting but an arid exercise if it is accepted (as it is by the mother) that if the court doesn&#8217;t have jurisdiction within the confines of 1996 HCPC (&#8216;..the Hague Convention doesn&#8217;t apply to use the language of s.2(1)(b) FLA 1986 )  the court looks at habitual residence at the time of issue.</p>

The intentions of the parents could not override the objective identification of where the child has in fact resided having regard to the importance of proximity.

The judge must take sufficiently into account the facts relevant to the old and new lives of the child and the family although need not necessarily do so in a side by side analysis of the sort carried out by Lord Wilson in Re B as long as it is apparent from the judgment as a whole that the exercise has been undertaken. Objective factors which support geographical proximity are likely to be more decisive than subjective factors such as national origins and future intentions but both are to be considered. Temporary absences from the country of their everyday lives, even if measured in months does not alter the country of habitual residence. Ms Cabeza identified a small cohort of cases where a child had been found not to have acquired habitual residence because their presence was pursuant to a court order which could not be made final until their immigration status (or similar) were determined and this prevented acquisition of habitual residence even though they were present for periods measured in many months or years. I regard those as being fact-specific examples where a degree of uncertainty undermined integration. Ms Cabeza referred to them to argue that Nora could not have become habitually resident in Thailand even now because a return order had been in force since 1 March 2023. </p>

Unlike BIIA (Article 14) the1996 Hague Convention is silent on the issue of residual jurisdiction; it neither confirms its existence nor excludes it. I do not consider that a long-standing jurisdiction would have been terminated by the changes effected by our departure from the EU and the replacement of BIIA as the primary jurisdictional vehicle with the 1996 Hague Convention. If Parliament had intended to remove entirely the parens patriae jurisdiction by the amendments to the statutory framework arising from our departure from the EU I conclude it would have needed to and wished to expressly exclude it.

Orders specifying who Nora was to live with and the time she was to spend with the other parent, are not available. The order that would be available would be one requiring that Nora or Felicity be returned to this jurisdiction. Ms Chokowry points out that the parens patriae jurisdiction should not be used to empower the court to make substantive welfare orders following the child&#8217;s arrival based on presence when the court has no real substantive jurisdiction.

It is an order that is potentially governed by the 1996 Hague Convention it falling within Art 3(a) 1996 HCPC, and Ms Cabeza acknowledges that if another Contracting State had jurisdiction under Art.5 of the 1996 Hague Convention, this court would not have jurisdiction to make that order.

As is recognised within the definition, the practice may involve children who are abandoned with or separated from their mother and in this case this might cover Nora&#8217;s separation from her mother from November 2019 &#8211; December 2022.  As I noted in the course of submissions whilst the father&#8217;s behaviour (if proved) could not meet the definition of transnational marriage abandonment it could still amount to a form of emotional and/or financial abuse if by his deceit and inaction he created a situation which separated the mother and Felicity from Nora. Human behaviour or misbehaviour towards one another is so varied in its range and may differ according to culture that I don&#8217;t think one needs to create closed categories. What one is always looking at is whether the substance of the behaviour can properly be described as abusive. </p>

It is difficult therefore to separate the pattern from the specific events said to establish the pattern. In this case every one of the mother's allegations is denied by the father. The court cannot make findings about a pattern of behaviour without evaluating the evidence in relation to specific incidents that allegedly contributed to that pattern. The difficulty is in identifying a limited number of incidents that would, if proved, establish a pattern of behaviour. Some specific instances of behaviour will not constitute abuse themselves and may appear to be relatively trivial if looked at in isolation but are in fact important evidence of a pattern of abuse, or the effects of abuse, when set alongside other findings. For example, there is evidence in this case of the mother texting the father to ask if she can use the toilet in his bedroom. Arguably, she did so because she was conditioned by him to ask his permission to perform many of her activities of daily living. How does the court keep a finding of fact hearing within proportionate and manageable limits without filtering out what might be highly relevant evidence of coercion or control?</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I observe that whilst findings may not amount to coercive behaviour either because they do not constitute assault, threat, humiliation or intimidation or that they were not intended to harm punish or frighten the victim they may still be emotionally abusive and relevant to future decision making. Patterns of behaviour or acts of behaviour may not primarily be designed to make the victim subordinate or dependent and may thus not amount to controlling behaviour but may still amount to abuse and, even if not abuse, may amount to self-centred, dictatorial or unsupportive behaviour (not an exhaustive list) which may be relevant to answering the ultimate question of what is in the child&#8217;s welfare. One particular reason for avoiding criminal concepts in the family court is that it may tend to promote a focusing on the label attached to the behaviour and whether the criminal act has been proved, which self-evidently is inappropriate for a family court determining matters on the balance of probabilities but also may promote a binary approach to behaviour as being relevant if proved but irrelevant if not proved. Much behaviour may still be relevant in welfare terms even if it is not &#8216;criminal&#8217; or does not fall within the definition of &#8216;domestic abuse&#8217; because the family court is always looking at the substance of the behaviour and its impact on the child or other parent and what effect that has on the formulation of what order will best promote the child&#8217;s welfare. It is also important to note that in evaluating patterns of behaviour and their motivation one should seek to place any pattern identified within the overall context of the multitude of facets of behaviour which a relationship will consist of as this may assist in identifying the intention of the perpetrator, if any, in conducting that pattern. This may inform the determination of whether it might amount to coercive or controlling behaviour as being intended to have the effects required by the definition, whether it is unintentional but still amounts to abusive behaviour or whether seen in a holistic context it is perhaps simply a manifestation of, for instance, selfishness which does not amount to abuse.   </p>

A lie is capable of amounting to corroboration if it is (a) deliberate, (b) relates to a material issue, and (c) is motivated by a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth:  <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-C (Children) </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 136 at paragraphs [97-100]. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, the honesty or dishonesty of a party does not sound only in <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span> terms, where it may positively corroborate an allegation but is of course of more general relevance in determining what weight should be given to a party&#8217;s evidence. A witness who has been found to be unreliable or dishonest is likely to find their evidence is given less weight than that of a witness who has been found to be generally reliable and honest. In cases where the court finds itself largely reliant on evidence emanating from only two individuals &#8211; as is often the reality in domestic abuse cases &#8211; the outcome may be heavily influenced by the fact that the court finds one party to be generally honest and/or reliable and the other dishonest and/or unreliable. Of course, in reaching that conclusion as to credibility, the court will be considering a wide canvas including the consistency of the accounts over time, the internal consistency or coherence of the evidence, consistency with other evidence documentary or otherwise, inherent probability as well as demeanour.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I remind myself that in relation to historic matters the memory is a potentially fallible source of evidence. See the <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin</span> case. In this case both parties are giving evidence about events which are up to 7 years old.  Evidence may be honestly and sincerely given but be false. The passage of time and the repeating of allegations in court and discussion outside court can undoubtedly result in memory creep. Inconsistency in accounts separated in time does not necessarily mean the accounts are not honestly given. Reliance on demeanour also requires some care particularly in a case such as this; applying general assumptions as to how a victim of domestic abuse could be expected to present are inappropriate.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As with most issues of evaluation of evidence it is of course always a question of fact and degree in which the consistency of evidence with previous accounts or with other evidence must be the subject of scrutiny and balance. The consistency of witness testimony with earlier accounts given by the same witness, its consistency with other witness or documentary evidence particularly contemporaneous records or digital footprints, the internal consistency or credibility of an account are all (non-exclusive) matters that go into the overall evaluation of witness reliability or credibility. In some cases where the only evidence available is that of two individuals &#8211; a rare case, as there will usually be some other evidence from other domains which sheds light on their  reliability or honesty, or from others as to the dynamic between them, which might illustrate the probability of the matter &#8211; then the behaviour or demeanour of each in giving their evidence might assume a greater importance, but even then, the court is unlikely to be left with only their behaviour or demeanour as a gauge for their honesty or reliability because the content of their testimony, together with what the court can gauge of the dynamic that exists between the two from their behaviour in court, or even the way their case is put, will form part of the totality of the light that is available to the court to illuminate where probability lies. An approach which takes account of the content of oral and written evidence, its consistency internally and with other evidence and, in particular, with any contemporary documentary material or other supporting evidence is essential in putting into effect the non-compartmentalised, broad panoramic view which the authorities mandate. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father gave evidence first. He was very softly spoken and said this was a result of damage to his spine and there were many occasions when he had to be asked to repeat what he had said. This soft speech was not really evident in the video recordings and I wondered whether the stress of the process was playing a role in subduing the father. However, the low volume level did not prevent him being determined and assertive in his evidence often speaking over counsel or myself. He was throughout his evidence vague or imprecise and his evidence rarely contained a description of events which had the quality of recalling a lived experience but were in the main disconnected. One example which did have the character of a genuine recall was around the assault on him by the mother&#8217;s family which had a spontaneity and connection which contrasted with other accounts such as the mother punching herself or the assault on 26 December 2023. He was often evasive, failing to answer the question put to him and deflecting onto some matter critical of the mother (often referring to her violence out of context) or giving an answer relevant to a different period of time.  He asserted that the whole time Nora was in England the mother never bothered to contact her &#8211; which on his own evidence was clearly not true but was an example of his tendency to hyperbole or exaggeration; his and his mother&#8217;s description of the assault by the maternal family preventing him working for 3 years; circumcision equals &#8220;chopping my dick off&#8221;; his exaggeration of his work/finances, his own description of the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2023 incident which suggested a very violent assault which was not borne out by the video. The father subsequently sought hospital treatment for alleged injury to his genitals although nothing on the video suggests he experienced any pain or discomfort from anything the mother did.  His evidence was often misleading or contradictory of his earlier accounts. He said there was nothing stopping the mother coming back after November 2019 but immediately had to accept she would have had to be sponsored (at least). His statements and letter to the British Embassy said they had been in a relationship from November 2016, speaking daily and looking forward to the pregnancy. In evidence, he asserted she had been two timing him with Mr Halle, they had infrequent contact until he returned in December 2017 and that he had not provided any financial support in the first 6 months of her pregnancy. This of course was entirely consistent with the mother&#8217;s account that after he discovered the pregnancy, he had in effect abandoned her, making no commitment to her, providing no support and giving her good cause to look elsewhere for her future and that of her baby. Both the father&#8217;s mother and the father via counsel asserted he had provided financial support to her following the discovery of her pregnancy although no financial records exist of any support. Only cash withdrawals around the time of Felicity&#8217;s birth were provided, which do not evidence any money being transferred to the mother. The father was occasionally frankly dishonest. He was prepared to lie (on his account) to the British Embassy to support the mother&#8217;s visitor Visa application dated 18 September 2018 although he belatedly sought to say that this was written by his own father and the mother. The date of the emails suggest it was forwarded to the mother after its submission. In that letter he said he discovered the mother was pregnant whilst in Thailand which tied in with the mother&#8217;s and maternal grandmother&#8217;s accounts but in court he maintained he found out only after he had returned to England. He said in evidence she was violent to him on the day after his birthday but elsewhere said she became violent after her arrival in England.  He asserted that when the mother was in England he contacted the British Embassy in London to find out about visas and at times seemed to make evidence up on the hoof; his evidence about the attempts he made to get her a work visa whilst in England had that character, as did his assertion that he withheld Nora passports in June 2019 when the mother returned to Thailand, because someone told him a Thai national could not be in possession of their child&#8217;s UK passport. He said he left Thailand so rapidly in November 2019 because Covid was already present there; its first outbreak was in China in December 2019 with the first case in Thailand being early in 2020. He also said in late 2022 he was willing to get her a visitor visa, but he was both unable to identify how much he needed to sponsor that or to say where the money would have come from. The mother had of course paid for his flight. He said he understood from the mother she had plenty of money in the bank so she could have used that; quite where she would have got this and how this sat with what she herself said in the text exchanges is another example of the father&#8217;s willingness to deploy misleading evidence to the court and to try to mislead the mother. His efforts to get her to the Embassy after she had taken Nora were not because he thought there was any realistic prospect of getting a visa but to get her before officials who he, no doubt, hoped would assist in recovering Nora. </p>

He maintained that when he met the mother&#8217;s family that she did not translate for him and that he had no idea that her family had discussed the expectation that he would marry the mother. The maternal grandmother and the mother were clear this was discussed and whilst it is of course theoretically possible that the mother played a very clever act (she is certainly capable of it) in leading her family to believe he had agreed to marry her in conversations whilst not conveying that to the father but rather suppressing all that her parents and brothers were saying in this regard it is hard to see how the language, body language and other interactions could not have betrayed the fundamental deception that the mother was perpetrating on them all.    He also maintained that he did not know what the mother intended when she came to England but that she was clear Nora was to live here and be educated here. This not only was contradicted by the paternal grandmother&#8217;s evidence and the mother&#8217;s, but defied common sense and the initial attempts to get a family or partner visa for the mother and his later acceptance that they discussed making a go of it as family in England. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father comes across as man who does as he wants and has little capacity for self-sacrifice. Strangely he says he still speaks virtually no Thai &#8211; he said he could ask for a beer and hence he says he could not have known that the maternal family were discussing marriage or that this was a topic when the police were involved in November 2019. I got the impression from his reaction to some of the mother&#8217;s evidence that he understood some of what she was saying before it was interpreted and that his Thai was more extensive than he said. Having said that he has never sought to learn Thai and took no active steps to enable Nora to maintain her Thai language in the period November 2019 -December 2022 such that she could barely communicate with her sister or maternal family. This seems consistent with his rather dismissive attitude to the mother (he referred at one point to her &#8216;not behaving herself)&#8217; and his lack of empathy for, or understanding of, others. It might also be a consequence of his rather lethargic approach to other aspects of his life where he seems to lack the energy or commitment to put himself out unless it suits his own needs. His almost complete absence of action to secure the mother&#8217;s visa position after she returned to Thailand is the most gross example of this, but one gets an impression of a man who finds it hard to commit to anything very much. He seems to have spent a significant part of the years I am concerned with floating from and to Thailand, working for short periods in rather unspecific capacities, living with his parents and making little headway in life. His inability to commit to the mother and the children to secure their presence in England by hook or by crook highlights this in contrast to what others might have done. He is clearly a man who finds it difficult to take responsibility for events or perhaps for himself. On almost any issue where he might be criticised it would not be his responsibility. The letter to the Embassy was his father and the mother. His lack of financial support was because of covid and illness. He would maintain he was in hospital for a year to the mother to explain why he had not acted to support her or get a visa &#8211; although this was clearly not true. He couldn&#8217;t travel to Thailand or get a visa for the mother because of Covid travel restrictions; although they ended long before he did travel.  He couldn&#8217;t get her a visa as it was not possible as she insisted on marriage; although he had done nothing active to secure any other form of visa. He would say he couldn&#8217;t afford to sponsor her because he couldn&#8217;t work although his mother said that prior to 2019 he was doing well and he told me that he was a property developer giving the impression he was in it in some quite substantial way albeit when pressed he backed off and eventually appeared to suggest he owned no property and all the funds came from elsewhere. He is clearly unwilling to make much if any sacrifice personally to ensure his children could come to England. The contrast with Mr Brown is quite interesting &#8211; he was prepared to marry, to get circumcised and to adopt Islam and indeed was initially prepared to accept Nora even when he knew she was not his. The father was not and is not prepared to. Marriage inevitably requires the parties to give up some of their autonomy, in this case the father was also required to surrender a small piece of his anatomy. He was prepared to give up neither even though it was the best way to secure a future in England for the mother and his daughters and he had led her and others to believe he would.  Given the issues of the mother&#8217;s visa were central to their lives and to this case the lack of evidence from the father about it, and the lack of clarity in what he did say demonstrated beyond anything else how little he had actually done to resolve it despite his obvious commitments (most notably in November 2019) but at earlier times as well to address it. No evidence of advice being sought from immigration specialists, no applications to the Home Office, no effort to save and put himself in a position to sponsor the mother, no evidence of seeking opportunities to get the mother work and a sponsor for her. The silence is deafening. </p>

He has a significant tendency to exaggerate whether it relates to his work and finances or otherwise. There were only rare moments of frankness. These traits appear to carry over into aspects of his personal life and are apparent in his dealings with the mother. I accept that he loves his daughters but that is not his only motivation. He is self-centred, very focussed on his needs being met and determined that things should be done his way. There would appear to be an element of getting his own way in his application rather than a pure focus on the welfare of the children.

Although at one stage interpretation and the dialect the interpreter spoke required the mother to correct the interpreter, for the vast majority of her evidence it appeared that the interpretation worked satisfactorily. It was clear that the mother had a reasonable command of English both from the texts and written documents but also as she appeared often to understand the question before it had been interpreted to her. However, when she did on rare occasions seek to answer in English it confirmed the need for an interpreter. The mother is clearly a far more animated personality than the father. In part I think her volume and pace reflects her character but it probably also partly reflects the language itself. Although she never became angry there were stretches when she was clearly more agitated and it was not difficult to picture her becoming very loud, abusive and angry. The videos illustrated what she might be like and away from court and subjected to the father&#8217;s characteristic evasion or condescension, it was easy to picture how an argument could develop and how the mother could spill over into abuse and aggressive or violent behaviour. </p>

She also misled her father and brothers and her adherence to Islam is a tenuous one. She is unprincipled and focussed on securing the best outcome for herself and her children without regard to any moral compass. She said why should she tell the father Nora was born when he had done nothing for her? This rather ignoring what might be best for Nora and of course the possibility of Mr Brown discovering it anyway.  She got pregnant again almost as soon as the father appeared in December 2018 and this I conclude was a deliberate decision on her part to further tie him to her. The paternal grandmother spoke of the mother taking medicine to enhance her chances of pregnancy. Her text messages in January 2023 still insist on the father undergoing circumcision and marriage for visa related grounds not because she could truly have believed they had a future in marriage. She also was capable of dishonesty and evasion in giving her evidence; getting to the stage where she accepted that shortly after marrying Robert Brown in an Islamic ceremony, she had slept with the father was a protracted and uncomfortable process with the mother metaphorically twisting and turning to avoid the inevitable concession. Her account of the father being violent to her and her denial of being violent to him lacked detail or conviction and the video of 26 December 2023 clearly demonstrated her abusive behaviour which she sought to minimise &#8211; although she did accept pushing the father. </p>

By the end of 2022 she had concluded that the father was never going to get her a visa save by making the commitment of marriage. I am not sure whether she thought there was any prospect of the father doing this or whether she was presenting him with a single option which she knew he would not take thus justifying (in her own mind and perhaps in a Thai court) her retaining Nora. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, despite the gross dishonesty she was clearly capable of she was a somewhat better witness overall than the father and there were considerable stretches of her evidence where she gave fact rich and seemingly sincere and honest evidence. Her account of the build up of the relationship, the pregnancy and her turning to Mr Brown seemed genuine and far more consistent in themselves and with common sense than the father&#8217;s. Her account of events around Nora&#8217;s birth and the unravelling of her relationship with Mr Brown were also detailed and convincing and showed a side of the mother which was much more connected with events than the father, as did her account of the father meeting her family and the need for and acceptance by the father of marriage. Her response to the criticism that she did nothing when in England was also heartfelt and the detail she gave suggested a true account as did her willingness to work. She seems to have a much better developed work ethic and sense of commitment to achieving an end than the father.   This would also suggest that the mother is probably more intelligent than the father who was rarely able to maintain any chronological order to his evidence and who was unable to focus on the content of a question in the way the mother was. Although she was evasive on areas which reflected badly on her she was much better able to absorb the thrust of a question (even allowing for interpretation) and to focus her answer on what was requested. However, she was also on occasions (far fewer than the father) capable of diverting off into an unrelated criticism of the father or his girlfriend which illustrated the extent to which she is jealous of other women although she said arguments in England were more about her visa insecurity than her jealousy. The clear impression she gave was of a real concern about other women and feeling threatened by the father&#8217;s attachment to girlfriends. This was clear in her evidence about the father&#8217;s contact with female friends in England; how was she to know whether they were friends or lovers she asked in justifying her anger with the father for having contact with other women. Given her own infidelity to Mr Brown this has a pointed irony quite lost on the mother. She would justify her infidelity as being borne of necessity rather than pure pleasure. However, her evidence was clear that arguments were more driven by her visa insecurity and this would confirm that she was understandably interested in securing her permanent presence in England as had been promised by the father and paternal grandmother when the visitor visa was secured with a reassurance that it could be converted once in England. It seems clear that the arguments arose because the father was not reassuring the mother about either his love life or her visa security. Having seen for myself how evasive and obtuse he can be, it is easy to envisage the mother losing her temper with him (she having a more volatile temperament anyway) and lashing out at him. The paternal grandmother&#8217;s account of her seeing her biting him was graphic and had the sense of a lived experience. Conversely, the mother&#8217;s own accounts of the father allegedly being violent to her lacked detail, context and were not elaborated upon in oral evidence. The father probably lacks sufficient emotional range to lose his temper &#8211; little seems to energise him. </p>

However, this shouldn&#8217;t be taken too far &#8211; it was only some level of contrition and in relation to Mr Brown she justified her behaviour by reference to the father&#8217;s poor behaviour in not supporting her and taking her on and this caused her to bring her own mother into the deception of the family. The need for this deception which the maternal grandmother was drawn into is most unlikely to have been necessary if the father had indeed been supportive of and supporting her.   This ability to acknowledge wrong-doing and to express regret or contrition was in contrast to the father who was almost completely incapable of accepting responsibility for any wrongdoing or poor decision making on his part. However, she is also capable of evasion and dishonesty particularly when it comes to the extent to which she can lose control and use physical as well as verbal aggression and violence. She also has an ability to put her rights or interests before those of her children.   As a witness she was also capable of giving broadly truthful evidence on events she witnessed.</p>

Her account of the mother&#8217;s abusive and violent behaviour was quite rich in detail and given in a heartfelt way which suggested when she said she had got fed up with the rows and violence that she had witnessed it. She tended to ascribe the blame to the mother solely and was not critical of the father, However she was clear that the intention in January 2019 was to bring the mother and Nora to England on a permanent basis and that when the father went to Thailand for Felicity&#8217;s birth in September 2019 her expectation was that the four would return to make their lives in England. She was somewhat evasive on the issue of what had been done to secure the mother&#8217;s immigration position and said it was not her responsibility which was true to some degree although as she had sponsored the mother to get her here in January 2019 one could justifiably say she had stepped up to a responsibility which required a more active role to pursue it than she played. Overall, I considered her to be broadly reliable with some discount to be applied to her evaluation of her son&#8217;s actions. </p>

As a consequence, the mother felt it necessary to seek support from Mr Brown and necessity and family pressure together with the lure of life in the West as the wife of Mr Brown led her to commit a gross and shocking deception on him which resulted in him being circumcised, adopting Islam and marrying the mother and applying for a spousal visa to enable her and the baby to live with him in Norway. The mother was almost immediately unfaithful to him when the opportunity to resume a relationship with the baby&#8217;s father emerged.

It seems likely she had got (from the father) a misleading impression of his wealth and position in England. Living with his parents and him she became jealous of the father and insecure about her position (both as a consequence of her fear that he had another woman and because of her immigration position.). This caused arguments between them. The father&#8217;s lack of empathy for the mother, his self-centred and condescending attitude to the mother and his evasive and vague attitude contributed to the mother losing her temper on a number of occasions during which she bit, slapped, hit and pushed the father. It is most probable that the father in fending her off did push her and that has been translated in the mother&#8217;s mind into his assaulting her. I do not find he deliberately assaulted her by pushing her out of bed or strangling her &#8211; more likely he put his hands on her perhaps around her upper chest or shoulders which has become strangling. The father and his mother have exaggerated to a degree the number of assaults and the extent of his injuries.</p>

Although this does not fall within the definition of transnational marriage abandonment, it is abusive of both the mother and Nora and Felicity nonetheless. Covid played some role in the length of the separation, but the father took no active steps to resolve the position. It was acts of omission rather than commission on his part. The mother has behaved in a physically and emotionally abusive way to the father in her verbal and physical assaults and in separating him from Nora.

Although re-united with her mother and sister and maternal family and so in a family environment this was an unfamiliar one both in terms of the people but also the language, the culture the food and much else. She had been removed unexpectedly from the father&#8217;s care and had not returned to England as she had been expecting in January 2023 to the home, school and family environment she was familiar with. The circumstances of her transfer from the father&#8217;s care to the mother&#8217;s was not only unexpected but she was exposed to high levels of acrimony between the father and the mother in this time which would have likely been both distressing and destabilising. She had not commenced at school. Although it appears she was beginning to adapt to life in Thailand &#8211; as she had to given her age and situation &#8211; that limited degree of integration was not sufficient to amount to habitual residence in temporal or qualitative terms and did not amount to a greater degree of integration in Thailand than she retained in England. She remained primarily an English speaker, was far more used to her father&#8217;s care and that of his family, was accustomed to attending English school/nursery and to English food, weather, etc. Using the see-saw analogy her roots had not gone down sufficiently in Thailand and had not been sufficiently uprooted from England to result in a change in habitual residence. I do not consider this to be in the theoretical territory of her having lost habitual residence in England and not yet acquired one in Thailand but is truly a retention of habitual residence in England. </p>

I observe that the lack of contact with the other parent (which Ms Chokowry relied on to try to maintain habitual residence in Thailand between November 2019 &#8211; December 2022) would be a drag on her acquiring habitual residence but not a bar to becoming habitually resident there. I do not feel it necessary to determine that factual issue at this stage, as even if she is currently habitually resident in Thailand, that fact does not affect the jurisdiction that the court acquired under Article 5 because Thailand is a non-Contracting State and so Art 5(2) is not applicable. In my view once jurisdiction is established at the commencement of proceedings on the basis of her then habitual residence the court continues to have jurisdiction until it concludes the proceedings because if Art 5 jurisdiction were lost  (because she ceased to be habitually resident here at the time of this hearing) it would be replaced by the  domestic law habitual residence jurisdiction in the form of s.2(1)(b(ii) and 2(3)(b)(i)  and s.3 FLA 1986 as Nora was habitually resident here as at 1 March 2023.

It might be said that is the end of the matter if no return is sought. However, the court has its own duty to consider whether to make orders of its own motion and given Nora is a ward and Felicity is a UK citizen and the father&#8217;s position would require separation of the siblings if the court concluded it was in Nora&#8217;s paramount welfare to return, I do not feel it is appropriate to rule out this possible tool to promote the welfare of Nora and Felicity until their position has received separate consideration.

Domestic law does not explicitly reference applications for PR &#8211; I mean within FLA 1986. There are no true jurisdictional requirements in the s.4 CA 1989 save that an applicant is the father which the father is.  Thus, the court has jurisdiction. However, given Felicity&#8217;s very tenuous links to England and the obvious connection she has with Thailand and the ability of the Thai court or administrative authorities to deal with PR, there are clearly strong arguments for refraining from exercising the jurisdiction.
