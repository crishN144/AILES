	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">On 11th December 2009, I gave judgment in respect of three applications. As set out in that judgment [para. 1], the principal application was that made by the husband for the return of seven files of documents containing information belonging to him, which information had been secretly obtained by, or on behalf of, one of the wife&#8217;s brothers from a computer system used by the husband, and for consequential orders prohibiting the wife or her legal representatives from making any use of that information. The second application was made by the wife for an order that the parties file and serve Forms E. The third recent application was an application made by the wife for the preservation of other confidential information, which had been obtained from the husband&#8217;s computer files, but was not within the seven files of documents to which I have just referred.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">The representation at this hearing is the same as for the previous hearing. This hearing has been fixed to deal with consequential matters arising out of my judgment, including the issue of costs.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">It is agreed between the parties that my judgment of 11th December can be published and reported without anonymisation. I agree with this proposed order, largely because judgments have been given in parallel proceedings in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division without anonymisation, and it would be wholly unnecessary to seek to anonymise my judgment. </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">The issues which I have to deal with today are: (i) the form of the order of 11th December; (ii) the form of today&#8217;s order; (iii) whether I should give further directions in respect of information/documents contained within the seven files which the husband claims are privileged; (iv) the issue of costs; and (v) finally, applications, principally made on behalf of the husband, for permission to appeal, and consequential orders sought by him for a stay of one of the provisions of the order of 11th December, and for the continuation of the order made by Coleridge J. on 23rd March 2009 pending the determination of any prospective appeal.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">(i) Turning first to the form of the order of 11th December: it became clear, during the course of the hearing, that there are no substantive issues between the parties as to the form of that order. The only possible disagreement relates, first, to a part of the preamble, which is sought to be added by Mr. Turner, which contains a definition for the words &#8220;confidential information&#8221;. I do not consider it necessary to have such a definition in the order. The second is as to the wording of para.1, which states that, &#8220;Save as provided below, the husband&#8217;s summons is dismissed&#8221;. Mr. Turner points out that that is subject to orders made on 11th December, and the orders to be made by me today. This is not a controversial issue. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">The third arises out of slight differences between the drafting of para.4, in the draft prepared on behalf of the husband, and para.3, in the draft prepared on behalf of the wife. I do not see any material differences between them &#8211; the draft prepared on behalf of the wife refers to pagination but that on behalf of the husband does not. As this is not a material difference, I propose that the order should be made as set out in para.4 of the husband&#8217;s draft order.</p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">(ii) Turning next to the form of the order for today: going through the paragraphs in turn, I propose to deal with them relatively summarily. I am working from the draft prepared on behalf of the husband. Paragraph 1 requires the wife to delete permanently from her computer systems any documents or part(s) of documents in the Withers files, and cause for her solicitors, all her counsel, and anyone else holding such material on their computer systems on her behalf, permanently to delete those documents, without reading or rereading them. It is submitted on behalf of the wife that that has been done, insofar as it can reasonably be done.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">The issue arises in this way. In common with many other organisations including firms of solicitors, the wife&#8217;s solicitors, Withers, back up their electronic information. They do so daily, weekly, monthly and annually. As a result, there are considerable volumes of backup tapes. In so far as any of the documents in the Withers files were held electronically, they would, at some stage, have been backed up.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Howard, on behalf of the husband, seeks an order that this material (on the backup tapes) should also be deleted. He submits that it is wrong in principle, in particular, that privileged documents should be retained, and that, up to today, he or the husband had received no categorical assurance as to the number of documents contained within the Withers files which had been held electronically and so would feature in a backup tape or tapes.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Turner opposes the deletion of the material from the backup tapes, and relies on a letter which has been provided today and is dated 13th January 2010. The letter is from the Director of Risk and Compliance at Withers. This seeks to set out the practical difficulties which, it is said, would arise if an order were made that the relevant material in the backup tapes had to be deleted. I quote:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ind" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;In order to comply with any request to delete relevant emails, we would therefore need to find, isolate and selectively delete emails from the backup tapes. I am advised that such a task would be highly complicated and would involve a senior IT consultant, possibly for a number of months. This would also require the restoration of the backup tapes to the live IT environment, which in itself would compromise the security of all the data on each tape. Even after such a task, the firm would not be in a position to make an absolute statement that no copies of the relevant emails or the attachments to those emails were held in any location for the relevant client&#8221;.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="jus">Then there is reference to the fact that even deleted material can, in some circumstances, be recovered.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Howard submits that the difficulties referred to in this letter are exaggerated and that it is wrong that the husband should run the risk that his material might be divulged in due course, as a result of it being held on the backup tapes. He submits that the material can be relatively easily identified by electronic search and deleted.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">I am persuaded by the letter from the Director of Risk and Compliance that there would be significant practical difficulties encountered if I were to make an order that the offending material held on the backup tapes had to be deleted. In my view, the husband&#8217;s position and his information and documents can be properly protected if I make an order that no-one is to be permitted to access any document or any part of any document in or from the Withers files held on any backup file without the permission of the court.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">Paragraph 2 of the draft order seeks an order requiring the wife and her solicitors to deliver up to the husband any document or any part of any document, which were held electronically in the husband&#8217;s computer files and were copied by the wife&#8217;s brother or on his behalf, but are not within the Withers files. As I understand the wife&#8217;s case, it is that there are no such documents and no parts of any such documents, because the only documents which she and her solicitors received were the documents in the seven files.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">However, having regard to the history of this matter and to the extensive information that was taken from the husband&#8217;s computer files, in my view, it is appropriate for me to make an order broadly in the terms of para.2, provided (as was made clear by Mr. Howard during the course of his submissions) that it replicates para.1, in that it refers only to documents or parts of documents - in other words, primary documents - and does not apply to derivative or subsidiary documents containing information derived from those primary documents. If that is made clear, it is a justifiable order.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">The third provision about which there is a dispute is that contained in para.3, which requires the wife, and requires her to cause her solicitors, to prepare affidavits setting out the steps taken to comply with paras.1 and 2 of today&#8217;s order, and para.3 of my order of 11th December (which requires delivery up of the seven files).</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_16">
	  <num>16</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Turner submits that such an order is unnecessary because he has made submissions, and so has gone on record, to the effect that the terms of the order have been effectively complied with. In my view, the husband, in the circumstances of this case, is entitled to have that fact clearly expressed in a sworn document. Accordingly, I propose to make an order in the terms of para.3. If Mr. Turner is correct, it will not be a very onerous obligation to impose on the wife or her solicitors and should be capable of being implemented speedily. I propose to make the order, as set out in para.3, save that I am going to require the affidavits to be filed and served by 4 o'clock next Tuesday, 19th January.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">(iii) Dealing, first, with the issue of privilege. It is part of the husband&#8217;s case that a proportion of the information contained within the seven files is privileged. In my substantive judgment I required the wife to return the seven files that she had received from or through her brother to enable the husband and his advisors to remove the material which was said to be privileged, and then subsequently to return the balance of the seven files to the wife&#8217;s solicitors.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="lvl_1">
	  <num>18</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">I said, and I quote from para.155, that the material (that is the material which was said to be privileged) must be preserved and held by the husband&#8217;s solicitors, pending the determination of the wife&#8217;s ancillary relief application. That was a provision proposed by the husband. I also indicated that, if it became necessary for any issue of privilege to be resolved, it appeared to me that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules, rule 31.19, (3) to (7), provided an appropriate procedure.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_19">
	  <num>19</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">The order which is sought on behalf of the wife is that that procedure should be activated immediately and that I should require the husband, by 4 o'clock on Friday, 22nd January, to produce an affidavit identifying each document or part of each document in respect of which he claims he has a right to withhold inspection on the grounds of legal professional privilege. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_20">
	  <num>20</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">These provisions are opposed by Mr. Howard. He submits that it is wrong, in principle, that the wife should be able to gain any advantage as a result of this information having been irregularly obtained. He submits that, if I were to make an order requiring the husband now to identify grounds on which he claimed a right to withhold inspection, I would be affording to the wife an advantage. He also makes consequential or ancillary submissions in respect of the timing of the provisions proposed on behalf of the wife, including that there is insufficient time for the matter to be addressed at the first appointment.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_21">
	  <num>21</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">21 Mr. Turner submits that, absent the privilege point, the wife would not have been required to return the seven files to enable the allegedly privileged documents to be extracted. So, he submits, it is for the husband to establish the claim to privilege. Otherwise, he submits, I would be undermining my substantive judgment, in that I would be adhering to or giving effect to the husband&#8217;s &#8216;clear line&#8217; argument.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_22">
	  <num>22</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">I do not propose to make any further directions in respect of the information or documents which are claimed to be privileged. Paragraph 2 of the draft order sought by the wife requires the husband to identify each document or part of each document in respect of which he claims he has &#8220;a right to withhold inspection&#8221;. The reason that the husband&#8217;s application and my judgment are framed as they are, is because the information and documents were irregularly obtained by or on behalf of the wife. By that, I mean that she took receipt or her solicitors took receipt of information which had been irregularly obtained for her by her brother.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_23">
	  <num>23</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">In my view it would be wrong to put the wife in a better position than she would be in if she had not received the irregularly obtained information/documents which are alleged to be privileged. It is for her, in due course, to seek to satisfy a court that discovery or inspection of the relevant documents should be afforded, and then (and only then), if the husband seeks to assert a claim to privilege, would the court have to go on and determine whether or not that claim was made out. I do not consider that the wife should be put in an advantageous position in respect of a claim to privilege as a result of the information having been irregularly obtained.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">(iv) Next, I propose to deal with the issue of costs. As I said in the course of my substantive judgment, one of the frequent consequences of information being irregularly obtained is to inflame the litigation process. I might also have said that it creates or can create a very tangled web, and a very expensive tangled web. The costs which have been incurred to date in these proceedings by the parties combined total almost &#163;1 million &#8211; and, effectively, nothing substantive has happened in the course of the wife&#8217;s ancillary relief application because Forms E have not been filed and, as a result, there has been no First Appointment. The husband&#8217;s estimate of costs is just over &#163;570,000, and the wife&#8217;s estimate of costs is just over &#163;400,000. It is a staggering sum of money to contemplate at this stage of these proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">Time is very tight. I have required the parties to file and serve Forms E by 4 o'clock on Friday, 22nd January. The first appointment is fixed for 26th February 2010. It has been made clear during the course of this hearing that the wife would wish to make use of the material which is, pursuant to my order, due to be returned to her, in part for the purposes of the first appointment, including for the purposes of preparing a questionnaire on the husband&#8217;s Form E.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">If I were to order a stay and if I were to continue the provisions of Coleridge J.&#8217;s order, I would be further inhibiting the proper progress of the ancillary relief proceedings. As I said in my substantive judgment, I consider that sufficient time and costs have been expended on the issues raised by these applications. Further, the wife and her advisers have already had possession and knowledge of the material for a substantial period and the use proposed, as referred to previously, will be of limited prejudice to the husband. I do not, therefore, consider a stay of my order or the continuation of Coleridge J&#8217;s order justified. Additionally, if the Court of Appeal is going to address the issues raised in my judgment, then in my view, the sooner the matter is put before the Court of Appeal, the better. The route, in my view, which permits or enables that to occur is for me to refuse the husband&#8217;s application for a stay of para.3 and for a continuation of the order of Coleridge J. If my judgment stands the effect of acceding to the husband&#8217;s submissions would be substantively to inhibit the proper progress of the ancillary relief proceedings. Any application can be made expeditiously to the Court of Appeal. Having regard to the resources that have been expended so far, I do not see that being a hurdle which would create any substantial difficulties for the husband and his legal advisers.</p>
