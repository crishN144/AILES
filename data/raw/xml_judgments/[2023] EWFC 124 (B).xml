	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">This is judgment in FD22P00191 and ZE22P01707.  These proceedings concern A-M, born on [redacted], who is now three, and the father has parental responsibility for him.  T was born in 2020.  He is now two and I think the father does not, at present, have parental responsibility for him.  These proceedings were brought under Art.21 of the Hague Convention by the children&#8217;s father and this is the judgment in a fact-finding hearing.  I record that the parties have been represented throughout, the mother by Mr Powell and the father by Mr Aspinwall, and I&#160;want to thank both counsel for their very calm, clear and courteous conduct of the case and both parents should know that they have had excellent representation.  I want to thank our interpreter and her colleagues, without whom we could not have conducted this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue in this case is the nature of the parents&#8217; relationship.  The mother alleges this was an abusive relationship and if the court looks at the big picture, she says there are patterns of coercive control.  The father characterises himself as a victim of the mother&#8217;s behaviour and says that her taking the children from Norway to the UK was all part of a pre-prepared plan to remove him from their lives.  Trying to understand the nature and nuances of somebody else&#8217;s relationship is a very complex thing and here I have fragments of videos, texts and memory, and I have to analyse thoroughly and look at what the whole picture suggests to the court.</p>

Thereafter the father lived in Norway and the mother in the UK, until the mother moved to Norway when she was pregnant with A-M in February 2019.  The mother left Norway with A-M and her older child, Z, when she was pregnant with T and returned to England on 25 July 2020.  On 27 July she emailed the Norwegian Embassy.  The father made an application to the Norwegian courts and obtained sole parental responsibility for A-M on 11 August 2020 and an order that A-M should live with him.  He sought summary return of A-M under the Hague Convention on 16 September 2020.  There was a hearing without notice to the mother on 17 September 2020 and orders were made to locate her.</p>

Her application does not mention the father&#8217;s Hague proceedings and the evidence in the bundle does not suggest that she was aware of his application when she applied for the Non-Molestation Order.  The father asserts on p.183 of the bundle that the mother realised he had started Hague Convention proceedings because he spoke to her sister in Morocco.  I do not have a statement from the sister.  I do not know exactly what the mother&#8217;s sister knew, and when, and what she told the mother, but what appears on the written evidence in support of the Non-Molestation Order, and appears to have been the trigger for the application, was that the father returned to the UK on or around 18 September 2020 and went to the place where The mother used to live and was speaking to her neighbours.</p>

This application was issued on 11 March 2022 and the application was accompanied by a Form C1A in which the box for &#8220;emotional abuse&#8221; was ticked by the father, it being alleged that the child was suffering emotional abuse as not having proper quality time with his father.

The matter was transferred here, to East London, and allocated to a circuit judge.  The father has been seeing A-M in weekly video calls.  He provided statements in May 2022 and January 2023 responding to the mother&#8217;s case.  He issued a C100 for T on 5 December 2022 - the copy in the bundle is dated July 2022 - and sought an order spending time with T and an order for parental responsibility.</p>

Findings of fact must be based on evidence, including inferences that may be drawn, and not suspicion or speculation.</p>

He said this case was full of shades of grey and the court&#8217;s job was to determine the veracity and credibility of the witnesses.  He said that the mother&#8217;s case was fabricated and embellished but did not seek a finding she had lied on any given point.  Mr Powell said that the father had lied by saying that the mother had inflicted bruises on herself, and lied about the extent to which he controlled her social media and phone.</p>

Both parties have prepared voluminous statements for the Non-Molestation Order and Hague Convention proceedings, and annexed numerous videos, photos and screen shots.  In case managing, I decided there was already sufficient evidence before the court in the existing statements and that no further witness statements are necessary.</p>

But, inevitably, in this case both parties mention details in the witness box that have not featured in previous statements, and of course parties cannot realistically cover the minutiae of a long and complicated relationship in statements in its entirety.  It is a question for the court as to the extent to which the new details that came out in the witness box impact the parties&#8217; credibility or are indicative of fabrication or embellishment.</p>

Such evidence can only ever give a partial picture.  I remind myself when somebody chooses to record, they choose what they are recording and for how long.  The parents speak together in a mixture of Arabic, Kurdish and English, and the grammar of the transcripts I have is idiosyncratic.  It does not help to make the meaning clear and what the parties mean by what they say at times is far from obvious.  I have not had an interpreter who transcribed these exchanges in court to help me understand the choice of words, the nuance and the context, and trying to translate a concept from one language to another is not always a precise task.  For example, the word &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">mehweb</span>&#8221; is an example of this, as are the swear words noted.  Without an expert in the language, I do not have the force or full meaning of those words.</p>

There are different levels of detail in her statements but the statements she makes are not inconsistent with each other.  She explained she was guided by her solicitor as to the level of detail she provided, and I did not get the impression she was making excuses or being evasive in saying this.  There is some force in her observation that it cannot all be included in statements.  There are some matters that appear in her journal, like the father talking about buying a gun or threatening to push her from the window, which do not appear elsewhere and it was put to her that she was making this up and embellishing, but she was adamant that she had nothing to gain from doing so.</p>

The father gave evidence with the help of an interpreter and when evidence is being translated there are times when clarification is needed or the meaning of words in translation needs further elucidation.

I am afraid this was an unconvincing response because his statements have been highly critical of the mother throughout his written case and he uses very critical language to describe her.

The fact that the mother wore a headscarf in the UK when the father was in Norway could be a feature of a controlling dynamic that suggests he sought to regulate her behaviour when she was out of his sphere of influence.  It could be seen as sending a visible message that she is not single to anyone who meets her whilst the parties lived apart.  There is also evidence that the mother is more religiously observant than the father and that too could be an aspect of headscarf-wearing.

However, it is noteworthy that the mother&#8217;s journal refers in March 2020 to him taking her phone away because he stated that she got distracted and he said she should no longer contact her family or friends.  Her evidence suggests that the father would buy her a phone and then expect to have it in his possession at times and have access to it.  Her correspondence with her sister is in a Moroccan dialect in the text that the father did not understand, as he said in the witness box, which might explain why she shared details or criticisms of the father with her sister, when even on her own evidence that he would go through her phone.

The PEth test of 16 October 2020 shows little or no alcohol consumed in the two to four weeks beforehand.  These test results are of course after the events in question but they might suggest that the father is not alcohol-dependent because it is clear that he can stop or moderate his alcohol use from these results.  In evidence, he explained to me there is a urine test carried out before he could get on board his work ship, and I can take judicial notice that a urine test covers a relatively short period of time when a substance might be in the body and that PEth can go back a number of weeks but not months.</p>

The father&#8217;s case is he is trying to relax by drinking and actually the mother is winding him up.  It seems to me that on either case there is a pattern of the father drinking with a degree of regularity when he comes home on shore leave.  Without testing evidence it is hard for me to calibrate whether there is any level of dependence or liver damage from the drinking, but the evidence as a whole suggests a degree of habit and the mother&#8217;s evidence suggests an impact on the father&#8217;s behaviour.  Of course I can take judicial notice of the fact that alcohol tends to have the effect of making people less inhibited and I will return to this when I look at the big picture.</p>

It seems to me more likely than not that the stage of the relationship at which the journal was written, things were getting increasingly tense.  The absence of abusive words in the texts and the recordings is something that the father points to, to undermine the mother&#8217;s allegation of verbal abuse.  It seems that the pattern of how the parents communicate with each other is either face-to-face when the father is on home leave, or by phone when he is on the boat.

The father&#8217;s evidence was that the mother raised this issue because she wanted to humiliate him in front of Z.  He accepted he did call her family because she was disrespectful and attacked him.  On his own evidence in the witness box he raised his hand up as if to cover the mother&#8217;s mouth and told her to &#8220;Shush.&#8221; The motion he showed in the witness box was consistent with the mother showing her mouth covered by his hand at times.</p>

It shows him pouring something into a glass with ice that he has fetched from the kitchen.  He has got a bottle of Coke on the table, which is visible and in shot, and a bottle on the floor next to the table.  It is interesting that the drinks are not in the kitchen, which might suggest they are left out for ease of access and refills, and the mother&#8217;s evidence that the bottle on the floor was Jack Daniels.  If so, it was a generous measure that I see the father pour.  He says, &#8220;Bruised?  You do it by yourself to show you attacked&#8221; in this conversation.</p>

There is reference in this recording to the mother saying she had been abused, &#8220;emotionally, physically, everything.&#8221; The father says, &#8220;If your husband slapped you, why you call 111 93 now at 11.30?&#8221; Again I caution myself about the difficulty of interpreting this evidence, particularly in relation to this interaction.

Similarly there is no mention in the C1A form relating to T.  The father first tells CAFCASS in the safeguarding letter that the mother is controlling at p.199. There is a strong theme in the father&#8217;s oral evidence that the mother provoked him and that her behaviour was all in the context of a plan to separate him from his children.</p>

It is hard to follow the logic of the arguments that the mother&#8217;s actions were all part of a plan, given that the mother&#8217;s allegations begin before she moved to Norway and before A-M was born.  If there was a long-term plan, as the father suggests, to deprive him of his children, it is hard to see why she would have moved to Norway at all, or stayed there during the police and Social Services investigation.  The mother&#8217;s evidence of control is detailed and date specific, whereas the father&#8217;s is mainly generalised and vague.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The central core of the mother&#8217;s case is convincing.  Her reports have been broadly consistent over a number of statements from her first to her most recent.  The type of detail she has added in the witness box are ones which reasonably one might expect to come up in oral evidence, and the overall picture that she paints and the patterns that emerge when you survey the whole canvas are more consistent with her evidence.  There is a pattern to the father&#8217;s behaviour which in my view can only be discerned when you take a step back and look at the whole picture.</p>

He grabbed the mother&#8217;s hand and, when she pulled it away, hit her stomach.  He slapped her, grabbed her around the neck with one hand, and gripped her arms to the extent it left bruises which were visible the next day to the medical examiner.  On 21 July 2019 the father would not allow&#160;the mother to speak to her friend on the phone and slapped her.  The mother called the Domestic Abuse Helpline, the police arrived and the father was taken to the police station and interviewed.  It seems to me more likely than not that the mother was discouraged by the father from openly speaking to Social Services.  He told her no one would believe her and her children would be taken away.  She was in a highly vulnerable state after giving birth and in an unfamiliar country.</p>

It seems to me that the father&#8217;s hand made contact with the mother&#8217;s face as he tried to silence her.  I am unable to make a finding as to the force used or how this is best characterised, but I find that the father called the mother&#8217;s family after this incident and was critical of her.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.75in">The incident of 28 January 2020 is an example of the mother&#8217;s language being imprecise.  The use of &#8220;head butted&#8221; suggests a degree of force that appears lacking to me on the evidence and the mother accepts she suffered no injuries to the bridge of her nose as a result.  She uses the word &#8220;strangled&#8221; in her written description and when I asked her what she meant by this she referred to the father placing one hand on her neck and the other over her mouth.  This is consistent with Audio 13 in which she talks about being held by the neck and the father talks about holding her mouth.  There is a degree of imprecision and dramatic use of language by the mother in this respect.  However, both parties accept that A-M was present on 28 January 2020 and there was a disagreement about money.  I find the father was under the influence of alcohol.  I find that he held the mother with one hand on the neck, under the chin, and the other over her mouth.  I am satisfied he had a chef&#8217;s knife and used the blunt side to hit the mother&#8217;s head, causing her arm to be raised to shield her face.  I am satisfied that the marks seen in the photo on p.300 were caused by this incident, and I am satisfied that the father threatened to kill the mother.  I am satisfied she was afraid of the father, left, went to the airport and that the father followed her and she returned following pressure from the family and the father.</p>

On 24 July 2020 there was an argument in the morning.  I find the father did tell the mother to leave.  I find he did tell her to go and ask for housing but did not tell her to report the abuse.  I find he tried to persuade her to return home when he saw her at the bus stop.  I find that the mother left Norway not as part of an elaborate plan to take the children, but as a result of the father&#8217;s behaviour.  She was afraid of him.  I am satisfied there was a pattern of controlling and coercive behaviour.</p>

His tone could be characterised as aggressive.  He speaks in a mixture of English and Kurdish.  The words, &#8220;I will kill you&#8221; have been translated from Kurdish.  A-M appears watchful.

The father&#8217;s version is that A-M has hearing problems - this is p.181 - and that he sat on the floor and made different noises and sounds to see his reaction.  The father&#8217;s oral evidence is that the phrase, &#8220;Sit down or I will kill you,&#8221; is a way of telling a child to behave in Kurdish and that the mother learnt this from a Kurdish woman at the hostel.
