Moor J was further concerned (a) that the Judge had not adequately dealt with the allegation that the mother had influenced T against her father, and (b) the young age of T.</p>

Between the 19th of January 2020 and the 30th of March 2020, the mother called police for assistance on four occasions in relation to alleged violent incidents perpetrated on her by the father.  It is notable that T was said to have witnessed at least one of the incidents, and that when the police attended the property on the first occasion &#8220;they found [T] hiding under a table &#8230; and had to coax her out&#8221; (extract from the Judge&#8217;s fact-finding judgment: see &#167;12 below).

He told me, during his submissions on the appeal, that he had been &#8220;exonerated&#8221; in the Crown Court.  He further told me that he recognised that the children had been traumatised, but by the mere fact of the parental separation, not by any abuse by him.  He told me that he had undertaken the &#8216;better parent&#8217; courses proposed, not because he considered that had behaved in any way as to justify his attendance, but simply in order to &#8216;build bridges&#8217; with the family.  </p>

He had told the Judge that he was not able to talk to the maternal grandmother anymore (she had after all given evidence against him in the fact-finding hearing); he had also seen very little of his own brother, and at one time in the proceedings had described a poor relationship with him.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The father&#8217;s challenge to the judge&#8217;s failure to address the issue of whether T&#8217;s views were authentically her own is not made out on my fuller review of the material on this appeal.  It follows that the Judge&#8217;s conclusion (reproduced at &#167;24(iii) above) is secure;</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I consider that Moor J was right to be concerned about the relative rarity of a final order which contemplates only indirect contact between a 5/6 year old child and her father in private law proceedings.  His concerns would I am sure have been alleviated had the Judge expressly referenced T&#8217;s right to a family life, and the established principle that c<span style="color:#000000">ontact between a parent and child represents a fundamental element of that family life (see </span>in particular the Court of Appeal&#8217;s seminal judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C </span><span style="color:#000000"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2011/521" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCA Civ 521" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWCA Civ 521</ref>, and Munby LJ&#8217;s comments esp. at [47]); the Judge could perhaps usefully have further referenced </span>the statutory presumption of parental involvement in a child&#8217;s life: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref>(2A) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>.  Having looked at the case as a whole, I do not find that her failure to do so incurably undermines the decision.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this particular case, the Judge was not particularly well-served by the social worker authors of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7</ref> reports whose recommendation that &#8216;trusted&#8217; albeit unqualified family members should play a pivotal role in mediating and risk assessing the situation going forward showed an astonishing lack of awareness of the complex risks in the case, and the extent to which this would expose the mother and children to potential further abuse.  The Judge was right to reject that part of their evidence (see &#167;20(v)/(vi) above and &#167;24(ii) above).  In fairness, not even the father thought that that recommendation was workable.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus, I am satisfied that the Judge reached a decision on these facts which was not wrong; indeed, it was, in the circumstances, in my judgment, probably the only order which realistically could be made at this point.  The Judge plainly recognised that had any of the factors been different (for instance, had T been asking for contact with her father, or had the father completed a perpetrator programme), then a different outcome may well have resulted.   Family Court Judges work under intense pressure of time, with variable resources to assist them; for these reasons I am not critical that the judge did not express herself as fully as she might have done.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I remind the father that the order under challenge in this appeal had clearly been prefaced (see &#167;2(iii) above) with a recital of the court&#8217;s contemplation that his relationship with his daughter could develop if her wishes and feelings changed, and if he positively engaged with a perpetrator programme.  It is in his interests, and more importantly in T&#8217;s, that he conscientiously maintains his letter writing to T to demonstrate, as the Judge contemplated (see &#167;24(ii) above) that he cares about her.  I trust that the mother will encourage T to respond (see her comments at &#167;24(v), with which I agree).</p>
