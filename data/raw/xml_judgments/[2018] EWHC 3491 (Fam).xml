The care proceedings were in the Family Court at Portsmouth and were being heard by Her Honour Judge Black. On 1 June 2017 she made a care order in relation to B, the proceedings in relation to A having concluded with the making of a care order on 22 December 2016. </p>

His application to Judge Black for permission to report the proceedings was refused. Judge Black also ordered Mr Green to return to HCC by 2.30pm on 3 May 2017, all &#8220;court documents and any copies of those documents which he retains.&#8221; He failed to do so. The order also &#8220;informed&#8221; Mr Green, although not in terms ordering him to do so, that &#8220;he should remove &#8230; from the internet within 24 hours&#8221; a particular article referred to in the order (&#8220;the Article&#8221;). He did not do so and in fact, <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>Judge Black had made her order, put up more material about the case on the internet (&#8220;the Second Article&#8221;).  </p>

I have to have regard to all the interests in play, whether public or private, and whether protected by Article 6, Article 8 or Article 10. None of these interests is intrinsically of any greater weight than any other; in particular, public interests do not take precedence as such over private interests. All these interests have to be evaluated and balanced before the final balance is struck. What weight is to be attached to any particular interest will depend upon an intense scrutiny of the circumstances of the particular case, as will the final determination as to how, at the end of the day, the balance is to be struck. An important aspect of the exercise is an evaluation of the impact on the children of what is proposed: <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2004/47" uk:canonical="[2004] UKHL 47" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] UKHL 47</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 591" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 591</ref>, para 25.
