His presentation is that of someone who appears to have witnessed or experienced harmful environments and has difficulty in managing emotions. He has had numerous placement breakdowns both in kinship care and foster care, 8 placements in total. The parents submit that Scott has ADHD/Autism or that there is an organic cause for his behaviour. This is not accepted by any medical or other professional.</span></p>

I also have a detailed chronology (provided on behalf of the father) which runs to 79 pages as well as an advocates chronology of hearings, 16 pages.

Most was unchallenged and indeed accepted. I will only address those issues either where there has been disagreement or challenge and which are particularly relevant to my decision. The absence of any reference to any matter does not mean that it has been ignored; the whole bundle of papers has been considered and taken into account in coming to my conclusions even if not mentioned specifically.</span></p>

I believe that there were 13 C2 applications filed before the appeal hearing was concluded and approximately 11 since, some with a consent order. The lack of proper communication between the parties &#8211; both lay and legal - has been apparent throughout and sadly this case has not only been protracted but also on occasions overly adversarial. At one point I informed the parties that I was not prepared to list any further interim hearings without proof that the issues to be raised had been fully ventilated between the parties and agreement proved to be impossible. The timetable has been extended on several occasions. At the time of this final hearing, commencing with Scott&#8217;s application, we are at around week 96. This final hearing is the 21st hearing.</span></p>

However, following an incident when both parents became aggressive and the father assaulted the mother in the presence of a social worker, with Scott almost caught between their fighting, the case escalated to Child Protection. Due to a lack of progress and the Child Protection Plan being ineffective as a result of the continued level of aggression by father during meetings, pre-proceedings were initiated. Within this period, support was provided.</span></p>

Dr Alwin identified the couple&#8217;s early life experiences were connected to their respective psychological formulation. Dr Alwin identified the parents&#8217; tendency to minimize the existence of domestic violence. Dr Alwin found it difficult to identify specific therapeutic intervention for the Mother as she did not accept that she would require psychological intervention.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial;color:#000000"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;color:#000000"> Dr Alwin identified that the parents &#8220;would benefit from attending couple&#8217;s therapy to help them address the underlying issues within their relationship&#8221; and would need to commit to attending couples therapy for a period of at least 3 &#8211; 4 months to give them a chance to benefit from developing a therapeutic relationship engaging constructively with a therapeutic process. Dr Alwin identified the Father would likely require between six months and one year of therapeutic input to help him understand and address his difficulties with emotional regulation (anger management therapy)  but it would be evident within three months whether he was able to engage.  Dr Alwin specified that the Father required anger management therapy sessions which should be provided by an experienced clinical psychologist with experience of working with males with interpersonal anger issues. Dr Alwyn highlighted that it is unlikely that the father would gain access to anger management therapy on the NHS </span></p>

Consequently they struggle to engage and accept the local authority&#8217;s perspective that Scott&#8217;s difficulties were primarily due to the home environment; the parents believe the parenting techniques offered were not effective as Scott had a neurodevelopmental disorder; the Father accepted he had ongoing difficulties with anger management and would need further input.</span></p>

Both Mother and Father deny and minimise concerns and blame the local authority for the situation they find themselves in.

The assessment refers to a strategy meeting held and legal planning meeting for unborn Alice to be considered in pre-proceedings. Within the action to be taken section the Mother is to be referred to Motherwell and the Father is to provide &#8220;details and costings of the RELATE / anger management courses&#8221;. The assessor considers that there is limited chance of effective substantial change regarding Father and Mother parenting and this is due to their limited will their limited willingness to engage with professionals on a meaningful level, taking into account advice given by the local authority. The author refers to the report of the ISW who completed the parenting assessment in which she states &#8220; Both Mother and Father deny and minimise concerns and blame the local authority for the situation they find themselves in stop Father is unable to regulate his emotions resulting in frequent outbursts of anger and aggression stop he has assaulted a previously allocated social worker and I am unable to foresee him ever having a positive working relationship with professionals. The assessment concludes that the unborn child would be at risk of significant harm and or neglect should she remain in her parents care.   </span></p>

Whilst he shows low average cognitive abilities, below average functional abilities and early signs of anxiety, problems with concentration, attention and hyperactivity, I believe these to be consequences of his adverse experiences rather than due to any innate or organic condition. He appears to be a child who has failed to thrive and has been emotionally harmed by the lack of care and nurture, and shows a heightened propensity to fight or flight, most likely due to chronic exposure to parental conflict and sources of threat </span></p>

Parents show love and warmth and interact with him, however there is clear evidence that they struggle to regulate themselves. Scott appears to need to control contact to an extent where he feels remembered and loved and any emotionally charged content is avoided... He continues to receive mixed messages about what is appropriate in the situation resulting in inappropriate methods of coping. This direct contact maintains his readiness for fight or flight and impairs his ability to form trusting bonds with new caregivers. At paragraph 7.15 he notes that neither parent is a significant attachment figure and they are perceived as a source of threat. Therefore, frequent contact is likely to sustain raised physiological arousal levels even when it goes well and likely to be associated with elements that increase Scott's anxiety.</span></p>

Contact is a clear trigger which should be carefully addressed in the longer term&#8221;</span></p>

He states that &#8220;I have not diagnosed Scott with ADHD as there is a more salient explanation for his pattern of difficulties&#8221;. Overall my impression is that Scott has experienced neglectful, harmful and inconsistent parenting from Mother and Father. He has developed a disorganised attachment style, where he will feel ambivalent towards those who care for him and not believe in their intentions, yet also needs care and nurture which he has not received. The report provides Mother and Father need to show their ability to regulate themselves and recognise that harm that Scott has experienced whilst providing messages of support to those who are caring for Scott. From the background provided, little has changed in their acknowledgment of the concerns and harm.  Whilst I have not met or assessed the parents directly, the psychological assessment clearly outlines a number of concerning issues in the parents presentation</span></p>

At no point in the statements does he actually set out what he considers the work would achieve or indeed why it is necessary other than admitting to arguments. He also does not contemplate the work failing or even what it involved. His belief seems to be that if the work was done, all would be well. In my judgment this is an extremely simplistic approach. Therapy is not a panacea, it requires commitment and understanding and it is clear that father has declined suitable therapy such as CBT since it is not anger management. The issue of being provided with specific &#8220;Anger Management Therapy&#8221; has almost become an obsession, father fails to recognise that other therapies &#8211; such as Lifeline and CBT, even RELATE &#8211; include elements which would be part of therapy in relation to anger management and that is does not have to be a bespoke, specific or individual course. </span></p>

This is an assessment stage to allow facilitators to commit their services to the lengthier intervention stage. As a former facilitator of such a course, the principal aim is focussing on a person&#8217;s motivation and genuineness to change. For example, whether someone is attending because they have been told to attend. It is not a</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">high test to reach but it is imperative that a person needs to accept domestic abuse has/is a feature of their life. Over the course of the current care proceedings, Father has offered interchangeable positions about his domestic abuse actions. He told me that failed attempt to engage with domestic abuse intervention was due the facilitator wanting him to admit to current domestic abuse at the time. I find this implausible and an attempt to attribute blame to others and distract from his inability to take responsibility.</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">The inability to progress past the assessment stage continues to pose a considerable risk of harm to the younger children. I would argue Father was just not aware of the nature of the assessment stage and when told, chose or did not have the capacity to understand the criteria. He refused to start the programme again. He had not met the test for motivation to change. The lack of understanding and insight into perpetrating domestic abuse remains a dynamic risk and given the significant level of psychological and emotional abuse endured by Scott, the risk is very high.&#8221;</span></p>

The Local Authority was proactive prior to the issue of proceedings by obtaining the opinion of Dr Alwin who made clear recommendations for anger management therapy by an experienced clinical psychologist for a period of 6-12 months and couples therapy for at least 3-4 months. Dr Alwin was aware that father&#8217;s therapy would not be available under the auspices of the NHS. As an experienced expert he will also have been aware of the limitations for funding by the local authority. The local authority funded 5 sessions with RELATE.</span></p>

The parents appear to have been told on several occasions that the therapy would be provided. Whether this referred to specific bespoke and specific &#8220;Anger Management&#8221; therapy in line with the recommendations is not clear. The parents believed that it was or should be. What is clear is that there was never a referral by a social worker to panel for funding for the specific therapy to take place, where a decision would have cleared the matter up once and for all, even though the parents appear to have been told by one social worker that it was. The service manager&#8217;s statement deals with the matter and agrees that it was unhelpful. However, it must be borne in mind that Dr Alwin&#8217;s opinion was a recommendation, and the Local Authority is entitled to assess all options.</span></p>

The court, of course, has no power to order the local authority to pay for therapy. If the panel decision was negative, that would be an end to the matter. This has caused significant confusion all around and a considerable amount of bad feeling and mistrust. The impression that I have is that it may well never have been explained to father that the other options were alternatives to achieve the same aim. This has led to him becoming fixated on a very specific therapy which may have impacted upon his ability to consider other options.</span></p>

There are no recommendations for rehabilitation from any professional. The Local Authority&#8217;s &#8220;shoddy&#8221; performance in certain respects would not lead me to gamble with the children&#8217;s lives and allow a very long delay for unlikely and uncertain potential outcomes in the face of the evidence. Even as Dr Alwin recommended the anger management therapy, he had reservations about engagement and efficacy due to father&#8217;s lack of insight and understanding and of the refusal to accept a non-organic cause for Scott&#8217;s behaviour.</span></p>

It is extremely rare, exceptional, for a child of his age to need residential care and even more exceptional that he requires restraint on occasions. He has had 8 placement moves and it is clear that he is highly insecure, worried that he is to blame and wondering if he will ever see his parents again. Sensory therapy is to be funded for him, but it is likely that this will only be one of many supports or therapies required for Scott to reach his highest potential. Dr Ganetra confirms that interventions to manage emotions and learn pro-social skills would likely be helpful for him together with further specialist CAMHS support later and should draw on dyadic approaches such as DDP or theraplay. His carers may also benefit from support such as group-based work and training around to support the emotional needs of traumatised children. It is imperative that a nurturing and highly skilled foster placement is identified for him as soon as possible and a planned move takes place.</span></p>

The delay would be, in accordance with Dr Alwin&#8217;s assessment, a minimum of 6 months and more likely 12 months for therapy to take place. Thereafter there would be a need for further assessment. This delay would be the minimum even if the parents fully engaged and Dr Alwin had concerns regarding their ability to do so. Certainly, in the case of Father he indicates that he will undergo anger management therapy and I have no reason to doubt this. So far, however, he has failed to repeat the Lifeline course when advised to do so, disengaged with CBT; considers, according to his evidence, that domestic abuse work is unnecessary; dismissed the Magic 123 training as inappropriate; dismisses the opinions of the medical practitioners as to whether Scott has ADHD or Autism and accuses various professionals continuously of lying. This included the ISW, health visitor, social worker in his evidence as well as claims throughout of the Local Authority &#8220;gaslighting&#8221; him. It is hard to see how father will be able to work openly and honestly and in a supportive manner with any professional/therapist who challenges him, or with whom he takes a contrary position.</span></p>

Sadly the matter is not so simple. There are absolutely no guarantees that the therapy would be successful. There are no guarantees that father would even fully engage in the process. He has previously stated that he is undertaking course as he needs to get his children back, whilst intimating that they were not necessary (Lifeline). He does not like people disagreeing with him and this could lead to disengagement as referred to above. Various types of therapy have been tried or considered, short of the full therapy as suggested by Dr Alwin and he was concerned that &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">that Father&#8217;s lack of insight into and understanding of domestic violence would contraindicate his attendance at an anger management intervention and it would be likely that any such intervention would have little or no positive benefit.</span></p>

Father does not appear to perceive that the therapeutic interventions regarding his anger issues, will need to address deep psychological thinking and root causes to address his low emotional resilience and poor anger management. Father gives the impression that addressing his anger management will not be a long-term piece of work and will lead to predictable and certain change.&#8221;</span></p>

The negatives include ceasing all contact with their natural family including their half siblings and this potentially impacting identity but there are more positives. These include ceasing to be looked after children subject to corporate parenting, being placed with carers who have effectively chosen them and will care for them throughout not only childhood but also later life This is the only option that offers Callum and Alice the option of secure and safe family life according to both the Local Authority and the Guardian and I accept that assessment. </span></p>

Callum and Alice&#8217;s immediate needs are for stability, security and permanence. In my judgment this can only be achieved by way of adoption and their welfare requires this, and accordingly I dispense with the consent of their mother and father.  I accept that this interferes with the rights of all three children and their parents to a family life together but in my judgment the making of such an order and the interference are proportionate given that there is no alternative which would meet their needs.</span></p>

Given that Alice has genetic testing outstanding which will likely take 3 months, I indicated that I was unhappy with that plan, since prospective adopters would most likely want to know the result before considering Alice or certainly committing to her and so they agreed to search for a joint placement for 6 months. Callum and Alice need to know that everything possible has been done to try to give them the opportunity to be brought up together.</span></p>

In the case of the father, there is a gap in direct contact. An application to suspend contact was made by the Local Authority supported by the Guardian and granted by order. Contact was suspended as a result of the father&#8217;s inappropriate behaviour during contact with Scott he and thereafter he physically assaulting the social worker whilst Scott was present directly following the contact on the same day. Thereafter there were various applications to extend by the local authority and to recommence by father. Mother&#8217;s contact was stopped for around a month with the father&#8217;s although it should not have been.</span></p>

Thereafter contact will be indirect only to assist with life story work. Whether they have any direct contact with Scott post placement will depend upon any potential adoptive placement and a risk assessment. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.65in"><span style="font-family:Arial">I would therefore recommend that the Local Authority invite prospective adoptive carers for Callum and Alice to keep an open mind about future direct contact between the siblings &#8211; including Scott. There are benefits of direct contact within adoption as well as risks, and these include maintaining important potentially lifetime relationships between siblings; providing reassurance, helping with issues of identity and loss; and helping the children with their dual connection to their birth and adoptive families. It can help children to make sense of the past. Social media has changed the landscape for closed adoptions; children grow curious as they grow older. It can be better for any such direct contact to take place in a controlled and supported manner rather that at the child&#8217;s own volition without any support or preparation. Letterbox contact cannot, in my judgment, ever be considered to be truly &#8220;good quality&#8221; as it is so limited in nature, but I accept that it is often the only way to maintain any links.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.65in"><span style="font-family:Arial">Contact for Scott is to slowly reduce to monthly following conclusion of these proceedings. Initially the plan of the local authority was for the contact to be 6 times annually, in school holidays. It remains supervised at a contact centre, in a small room. It is to be reviewed at the monthly stage and will not be reduced further without a formal meeting. This meeting will include the parents and appropriate professionals as well as the IRO and it will be minuted. The Guardian was clear that this should be a formal process and must take into account Scott&#8217;s behaviours as well as his wishes and feelings. Ideally contact should in the future move to be more activity based and potentially in the community, but this would be dependent upon Scott&#8217;s progress. The need for forceable restraint in public must be avoided. It would not change imminently &#8211; the main issue for the foreseeable future was to get Scott settled, but enjoyable contact would be beneficial. It also needs to be noted that contact with his parents may be a trigger for Scott so it must be a carefully considered process. Scott has a long journey ahead of him and the contact is for </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Arial">his</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> benefit and wellbeing. He is also to undertake some sensory wok and consideration should be given to mother being involved if considered suitable by the therapists. At the very least both parents are to be notified of any developments regarding Scott and this includes incidents where restraint is required.</span></p>
