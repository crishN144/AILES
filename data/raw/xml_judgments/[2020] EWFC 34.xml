This was a routine contact session regulated by the terms of a child arrangements order dated 17 August 2017. B was returned to her mother the following day. The father has not seen his daughter since. </p>

On 18 January 2019 the mother cross-applied to vary the order. The matter was set down for a fact-finding hearing. This took place in June 2019. The mother, the father and Dr B gave evidence. There were three other witnesses. The DVD was not produced, let alone examined by an independent paediatrician. The father in his evidence flatly denied sexually abusing his daughter. However, on 14 June 2019 the circuit judge found that he had, on a single occasion, sexually abused his daughter by poking his finger into her vagina. </p>

Taken together these rendered the judgment unreliable and therefore wrong. He set aside the finding. He directed that the issue be reheard at High Court judge level. The matter was allocated to me. I directed that an independent paediatrician should be instructed, and that the DVD should be made available to her. Dr Christine Greenshaw was jointly instructed. She is a consultant paediatrician and a senior forensic physician. </p>

The third laceration is in my opinion likely to be the result if the examination technique, possibly facilitated by the previously noted nappy rash.&#8221;   </p>

She indicated on a picture that she calls the genital area noony and the anal area bumby, and specified when it happened: &#8220;Grandma is in the toilet when daddy puts his fingers in my bumby.&#8221; When asked directly where dad puts his finger, she replied: &#8220;...in the noony, in the little hole, ... lots of times.&#8221; However, in the archiving (<span style="font-style:italic">sic, semble</span> achieving) best evidence (ABE) interview, B would not talk, was evasive, and repeatedly stated that she could not remember and finally said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember what my dad did, like when he hurts me.&#8221;  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0in">From my paediatric experience, I can think of several reasons why B didn&#8217;t want to talk about her father during the videointerview. The strange new setting might have contributed, she might have felt that she had said it all already, felt pressured, had a conflict of interest and loyalty, realising that she had got her father into trouble, but also, she may have been uncomfortable because what she had previously said was not true. I also wonder if the child in the last 19 months expanded further on what she previously said. Children who have experienced maltreatment are often able to talk about what happened once they are in a secure setting and don&#8217;t have further contact with their abuser.&#8221;  </p>

However, neither the father nor the Guardian sought such a course and even if they had I would not have adopted it in the light of the mother&#8217;s stance and the evidence of Dr Greenshaw.

I record that she is now demonstrating a degree of impartiality in contrast to her stance hitherto. I further record that she is not to be criticised for bringing the matter before the court and for seeking a judicial determination. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Unfortunately, there has been a complete disruption of the relationship between the father and his daughter &#8211; one of the two most vital relationships in her life. The father is realistic enough to acknowledge that rebuilding the relationship must be taken in small stages. I have ordered that there will be weekly contact by Skype for approximately eight weeks. No medium of direct contact is possible during the current national coronavirus emergency. The matter will then be the subject of a report by the Guardian, but the intention is it should then move to direct supervised access and from there to a normal father-daughter relationship. </p>

I am satisfied that the index of complexity is relatively high and that there is virtue in maintaining judicial continuity. I have exhorted the parents to work together responsibly and diligently to bring about a resumption of the father-daughter relationship which is so obviously important for the psychological well-being of this small child. </p>
