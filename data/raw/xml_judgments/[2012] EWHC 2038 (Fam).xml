In simple terms this represents the embodiment of the principle of open justice in a free country. An important aspect of the public interest in the administration of criminal justice is that the identity of those convicted and sentenced for criminal offices should not be concealed. Uncomfortable though it may frequently be for the defendant that is a normal consequence of his crime. Moreover the principle protects his interests too, by helping to secure the fair trial which, in Lord Bingham of Cornhill's memorable epithet, is the defendant's "birthright". From time to time occasions will arise where restrictions on this principle are considered appropriate, but they depend on express legislation, and, where the Court is vested with a discretion to exercise such powers, on the absolute necessity for doing so in the individual case.</span></p>

Innocent parents suffer from the criminal activities of their sons and daughters. Husbands and wives and partners all suffer in the same way. All this represents the further consequences of crime, adding to the list of its victims. Everyone appreciates the risk that innocent children may suffer prejudice and damage when a parent is convicted of a serious offence &#8230; If the court were to uphold this ruling so as to protect the rights of the defendant's children under Article 8, it would be countenancing a substantial erosion of the principle of open justice, to the overwhelming disadvantage of public confidence in the criminal justice system, the free reporting of criminal trials and the proper identification of those convicted and sentenced in them. Such an order cannot begin to be contemplated unless the circumstances are indeed properly to be described as exceptional.&#8221;</span></p>

She played a large part in the upbringing of C; when she had just turned 15 she was left alone to look after C (4) while M and B went on a ten-day holiday to the United States.</p>

	      <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;First I recognise the primacy in a democratic society of the open reporting of public proceedings on grave criminal charges and the inevitable price that that involves in incursions on the privacy of individuals.  Secondly, I recognise that Parliament has in a number of statutes qualified that right to report and, in the context of this case, most notably in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/23-24/12/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/23-24/12" uk:canonical="1933 (23 &amp; 24 Geo. 5) c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1933 Act</ref>; where a set of circumstances arise not covered by those provisions the court should in my judgment be slow to extend the incursion into the right of free speech by the use of the inherent jurisdiction.  Thirdly, I have to recognise that not even the restrictions contended for here offer real hope to CS of proper isolation from the fallout of publicity at this trial; it is inevitable that those who know him will identify him and thus frustrate the purpose of the restriction.  Lastly, I am simply not convinced that, when everything is drawn together and weighed, it can be said that grounds under article 10(2) of the ECHR have been made out in terms of the balance of the effective preservation of CS&#8217;s article 8 rights against the right to publish under article 10.  </p>

	      <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The need to be vigilant  arises from the natural tendency for the general principle to be eroded and for exceptions to grow by accretion as the exceptions are applied by analogy to existing cases.  This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing.  It is necessary because the public nature of the proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court.  It also maintains the public&#8217;s confidence in the administration of justice.  It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially.  It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors or with one or more of the parties&#8217; or witnesses&#8217;  identity concealed.  It makes uninformed and inaccurate comment about the proceedings less likely . . .  Any interference with the public nature of court proceedings is therefore to be avoided unless justice requires it.  However Parliament has recognised there are situations where interference is necessary.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">... A criminal trial is a public event.  The principle of open justice puts, as has often been  said, the judge and all who participate in the trial under intense scrutiny.  The glare of contemporaneous publicity ensures that trials are properly conducted.  It is a valuable check on the criminal process.  Moreover, the public interest may be as much involved in the circumstances of a remarkable acquittal as in a surprising conviction.  Informed public debate is necessary about all such matters.  Full contemporaneous reporting of criminal trials in progress promotes public confidence in the administration of justice.  It promotes the values of the rule of law.</p>

	      <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">There are a number of specific consequences of the grant of an injunction as asked for in this case to be considered.  First, while counsel for the child wanted to confine a ruling to the grant of an injunction restraining publication  to protect a child, that will not do.  The jurisdiction under the ECHR could equally be invoked by an adult non-party faced with possible damaging publicity as a result of a trial of a parent, child or spouse.   Adult non-parties to a criminal trial must therefore be added to the prospective pool of applicants who could apply for such injunctions.   This would confront newspapers with an ever wider spectrum of potentially costly proceedings and would seriously inhibit the freedom of the press to report criminal trials.</p>

	      <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, if such an injunction were to be granted in this case, it cannot be assumed that relief will only be sought in future in respect of the name of a defendant and a photograph of the defendant and the victim.   It is easy to visualise circumstances in which attempts will be made to enjoin publicity of, for example, the gruesome circumstances of a crime.  The process of piling exception upon exception to the principle of open justice would be encouraged and would gain in momentum.</p>

If the newspapers choose not to contest such an injunction, they are less likely to give prominence to reports of the trial.  Certainly, readers will be less interested and editors will act accordingly.  Informed debate about criminal justice will suffer.</p>

	      <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, it is true that newspapers can always contest an application for an injunction.  Even for national newspapers that is, however, a costly matter which may involve proceedings at different judicial levels.  Moreover, time constraints of an impending trial may not always permit such  proceedings.  Often it will be too late and the injunction will have had its negative effect on contemporary reporting.</p>

Local newspapers play a huge role.  In the United Kingdom according to the website of The Newspaper Society there are 1301 regional and local newspapers which serve villages, towns and cities.  Apparently, again according to the website of The Newspaper Society, over 85% of all British adults read a regional or local newspaper compared to 70% who read a national newspaper.  Very often a sensational or serious criminal trial will be of great interest in the community where it took place.  A regional or local newspaper is likely to give prominence to it.  That happens every day up and down the country.  For local newspapers, who do not have the financial resources of national newspapers, the spectre of being involved in costly legal proceedings is bound to have a chilling effect.  If local newspapers are threatened with the prospect of an injunction such as is now under consideration it is likely that they will often be silenced. ... </p>

Given the weight traditionally given to the importance of open reporting of criminal proceedings it was in my view appropriate for him, in carrying out the balance required by the ECHR, to begin by acknowledging the force of the argument  under article 10 before considering whether the right of the child under article 8 was sufficient to outweigh it.&#8221;</p>

There are here two powerful and emotive competing interests, each protected by the Convention. On the one hand, the freedom of the press in relation to the open reporting of criminal proceedings, coupled with what Munby J has described as the "clear and compelling interest" of the media and the public in the publication of the photograph of a person convicted of a serious crime so as to "put a face on the man" (see&#160;<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">F v Newsquest Limited and others</span>&#160;<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/762" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 762 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 762 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] EMLR 607" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EMLR 607</ref> at para 98); on the other hand the need to protect the privacy of the children caught up in a situation over which they have no control and where they are in a delicate and vulnerable state and the subject of care proceedings of uncertain outcome. As to the former, the interference with the Convention right is certain and clear cut. As to the latter, it is more problematic in two respects. First, what is the likelihood of interference if the injunction is withheld? Second, if the injunction is granted how effective will it be to prevent or reduce the interference against which protection is sought? In these respects, when having regard to proportionality, it is necessary to consider not only the extent of harm which has already occurred, but the likelihood that the harm sought to be avoided will occur in any event.</p>

Different types of crime, albeit serious, give rise to different reactions in society and (depending upon the circumstances of the case) there may well be cases, which engage pity as much as condemnation for the defendant. That is, however, irrelevant to a balancing exercise as between the inroad into press freedom and the public interest on the one hand and incursion into the child's right to privacy and family life on the other.&#160;<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re S</span>&#160;has made clear that the court must be prepared to take a hard-headed and, what may appear in this jurisdiction a hard-hearted, approach.</p>

However, the case rightly made by Newsquest is that it is the novelty and issues involved in the charge to which the mother is pleading guilty which render it of high interest and I do not consider that reporting or discussion of those issues will be significantly inhibited. In so far as relief is sought against the naming of others who are or may be responsible for the care, education or welfare of the children, I do not consider that any significant inroad would be made into the right to report the criminal proceedings.</p>

However I do not accept there is no immediate threat to their health or well-being if the injunction is not granted. I am persuaded by the evidence before me that if the "naming and shaming" which is proposed (and by use of that convenient phrase I do not seek to suggest that it would not be justified) then there is likely to be a focus of attention, pressure and harassment upon the children and the families concerned and potentially concerned with their care of a far higher profile and more intense degree than would be the case if the injunction is not granted (see further below).</p>

If R stays with his father's family, their predicament will be known on the estate, regardless of whether wide spread publicity occurs. However, it is not yet settled where R's future placement will be. Further, if the matter is the subject of high publicity, not only is it likely to encourage a higher level and a more widespread curiosity and adverse attention in the short-term, but, memory and gossip being what they are, chances of attracting harassment, bullying and teasing in the future over a medical condition which R probably does not have, and certainly does not deserve, are high, and in my view probable. If, in the event, the outcome of the care proceedings is ultimately that the Council seek to place R with other foster parents, again I consider it likely that unnecessary difficulty may be encountered in placing him.</p>

	      <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">So far as T is concerned, similar considerations apply, but to a more serious and positive extent in that she is already of an age to be vulnerable and sensitive to teasing, ostracism or bullying should that occur as a result of wide publicity being given to the identity of her mother and father. I have already referred to T's very vulnerable position by reason of the disturbance that she has already suffered. I accept that there is likely to be serious short-term and long-term prejudice to the children if the injunction is not granted, for the reasons given by the Council. It may well be that, even without it, there will be a level of gossip and harassment. However, in my view it is sufficiently established that what may otherwise die down as a nine-day wonder will be elevated into a widespread and far longer-lasting inroad into the privacy and family life to which these children are entitled and of which they are in such need. In my view it is both necessary and proportionate to protect the children against what I consider is established as a likelihood of harm which will be avoided, or at any rate diminished, if the injunction is granted.</p>

Equally, each Article qualifies the right it propounds so far as it may be lawful, necessary and proportionate to do so in order to accommodate the other. The exercise to be performed is one of parallel analysis in which the starting point is presumptive parity, in that neither Article has precedence over or 'trumps' the other. The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each. It is not a mechanical exercise to be decided upon the basis of rival generalities. An intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary before the ultimate balancing test in terms of proportionality is carried out."</span></p>

We must however add that we respectfully disagree with the judge's further conclusion that the proper balance between the rights of these children under Article 8 and the freedom of the media and public under Article 10 should be resolved in favour of the interests of the children. In our judgment it is impossible to over-emphasise the importance to be attached to the ability of the media to report criminal trials. In simple terms this represents the embodiment of the principle of open justice in a free country. An important aspect of the public interest in the administration of criminal justice is that the identity of those convicted and sentenced for criminal offences should not be concealed. Uncomfortable though it may frequently be for the defendant that is a normal consequence of his crime. Moreover the principle protects his interests too, by helping to secure the fair trial which, in Lord Bingham of Cornhill's memorable epithet, is the defendant's "birthright". From time to time occasions will arise where restrictions on this principle are considered appropriate, but they depend on express legislation, and, where the Court is vested with a discretion to exercise such powers, on the absolute necessity for doing so in the individual case.</span></p>

Innocent parents suffer from the criminal activities of their sons and daughters. Husbands and wives and partners all suffer in the same way. All this represents the further consequences of crime, adding to the list of its victims. Everyone appreciates the risk that innocent children may suffer prejudice and damage when a parent is convicted of a serious offence. Among the consequences, the parent will disappear from home when he or she is sentenced to imprisonment, and indeed, depending on the crime but as happened in this case, there is always a possibility of the breakdown of the relationship between their parents. However we accept the validity of the simple but telling proposition put by the court reporter to Judge McKinnon on 2 April 2007, that there is nothing in this case to distinguish the plight of the defendant's children from that of a massive group of children of persons convicted of offences relating to child pornography. If the court were to uphold this ruling so as to protect the rights of the defendant's children under Article 8, it would be countenancing a substantial erosion of the principle of open justice, to the overwhelming disadvantage of public confidence in the criminal justice system, the free reporting of criminal trials and the proper identification of those convicted and sentenced in them. Such an order cannot begin to be contemplated unless the circumstances are indeed properly to be described as exceptional.</span></p>

We accept the assessments of their mother, their headteacher, their social worker and the consultant child psychiatrist. Nevertheless we must adopt a much wider perspective. For the reasons set out above, we concluded at the end of the hearing that all we could properly do in the interests of the children was - exceptionally - to announce our decision in advance both of the delivery of our judgment and of our setting aside of the judge's order. Our intention was to create a period in which work might be done with the children, with a view to enable them better to cope with the public identification of their father following its earlier postponement.&#8221;</span></p>

This is because stories about particular individuals are simply much more attractive to readers than stories about unidentified people. It is just human nature. And this is why, of course, even when reporting major disasters, journalists usually look for a story about how particular individuals are affected. Writing stories which capture the attention of readers is a matter of reporting technique, and the European Court holds that article 10 protects not only the substance of ideas and information but also the form in which they are conveyed:</span><span style="font-style:italic">&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">News Verlags GmbH &amp; Co KG v Austria</span><span style="font-style:italic">&#160;</span><a href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/5.html" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">[2001) 31 EHRR 8</a><span style="font-style:italic">&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#8230;. This is not just a matter of deference to editorial independence. The judges are recognising that editors know best how to present material in a way that will interest the readers of their particular publication and so help them to absorb the information. A requirement to report it in some austere, abstract form, devoid of much of its human interest, could well mean that the report would not be read and the information would not be passed on. Ultimately, such an approach could threaten the viability of newspapers and magazines, which can only inform the public if they attract enough readers and make enough money to survive."</span></p>
