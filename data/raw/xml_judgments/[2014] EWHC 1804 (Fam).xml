	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The Hague Convention of 1980 is arguably the most successful ever international treaty and it has over 90 subscribers to it, over half the countries in the world.  The underlying and central foundation of the Convention is that, where a child has been unilaterally removed from the land of her habitual residence in breach of someone&#8217;s rights of custody, then she should be swiftly returned to that country for the courts of that country to decide on her long-term future.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There are very few exceptions to this and the exceptions that do exist have to be interpreted very narrowly in order that the central premise of the Convention is not fatally undermined.  It is important to understand what the Convention does not do.  The Convention does not order a child who has been removed in the circumstances I have described to live with anybody.  The Convention does not provide that the parent who is left behind should, on the return of the child, have contact or access in any particular way.  The Convention does not provide that, when an order for return to the child&#8217;s homeland is made, the child should stay there indefinitely.  All the Convention provides is that the child should be returned for the specific purpose and limited period to enable the court of her homeland to decide on her long-term future.  That is all it decides.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Where exceptions come into play, such as for example the exception mentioned in Article 13 of the Convention, which is that the child objects to being returned and has attained a degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take into account her views, the type and nature of the exception has to be examined in the context of the limited objectives of the Convention.  It must be a sound, reasoned and mature objection to being returned to her homeland for the sole limited purpose of enabling the court of that country to determine her long-term future.  Equally, if the exception that is relied on is that there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place her in an intolerable situation, that again has to be seen through the lens of the objective of the Convention.  We are not talking here about long-term risks.  We are not talking here about long-term harm.  We are talking about risks and harm that would eventuate only in the period that it takes for the court of the child&#8217;s homeland to determine her long-term future and to impose the necessary safeguards, if necessary, in the interim.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">That particular exception has been heavily qualified by Regulation 11(4) of B2R which provides that it does not operate if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after her return.  That in turn is strengthened yet further by the fact that both Lithuania and the United Kingdom are active subscribers to the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children.</span></p>

In a case where a risk of harm under Article 13 of the 1980 Convention is suggested, if the countries in question are both subscribers to the 1996 Convention, measures can be ordered here - and I will do so in this case - which provide the necessary protection and which, by operation of the Council Regulation, remove the availability of that defence.</span></p>

The mother and father were married in Lithuania on 5 December 2004.  They are both Lithuanian, although I have read in the papers that the mother is of Russian origin but she has confirmed to me she is a Lithuanian citizen.  Their daughter, as I have said, was born on 24 January 2005.  The parties were divorced on 24 January 2011 and a final order was made by the Ukmerge District Court on 22 May 2013 which granted the mother, to use the old language, custody and which granted the father, to use the old language, access.  It is apparent that an earlier order was made on 22 December 2010 to the same effect.</span></p>

However, the only expert evidence that has been permitted by the orders of this court is that which was procured from Mindaugas Vaiciunas of the firm Vaiciunas &amp; Vaiciunas, who has produced a report of 31 March 2014, in which he confirms in para.37 that:</span></p>

That was two days after the last occasion on which the applicant had contact with his daughter.  The father made a complaint to the police after the removal, but the police concluded, in a decision dated 29 November 2013, that no crime had been committed and declined to start pre-trial investigations against the mother.</span></p>

I did not agree to A moving to England with the respondent and at no point did I state that she could go where she wanted, nor that A could reside in England with the respondent.  I do accept I was aware of the respondent did want to go to England to work and we discussed that A would live with me during that time.  I was shocked however when the respondent left without informing me and took A to the United Kingdom.  The respondent also lied to A and told her that they were going away only for a weekend and did not inform her they would be moving to England permanently.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I turn to Article 13 of the Convention which says merely in sub-paragraph (a) that this court is not bound to order the return of a child if the person who opposes her return establishes that the other person has consented to the removal.  The authorities on the question of consent have made clear, unsurprisingly, that the evidence has to be clear and unequivocal before the court will find that such consent exists.  Therefore, if there has been consent given in writing, that would obviously satisfy the test.  If there has been an admission of consent, that would </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">ex hypothesi </span><span style="font-size:14pt">satisfy the test.  If there has been an oral agreement between the parties which is corroborated either by third-party evidence or by the conduct of the parties in the light thereof, that would satisfy the test.  Here, we have simply a conflict of evidence so I have to ask myself whose account is more likely.</span></p>

On the contrary, the father&#8217;s subsequent conduct is at complete variance with consent.  The first thing that he did after having discovered that the mother had left was to report the matter to the police on 19 November 2013.  Secondly, he promptly made this application for the child&#8217;s return.  Thirdly, if this was a true, consensual situation, one would have expected the mother to have been far more open with the father about where she was and what she was doing, but in fact, until these proceedings were commenced, her activities were shrouded in secrecy.  Fourthly, following the removal, the mother did not supply the father with her address or contact details or even a telephone number, so far as I am aware.  This is inconsistent with a consensual arrangement.</span></p>

The next defence, is the question of the child&#8217;s objections.  The objections in question must be of appropriate maturity having regard to the terms of the Convention and they must be an objection to being returned to the homeland for the purposes of the courts there working out as soon as may be possible what is in the child&#8217;s best interests.

She has clearly sided with her mother and with remaining in this country.  She was guarded in what she had to say.  Her responses lacked depth, detail and balance.  I found it difficult to get a picture particularly of her life in Lithuania.  Questions about Lithuania were frequently diverted back to favourable comments about this country.&#8221;</span></p>

He stated to me that, at all times in the interview, she was very anxious and there was a significant lack of substance to her objections.</span></p>

It is perhaps of some interest that the Convention does not specify a minimum or maximum time period within which a child should be returned, but uses the ambiguous phrase &#8220;forthwith&#8221; instead.</span></p>

She will need some time in order to arrange her affairs here, perhaps to seek to negotiate a sabbatical from her job, to let A down gently, to arrange for her schooling to be brought to a temporary end.  Beyond that, it is necessary for the mother to have sufficient time to instruct a lawyer in Lithuania to take proceedings there on her behalf seeking what she should have done in the first place, namely permission from the court in Lithuania to relocate to this country.  The mother should understand that that is the steps that she should have taken.  She should have proceeded lawfully rather than unlawfully in the first place.  Beyond that, three weeks may give the mother an opportunity to obtain an urgent interim hearing in the Lithuanian court before 10 June which allows her to stay here.</span></p>

If that order is made, then of course the order for return that I am going to make will be superseded.  The order that Mr. Hames will draw up will specifically provide for that.</span></p>
