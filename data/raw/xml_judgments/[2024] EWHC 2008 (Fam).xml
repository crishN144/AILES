He said he is the father of the boys and Miss ZZ, the Respondent, is the mother.  He wishes to have contact with them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In support of the existence of the twins, the Applicant produced recordings of conversations where the Respondent and various witnesses had spoken to him about the children.  He exhibited WhatsApp messages and photographs from his telephone of one child and sometimes two which he said the Respondent had sent him.  He offered his telephone for forensic examination.  He also produced pregnancy ultrasound scans and other documents relating to the babies.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent&#8217;s case was that she was never pregnant and no twins were ever born.  The Respondent and various witnesses gave evidence.  They accepted it was their voices in the conversations recorded by the Applicant. The Respondent said that the photographs of a child or children and the ultrasound scans had been doctored by the Applicant and were not authentic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent said that the Applicant knew and knows that the twins were not born and he has pursued her as a continuing act of controlling and coercive behaviour or as an act of revenge for her reporting his father to the authorities as a possible child molester.  As was clear from the recordings and as she accepted, she allowed herself to join in the deception at the beginning although her case was that no one was deceived.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There were other suggestions of an earlier pregnancy, one made by a witness who said that the Respondent had told her that she had suffered a still birth with twins in 2019.  The Applicant suggested the Respondent had had a miscarriage in 2019. For that supposed early pregnancy, there were therefore three possibilities, a termination, a still birth or a miscarriage.  The Respondent&#8217;s case was that there was no earlier pregnancy and indeed no later one.  </p>

The Respondent&#8217;s family was wealthy, and it is agreed that at some point her brothers came to disapprove of the couple&#8217;s relationship. They considered that the Applicant was motivated by money. When the Respondent and the Applicant had an Islamic marriage in August 2019 few of the Respondent&#8217;s family attended and her brothers stopped communicating with her soon afterwards.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The couple moved in with the Applicant&#8217;s parents, but the relationship broke down shortly afterwards.  The parties have given different accounts about the reasons for this, but both of them agree that at one point the heart of a goat or a sheep was found on the Applicant&#8217;s parents&#8217; doorstep (&#8220;the animal heart incident&#8221;) and, rightly or wrongly, the Respondent was blamed for this.  Sometime later, the Respondent reported the Applicant&#8217;s father to the local authority as possibly having molested a foster child several years before.  This cannot have made the family relationships any easier.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was some evidence that undermined her account that she had remembered that the Applicant was pregnant on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2020 but there was nothing that enabled me to find her evidence was not truthful.  She seemed a respectable professional.  There was no evidence that she had an axe to grind and I did not accept that she was being put up to give this evidence by the Applicant.  Quite the contrary in her earlier statements and evidence she was critical of the Applicant.</p>

I now find there is strong evidence there was a pregnancy and there is some evidence that at least one child was born.  There is insufficient evidence to say there were two. </p>

I cannot say where the birth took place but it is likely to have been in a private hospital.  I cannot say where the child is currently.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am struck again by the difficulties that a Family Court has in fully understanding and exploring a set of facts in a case when there are no legal representatives.  The Family Court cannot act as an investigator.  There was evidence in these proceedings that may well, had it been explored appropriately, have led to a different conclusion.  These proceedings had been lengthy enough, each adjournment had led to further contradictory evidence, the fact finding had to come to an end.</p>
