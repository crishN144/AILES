Soon afterwards, he was served with a Family Court order obtained by Mrs R that day which, amongst other things, forbade him with immediate effect from entering or attempting to enter X Street.  The order had been made at a hearing of which he had no notice in proceedings of which he was unaware.  Mr R duly vacated the property and, having done so, attempted over a period of months to challenge the order through proper court procedures.  However, on the basis of an insignificant procedural failing, the court refused to hear his challenge.  In the meantime, he was arrested for an innocuous breach of the original order to which he pleaded guilty without receiving legal advice and in consequence acquired a criminal record.  And as if that were not enough, the effect of the original order was to deprive him of contact with his children for fully five months.  All in all, Mr R could be forgiven for feeling like the hapless protagonist in Kafka&#8217;s </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">"The Trial".</span></p>

The court has extensive case management powers, exercised through the Family Procedure Rules 2010, whose overriding objective is to enable the court to deal with cases justly.  In this case, the without notice order should not have been made.  It was drawn up in misleading terms that did not reflect the court&#8217;s intention.  The respondent was given no effective opportunity to challenge it within a reasonable time.  The court&#8217;s case management powers were then used in a Draconian way that compounded the injustice to an unrepresented party.</span></p>

It in no way diminishes her account, however, to say that the evidence scarcely justified the making of an order without notice.  The threshold appears at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/45/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.45(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>, which in summary requires the court, before making an order without notice to the respondent, to have regard to all circumstances, including any risk of significant harm to the adult or child, and whether it is likely that the applicant will be deterred from pursuing the application if an order is not made immediately.  Those criteria are supplemented by FPR 2010 PD18A, which states that without notice applications can only be made where there is exceptional urgency, or where the overriding objective is best furthered by doing so.  The exceptional nature of without notice procedures has been stated time and again in recent authorities.</span></p>

The transcript of the hearing runs to just two pages.  Mrs R was present and represented by counsel.  The judge rightly made clear at the outset that she was not going to grant an occupation order removing Mr R from 23 X Street, and remarked that Mrs R&#8217;s evidence was in general old.  She then went on to consider the draft order, noting that the family lived in X Street.  She said that she would make a non-molestation order including all the provisions in the draft order, but only for a few days.</span></p>

It led to the drawing up of an order in the exact terms of the draft order (paragraph 9 above), warning Mr R that he would be guilty of a criminal offence and liable to imprisonment of up to 5 years or a fine or both in the event of disobedience.  The order was expressed to last for a year.  Mr R was at the specific behest of the judge given permission to apply to vary or discharge the order on 24 hours notice and a hearing was fixed for an early date, 26 June.  It was stated that the court would then consider whether the order should continue. </span></p>

A swift decision can be taken in light of all the circumstances and the specific considerations set out in the Rule.  This can usually be done without an oral hearing.  On any view, this was a case where every single one of the eight relevant considerations listed in the Rule spoke in favour of granting relief.  As the history shows, an unduly strict or narrow approach can cause delay, expense and injustice.</span></p>
