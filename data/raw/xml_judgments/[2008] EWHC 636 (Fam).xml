However, because of the extensive overlap between their respective cases and that of their mother, KS, their certificates were withdrawn just prior to the commencement of this hearing.  They are accordingly acting in person.  I appreciate that they of course feel at a disadvantage in litigation of this seriousness, but I have been vigilant to ensure that their case is properly examined insofar as it both supports, and occasionally may slightly differ from, that of their mother.</p>

It became clear in the course of the examination of the first of the applicant&#8217;s witnesses that the applicant (in agreement with the Official Solicitor) was no longer seeking such a declaration.  They seek instead a declaration that she has fluctuating capacity in this regard. Thus, in their view, the issue becomes one of whether, and if so how, this vulnerable young woman can be protected at times when she does not have capacity, or come to that even when she does.  The fifth defendant does not, however, share this view and for reasons I shall turn to later in the judgment nevertheless seeks a declaration that SK cannot consent to sexual relations (defined as vaginal intercourse).</p>

The applicant has for some time attempted to interest the National Health Service Primary Care Trust in this litigation, and to make an application, but they have steadfastly declined to engage, until sending a letter dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2008 (the third day of the hearing) and attending by Dr. L. (Medical Director of the hospital) but without a legal representative on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March.  It was initially suggested by the expert obstetric and gynaecological evidence that if I were to make such a declaration, this operation could proceed on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2008, and, should I make a declaration in relation to the administration of contraception in the form of an IUD, that could be inserted at the same time.  For reasons I shall explain later, the idea of contraception is inimical to SK, and therefore it would be highly likely that issues of the forcible administration of general anaesthesia, and issues of restraint of liberty generally, would arise.  At the end of the evidence I was asked to &#8220;uncouple&#8221; these operations, and adjourn the issue of contraception.</p>

On Wednesday 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2007 Sumner J. heard an interlocutory application in this case.  The issue before him, which forms the subject of a 12 page judgment, was whether or not SK should return to the home of her mother for a trial period pending the final hearing which is now before me.  Although he also dealt with the proposed instruction of a further expert, I need not refer to that aspect again.  In the course of his judgment he set out in summary the background to this case and described it as &#8220;complex&#8221;.  He could not be said to be indulging in hyperbole.  There were five full lever-arch files of documents before him. There are eight plus before me.  Practice Direction documents exceed 250 pages.  The statements of the parties run to over 500 pages.  The reports of experts run to approximately 250 pages.  The Official Solicitor&#8217;s reports run to 120 pages.  There is a plethora of surrounding material, from sources including the police, an housing association, general practitioners, psychiatric hospitals, etc.</p>

It is not just one member of the family who has referred to KS as a &#8220;step-mother&#8221;, for in SR&#8217;s most recent statement she draws together a number of references from the historical documentation showing that a number of authors have suggested (based on information from unspecified family members from time to time) that this was the relationship between KS and the women who now do indeed prove to be her daughters and not her step-daughters.  SR in particular is aggrieved by this revelation of genetic identity, for she claims to have been referred to by KS (and others) as a step-daughter, and discriminated against by them accordingly.  In the course of KS&#8217;s evidence it became clear that she was under the powerful impression that it was SR who had raised the issue of a step-relationship, and who had called her &#8220;step-mother&#8221;, leading to grave affront and a considerable display of anger on the part of KS when describing her feelings on this subject.  SR was equally angry, distressed and tearful when describing her perception of familial discrimination against her.  It was unhappy to observe that KS, sitting at the back of the court was, throughout that part of SR&#8217;s evidence, laughing at her daughter, and trading with MHAS and LU looks suggestive of collusive derision for SR.  Returning to SK, the evidence does not appear to establish that she was discriminated against for this reason, but she certainly has been for others (see below).</p>

Indeed in considering the issue of her capacity at this time it is noteworthy that the applicant local authority/health services were aware of marriages numbered one and two, and did not seek to restrain either on the basis of lack of capacity.  Whether or not SK was at those times the subject of a formal assessment of her <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">psychiatric</span> state to determine the issue of capacity to consent (as opposed to the generality of her treatment) is not at all clear.</p>

I do not know whether or not, on this occasion, SK was regarded as having the ability to consent, or whether her marriage guardian (whomsoever that was) consented on her behalf.  It does not appear as if her mother was present at the ceremony, and I would imagine that her mother would, by virtue of her status, be her marriage guardian, and not one of her siblings.

It was not just the religion of her chosen partner, but also that she was having sexual intercourse outwith marriage which caused such problems for her family, it being said that her actions were culturally, religiously and socially an affront to their beliefs and practices.  The documentation I have read suggests that S was living with SK at the time she gave birth to her child (see above) although the papers also suggest that he may not have been the father, it being alleged that SK was at that time having sexual intercourse with more than one man.  At all events that relationship broke down after about two years.  It is at this time particularly that she appears to have been estranged from her family.  It is now their case that this was at her wish and not theirs, and that they were anxious to assist her.  I regret to say that I do not accept their evidence on this point, for the strong evidence suggests that this is a conservative family with orthodox views on the sinfulness of living with a man outwith marriage, and that their disapproval of her way of living manifested itself in them rejecting her.</p>

A body of documentation has been made available concerning her application to obtain this sheltered accommodation.  She was taken to aspects of it in the course of cross-examination by Ms. Morris (counsel for SR) suggesting that she had given answers to her interviewers suggesting that her own abilities to look after herself were severely constrained.  She was anxious in oral evidence to brush aside any such impression, purported not to understand how any such answers might have been recorded as a result of what she said, although she did agree that all of her relevant answers had been given whilst her daughter MHAS was there to translate for her.  I need not set out the detail of the discrepancies between what she then said about her limited abilities, and what she now says is the real (higher) range of her abilities.  I find that she was then quite content to exaggerate real problems, or fabricate problems for the purposes of deceiving the housing association in order to get better sheltered accommodation for herself.  The reality is nevertheless that she is severely inhibited in much of what she does, and whilst she can, albeit with difficulty, manage her own life, she is quite incapable of caring, to the extent required, for SK with her multiplicity of presenting problems.</p>

She told her assessor that she would call social services (and not, interestingly, her daughters) to deal with this, it being their responsibility.  One can well understand her dilemma, for she is from a culturally conservative family and society, and given the views of her religion, shared by herself, of regarding as sinful sexual relations outwith marriage, it is difficult to see how she could change her position on this.  It would, of course, be open to attempt to discuss with her the possibility of accepting that a man in this category might enter her home for purely social purposes, any sexual relationship occurring elsewhere.  That is certainly a submission which, in the course of exchanges during cross-examination of Ms. GC (see below) Ms. Hewson for KS invited me to consider.  In my judgment there is an air of persistent unreality about the proposals being put forward by KS on this as on so many subjects.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">KS&#8217;s answer as to how she would deal with her other daughters seeking to remove SK from her care was similar (namely reliance upon social services), she stating that she had no influence over her other daughters.  Were I to accept that that lack of influence was of historical interest only, and that KS, LU and MHAS are now agreed as to the proper care of SK, and that neither daughter would seek to remove SK from KS&#8217; care, it is submitted that this is not an issue which should cause me worry.  Of course SR does not share in this proposed family plan for the care of SK.  She is vehemently opposed to it.  It is suggested to me that a variety of injunctions placed around these family members might be a way of governing their vicissitudes of feeling for and about each other, and any acts consequent upon those vicissitudes, and that I could rely upon such a structure to ensure that the care of SK remains with KS.  I do not find this a convincing argument, for were I to find that there continues to be a risk of real disagreement between them, which I do, who would be the reporter of infractions?  Is it really to be expected that from this familial and cultural background, KS would report her daughter or daughters for any such infraction, leading possibly to the removal of SK from her care, and/or potentially grave consequences for her daughter or daughters.</p>

In a field as complex as care for the mentally disabled, a high degree of pragmatism seems to me inevitable. But in each case it seems to me that the four essential building blocks are the same. First, is mental incapacity established? Secondly, is there a serious, justifiable issue relating to welfare? <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>Thirdly, what is it? Fourthly, with the welfare of the incapable adult as the court&#8217;s paramount consideration, what are the balance sheet factors which must be drawn up to decide which course of action is in his or her best interest?&#8221;  (At 18 and 21).</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The balance of probability standard means that a court is satisfied an event occurred if the court considers that, on the evidence, the occurrence of the event was more likely than not.  When assessing the probabilities the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is established on the balance of probability.  Fraud is usually less likely than negligence.  Deliberate physical injury is usually less likely than accidental physical injury.  A stepfather is usually less likely to have repeatedly raped and had non-consensual oral sex with his under age stepdaughter than on some occasion to have lost his temper and slapped her.  Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher.  It means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred.  The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established.  Ungoed-Thomas J. expressed this neatly in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Dellow&#8217;s Will Trusts</span> (1964) 1 W.L.R. 451, 455:  &#8220;The more serious the allegation the more cogent is the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having read the papers with care, and considered not only the allegations of the family set out in their respective statements, but also in the vast amount of surrounding material, I have come to the clear conclusion that it is not possible to establish in the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">each</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">every</span> allegation where the truth lies.  In relation to some allegations there are very high levels of suspicion, but I could in all honesty go no further than to so record.  I have nevertheless been able to come to some clear views on certain issues (for example the family&#8217;s rejection of SK for a period) and on the generality of individual credibility.  For example, there was one part of the factual evidence (both written and oral) which related to KS&#8217; relationship with a fellow tenant of the building in which she previously lived.  He made many allegations about her behaviour, including that she launched hostilities against him, was racist, intolerant, abusive of him and his one guest, and guilty of physical assault upon him.  KS denied all of these, but I regret to say, having listened carefully to both of them, and to the contextual and compelling detail given in particular by Mr. F., that I unhesitatingly prefer his evidence over hers.  I appreciate that people lie for many reasons, and have accordingly given myself a direction which any judge in a criminal case has to consider giving to a jury where a defendant has lied or is thought to be lying the warning being set out in the case of R v Lucas <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1981] QB 720" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1981">[1981] QB 720</ref>.  I need not set out the full terms of that warning at this point, but have directed myself accordingly.  I find that KS&#8217; lying in this area of the evidence leads me to disbelieve other testimony she gives, or at the very least apply a heavy discount as to her truthfulness. For example, Mr. F described periodic observations by him of SK suggesting high levels of neglect of her by either KS and/or her family in the absence of KS.  I believe him.</p>

Thus, whilst being unable to make specific findings on most of the allegations, I approach their evidence with considerable caution which will inevitably give me considerable pause for thought when evaluating the reality of their expressed intentions for their future conduct, particularly when they assert that they have learned much from the recent past, and will strive not to re-create circumstances which will put SK at risk of, at the very least, becoming embroiled in their feuding.</p>

There can be no doubt in my mind that the evaluation of best interests is akin to a welfare appraisal &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; pending the enactment of a check-list or other statutory direction it seems to me that the first instance judge with the responsibility to make an evaluation of the best interests of a claimant lacking capacity should draw up a balance sheet. The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit. In the present case the instance would be the acquisition of fool-proof contraception. Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counter-balancing dis-benefits to the applicant. An obvious instance in this case would be the apprehension, the risk and the discomfort inherent in the operation. Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses. Obviously, only if the account is in relatively significant credit will the judge conclude that the applicant is likely to advance the best interests of the claimant.&#8221;</p>

An ultra-sound examination carried out before consultation showed that SK has a 5cm x 5cm complex solid cystic mass.  The vast majority of such masses in women of SK&#8217;s age are benign in nature, although given the possibility of malignancy it is necessary for a definitive diagnosis.  In addition to that question, SK has intermittent abdominal pain likely to be caused by the presence of the mass.  For those two reasons it is in her best interests medically for the mass to be removed.  Miss RL would wish to carry out this laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy (oophorectomy), and then to assess the left ovary.  If the lesion has the appearance of a benign cyst the ovary would be left intact, but any proper sign of malignancy would require the left ovary to be removed.</p>

Whilst she understood that she would be &#8220;asleep&#8221; when an operation would be carried out, SK was not able to describe what the word &#8220;cyst&#8221; meant, and had no grasp either at the time, nor in recall some 40 minutes later, of the potential need for the removal of the ovary in the event that malignancy or suspicion of malignancy was manifest.  I need not set out any further detail from that interview, for the unchallenged conclusion reached by her was that SK&#8217;s learning disability and recurrent psychotic mental illness only partially treated by medication, amounts to an &#8220;impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain&#8221; as that terminology is used in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2 (1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.

Serious risks of the procedure proposed occur in only approximately one in a thousand cases, although given that SK has previously had a caesarean section, there may be a slightly increased risk in her case caused by the presence of adhesions.

I appreciate in so stating that the common law would also provide protection to any doctor taking that clinical view and carrying out that further procedure.  It is unquestionably in her best interests that the mass currently causing her discomfort and intermittent pain be removed.  This is even more so in the light of the possibility that it is a malignant mass.

It has previously been proposed in the medical evidence that whilst SK is under general anaesthetic for the carrying out of the oophorectomy, it would be the perfect opportunity to insert such a device.  This could not be done either without her consent if she had capacity or without a court order.</p>

Apart from anything else, if SK were to be under the impression that in submitting to the administration of an anaesthetic she would be putting herself at risk of the doctors carrying out the insertion of a contraceptive device at the same time, she would be more likely than not to manifest powerful resistance, vocally and physically.  The hospital would then be faced with management decisions as to whether or not to proceed with the operation on that day, or attempt to re-negotiate with SK for a future occasion.  The evidence of Dr. L (the medical director at the hospital) and the evidence of Dr. EAM satisfies me that it would not be in SK&#8217;s interests even to contemplate the two operations being carried out at the same time.  I should make it clear, for the avoidance of doubt, that no final decision has been made that the hospital <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">shall</span> carry out the insertion of an IUD at any stage, for it is now the proposal of the hospital to consider at a multi-disciplinary meeting one month after the carrying out of the oophorectomy whether or not a contraceptive device should be fitted (always assuming that I make a declaration that the carrying out of such an operation would be in her best interests).</p>

It will, therefore, be necessary and appropriate, in my judgment, for a Dari-speaking person (whether a member of one of the local authority&#8217;s teams, or a member of her family), to be present with her for much of the prelude to the operation, and after she regains consciousness, so that she may be given the necessary reassurances.  In the event, of course, that the removal of her ovary is deemed necessary, it will be essential that a Dari-speaking person is there to explain, at the appropriate time, what has happened to her and why.</p>

SK apparently likes it, and there have been brief and happily successful introductions of her to WR and its staff, and a recent overnight stay.  One of the perceived advantages is the availability there of staff who speak Farsi.  The family (coming from Afghanistan) speak the Dari dialect of Farsi, and the written evidence does not altogether make it clear the dialect in which the proposed key-worker for SK, and the manager of WR, speak, although I was told by counsel that it is Dari.  Nor does the evidence indicate which, if any, of the staff at WR speak Urdu or Punjabi (both languages with which SK has a degree &#8211; unspecified &#8211; of familiarity).</p>

It is the local authority&#8217;s preferred placement, and has been the subject, as has RP, of an assessment by Ms. W.  It is her preferred option as well.  The Official Solicitor and SR also support it.  It is an 8 bed-roomed two storey house with a large garden.  The current occupants are of both sexes.  It has 24 hour staffing with a manager who understands Farsi, and who has some speaking skills in that language.  There is also another social worker who does speak Farsi employed there.  The manager in particular, impressed Ms. W for her abilities, and sensitivity to, for example, the multiple needs of, and the associated risks in caring for, SK.  Some of the questioning in oral evidence of the applicant&#8217;s social workers was devoted to the bathroom and lavatory arrangements at this home.  The room identified for SK is on a floor with two other bedrooms, one taken by a male occupant.  That floor has its own bathroom and lavatory.  It is not thought in this carefully monitored establishment that there is likely to be any intrusion upon, or loss of dignity by, SK (nor indeed the other residents) when carrying out their ablutions, a view reinforced in their experience by the fact that in her current residential accommodation provided in the course in the second half of last year, she has experienced similar arrangements without any difficulties arising.</p>

It is noteworthy that when she lived alone she was able to navigate her way around an area of London familiar to her, and she was said to move freely about that neighbourhood but will at first need support in going to areas she did not previously know.  Currently, she is somewhat shy of venturing from her short-term residential home, not being familiar with the area, and anxious about new areas of London.  If she were to move to WR it is intended that she should be introduced to her local community and become increasingly familiar with its environs so as to reduce those anxieties, and help to stimulate her, for she is currently bored.  It is noted that the applicant does not intend, for the foreseeable future, to permit her to leave WR unescorted for a variety of reasons.  Of course once she is introduced to the area it raises the possibility/probability that she will be much less compliant with the requests of her carers not to put herself at risk, which she may easily do if she ventures forth unaccompanied in due time, and thus the issue of restraint of liberty falls to be considered (see below).</p>

But respect for our human condition, regard for the realities of our society and the common sense to which Lord Oliver of Aylmerton referred in <span style="font-style:italic">Re KD</span> &#8230;, surely indicate that the starting point should be the normal assumption that mentally incapacitated adults will be better off if they live with a family rather than in an institution &#8211; however benign and enlightened the institution may be, and however well integrated into the community &#8211; and that mentally incapacitated adults who have been looked after within their family will be better off if they continue to be looked after within the family rather than by the State.&#8221;</p>

If the State &#8211; typically, as here, in the guise of a local authority &#8211; is to say that it is the more appropriate person to look after a mentally incapacitated adult than her own partner or family, it assumes, as it seems to me, the burden &#8211; not the legal burden but the practical and evidential burden &#8211; of establishing that this is indeed so. And common sense surely indicates that the longer a vulnerable adult&#8217;s partner, family or carer have looked after her without the State having perceived the need for its intervention, the more carefully must any proposals for intervention be scrutinised and the more cautious the court should be before accepting too readily the assertion that the State can do better than the partner, family or carer. </p>

Overall, despite that which follows later in this paragraph, the applicant&#8217;s assessment of contact is that it is greatly appreciated by all of the women, in particular by SK who is very tactile and affectionate, and who displays those behaviours readily with her family.  The overall quality of contact has been highly rewarding for all concerned.   There is an agreement as to the subjects which might be discussed and which are inappropriate to discuss with SK.  There has, nevertheless, been an occasional alleged infraction, for example it being said that in September 2007, KS was whispering in the ear of SK that the latter should say that she wished to live with her mother.  KS says this is all a misunderstanding and she was simply inviting her daughter to inform the Official Solicitor that she wanted to live with KS, SK having previously indicated this strong wish, and her mother seeking to help her to bring it to the attention of the Court.  There is no evidence to support this allegation save the hearsay reference.  On 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January this year KS touched SK in the vaginal area through her clothing.  The explanation from the family for this is that there was some discussion of SR&#8217;s visit to see a doctor who had asked her about sexual relations in the course of which discussion KS touched SK&#8217;s vaginal area and she and her daughters were laughing with, and not at, SK.  The applicant considered this to be an inappropriate way of touching, and the family was so advised.  Only a few days later on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2008 in the course of a very affectionate greeting of her mother, SK had at one stage in the course of that contact reached over to touch and then begin to rub her mother in the vaginal area through her clothing.  Neither the mother, nor LU, nor MHAS attempted to stop this, and made no attempt to advise SK that this was inappropriate.  These two occasions are admitted by the family, and it is their case that they listened carefully to the advice received on both such occasions, and will be vigilant to prevent and/or stop any repetition of such behaviour.  It is concerning, says the applicant, that where it is well-recognised that SK has real trouble understanding boundaries, this family, even as late as January this year, simply did not recognise the wholly inappropriate nature of this behaviour.  This, say the local authority is particularly worrying when one considers the previous exploitations of SK by men, and her inability to recognise proper boundaries of intimacy which the family should be teaching her and not undermining by default or act.  I agree with the Borough&#8217;s view. I give these details by way of illustration only.</p>

The factors included risks based upon allegations then current that KS and/or the two sisters were attempting to arrange a further marriage for SK when, in the applicant&#8217;s view, she demonstrably had no capacity to consent; allegations the family (not SR) were stealing from SK; that they were not aware of her multiple needs; that there was a continuing climate of &#8220;high expressed emotion&#8221; (this being a risk factor possibly triggering psychotic breakdown for SK because of her psychiatric vulnerability); that there was a history of feuding between the mother and the sisters in the presence of SK which likewise impacted on her mood and psychiatric state, and the continuing risk that SK would be drawn into this feuding.</p>

They nevertheless remain concerned about the others set out above, and the obvious implications for SK if caught up in this climate.  I find that the written and oral evidence more than establishes a history of behaviour between the mother and her daughters which factually underpins these anxieties.  It is the family&#8217;s case that they have learned much in the course of these proceedings about SK, about her capacities, about what affects her, and about their own behaviour and its implications for SK.  They assert that they have learned to moderate their behaviour, and now being fully cognisant of the risks to SK, would not expose her to a repeat.  In so asserting they have a modest degree of support from Ms. B and Ms. GC who spoke of a meeting arranged last September, attended by KS, MHAS and LU, social workers and members of the psychological services, the purpose of the meeting being to identify, in part at least, some of SK&#8217;s needs, and what the family might do to assist her.  The applicant says one such session is insufficient to address long-standing patterns of relationships.  Has the family learned enough?  I do not believe so based upon my reading and my observations of them throughout this hearing.  I appreciate the disadvantages of attempting to assess such patterns of behaviour on the basis of the limited snapshot of behaviour and evidence in the forensic arena, but sadly all-too alive and well were the manifest antipathies running powerfully through this family&#8217;s relations with each other, and their anger, passion and distress when reflecting upon these issues and their current loyalties.  I have no doubt at all that there remains a real risk /probability of these hostilities repeating themselves and being all-too evident to SK who would be drawn into them, with consequential deleterious effects upon her state.  I do not consider it to be an answer that SR is for the moment excluded from contact, she being the current focus of hostilities.  This family has turned each upon the other from time to time, SR being the current b&#234;te noir.  It is the applicant&#8217;s plan (put forward for consideration by SR) that there be attempts, subject to the wishes and feeling of SK, to re-introduce SR into the life of SK initially by the provision of a DVD from her sister showing happier times in their relationship.  Were that re-introduction to be achieved, SR would be back in the arena as the direct focus of hostility from her sisters.  Even if she remains outwith the current contact arrangements, I have very little confidence in the assertions of KS, MHAS and LU that they will avoid the topic of SR when in the presence of SK, and even if she mentions her sibling, they will not discuss her.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I nevertheless see that it is more appropriate than not to attempt a cautious relaxation of the contact regime.  Such an attempt must be carefully managed by the applicant.  Ms. B and Ms. C spoke of a Family Therapeutic Intervention which should ideally be set up to assist this family (as well as those managing the affairs of SK).  Such an intervention is arranged by the Mental Health Services, and the tailor-made programme runs for an average of six to nine months.  The family is advised how to deal with those suffering from psychotic conditions, how best to help them, irrespective of whether the incapacitated person lives at home or is resident in another home and the subject of a contact regime.  I invite the applicant to pursue a referral to the Mental Health Services for the creation of such a programme for this family.  It is a highly desirable programme for them for they, particularly LU, recognised their historical failures to discern the complexities of SK&#8217;s illness, and failed to respond appropriately to the vicissitudes of her condition.  Such a programme is not available in Ealing, and it may instead be necessary to apply to other psychology services.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicant&#8217;s proposals suggest the need for a regular review of the needs, wishes and feelings of SK, both in relation to her direct contact with her family, and her wider needs, it not being possible to consider contact issues in mediation.  The family is proposing a swift move to unsupervised contact, and even staying contact.  Whilst not ruling out such suggestions for the medium and longer term, it is far too early, in my judgment, to move to such a regime.  SK will be undertaking a move to WR.  She will be negotiating in her own way her relationships within that home, as well as potentially her disappointment in not living with her family.  She will be the subject of lengthy and careful assessment as to her need for access to programmes of education as well as social stimulation.  Although there is some sympathy for the suggestion made by the family that MHAS and/or LU (and possibly their mother) might approach WR directly by telephone or otherwise and ask for permission to drop in from time-to-time, such a way forward cannot be at the expense of her ability to settle and access important programmes elsewhere.  Whilst recognising the importance to SK of her family, and the Article 8 rights under the Convention of all of these adults, I approve the more cautious approach of the applicant, supported as it was by the expert evidence of Ms. W.</p>

I have already set out my view in relation to what findings I can and cannot make, and confirm that in respect of them I make no findings that these allegations are true.  SK has a long history over many years of making allegations against her siblings when either in psychotic states, or less severe states of mental turmoil, and it is unwise, without good corroborative evidence, to accept her at her word in such matters.  I note in any event, that Ms. B and Ms. GC did not regard the existence of the allegation as of itself a reason for inhibiting the reintroduction of contact to SR subject to SK&#8217;s wishes.</p>

Whilst I shall certainly make those declarations, it is not appropriate in my judgment at this time, to set up a detailed framework in which the applicant must operate.  The current circumstances are too fluid, and will change radically once SK moves to WR.  It would be unwise in my view for me to be too prescriptive, whilst recognising that I should in SK&#8217;s medium to long-term interests review the issue of contact at least once.

It is difficult to see how it can sensibly be said that she has capacity to consent to a particular sexual act with Y whilst at the same time lacking capacity to consent to precisely the same sexual act with Z. So capacity to consent to sexual intercourse depends upon a person having sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature and character &#8211; the sexual nature and character &#8211; of the act of sexual intercourse, and of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of sexual intercourse, to have the capacity to choose whether or not to engage in it, the capacity to decide whether to give or withhold consent to sexual intercourse: see <span style="font-style:italic">X City Council v MB, NB and MAB (by his litigation friend the Official Solicitor) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/168" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 168 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 168 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 FLR 968" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 FLR 968</ref>, at para [84].

She is a vulnerable patient easily prey to sexual exploitation and with a poor understanding of relationships in general, as well as limited ability to assess the intentions of others.  They agreed there needs to be in place, in order to protect SK from exploitation, measures (unspecified) which will be of particular import during any periods of relapse in which she lacks capacity.  The provision of contraception would not protect her from her underlying vulnerability whilst it may achieve the obvious result of protecting her from pregnancy (if not sexually transmitted diseases).  They agreed that the temporary periods of incapacity to consent to sexual relations may cause significant management difficulties for those undertaking her care, and Dr. EAM was of the expressed view that these temporary periods of incapacity should not be allowed to prevent SK entering a sexual relationship should she so wish at other times.  Dr. MS does not appear to associate herself with that view, at least in that document.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;Capacity to consent to sexual intercourse, where decisions are being made about the long term sexual conduct of an adult, cannot be required to be set at the criminal standard of capacity.  This is because the matters that are relevant to a finding of capacity are far wider than the narrow ones identified under the criminal test.  Should a capacity test with the usual situation-specific characteristics be applied then factors such as all the risks of sexual intercourse, including social, emotional and psychological risks, may be taken into account, it is submitted more closely following the types of matters that a person consenting to sexual intercourse capably would take into account.&#8221;</p>

It is her submission that the omission in this case of consideration of capacity in the light of the wider set of factors (see paragraph 134 above) by the court would amount to a failure to protect this vulnerable young woman who cannot in truth consent.  In the above quotation from her opening document she refers to &#8220;the criminal test&#8221; (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42/section/30/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 30 (2)</ref> (a) etc. of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2003 Act</ref>).  She is, of course, also referring to the two decisions of Munby J. in which he was considering whether or not there should be a distinction as between criminal and civil law on the subject of the relevant test of ability to consent to sexual relations.  I have already set out (although not in its extended form the full discussion undertaken by him on this subject) relevant paragraphs from X City Council v MB etc. and MM v Local Authority X.  However, it is, in considering Ms. Morris&#8217; argument, also worth setting out what Munby J. said at paragraph 89 of MM v Local Authority X:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Moreover, and of equal if not greater importance, there are sound reasons of policy why the civil law and the criminal law should in this respect be the same, why the law should, as it were, speak with one voice and why there should not be any inconsistency of approach as between the criminal law and the civil law.  In this context both the criminal law and the civil law serve the same important function: to protect the vulnerable from abuse and exploitation (see further below).  Viewed from this perspective, X either has capacity to consent to sexual intercourse or she does not.  It cannot depend upon the forensic context in which the question arises, for otherwise, it might be thought, the law would be brought into disrepute.&#8221;</p>

Whilst eschewing any intention of attempting to define the precise ambit of that phrase as it is used in those sections, which remains a matter for first instance trial judges and subsequently the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal, I would be surprised if those words were found to import the necessity for an evidential analysis in the criminal sphere of the sort of wide-ranging material which has been arrayed by Ms. Morris in her attempt to establish that capacity to consent is not present, or cannot be established.</p>

In one of the quotations provided for me to consider, the following phrase appears: &#8220;It should also be noted that different considerations apply in determining capacity to give valid consent of (sic) the criminal law, and particularly where it is alleged that a sexual offence has taken place &#8230;&#8221;.  It is not at all clear to me, since the authors of that guidance appear to accept that the test of capacity is as set out in MAB, the basis upon which they make this suggestion.  She further recites the passage where the authors consider that &#8220;the following factors may be relevant to an assessment of an individual&#8217;s capacity to consent to sexual relations &#8230;. the kind of relationship they have (for example if there is a power imbalance)&#8221;.  It is entirely unclear from these passages as to whether or not the authors are simply adverting to a relationship where it is demonstrable that the individual&#8217;s will is so overborne by the other person that they cannot, in truth, have been said to consent, or that they may be said, for example, to be under duress (as given its extended meaning in recent years in the criminal jurisdiction), or whether they are positing some more elaborate enquiry as to the nature of the relationship between the two individuals.  Whatever the answer to that conundrum, I do not find this guidance to be of particular help in illuminating the landscape of this case.</p>

It may well be that in the periods when Dr. EAM and Dr. MS consider that SK has capacity to consent to sexual intercourse, and does so, an objective view of her best interests might make her act of consenting, and any subsequent activity undertaken, extremely unwise, but the law has not yet come to the stage, and I hope never will, that it will seek to intervene to prevent acts on the part of the citizen which it does not consider to be in that citizen&#8217;s best interests which are nevertheless lawful acts and which the citizen has the capacity to agree to.  This is not to say that the State (here the applicant and/or the court) should not as part of its care plan for SK, in undertaking what will undoubtedly be very difficult management issues in relation to her behaviour, provide extensive advice and support to her, including advice on the possible/probable consequences of her having sexual relations when she is capable in law of making the decision so to do.</p>

Once again, in my judgment, this represents confusion on the part of Ms. Morris between the capacity to consent in law, and the separate question of whether or not any choices made by someone with capacity are wise when considered in the light of the best interests test.  The &#8220;false beliefs&#8221; upon which Ms. Morris relies (for example that the chosen male is in love with SK, and /or will marry her) are of a type, she submits, fatally to undermine SK&#8217;s consent even on the currently accepted test.  Sadly, many young women in society who do not suffer from the particular afflictions of SK similarly persuade themselves as to the attitude and intentions of their man towards them.  These factors go to the issue of the wisdom or otherwise of choosing to have sexual relations but cannot essentially, in my view, undermine the consent given when the person has capacity.</p>

She goes on to submit that the risks of pregnancy for SK are &#8220;crucially relevant to making decisions about sexual intercourse&#8221;.  In this context it is necessary to consider the findings of fact made in relation to SK as set out in paragraph 139 above.  In addition to those factors I note, and accept, the evidence of the applicant that even though currently housed in a residential home of mixed sexes, she has shown no inclination, despite her high sex drive, to establish sexual relations of any kind, let alone intercourse, with any of the male residents.  In WR, also a home for mixed sexes, I can feel a degree of confidence that the levels of care and vigilance of the staff, combined with SK&#8217;s apparent current lack of interest in establishing any sexual relations with any male other than her husband, are such that the risk of them occurring is acceptably low, and even when that care is undertaken (surreptitiously or otherwise) during her periods of capacity to consent, the likelihood of a pregnancy occurring as a result is also minimal.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do, however, agree with Ms Morris, and no-one dissents from this proposition, that SK&#8217;s carers should be provided with a &#8220;clear list of the indicators of a possible loss of capacity to make decisions about sexual intercourse&#8221; or other sexual contacts, so that they may i) recognise them and ii) act consistently with her other carers in establishing where the dial points on the barometer of capacity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence in the case is unhappily confused and in significant measure obscure.  Although everybody appeared to operate on the basis that SK had at one time received contraception in the form of injections and/or orally, the documentation now suggests that a number of years ago an IUD contraceptive device was fitted.  Apparently, scans have not picked it up subsequently, and there is a real question mark as to whether it exists or not.  Even if it does, it is the expert evidence, which I accept, that it is time for it to come out.  Should it be replaced with a new one?</p>

I agree, and thus the matter will have to be restored to court in due course.  I shall hear submissions as to when, at the hearing following on immediately after this judgment is handed down.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms. W invited the court to consider the appointment of a Personal Welfare Deputy with powers limited to the authorisation and monitoring of any deprivation of liberty considered necessary and appropriate, for example in relation to ensuring that SLK remains resident at WR.  The post would be time-limited until April 2009, thought to be the date upon which amendments to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> brought in to force by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/12" uk:canonical="2007 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 2007</ref> will commence.  This suggestion received no support from any quarter.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Were I to be appointing such a Deputy, I would be exercising my powers as a member of the Court of Protection, and would have to be satisfied that the appointment of a Deputy is to be preferred over the statutory scheme provided for in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16 (4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> (namely making declarations).  Furthermore, as is pointed out by Ms. Morris, a Deputy does not have the power to terminate contact (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/20/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20 (2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>) a power which may be necessary in this case, albeit exercised very sparingly.  Ms Morris also points out that any Deputy parachuted into this particular case would, in all likelihood, fail to understand the powerful personalities and feelings engendered by the history of this family at least until in post for a significant period.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the Deputy Official Solicitor suggests in her report, I should take a purposive view of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/12" uk:canonical="2007 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 2007</ref> provisions which provide a more rigorous framework for overseeing issues such as deprivation of liberty;  the current limited authorisation of a Personal Welfare Deputy simply does not cover the needs envisaged.  The appropriate way forward is for vigilant monitoring by the staff of WR and by return to court if the circumstances prove a need for further declarations/intervention, until such time as <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/12" uk:canonical="2007 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2007 Act</ref> comes into force.</p>
