The Mother met the Father in 2011 they formed a relationship in 2012. It was in 2012 when the Mother was working away from home that she discovered that she was pregnant with Peter (the Father being the father). She informed the Father of her pregnancy and that he was a father. Upon returning to Lithuania, it was agreed that she and the Father would live together in the Father&#8217; parents&#8217; property. They did not get married. The nature and quality of their relationship is the subject of a number of the allegations which are before the court. After the birth of Peter in 2013, the Mother soon became pregnant by the Father with their second child, Stephen. The circumstances of that pregnancy are also the subject of some of the allegations.</span></p>

In spring 2018, the mother sought treatment from a psychologist for herself and Peter. In winter 2018, the previous child arrangements consent order was varied by agreement, contact being varied to every other weekend with an increased level of child support. In spring 2019, Stephen&#8217; behaviour was deteriorating and he was taken by the mother to see a psychiatrist. In summer 2019, Stephen was hospitalised for16 days because of some of the behavioural issues he was displaying. In autumn 2019, there was an incident when the children were staying with their father: Stephen was left in the care of the paternal grandfather who was not directly overseeing Stephen when he and his stepsister left the property where they were staying, and went to a neighbouring property. There appears to have been some genuine worry and concern at the time until Stephen was found.</span></p>

The circumstances of what occurred are highly contested. It is not in dispute that the children were spending time with their father. It does not appear to be in dispute that while there, Stephen soiled his pants. The Father&#8217;s reaction to this is disputed. He says that he and his wife helped Stephen clean himself and his underpants. When they returned to the care of their mother a few days later, the mother reports that the children told her that their father had twisted Stephen&#8217;s ear during contact, that the father had shouted at Stephen when he soiled his pants, had hit him on the back, and had made Stephen clean himself and his soiled underpants in the shower.</span></p>

He asserts that he had obtained the express permission of the police to attend. The mother alleges that the father attended, shouted, punched doors and windows, and made threats to her parents and neighbours and that the police were called. Following this incident, the father applied to vary the contact under the 2018 child arrangement order, such that he could spend more time with the children. The bail conditions remained in place, and it was clarified that the father was not to have contact with either of the children pending the conclusion of the pre-trial investigation. A social services report, in autumn 2020, was filed within the father&#8217;s application, making reference to the allegations of violent and non-violent behaviour of the Father against the children. It did not recommend that the children spend more time with the father. </span></p>

In December 2020, the Lithuanian court made an order on the application of the Father to enforce the terms of the child arrangements 2018 order, the court finding that the Mother was not facilitating daily contact by telephone.

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities. However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence. Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable&#8221;</span></p>

M&#8217;s evidence was not completed as had been planned in the witness template. I asked, and it was agreed, that would start early on day 3 in attempt to make up some of the lost time, however, the Father&#8217;s interpreter was not present at the beginning of day 3 and the start was delayed while another interpreter was requested. The mother&#8217;s evidence continued until mid-afternoon on day 3, when the Father was sworn in. On day 4, I asked, and it was agreed, that we start at 10:00 again, but there was yet further complication with the interpreters, and we did not resume evidence until 11:20. the Father concluded his oral evidence until shortly before 5 pm. On the final day, I heard oral evidence from the maternal grandmother, and the Father&#8217;s wife, and helpful closing submissions from Ms Cabeza and Mr Gifford Head. </span></p>

The Mother&#8217;s evidence was that she had raised the allegations in various ways in Lithuania, either to the police, to the Child Rights Protection Service (i.e. social services in Lithuania), on indeed in court, but that, save as to the findings in the context of the pre-trial investigation, the Lithuanian courts had not made any determinations of the allegations. The Mother&#8217;s evidence was that she only felt safe enough once in England to raise in this court various allegations that were not heard when she raised them in the Lithuanian courts or with other Lithuanian authorities.</span></p>

The Mother&#8217;s response was that she had tried to promote the relationship between the Father and the children, and she pointed to various messages and e-mails exhibited to her statement that she had sent to the Father in this regard, stating that it was the Father who did not purse a relationship with the children rather than her not encouraging it. She referred to a separate e-mail account as well as a private Instagram account that she has more recently set up for the Father to receive pictures of and updates regarding the children.</span></p>

There is no doubt that the subject matter she was, quite properly, cross-examined about was triggering to her and touched upon issues of profound concern to her. I was left with the clear impression that she believes she was abused by and is still afraid of the Father, of her firm belief that that the children were abused and traumatised by him, that neither she nor the children were safe in Lithuania, and her genuine concern that the children would not be safe in their father&#8217;s care and that even communication between the Father  and the children will be damaging to them in circumstances where she says they are adamant that do not wish to communicate with him. </span></p>

Even if, as he stated in evidence, the Father believed the Mother to be mentally unwell (and I am far from convinced that he genuinely held that belief), I find that it was nonetheless abusive to refer to any such concerns in this way. It is clear from the report of Dr Campbell dated 17 February 2022 that, whilst anxious, the Mother is not mentally unwell and it caused her harm for the Father to repeatedly allege otherwise.

Without more, the Father had no reasonable basis to state to social services or in court that the Mother was or had been, in effect, a prostitute.

The obligation to pay maintenance was obviously consequent upon the children being resident with the Father and him incurring cost as a result. It is not in dispute they have not in fact stayed with, or seen, him since August 2020. The Father had, by May 2021, commenced an application with the Central Authority to locate the children and have them summarily returned to Lithuania. I consider that for the Father to enforce the maintenance obligation - which in fact required that the Mother pay the Father over &#8364;2,500  - and to instruct bailiffs to seize the Mother&#8217;s property and to freeze her bank accounts in Lithuania when he was self-evidently not incurring any costs in relation to the children, was deliberately intended to cause the Mother financial harm and was abusive in the circumstances. It also had a coercive and controlling character, in that it was intended to harm and exploit her resources.</span></p>

Nonetheless, an allegation of rape, even in the context of a fact-finding hearing as opposed to criminal proceedings, can only be based on clear, cogent and compelling evidence. The Mother  has not adduced sufficient such evidence in this case. In particular, she has not adduced evidence as to the specific circumstances of the alleged non-consensual intercourse.

Whilst this account does not give details of the physical abuse, I accept that the Mother was dissuaded from making such allegations for the reasons set out above. I accept that her application to the court in Lithuania in June 2015 for a child arrangements order is consistent with this account. I also note that her account shares key elements (argument, the Father&#8217;s departure and return with a friend, the arrival of her parents and her never going back) with the Father&#8217;s account and her parents&#8217; account.</span></p>

	    <p class="JEParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I find the Father&#8217;s contrary account of what happened on that date unreliable. In his witness statements he said that there had been an argument about money, but that he left to try and diffuse the situation and when he returned, the Mother had left with the children. However, in his oral evidence he substantially changed that story and stated that he came back at about 7 or 8 pm and that the Mother and the children were still there, in the garden, that he tried to speak to them but they did not answer. I find this version not only materially inconsistent with his previous written evidence, but inherently unlikely. The timing of his return does not accord with the evidence of the Mother or her parents, and I find it implausible that he would have been mistaken in preparing his written evidence about such an important point as to whether the Mother and the children had, or had not, left before he returned. I therefore find that the Father&#8217;s alternative accounts are unlikely to be true and that the Mother&#8217;s account is more likely than not to be true.</span></p>

His explanation was that the Mother had refused to allow him to see the children when he was just three minutes late and that she was exercising control over him. I do not accept the Father&#8217;s evidence as to being only three minutes late:  the Father&#8217;s attitude to timings, as he described it in oral evidence, was very casual, referring as he did to an occasion when he was 51 minutes late (when the Mother had an appointment booked for the children) as having &#8220;no big impact&#8221;. I also find it inherently improbable that the Mother was attempting to exercise any control over the Father at that date, just weeks after she had been forcible removed from her home and especially as her parents where not at home with her. It is more likely that she was acting in what she perceived as the children&#8217;s best interest in allowing them to stay in bed and sleep. In those circumstances, I find it more likely than not that the Father attended the property, became angry (and I note my finding that he had been angry and aggressive towards the Mother in expelling her and the children from their home only a few weeks before) and acted as described by the Mother. I find that this behaviour constituted emotional and psychological abuse of the Mother with a coercive and controlling nature, and emotional and psychological abuse of the children, who became distressed as they saw and/or heard what was happening.</span></p>

The account was clear, cogent and corroborated by the fact that it was reported to the police the same day by the Mother and by a neighbour who witnessed the Father at the property who gave a statement to the police. The Father does not deny that he attended, nor did he appear to deny that he knew that such attendance was contrary to the remand conditions that were then in place. His assertion, made for the first time in oral evidence, that he had obtained special permission of the police to attend, but had not produced a copy of that permission, was not credible. This finding is necessary because it goes to the risk of the Father not obeying court orders regarding the children.</span></p>

I have carefully considered all the evidence. In reaching my findings in relation to the allegations of ear twisting and hitting Stephen&#8217; back and bottom, I have focussed in particular on the contents of the pre-trial investigation report dated 12 January 2021. I focus on this report because it contains evidence that is more contemporaneous than the evidence given directly in these proceedings and I bear in mind the real risk of &#8220;story-creep&#8221; over time, especially in circumstances where the parties, witnesses and children have been asked to recall the events of July/August 2020 on numerous occasions to numerous individuals and organisations. That report included evidence from the children, the Father, the Mother, the Father&#8217;s wife and both sets of grandparents. The pre-trial investigation concluded that there was insufficient &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">objective, irrefutable and sufficient</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221; evidence to establish &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">with certainty</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221; or &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">beyond doubt</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221; the constituent elements of the criminal offences by the Father which were under consideration. However, I am faced with a different task: I must consider the totality of the evidence before me and consider whether the specific allegations of abuse made by the Mother are proven on the balance of probabilities. I do not consider that any of the findings of the Vilnius District Court dated 25 May 2021 can be relied upon because that decision was annulled upon the Mother&#8217;s successful appeal on 7 April 2022. </span></p>

My reading of that paragraph and its conclusion is not that it made a new finding of fact: rather, the panel of appeal judges were commenting upon the arguments put forward on the part of the Mother and merely concluded that the Father&#8217;s behaviour towards the children post-dated the photographs referred to, since his behaviour &#8220;was constantly changing&#8221;.

I reach this finding on the basis that I accept the Mother&#8217;s evidence that Stephen had told her that his father did this to him, that she raised the issue with the Father before the last direct contact took place in August 2020 and that the Father  admitted that he did so because Stephen did not obey him, but said he would not do it again. The Mother referred to this behaviour again in her letter dated August 2020. I also accept the evidence that Peter has provided to various individuals and authorities, including the pre-trial judge, regarding the Father pulling Stephen&#8217;s ear. I accept that in the first interaction with social service on 9 August 2020, Stephen referred to his father having &#8220;pulled him by the ear&#8221; and he repeated this to social services on 12 August 2020. I acknowledge that there was some inconsistency in Stephen&#8217;s evidence to the pre-trial investigation, but consider that this was due to the circumstances of the various interviews and to Stephen&#8217;s age and vulnerability. I do not accept the Father&#8217;s bare denial that he did not twist Stephen&#8217;s ear, which appeared to me to be more focussed on him finding fault with the Mother for raising this allegation rather than addressing why his children had reported to social services and the pre-trial judge that he had pulled or twisted Stephen&#8217;s ear.</span></p>

I reach this finding primarily upon the contemporaneous evidence of the children referred to in the pre-trial investigation report, as given to the pre-trial judge and the psychologist. Stephen was clear, when interviewed by a social worker on 9 August 2020, that his father had hit him. Peter admitted that he had not seen Stephen being hit, but that he had heard shouting and that Stephen had told him afterwards that his father had hit him. This account was consistent with what the children reported to their mother at the time and with what Stephen told the pre-trial judge and his grandmother and I find it more likely than not to be true. I find that Stephen&#8217;s fear of the Father repeating this behaviour has caused him psychological harm.  </span></p>
