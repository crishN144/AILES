There are two applications before me; one by the Applicant Mother dated 6 January 2023 for a Reporting Restriction Order (&#8220;RRO&#8221;) preventing the identification of the Mother and Father&#8217;s three children, and the second by the Father to relax the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref> (&#8220;AJA&#8221;) to permit him to disclose information from the proceedings to the world at large.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to this case concerns three children. The oldest child is not currently subject to an application in the Family Court but would be affected by publicity in a way similar to the two younger children. There has been extensive and highly conflictual litigation concerning the children over a number of years. This culminated in a decision by District Judge Saunders sitting at the West London Family Court in January 2023 after a four day hearing that the Father should have no direct contact with the children.  District Judge Saunders set out a very detailed judgment in which she explained the background to the matter and her reasons for her conclusions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In very brief terms, the parties divorced in 2015, arrangements with the children broke down in late 2017 and litigation commenced in 2018. The Father&#8217;s position has consistently been that the Mother has alienated the children from him and that the judges and professionals involved have accepted the Mother&#8217;s case entirely wrongly. There was a hearing before District Judge Gibson in October 2018 who made an order for contact building up to unsupervised contact. For various reasons, those arrangements broke down and there were then further proceedings culminating in the judgment of District Judge Saunders.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The approach advanced by the Mother, through Mr Wolanski, was to invite the court to adopt a process similar to that used under the Family Court Transparency Pilot which commenced on 30 January 2023 and is currently being operated in three pilot courts in England and Wales (Leeds, Cardiff and Carlisle). The President of the Family Division has issued Transparency Reporting Pilot Guidance which is being used in the three pilot courts. The present case does not strictly fall within that Guidance, but it is accepted by both parties that it is appropriate to adopt a similar approach in this case.</p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The process being adopted in the pilot courts is that a &#8220;pilot reporter&#8221; (a member of the press or legal blogger) can attend the court and make a request for a Transparency Order (&#8220;TO&#8221;) allowing them to report the case subject to various restrictions intended to preserve the anonymity of the children concerned. Mr Wolanski has submitted to the court a draft RRO that is intended to mimic the provisions adopted in the pilot court. One key matter from that procedure is that it is not open to a party, in this case either of the parents, to publish any information about the case. The approach in the pilot courts is only to allow reporters, as defined, to speak to the parties as set out in the President&#8217;s Guidance. </p>

That after all is what M's &#8216;alternative view&#8217; of the case is. The expression of that view, therefore, not only risks J's privacy but his emotional wellbeing. As will be clear from my extensive judgment, given space and independence, J has moved from presenting as a girl to asserting his male identity. This process has been gradual and public. It has been witnessed by his peers and teachers. His school has been tremendously supportive. This is the landscape in which J's Article 8 rights, asserted on his behalf by his father and Guardian, fall to be considered. There is, in my evaluation of the competing rights and interests here in play, a high and wholly unacceptable risk that the mother will either unknowingly or otherwise, broadcast some detail of her and J's life together which will identify J to those who know him and who hear or read such information. Again, the highly unusual facts of this case render that, self evidently, far more likely than would be the case in many other circumstances. The potential consequences incorporate not only the violation of J's privacy but the inestimable harm to him caused by hearing, or hearing of, his mother asserting, in the public domain, her wholly unjustified conviction that her son is gender dysphoric or identifies as a girl. Moreover, it is difficult to see how by advancing her views in the public domain M can fail to damage the fabric of her relationship with her son. That relationship as I have said in the substantive judgment is, above all else, J's right.&#8221;</span></p>

The Mother has therefore asked that the Father gives an undertaking that he will not discuss with the children any actual or potential publication of information concerning the proceedings or draw the children&#8217;s attention to any such publication. At the present time the Father has no direct contact with the children, but I accept that that situation may change. The Father has been happy to accept an undertaking that he will not so discuss any reporting with the children and I have accepted that undertaking.</p>

The order in this case therefore has to retrospectively try to reproduce what would have been decided if the case had been in a pilot court and an application had been made before the case concluded. Mr Wolanski&#8217;s draft order, in the main, achieves that outcome. There are however a limited number of points in dispute. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Father requests that the independent social worker Mr Power, the local authority social worker, and the GP should all be named. In accordance with the principles in the Transparency Pilot Guidance, independent social workers, so long as they are not currently working with the children, can be named in any reporting. This follows the principle that they are professionals appointed by the court to produce reports, and thus are independent experts who can reasonably be expected to be named in any judgment.  However, the normal position would be that a local authority social worker and a clinician cannot normally be named. I see no reason in this case to depart from those normal principles. If a reporter wishes to report this case and believes that there is a public interest in naming either the social worker or the GP, then the reporter can make an application to this court, and I will consider the application on the individual facts of the case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second issue concerns what documents and other materials the reporter can be shown. In the Transparency Guidance a very careful balance is struck between giving the reporters enough information to allow them to meaningfully report, but to preserve the essential privacy and Article 8 rights of individuals involved in the proceedings, both children and their parents. In the Pilot Guidance, reporters are entitled to see documents drafted by the advocates, or litigants in person if self-representing, and indices from the court bundle. This then allows the pilot reporter to make further applications for documents if they consider it necessary for effective and proportionate reporting.</p>

If they refuse that permission, then the matter can come back to me for further consideration.</p>

This includes both photographs which he suggests are relevant to any reporting, and recordings of conversations he had with one of the children which he suggests provides evidence of parental alienation by the Mother. Mr Wolanski points out that some of the recordings were covert and were done without the permission, and indeed the knowledge, of the child in question. </p>

If they consider it is necessary and proportionate for their reporting to see further documentation then they have to make an application to the judge. This again balances the Article 10 rights of the journalist with the Article 8 rights of the family. Again, I consider this to be the appropriate approach here. If the reporter wishes to see the further material, then s/he will have to make a specific application. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third issue concerns specific identifying information relevant to the case. The principle that lies behind the Guidance and draft TO being used in the pilot is that nothing should be revealed in reporting which is likely to lead to the identification of the children. There is no dispute that the names of the Father&#8217;s partner or former partner<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/>would be likely to lead to such identification and therefore is appropriately excluded. The other piece of information which the Mother seeks to be excluded relates to her heritage which she says is likely to lead to her identification and that of the children. Given the particular facts of the case, I can see some possibility in this regard and I will therefore restrict the identifying information to reference to the fact that the Mother&#8217;s family is from Northern Europe. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fourth and most contentious area relates to a schedule of prohibited information to do with the personal circumstances of the family. This part of my judgment will need to be further redacted before my judgment is published. This information both goes to the Mother&#8217;s own Article 8 rights and very importantly to information which could harm the children if in the public domain.  I appreciate that the children will be anonymised in any reporting, and the intention is that members of the public, certainly those who do not know the family, will not be able to identify the children or the family. However, the children themselves if they read the judgment or come across any media reporting may well be able to identify their own family. This information could well cause them very great distress and indeed psychological harm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Father says that the children are already aware of this information, or at the very least that the oldest child is aware of it. However, even if that were correct, the fact that such personal information is placed in the public domain is something that could well have a damaging effect on the children. Balancing the Article 8 and Article 10 rights in this case I can see minimal genuine public interest in this part of the case and, in my view, the balance lies strongly in favour of not putting this information into the public domain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The next piece of disputed information is &#8220;the mother&#8217;s historic substance or alcohol abuse or other difficulties&#8221;. This is of course very personal information for the Mother. However, if any reporting can make no reference to this aspect of the Mother&#8217;s history then the Father&#8217;s complaints about the process and why he feels the courts were wrong to rely on the Mother&#8217;s evidence, and why he feels this is a case of parental alienation, become very difficult to understand. It also appears from the evidence, although I only have written evidence from the Mother on this point, that the children are likely to have some knowledge of the difficulties the Mother has faced in the past. It seems to me the appropriate way forward, given that the Mother has accepted that there can be reporting of the case in principle, is to gist these issues along the lines of &#8220;the mother has had issues in the past with substance and alcohol abuse and some other vulnerabilities&#8221;. If I were not to allow a gist in this form, then much of the Father&#8217;s case and of the judgments themselves would become meaningless. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The next piece of disputed information concerns the children&#8217;s own very personal circumstances. I can see no justification for allowing reporting of those matters. They are neither critical to any public interest in this matter nor to the way the Father frames his complaints against the family justice system. I am very conscious of the fact that the children are of an age to be using social media and that makes them particularly vulnerable to the spread of information. In my view the Article 8 right of the children to maintain their privacy in this regard outweighs any Article 10 consideration.</p>
