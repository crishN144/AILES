F1 is serving a life sentence for murder, and the M is in prison for manslaughter. Both were sentenced by HHJ Lockhart KC at Coventry Crown Court on 12 March 2021. F1&#8217;s earliest release date is 2036. According to Ms Bell of the Probation Service the M will automatically be released in May 2027. The M is eligible for early release in May 2025, and might be eligible to be released in May 2024, but that depends on her fulfilling certain criteria which at the moment are not certain. </p>

PA1 is the youngest sibling, and puts herself forward to look after C2 &amp; C3. The victim and F1 were first cousins.</p>

There was a report in September 2018 to the then Local Authority, Birmingham Children&#8217;s Trust (&#8220;LA&#8221;), about F2 being abusive to the M, and her having attempted suicide, although the M has always denied the veracity of the allegation of a suicide attempt.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The murder took place on 17 November 2019. The very brief background is that the M alleged that the victim had sexually assaulted her. This then led to a sequence of events which culminated in the victim being killed with a knife by F1. The parents then got into a car with C1 and C2 and were stopped by the police firearms unit. F1 was arrested by armed officers which the children observed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A number of the sentencing remarks of HHJ Lockhart KC are highly relevant to the issues I have to decide. I am not bound by them as findings of fact, but the Judge had presided over a lengthy trial and had heard a large quantity of evidence, I therefore give them the utmost weight. The key passages are as follows:</p>

I find that the texts, the telephone calls and the other social media traffic indicated that you would not let this lie. You had decided that you had been wronged, you were determined to have it out once and again with V1. This at a time when you would have F1 at your side. I find that you issued an ultimatum to F1, V1 and PA2 leaving, or "me leaving". F1, at your hands, was under some pressure, M.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">F1, "kill him". On the finding of the jury, you did not actually wish for this to happen, but in every sense you encouraged him to assault V1 as he went forward. I find, of course, that I cannot be sure that you wanted him killed, but you were encouraging him as he went forward.&#8221;</span></p>

I have made a sure finding that you here took the law into your own hands. If there was some provocative conduct by V1 -- and I am prepared to find that in the weeks and days before this event there may have been -- then because there were so many other ways of dealing with it, it offers little by way of mitigation. That said, I do find that your co-accused M, did, in a wholly despicable way, encourage you to violence. It is hard for me to assess exactly what weight to give this factor, but I take it into account in your favour in the way that I can.&#8221;</span></p>

I asked for clarity from the Prison Service as to the M&#8217;s possible release dates. In a letter dated 16 June 2023 the Probation Officer at HMP Foston Hall informed me that she is eligible for being Released on Temporary Licence (&#8220;RoTL&#8221;) on 31 May 2025. However, that was subsequently changed to such release being possible in May 2024.  It is also possible where prisoners have made exceptional progress during their sentence for them to be recategorized a year early, i.e. on 31 May 2024, but it is not possible to know if that would apply to the M at this stage.</p>

The assessment considers the impact of separation of the siblings should C1 and her younger siblings have different care plans. The assessment concludes &#8216;it is recommended that if F2 is positively assessed by the Local Authority and C1&#8217;s long-term care plan is that of placement with her father, then the separation of the siblings would be deemed necessary and proportionate to allow C1 to reside with her father, and C2 and C3 to reside in an alternative placement, which is deemed suitable to meet their needs throughout childhood.&#8217; And &#8216;It would be important for the children to have an ongoing relationship as this is important for their identity throughout their childhood. The means of such relationship will be determined at a later date within their care plans as it is important that the children&#8217;s safety is the priority throughout any decisions which are made.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>

She denied knowing about the tensions within the family prior to the murder, but Ms Kapur considered this not to be true. PA1 seemed na&#239;ve at times, not considering the difficulties of looking after the children once the M was released from prison. Ms Kapur was very concerned about the wider family dynamics.

Further, she had seriously underplayed events within the household before the murder. PA1 had been very reluctant to give contact details of the Parental Grandparents.

She said that she had come to the UK on 21 October 2019 to live with her husband who she had married the previous year in Pakistan. Her evidence was that she had only lived with him for 5 days, but he had been abusive and she had left and gone to the police, who had helped her to live in a refuge. She had moved to live with F1 and the family on 31 October 2019, 17 days before the murder. However, at the end of her evidence I pointed out to her that she had told the police on the day of the murder that she had moved to Osborne Grove on 12 November, five days before the murder. At that point she changed her evidence and said that 12 November was the correct date. I do not see how this could be an innocent mistake. The difference between having lived with the family for only five days rather than 17 and therefore having such limited time with the children at such a memorable and intense time, is a not an easy mistake to make. </p>

Under Article 8 of the ECHR, any interference with the exercise of the right to respect for family life should be proportionate to its legitimate aim. There can be no greater interference than the permanent removal of a child. Consequently, the relationship between parent and children can be severed "only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare, in short where nothing else will do", per Baroness Hale of Richmond in Re B (Care Proceedings: Appeal) [2013] UKSC 33 [2013] 2 FLR 1075 at paragraph 198.

In doing so may well be that some features of one or other option taken in isolation would produce a better outcome in one particular area for the child throughout minority and beyond. It would be intellectually dishonest not to acknowledge the benefits. But this is not to say that finding one or more benefits trumps all and means that it cannot be said that &#8220;nothing else will do&#8221;.  All will depend upon the judge&#8217;s assessment of the whole picture determined by the particular characteristics and needs of the child in question no doubt often informed by the harm which she has suffered or been exposed to.&#8221;</span></p>

A witness may lie because she lacks credibility, or because she has an innocent motive for lying. If she lies about the key fact in issue, that is one thing; if she lies about collateral facts, that may be quite another.

Lies, however disgraceful and dispiriting, must be strictly assessed for their likely effect on the child, and the same can be said for disobedience to authority. In some cases, the conclusion will simply be that the child unfortunately has dishonest or disobedient parents.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This background means that it is particularly important that the children have as stable and permanent a home going forward as is possible to achieve.  They need high quality and consistent parenting. They also need a placement that will be sensitive to, and be able to deal with, the long term consequences of the trauma they have suffered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have no hesitation in dismissing PA1 and LG as not being realistic options to care for the children. I accept PA1 has the advantage of being a family member and may well have a genuine commitment to the children. However, I agree with Mr Thompson and Ms Kapur that she appeared na&#239;ve and unrealistic about the challenges of looking after them in the long term. She did not appear to have thought out at all how she would deal with the position when the M comes out of prison, when in my view she is highly likely to seek to have the younger children returned to her care. </p>

I accept that the fact she lied about the time she had spent with the children and the domestic abuse does not mean none of her evidence was true. However, I do not think that she is capable of keeping the children safe, either from the M or from the paternal family or meet their long term emotional needs. </p>

But given the fact that they live in Pakistan; had considerable involvement in the events leading up to the murder, and bring with them many of the same complexities as PA1, I see no basis for adjourning to allow their assessment</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I then consider whether the younger children can remain in foster care until the M is released. This might be as soon as next year, or possibly the following year. There are two very significant problems with this course. Firstly, one or two years is a long time for these children, who have been living with instability since November 2019. If we wait for one to two years then they are likely to be impossible, or at least much more difficult, to adopt together. Secondly, it is in my view extremely doubtful as to whether they could be placed safely with the M when, or even soon after, she is released. There are major concerns around her mental health, her ability to protect the children from domestic abuse, and the circumstances around the index offence which she still seems to be in complete denial about.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are well established problems with long term foster care, in particular the instability inherent in such a placement. Further, as Miss Thind points out there is no guarantee of sibling contact, or that C2 &amp; C3 would stay together if they are placed in long term foster care. Therefore I do not consider this is a realistic option to meet C2 &amp; C3&#8217;s needs. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What makes this case so difficult is that if I accept the LA&#8217;s case, it may be that sibling contact is lost between C1 and the younger children. I accept that this is an enormously important relationship for these children. C1 has felt herself responsible for her younger siblings, and they have doubtless looked to her for stability and love through very difficult times. To not allow them to continue to know each other, and feel, albeit at some distance that they are part of a family may well have life long impacts upon them.  I would do everything within my power to preserve this relationship. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To maximise the chances of a prospective adopter accepting sibling contact, I consider it inevitable that I would have to very much restrict C1&#8217;s contact with her mother. I accept that would be a very significant loss for C1. She loves her mother, and undoubtedly wants contact with her, even though at times it may be upsetting and bring back very bad memories. However, I accept that it will make it very much harder to find prospective adopters if they think there is a prospect of C1 talking to the M and thus giving her a way of tracing C2 &amp; C3. Given the index offence and the M and paternal family&#8217;s adamant opposition to adoption, this must be a very real concern. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I had considered adjourning the placement applications in order to see whether a prospective adopter came forward who would support sibling contact. However, I was persuaded by counsel for the LA, Guardian and F2 that that would be the wrong course. It would both involve the Court taking a role which could be said to be contrary to that envisaged in the statutory scheme, but also it would be likely to cause more difficulty in finding adopters, and importantly delay in the process. I note that the Care Plan is strongly supportive of sibling contact, and I very much hope this will be acted upon in the placement search. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore, bringing all these factors together in a holistic analysis, I consider the only realistic outcome which meets the younger children&#8217;s needs for stability and a loving home, within a reasonable timeframe, is for placement orders. The most important relationship to maintain for all the children is that with their siblings, and to maximise the chances of that relationship being maintained I have no choice but to very much restrict C1&#8217;s contact with her M. </p>

Mr Thompson described how school is C1&#8217;s safe place where she feels she can get away from all the issues around her home and family life. It is very important to protect this, and also to minimise the chances of the M destabilising her hard won sense of security. Although the M says that she would not seek to destabilise the placement, given her desire to regain her children when released and her and the paternal family&#8217;s strenuous efforts to influence the court through emails, late letters and applications, I am not confident I can rely on the M in this regard.</p>

The stability of that placement should not be simply assumed, and it is very important to protect it going forward.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not think it is appropriate to make any order for contact or spending time by C1 with the M at this stage. C1 has been having some face to face contact with the M which she has enjoyed, albeit it can also be destabilising. It is hardly surprising that C1 has conflicting emotional responses in this regard. F2 is adamantly opposed to C1 going into the prison to see the M. I can understand this concern, and he is C1&#8217;s primary carer and I think I should respect his views. However, C1 loves her mother and wants to see her. If this can be facilitated, either by Ms Kapur supporting C1 in a prison visit or by the M having contact in the community, then I would strongly encourage F2 to allow this. </p>

But for the same reasons as the PSO, and given the background of this case, I think it is important to put in place a filter for any applications. I will make it clear that if the M can show that she has done the requisite work and has gained more insight into her responsibility for what has befallen these children, there is a good chance that an application would be permitted.</p>
