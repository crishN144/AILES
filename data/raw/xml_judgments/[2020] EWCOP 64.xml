She is the subject of, and currently the only respondent to, Court of Protection proceedings; she has been found to lack litigation capacity and is represented by the Official Solicitor as her Litigation Friend.  The proceedings have been brought by Leeds City Council (&#8220;the Local Authority&#8221; or &#8220;LCC&#8221;), in whose area DK currently lives.  The Local Authority asserts that DK lacks capacity to make decisions about her residence, contact with others, and use of social media; it seeks declarations and welfare orders in these respects. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">KK&#8217;s case for joinder and party status was set out in a detailed application supported by two witness statements; she was represented at the hearing before the Judge, as she has been at this appeal, by Mr Ben McCormack.  For the reasons more fully rehearsed below (see [16]-[17]), the Local Authority and the Official Solicitor on DK&#8217;s behalf opposed the application; they too were represented then, as now, by Miss Allan and Mr O&#8217;Brien respectively.  At the hearing before the Judge, the Local Authority and the Official Solicitor presented, and sought to rely upon, information which, although acknowledged to be relevant to the issue before the court, they wished to keep confidential from KK (&#8220;the confidential material&#8221;).   The Judge received this documentary confidential material, and read it.  Neither KK nor her lawyers were given access to this material.  The Judge gave a separate shorter judgment (which I </p>

At the age of 16, DK was received into the care of relevant local authority.  She made allegations against KK&#8217;s husband and son of sexual abuse; these were investigated by the police over a period of 18 months (during which time KK and DK had no contact) before the police decided to take no further action.  Given her troubled presentation, DK experienced a range of placements, sadly but predictably in different locations around the country. DK&#8217;s ongoing exposure to sexual exploitation and trafficking led to involvement by the National Referral Mechanism (the <span style="color:#0B0C0C">framework for identifying and referring potential victims of modern slavery, ensuring that they receive the appropriate support)</span>. In October 2019 DK moved placement once more, this time to Leeds, after she disclosed an imminent plan to marry an older man whom she barely knew.  An urgent application was made to the Court of Protection when DK later announced that she wished to return to KK&#8217;s home for Christmas 2019; at an urgently convened court hearing, DJ Gardner determined on an interim basis that DK lacked capacity in respect of that decision.  Shortly thereafter,  KK applied to be joined to the process. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Having conducted the review of the Judge&#8217;s decision on this appeal (<span style="font-style:italic">rule 20.14 COPR 2017</span>), I have resolved to grant KK permission to appeal.   I accept Mr McCormack&#8217;s submission that the Judge&#8217;s adoption of a process which effectively denied the Applicant access to core, relevant, material in determining her application raises a sufficiently significant issue of principle and practice to justify a consideration of the full merits.  What follows, therefore, is my reasoning for dismissing the appeal itself. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I have cited the Judge&#8217;s judgment extensively above because I am satisfied that he diligently and accurately identified and applied the relevant law when determining this application for joinder.  He rightly, in my judgement, referred to the &#8220;broad discretion&#8221; available to him (see &#167;18 of his judgment quoted at [10] above) in making a decision of this kind and rightly prioritised DK&#8217;s &#8220;interests and position&#8221; (per <span style="font-style:italic">rule 1.1(3)(b) COPR 2017</span>) over all else (see [11] above). It is apparent that he carefully weighed the relevant issues in play on both sides of the argument on the issue of disclosure of the confidential material before reaching the conclusion, set out in &#167;49 of his judgment, that if the Court of Protection is to remain true to its name, all decisions need to be made in the best interests of P (in this case DK).   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I am satisfied that the Judge rightly prioritised (so far as was reasonably practicable), the need to permit and encourage DK to participate in the proceedings which concern her, and/or to improve her ability to participate, as fully as possible in any act done for her and any decision affecting her (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.4(4)</ref></span>).  Having regard to the matters set out in his judgment, which he clearly and sufficiently articulated in &#167;43 (which I cited above) I consider that the Judge was not wrong to conclude that to join KK to the process &#8220;would be to strike at the heart of this statutory scheme designed for DK&#8217;s participation in the legal process&#8221;, and that this would adversely affect DK&#8217;s ability to exercise her <span style="font-style:italic">Article 6</span> rights. </p>

I am satisfied that, although unusual, the process by which the Judge reached this conclusion was not fundamentally &#8216;unjust&#8217; (see <span style="font-style:italic">rule 20.14(3)(b) COPR 2017</span>); in short, having approached the issue by reference to the principles which I have adumbrated at [41] above, I could detect no serious procedural irregularity in the way he conducted the proceedings. </p>

In my judgment, he deftly managed that information as between the parties, and, while providing a succinct supplementary judgment, he provided a much more substantive and detailed judgment which in my judgment gave more than sufficient reasoning to KK and the parties for his decision. This was not a case, I am satisfied, in which it would have been possible to gist the material to KK and her lawyers, and no other &#8216;procedural mitigations&#8217; (see [26] above) &#8211; which, I may add, may well be suitable in certain other cases &#8211; were apparently suggested to him.  In this regard, his approach followed that advocated by Lord Neuberger in <span style="font-style:italic">Bank Mellat</span> at [69]: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.1in;text-indent:0in">I should add that, in my conclusion, the Judge was right to prepare a short supplementary judgment setting out his conclusions relevant to the confidential material.  If for no other reason, it has been possible for me sitting in an appellate capacity, to assess the extent to which, if at all, the confidential material has had a bearing on the overall outcome. </p>
