It was not clear to the Court whether in fact EM was still in a crisis during which her capacity to make relevant decisions was absent, at least some of the time. In such circumstances the Court needs to understand the nature of the fluctuating capacity, what triggers it and what is the scope of the incapacity when triggered.

I asked counsel for the LA and the social worker to leave the issue of capacity to one side, because the Court needed to consider the issue at a later date and to concentrate on what care plan would best meet Emma&#8217;s needs in the meantime. The Court&#8217;s view was that, on the face of it, Emma was still likely at times to act in a dangerously dysregulated way and posed a significant risk to her own safety. Whilst keeping someone safe is not the only issue before this Court, it is a pretty significant one. The Court wanted to understand how the LA had reached its surprising decision to apply to withdraw proceedings, and for the interim orders authorising Emma&#8217;s residence and care arrangements to be discharged.</span></p>

There were also restrictions on her contact with other people, notably her family. At that time, other placements had been identified, and the intention was for less restrictive care plans to be put in place as and when Emma moved there.
