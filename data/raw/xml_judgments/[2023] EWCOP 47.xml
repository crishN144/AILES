Those meetings did not produce any treatment plan for DL that could be actioned. Instead, on 21 October 2023, an out of hours application was made by the Norfolk and Suffolk Trust for directions to be given for evidence to be filed so that this court could make a decision in respect of treatment for DL. One of the directions given was that the East Suffolk and North Essex Foundation Trust should be the applicant in these proceedings. They are the Trust that will deliver any treatment plan designed to feed and rehydrate DL.</p>

That time estimate was a woeful underestimate. I thus made time available in my list on 25 October and 26 October 2023. This judgment has been handed down electronically at 10am on 27 October 2023. In the meanwhile, the evidence is that DL continues to decline to eat and is drinking no more than 100ml a day. It is common ground amongst the parties that that is not sufficient intake to maintain life. DL has changed her mind. She now wishes to live and all parties before me wish to give her the chance to live. The overarching issue before me really comes down to what intervention(s) should be made to enable DL to have that chance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">DL&#8217;s brother and sister have participated in this hearing and have been powerful advocates for their sister and the treatment they consider would be in her best interests. Their mutual bond and love for each other came through the evidence they gave me.  They have written a statement which is before me, sent me emails with comments upon the evidence they have heard as it unfolded and have spoken to me directly.  They told me of their lived experience of DL, especially over the last 4 years. DL has been placed on an acute ward before, about 18 months ago, with disastrous effect. They described to me a vicious cycle of hospital interventions which are so traumatic for DL that they worsened rather than improved DL&#8217;s conditions. They are adamant that restraining DL to feed her by NG tube would be traumatic for her and would in all probability result in a further deterioration. Their strong view was that the better option is for DL to be refed under sedation. Her bloods are thankfully still within normal ranges. She had come through anaesthetic before. Whilst they acknowledged she is now physically weak, they took the view that she is resilient. DL had told them that she wanted to go to sleep and wake up better. They supported her wishes and feelings. They also told me how DL would hate being a sideshow in a side cubicle. She would not want nor be able to cope with people peering at her. Her siblings told me that so complex and unique is DL&#8217;s combination of conditions and thus presentation that she is an object of medical as well as public curiosity. They wished to protect her from that. As DL&#8217;s sister put it &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">she is not a goldfish in a bowl</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have had the benefit of a meeting DL over the link. The meeting was not planned because I had been told that she did not want to speak with me. However, at the start of proceedings on the second day, DL with her assistants, joined the hearing remotely. After initial pleasantries, I adjourned to meet with DL in the presence of her carers, who facilitated communication via Makaton. Mr Cullen, on behalf of the Official Solicitor, took a note of the meeting. That note has been agreed by me and distributed to all parties. I have taken that full note into account. However, it is right I record here some of the headlines that I took from it. With force DL told me that she wanted to go to hospital because they (hospitals) make people better. She clearly did not understand why she had not yet gone to hospital to get better and was querying why she was being treated differently. She wanted to go to sleep and wake up better.  It was evident from what she said and how she said it, that at the moment DL very much wants to get better. DL told me how her transition from the ward to the hospital could be managed. DL suggested that she has her PAs with her when she goes, she wears her ear defenders, and she takes her doll Mel with her. All her suggestions seemed to me to be insightful. They were also practically possible. When I asked her in the context of a general anaesthetic, if she was scared she would not wake up, DL was unable to answer the question and moved on thus avoiding it. DL, however, very clearly told me that she  did not like the idea of being  touched and of  people holding her. She was worried about the noise on a ward and told me, again forcefully, that she would kill people if placed on a ward.</p>

I have read a witness statement from Dr A, her annotations to the initial treatment plan proposed by the acute trust and I have heard her evidence. She gave her evidence to me on Tuesday of this week. She had seen DL the day before. She described to the court how DL is confined to her mattress on the floor of the seclusion unit in the ward. DL is now so weak she cannot roll over. She is no longer crawling around. She told me that from a psychiatric/psychological point of view refeeding under sedation was the best option for DL. Although there were risks involved with giving a General Anaesthetic, on balance those risks should be taken. It would be the least traumatic option for DL and would be in line with her wishes and feelings. The other option namely feeding on a side ward via NG tube and under restraint would be traumatic for DL and was frankly unrealistic. It is highly likely that DL would have to be restrained throughout her admission. That of itself would be traumatising. If mittens were used, DL would not be able to use Makaton to communicate and would become isolated.  If not restrained she is highly likely, almost to a point of certainty given her past behaviours, to pull tubes and cannulas out. However restrained DL is still likely to take any opportunity that presents to take her tubes and cannulas out and to do so repeatedly. That will compound the trauma she experiences. Dr A did not favour chemical restraint because DL is so weak and because she queries the efficacy of doses that would be safe for DL in her current condition. In Dr A&#8217;s opinion the least worst option would be to refeed her under sedation. Whilst that carries risks which she factored into her thinking when she gave her evidence, it was the best option that could be devised for DL because it was the least traumatic. According to Dr A, trauma is the driver for most if not all of DL&#8217;s conditions and presentation. DL has previously found an inpatient stay at an acute hospital traumatic. There is a real risk that any use of physical restraint to enable treatment will trigger past trauma. The environment on a ward, even in a side room, is noisy and busy. It brings with it a real risk to DL&#8217;s mental and physical health and further deterioration in her presentation. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.48in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Dr L</span>, a consultant gastroenterologist in Hospital I. He has experience of managing a multitude of patients requiring additional nutrition support with the aid of a nutrition team.  He had provided to the court a statement dated 24 October 2023. Prior to making his statement he visited DL on the ward.  He did not weigh her but assessed her weight to be between 40-45 kg. He agreed with Dr S&#8217; statements regarding the health risks to DL of reduced oral intake and the medical need for intervention. He considered it to be in her best interests if DL were treated urgently and that the treatment could be completed within 7 days to mitigate the risks of refeeding syndrome. Dr L outlined to DL the need to insert a NG tube and the need to use medication/restraint to help her mage with its insertion as well as taking bloods, which she appeared accepting of his proposals. Following his review, he spoke to Dr A and accepted her concerns about the psychological harm that would be caused by restraint but concluded that as DL was so weak, the restraint would be as minimal as possible. He also acknowledged the risk of physical harm that DL may pose to herself and others on the ward. He factored in the risks of anaesthetic including assisted ventilation. On balance and given DL&#8217;s current acceptance of the need for hospitalisation and feeding, he felt she could be managed on the ward. He proposed treating DL in a large side room on the adult Gastrointestinal ward. DL&#8217;s privacy could be enhanced by blocking the windows and doors with privacy blinds and using the cubicle curtains. The room could not be completely blocked off, but her privacy could be protected. When he had spoken to her, she had wanted multiple toys with her as well as posters in her current room. DL wished to have someone present who can enable her to communicate using Makaton. His trained staff would insert the NG tube and position it but it appeared to me from the totality of his evidence that he was reliant on ward staff providing restraint to enable his clinical staff to place the tube. The only staff he had access to that could apply restraint were security staff. Whilst Dr L&#8217;s preferred option was to feed DL via NG tube using a bolus feed over 20-30 minutes at regular intervals 4 times a day. Physical and chemical restraint was likely to be needed to insert the tube, but mittens could be used during the feed to prevent the tube being pulled out. If that plan did not work, then there would be an escalation in accordance with the treatment plan to ITU. In cross-examination Dr L accepted that placing DL under an anaesthetic would have no real impact on her feeding, his concern was about the risks associated with general anaesthesia. In relation to feeding via a PIC line he considered that a riskier option because of the risk of infection and potentially sepsis. In his opinion enteral feeding was better at delivering nutrition than parenteral feeding.  The safer option would be, in his opinion, the least restrictive option namely feeding via NG tube under physical restraint. However, he accepted that Dr S had come to a different view. Although he did not share her view, he accepted that her opinion fell within the band of reasonable opinions a gastroenterologist could have in the context of this case.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.48in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Dr N</span>. He is a consultant in Intensive Care Medicine and Anaesthetics in the acute trust. He has provided two statements which are before me. He gave oral evidence on Wednesday 26 October. He acknowledges the potential risks to mental health as stated by Dr A but was clear that although it is out with his expertise, he knows of no mental health condition that can be reversed with force feeding in ITU in 7 days. From his perspective DL&#8217;s vital parameters and bloods remain within the normal limits. There is no need for organ support or any identified reversible pathology which will benefit from DL entering ITU. General anaesthesia or sedation may lead to delirium and confusion when the patient is brought around. Some of these effects may be transient but there is a risk of PTSD and post ITU psychosis syndrome. Admitting her to ITU for sedation without at least trying first other ward-based options potentially risk DL&#8217;s life and increase her morbidity. She has lost a significant amount of weight and is very dehydrated; this poses a significant risk of circulatory collapse during anaesthetic induction. Should that occur then she would be on a ventilator throughout her stay on ITU and predisposed to a risk of lung injury. This is in turn will potentially set in train a further deterioration in her physical state, she may be weak, difficult to wean off a ventilator and may need a tracheostomy. Dr N was very clear in his statements that he preferred a step ladder approach which would exhaust all other options before admission onto the ITU.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In cross examination the difference between general anaesthetic and deep sedation was explored with Dr N by Ms Gollop KC. He told me that under deep sedation the patient would be asleep but would breathe independently. Deep sedation would take place on ITU in case airways became compromised and intervention was required. In deep sedation you can deliver nutrition via a PIC line which avoids the &#8220;massive&#8221; risk of aspiration associated with feeding via a NG tube under sedation. In terms of the risks arising from general anaesthesia when balanced against deep sedation, the differences were &#8220;marginal&#8221;. </p>

It was in that context that it was put to the doctor: why not take the same steps now in the controlled environment of an elective admission rather than in response to a crisis? The response was that it could be done but that clinically he would prefer the step ladder approach. If the court determined that a planned admission to ITU was the best way forward, he would make that option available.</p>

As the morning of the first day progressed the issues narrowed, the court was by then being asked to decide between two treatment options: -</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the proceedings progressed, by the end of day 2 the issues for me to decide appeared to have narrowed and the option before the court had changed. A third way was proposed namely feeding DL via a PIC line under deep sedation rather than general anaesthetic. That would allow her to breathe independently. She would not need an endotracheal tube to be inserted unless her breathing became compromised. The treatment would be delivered on the intensive care unit thus enabling prompt action if her breathing was compromised. When I rose on 25 October, that appeared to be the only option for the court if there was to be intervention to sustain life. The option of physical restraint was, at that time, off the table.  The Trust responsible for the ward where DL is currently accommodated indicated that they could not provide the staff that would be needed to restrain DL whilst DL was being fed by a NG tube in the acute hospital. The acute hospital trust did not have any appropriately trained medical staff and could only propose restraint by security staff which they recognised was inappropriate. At the conclusion of the day, I was told that a private agency could provide nursing staff who were trained in restraint but neither trust were currently proposing to pay for such a service. In those circumstances, I directed that the relevant director or officer authorised to make funding decisions in both Trusts should attend upon this court at 10 am on 26 October 2023.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the morning of 26 October 2023 matters had changed again. Funding of restraint was no longer an issue.  The acute Trust had found an agency who could provide the restraint they considered necessary, and they were willing to fund it. Shortly before court commenced on 26 October 2023, the applicant filed two fresh treatment plans. They were to be read in a linear fashion. The first was a refeeding treatment plan via a NG tube. The plan proposed elective admission to a side room on a ward of the Hospital X physical restraint to enable IV access and then initial chemical restraint /sedation to a level where DL requires minimal physical restraint. The last paragraph of the plan reads: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">If DL is unable to be safely managed on the ward she</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">will be escalated to ITU. Escalation will require sedation and a PICC line.&#8221; </span> The escalation plan to ITU confirmed deep sedation and the insertion of a PICC line to enable parenteral feeding. Both the treatment plan and escalation plan set out the benefits and burdens of each plan. I have factored those balances into my decision making.</p>

From a psychological perspective, Dr A considered that it minimises the risk of further trauma for DL and maximises the welfare outcome for DL going forward.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I begin by considering whether DL has the capacity to make decisions in relation to her own nutrition and hydration.  I conclude that she does not. I have come to that conclusion on the basis of the evidence of Dr A in her statement of 21 October 2023 and the oral evidence she gave. When cross examined by Mr Brownhill, Dr A told the court that DL understood the risk of being refed by tube. From DL&#8217;s perspective those risks were two-fold (i) getting fat and (ii) being held down. According to Dr A, when considering being fed under anaesthesia, DL increasingly appreciated that it was associated with a risk of death. However, her evidence was that although DL could understand the risks and increasingly was able to retain knowledge about those risks, DL could not weigh the risks in the balance and make use of that information to make a choice. I accept Dr A&#8217;s evidence. I find on the balance of probabilities that DL cannot use or weigh the information that she has as part of the process of making decisions about her hydration and nutrition.  DL is unable to make a decision for herself in relation to her hydration and nutrition because of an impairment or disturbance in the functioning of her mind or brain.</p>

In the event that the treatment plan becomes <span style="font-style:italic">unmanageable </span>the applicant trust will escalate DL&#8217;s treatment and provide hydration and nutrition in accordance with the escalation plan. That seems to me to beg the question whether the treatment plan is manageable in the first instance. On behalf of DL it is, in effect, submitted that the evidence before the court is such that the court can find on the balance of probabilities that the treatment plan is unmanageable and is not a realistic option in this case. </p>

Similarly, Dr A has given opinion evidence from the perspective of her area of expertise and has been careful to stay within the confines of her own expertise. My task is different to theirs. I survey the broad canvas of evidence before me which includes but is not limited to the medical evidence I have heard.  My task is to stand back and look at the evidence as a whole.

Although she is weakened by her malnutrition and dehydration, she continues to be held in a segregation unit on the ward as a result of past assaultive behaviours. She has no contact with other patients because it continues to be unsafe for her to do so. In her statement dated 21 October 2023 Dr A evidence, which was not challenged, was that as of that date DL was still assaulting staff members. Her aggressive behaviours mean that it continues to be unsafe to weigh DL. DL continues to need a high staff ratio.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further there is a problem with the use of restraint, particularly, physical restraint. The unchallenged evidence is that DL does not like to be touched and held. Attempting to restrain her against her will is likely to aggravate her and her presentation. Dr A&#8217;s evidence to me was that trauma was at the root of DL&#8217;s disorders. Physically restraining her is likely to trigger her responses. According to Dr A, attempting to treat DL under restraint simply will not work.  Physical restraint will only cause DL to deteriorate. Further chemical restraint is unlikely to be of value because the drugs and dosages that can be used by reason of her frailty are unlikely to be sufficient. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Standing back and looking at the evidence as a whole, I can appreciate why Dr N and Dr L consider that the treatment plan could work. As Dr N told me in evidence the plan is in accordance with the clinical guidance to which he adheres. That guidance favours an incremental approach. However, whilst that approach is understandable, it is theoretical based on the general rather than the individual. My task is to consider DL as a unique person at this moment. When I do that and put the theoretical into the context of DL&#8217;s reality, about which I have already made findings, I find that the treatment plan is unrealistic.</p>

Her past trauma is, I find, likely to be triggered by imposing restraint against her will or passing a tube through her nose against her will. There is a significant risk on the facts of this case that those events will cause additional trauma and cause DL&#8217;s disorders to be aggravated and her presentation to deteriorate still further. There is a significant risk of DL being caused further psychological or psychiatric harm by any such interventions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I factor in the risks arising from deep sedation that Dr N has placed before the court in his evidence. The risks come from the medication that would be used and the deep sedation itself. He rightly brings to my attention that treatment on an ITU comes with continuous physiological monitoring, invasive measurements of blood pressure and the insertion of a urethral catheter. There is a significant risk of cardiac depression, low blood pressure, and on emergence withdrawal or delirium or aggravation of existing psychological and psychiatric illness. Whilst deep sedation would allow DL to breath independently, invasive action would be needed if her air way is compromised. Deep sedation will lead to reduced mobility, increased risk of pressure sores and a catabolic metabolism with rapid bone demineralisation. I accept Dr N evidence about the risks and I weigh them in the balance.</p>

Dr N told the court that when DL emerges from sedation after 5-7 days, there is a real risk of further psychological/psychiatric consequences for DL. He tells the court that there is nothing in the literature to suggest that DL will awake from sleep and eat and drink normally. Dr A accepts that. However, DL is unique. Based on past behaviours, Dr A considers that there is a real possibility that DL will do as she has stated, awake from sleep and be better. I consider that on the evidence there is at least a chance that will happen. In contrast I find that a plan to feed DL via NG tube under restraint has little or no chance of bringing about the change needed. Instead, it is likely to be part of a vicious cycle with no positive end in sight.</p>

I factor into my determination the heartfelt views of DL&#8217;s siblings. I accept that they know their sister better than anyone else. They have lived experience of her functioning and her likely reaction to restraint and the placement of a NG tube against her wishes. Based on their experiences, even if placed in a side room, the noises, the people going to and fro, the people treating her, the people restraining her are all likely to trigger an adverse reaction from DL. They are adamant that they wish to respect DL&#8217;s wishes. That is an informed decision into which they have factored the risks associated with sedation. They take the view that they are risks worth taking. I consider that their views should have weight because they are based on their lived experience of DL who they love dearly.</p>
