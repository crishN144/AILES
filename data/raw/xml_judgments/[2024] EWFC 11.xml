	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 January 2024, I heard a First Appointment in this case. In their written submissions, sent to me the day before, counsel for both parties informed me of an agreement that the substantial business interests should be valued by two separately instructed sole experts, one for each party. I sent an email to counsel stating my provisional view that I should instead make a direction for the instruction of a Single Joint Expert (&#8220;SJE&#8221;). By the start of the hearing, the parties had agreed to move forward on the basis of my suggestion for a SJE report. I indicated that I would do a written judgment as one or two points of principle arise. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties married in 1998 after a period of cohabitation. They separated in 2023, so this was a period of cohabitation/marriage exceeding 25 years. They have two children. During the course of the marriage, the husband (&#8220;H&#8221;) built up a number of highly successful businesses. The wife (&#8220;W&#8221;) was fully supportive in her role within the marriage. There is no dispute that they made equal contributions to the marriage and the family. Further, it is common ground that prima facie this is a case for equal division, subject to potential arguments about liquidity and structure.</p>

Almost the entirety of the questionnaire is devoted to questions in relation to the businesses. It was prepared with the assistance of W&#8217;s accountant. It was intended to elicit such information as W&#8217;s accountants thought necessary to enable them to carry out a valuation.</p>

The solely instructed expert may (whether consciously or subconsciously) be partisan to a lesser or greater degree, because they take instructions from one party, are given information by them, build up a relationship with them and are paid by them to prepare reports and give evidence in conflicted litigation. The SJE by contrast is likely to be less susceptible to bias (conscious or subconscious) towards either party.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">The SJE prepares a report in accordance with one joint letter of instruction, jointly provided information and one series of joint questions. By contrast, two separate experts, instructed by two different parties, may receive different instructions, different information and different questions. They are subject to less oversight by the court than the SJE whose remit, instructions and provision of information are ultimately to be decided by a judge if the parties do not agree.  There is a significant risk that the court will be faced with reports which are not just different in their conclusions, but based on different information, questions and instructions. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Nothing prevents either or both parties from instructing shadow experts to assist in (for example) drafting the joint letter of instruction, or raising questions of the SJE once the report has been received. It is common at trial for the SJE, if required to give evidence, to be cross examined by counsel for one or both parties with the benefit of input from shadow accountants.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Should either or both parties be dissatisfied with the SJE report, it is open to them to make a <span style="font-weight:bold">Daniels v Walker </span>application for permission to adduce their own expert evidence. I appreciate that this may lead to additional expert evidence, but experience suggests that in many cases parties are content, broadly, to accept the SJE&#8217;s opinion, and those cases where there is a legitimate justification for additional sole expert evidence will be rare. It does not therefore automatically follow that to instruct a SJE will inevitably lead in due course to three experts (the SJE and two sole experts). Occasionally, one party will seek to rely on the SJE, and the other will reject the SJE&#8217;s conclusions. In that case, if permission for the dissatisfied party to obtain their own expert is granted, there will be two experts. In those rare cases where both parties secure permission for their own expert, it may nevertheless remain helpful for the court to have the benefit of independent SJE evidence at trial. I am therefore unpersuaded that the court should routinely assume a gloomy prognosis about the future trajectory of expert evidence even before the SJE route has been explored. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Instruction of a SJE will usually enable that expert to decide what documents they need and request them. It is commonplace to include in any court order a direction that the parties cooperate with requests for information made by the SJE. That is usually the most practical way to deal with issues about what is sometimes the vexed issue of company disclosure. Appointing a SJE will therefore usually remove the need for lengthy questionnaires addressed to company matters; these can be left to the SJE.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, I am in no doubt that the right course of action is for a SJE instruction. A SJE report is likely to give the parties a more secure evidential foundation for the FDR than two solely instructed reports. W has expressed some suspicion about H&#8217;s approach to valuing the businesses with his own valuer, believing that he will seek to depreciate their true worth. It seems unlikely to me that W would necessarily be minded to accept what is said by H&#8217;s instructed expert (and the reverse may also apply), such that attempts to agree valuation figures would in all likelihood be unfruitful. By contrast, both parties should have greater confidence in the SJE. There is no good reason, in my view, to depart from the usual rule that a SJE should be instructed. Both parties will continue to have the aid of their shadow accountants. Further, this course avoids the need to consider the 81-page questionnaire; the SJE can decide what documents and information are needed. </p>
