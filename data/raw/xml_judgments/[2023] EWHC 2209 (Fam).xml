The application concerns C (known as N) born on in December 2018 and now aged 4.  N is a Romanian national, as is his younger sister, R.  The applicant mother, NM, is Romanian. She seeks the summary return of N to the jurisdiction of Romania. The mother attended this hearing by video link and is represented by Ms Cliona Papazian of counsel. </p>

The father resists the summary return of N on the grounds that N was habitually resident in England and Wales on the relevant date, and therefore his retention was not wrongful for the purposes of Art 3, that the mother consented to the retention of N from the jurisdiction of Romania for the purposes of Art 13, that N is settled in the jurisdiction of England and Wales for the purposes of Art 12 of the 1989 Hague Convention and that returning N to Romania would expose him to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or would otherwise place him in an intolerable situation for the purposes of Art 13(b). There is no issue between the parties that the mother was exercising rights of custody in respect of N at the relevant time.  </p>

As Mostyn J noted in <span style="font-style:italic">B v B</span> [2014] EWHC 1804, the objective of the Convention is to ensure that a child who has been removed unilaterally from the country of his or her habitual residence in breach of rights of custody is returned forthwith in order that the courts in that country can decide his or her long term future.  In these circumstances, a decision by the court to return a child under the terms of the Convention is, no more and no less, a decision to return the child for a specific purpose and for a limited period of time pending the court of his or her habitual residence deciding the long-term welfare position.</p>

The mother alleges that, during the course of 2021, the parents agreed to relocate to Romania with the intention to live in Romania for a period of time. Whilst the mother contends that the parents left the possibility of returning to the United Kingdom at some future point, she contends that the family had no fixed return date.   The father alleges that the intention was for the mother and the children to travel to Romania only for a holiday following the stresses and limitations of the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>

Upon arrival in Romania, the mother and the children resided with the maternal grandmother in a two bedroom apartment, the mother sharing a room with the children.  The mother states that, in circumstances where they arrived in winter, she and the children spent a lot of time indoors.  The mother asserts that she and the children saw her brother, his wife and their two children aged five and nine several times each week and would see other members of her family.  The mother asserts that N was due to be registered for nursery in Romania in June 2022, with a view to him starting in nursery there in September 2022.</p>

The mother asserts that in March 2022 she and the father were still very much in a relationship.  She asserts that during the March visit, the father discussed options for opening a restaurant in Romania with her brother.  In this context, the mother points to the fact that following the father being granted a visa for three months for the March visit, the mother applied to extend that visa to 31 May 2023 in the expectation that the father would be joining the family to work in Romania.</p>

In this context, the father portrayed his visits to Romania as attempts to salvage the relationship.   He asserts that he believed that these visits were successful and that the relationship had resumed but that the mother then contacted him to request he take N back to England as soon as possible as he was not behaving and because the maternal grandmother felt he looked like his father and that he was not welcome in their house.  The mother concedes that she and the father had an argument at the end of April 2022 over money.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of the April visit, the father took N to England.  The father contends that the mother consented to him returning N to England permanently, in circumstances where N&#8217;s behaviour had deteriorated and the maternal grandmother did not want him in her property.  The mother contends that the father asked her to obtain a Romanian passport for N so that he could spend some &#8220;boys time&#8221; with N in England.  The mother did so.  She says she had no suspicion that the father intended to retain N and asserts that she agreed to the father taking N to England for a short period only and expected him to be returned to Romania some two or three weeks following their departure.  It is in that context that the mother says she provided her written consent to the father to leave Romania with N.  The father took N to England on 3 May 2022.  At that point, N had been in Romania with the mother and R for a period of four and a half months.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father now asserts that the mother consented to him removing N from Romania.  On behalf of the father, Mr Basi was forced to concede, rightly, that beyond the assertion of the father and the fact he and N travelled on a one way ticket, the evidence before the court does not demonstrate clear and unequivocal consent on the part of the mother to the removal of N from the jurisdiction of Romania.   The mother contends further that the subsequent communications between the parties on WhatsApp demonstrate that she had given no such consent.  In particular, the mother relies on WhatsApp messages in which she seeks to clarify with the father what date he will be returning N to Romania in the context of the asserted agreement of a two to three week holiday, the first of those messages being sent on 6 May 2022.  The father was not able to dispute that at no point in his replies does the father rely on that which he now asserts, namely that the mother had consented to him removing N from Romania to live with him in England.  Indeed, it is clear from the WhatsApp messages that the father was stating he would be booking a flight, albeit he continued to dissemble as to when.  During the exchange, on 10 May 2022 the mother put to the father that &#8220;You said you&#8217;re bringing N home in 3 weeks. It past one week already&#8221;.  The father&#8217;s reply did not dispute this.</p>

As I have noted, the father contends that at this point N was settled in the United Kingdom for the purposes of Art 12 as, if he was wrongfully retained in England, he had been so for a period of more than one year at the date proceedings were issued.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the alleged retention of N in the jurisdiction of England and Wales, both parents commenced litigation in Romania.  The mother issued proceedings in the Romanian court.  Her first application was dated 7 June 2022, by which application she sought the return of N to the jurisdiction of Romania.   On 24 November 2022, the Regional court made an order for R to reside with the mother but refused such an order in respect of N.  The translated transcript of judgment of the Regional Court indicates that the court rejected as not proven the father&#8217;s case that the mother had asked him to take N to England because of his behaviour and the view of the maternal grandmother.  The court further found that, whilst the mother had given her consent for N to travel with his father, the mother continued to intend for him to live with her in Romania.</p>

The Hague Convention proceedings launched by the father in Romania in respect of R dealt with a number of the issues that fall for determination in, or are relevant to, the proceedings before this court.   In its judgment, the Bucharest Court of Appeal stated that it had considered the following aspects of the Convention:</p>

On 27 February 2023, allowing the mother&#8217;s appeal on the ground that the judge at first instance had not considered sufficiently or at all the impact on the children of separating the siblings, the appellate court considered the factual aspects of the case dealt with by the Regional Court on 24 November 2022 to have been settled and to be <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span>.

This agreement reconfigured the content of the right of custody regulated by art.5 of the Convention.  The attributes of the right of custody became, from the date of the agreement, inextricably linked to the residence in Romania of the child, which was designated as the usual living environment of the minor, by the concordant will of his parents.  Subsequent to this agreement of the parties, the [father] has the freedom to change his mind, however, <span style="font-weight:bold">this new manifestation of will produces effects only if he obtains the [mother&#8217;s] agreement or the consent of the guardianship court</span>.  Therefore, the refusal of the [mother] to return with the child to Great Britain, at the request of the [father], does not affect his right regarding custody, but is legitimised by the existence of the agreement of the parties on the minor&#8217;s new residence, an agreement that cannot be revoked unilaterally.&#8217;</p>

However, the approach of the parties was a unitary one in relation to both children, a fact that requires the conclusion that they had initially decided that the residence of both children should be established in Romania, and the change of residence could only take place on the basis of a court decision or the mutual agreement of the parties.&#8221;</p>

In this regard, he relies on the fact that N does not speak Romanian, that he has lived in England for a significant period of time, that he is in nursery and doing well here. The father asserts that whilst in Romania the maternal grandmother made N feel unwelcome and that this places him at risk of psychological harm.  The father further asserts that a return order would lead to N being placed in an environment he does not know, having been removed from everything he knows in England. The father further alleges the mother would make it difficult for the father to have any meaningful contact with N in circumstances where he cannot work in Romania, cannot speak the language and cannot live there.   Finally, the father alleges that he has been subjected to domestic abuse by the mother. </p>

In my opinion it is implicit in the concept of wrongful retention, as referred to in Articles 1, 3, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, that the wrongful act must take place within, or immediately following, an agreed finite period of care by the retaining parent&#8221;</p>

I do not read him as stating that there must in every case be fixed calendar dates. Each case must be judged on its specific facts. Thus, for example, rather than a specified calendar date, the agreed or anticipated date for return may be referable to an agreed crystallising or triggering event, the precise date of which is unknown to the parties at the time of departure. In this case the due date for return was at the conclusion of the treatment, the precise timing of which was unknown when they flew to England and, in the event, has not yet come to pass. But it seems to me that there must be some ingredient to indicate that the departure from one country to another is intended to be temporary rather than permanent or potentially permanent, even if the precise date of return is not fixed. Thus, it is hard to conceive of a wrongful retention where the departure from the outward country is agreed to be open ended with no determining or triggering event; I endorse the observations of Mostyn J at para 32. In each case, the court will have to do the best it can on the available information to determine the relevant date&#8221;.</p>

The decisions of Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic">JM v RM</span> and Peel J in <span style="font-style:italic">Z v Z</span> are plainly not authority for that proposition.

Whether the divorce court should reopen the issue depends on the circumstances. If the court is satisfied that there has already been a full and proper inquiry in the previous litigation, it will often hold that it is not necessary to hold another inquiry all over again: but if the court is not so satisfied, it has a right and a duty to inquire into it afresh. If the court does decide to reopen the matter, then there is no longer any estoppel on either party. Each can go into the matter afresh.&#8221;</p>

I also note the disputed evidence concerning whether the mother emailed a nursery in November 2022 regarding a nursery placement for N in January 2022.  The mother denies sending that email.  In any event, even on the father&#8217;s case the parents agreed that they would be in Romania in January 2022.  With respect to a separate email in which the mother invites a nursery to retain a place for N (whilst making clear the family may not be returning to this jurisdiction for a period) the mother states that she did not close the door completely as she was not certain how things would work out in Romania.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances, whilst the reason for the mother and children travelling to Romania in January 2022 is arguably <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span>, the evidence before this court in any event leads to the same conclusion, namely that the parents had agreed to relocate the family to Romania for a period of time.  Whilst it is plain that there was no clear plan for how long the family would remain in that jurisdiction, in considering the relevance of parental intention, there is no requirement that there be an intention on the part of one or both parents to reside in the country in question permanently or indefinitely. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The relevance of these matters is that N travelled Romania with his mother and sister in January 2022 with the intention that he reside there.  The environment in which he subsequently lived for a period of four months was thus one in which the expectation was that he would be settling in that country.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the strong links I acknowledge N had with the jurisdiction of England and Wales would have subsided more quickly than they might have done absent an intention on the part of his parents that the family would be relocating to Romania.  This is particularly the case in circumstances where, whilst he had lived in England since birth, at the time he was taken to Romania<span style="font-style:italic"/>he was 3 years old.  He therefore remained highly dependent on the adults caring for him, an in particular his mother, who is a Romanian citizen.  N had always lived with his parents and younger sister and his mother had always been his primary carer.   Whilst the father did not accompany the family, I am satisfied that that was the intention.  Whilst it is contended that N had a nursery place in England commencing in April 2022, N&#8217;s reality was that he had not attended nursery prior to move to Romania.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Upon arrival in Romania, N resided with his mother and sister and with his maternal grandmother.  The father did not dispute the evidence of the mother that upon arrival and due to the weather the family spent time a lot of time at home living as a family with the maternal grandmother.  N had with him his main toys as part of the extensive luggage that I am satisfied accompanied the mother and children.  N, along with R, was registered as a Romanian citizen on 14 February 2022 so he could access health care and education.  During the four months he spent in Romania prior to his retention in England by his father, N had regular contact with his cousins and wider maternal family and friends.</p>

In this context, in circumstances where N was three years old, I also have regard to the fact that his mother, on whom he was dependent, is Romanian and was herself well integrated into the social and family environment in Romania. The mother had herself taken further steps to integrate in Romania, in particular by taking driving lessons in that jurisdiction.  The mother also continued to work whilst in Romania (although she paid any profits into an English bank account).</p>

Those exchanges make it clear that the mother expected the father to return N to the jurisdiction of Romania.  Further, and importantly, at no point does the father respond to the mother&#8217;s enquiries regarding the booking of flights and the precise date of return by asserting that the mother consented to him retaining N in England.  At no point when mother is seeking return of N does the father make what would be the obvious reply that the mother had consented to him remaining in England.  Whilst not required in order to reach the decision I have on consent, I also note that the first instance court in Romania which awarded residence of N to the father found that the Father had not established consent to permanent removal, that the Mother had only agreed to a temporary removal and that the Father had unilaterally changed N&#8217;s residence to England.   In overturning the decision of the first instance court, the appellate court maintained this finding having reviewed the evidence.</p>

I reach the same conclusion with respect to the fact that N does not speak Romanian and the assertion that a return order would lead to N being placed in an environment he does not know (this not in fact being the case given the implementation of the parents&#8217; decision to relocate the family to Romania), and being removed from what he knows in England.  There is no evidence to support the contention that the maternal grandmother made N feel unwelcome.  The father&#8217;s assertion that the current war in Ukraine would create a grave risk of harm were N to be returned to Romania is <span style="font-style:italic">entirely</span> specious. The other matters relied on by the father, namely that the mother would make it difficult for the father to have any meaningful contact with N in circumstances where he cannot work in Romania, again do not come close to satisfying the terms of Art 13(b).   Whilst the father exhibits to his statement a photograph of him with a nosebleed, there is no cogent evidence before the court that he is the victim of domestic abuse. </p>
