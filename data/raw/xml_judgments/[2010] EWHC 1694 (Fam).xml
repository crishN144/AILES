The practical effect of that would be that the making of a Convention Adoption in this Country would obligate the U.S.A. to make all necessary arrangements for the admission to and residence in the U.S.A. of the adopted child. In those circumstances the local authority changed its care plan from a placement for adoption in the U.S.A. to the making of a Convention Adoption in this country with a view to subsequent permanent removal to the U.S.A.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by the local authority for a Placement Order in respect of a child SM born on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2003 and who is therefore 7 years of age. Her parents are DC and BM who, although not married, share parental responsibility. Neither parent is able to care for SM and neither contend otherwise. A full care order was made on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2008. It has been the local authority&#8217;s plan for a long time (and approved in principle by the court) that SM should live with her paternal uncle and aunt in the U.S.A. The reasons for the delay are to be found in the practical and legal difficulties that have been encountered and have been described in Black J&#8217;s earlier judgment and acknowledged in <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Re A</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That approach is supported by the father although he has never formally lodged his consent. It is opposed by the mother principally on the basis of resultant contact difficulties. However, she advances no tenable alternative. As I shall explain, I am satisfied that SM&#8217;s welfare will positively require me to dispense with their consent. However it is always more satisfactory both for prospective adoptors (especially where they are family members) and often for the child (when adult) to know that a placement was supported by parents. Hence the order giving the parents an opportunity to consent before the dispensing order is drawn up.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority are now anxious to press on with the placement with the prospective adoptors. They have issued their application for a placement order and I have heard it. In order to decide whether such an order should be made, the court must have regards to the matters set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. The simple facts are these: SM is living in a non-permanent foster placement; her parents cannot care for her and thus arrangements for permanency must be made; the paternal uncle and aunt are ready and willing and have been carefully assessed as able to care for her permanently; SM is keen to join them; because of immigration controls, she is unable to do so unless it is as an adopted child. In those circumstances a court applying <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1</ref> can only conclude both that a placement order is both right and necessary and also that, if the parents feel unable or unwilling to consent, the welfare of SM positively requires that it be dispensed with pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/52/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section52 (1)</ref>(b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus we reach the position where the court is disposed to make a placement order. It is made on the basis of a placement for adoption with the paternal uncle and aunt. The court should then satisfy itself that adoption by them is an end which is in fact (and in law) achievable. Many of the problems which have been confronted by courts, and are illustrated in <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Re A </span>(above), have been resolved by accession to the Convention. The practical problem in this case is the required residence period of 10 weeks. It is now established (see <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Re A</span>) that the home base does not have to be in this jurisdiction. The question is, however, whether the local authority can place this child in the U.S.A. with the prospective adoptors for some or all of this period.</p>

Breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85</ref> is made a criminal offence and, if what is contemplated here is a breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85</ref>, then clearly it cannot be done.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Parliament must of course be taken to know that the provisions of Chapter 3 and those of Chapter 6 are in the same Act and must, in my judgment, be taken to have intended that they be not in conflict with one another. The question is as to how they should be read so as to render them compatible. Two options suggest themselves: either to read <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/28/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 28(2)</ref> and (3) in such a way as to exclude any concept of the placement for the purposes of adoption; or to read <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85</ref> in some restrictive measure that does not encompass the making of a Convention adoption order in this country.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The difficulty with the restrictive reading of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/28/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 28(2)</ref> and (3) is that it is difficult to see, once a placement order has been made, how any placement is not for the purposes of adoption. It would, I think mean either restricting <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/28/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 28 (2)</ref> and (3) to long holidays in respect of a child otherwise placed in this country or devising a very restricted, even artificial, form of words as to purpose of placement whose sole purpose would be to defeat <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85(1)</ref>. I do not find either approach attractive and would prefer, if possible, to concentrate on the construction of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85 (1)</ref> itself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The context in which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85</ref> is found is that of removal of children for the purposes of adoption abroad. It seems that one of the main purposes of Chapter 6 is to ensure that children who are to be adopted abroad have all the same protections as they would were they to be adopted in this jurisdiction. That would be consistent with there having to exist an order for parental responsibility made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/84" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 84</ref> with all the safeguards provided by the Adoption with a Foreign Element Regulations 2005. Chapter 2 of Part 3 of those regulations (a different part to those dealing with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/84" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 84</ref>) deals with Convention Adoptions and of course govern the procedure in this case. Those Regulations can be complied with whether the child is here or in the U.S.A. I should also note that Section 86 gives power to restrict the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85</ref> in respect of family member by Regulation but none to date have been laid. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85</ref> therefore applies as much to family members as it does to strangers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85</ref> should be read restrictively (it is after all a penal provision) by confining it to permanent removals abroad for the purposes of adoption abroad. It should not be taken as covering what are temporary removals pending a return to apply for a Convention Adoption order in this jurisdiction &#8211; and return they must not least because that is required by the U.S.A. Immigration Authorities. In those circumstances in my judgment <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/28/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 28 (2)</ref> and (3) empower the court to sanction an arrangement which means that the period prescribed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 42</ref> can be spent outside the jurisdiction. In order clearly to distinguish this situation from one to which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85</ref> would apply, the Court should assert that the child remains subject to this jurisdiction, permission should be given for a specific time and the prospective adoptors should be required to undertake to return the child to the jurisdiction within that period or earlier if called upon so to do.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In those circumstances I doubt whether it would ever be right to give leave permanently to remove under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/28/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 28 (2)</ref> and (3) though I recognise that the drafting replicates <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 13</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> which clearly allows for permanent removal. I express no concluded view, however, as any such view should only be offered were the question directly to arise. For the purposes of this case only temporary leave is sought or is necessary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly I conclude that the court can give leave for the child to be removed to the U.S.A. for the purposes of the period required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 42</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> and that the taking up of such leave would not involve a breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 85</ref>. Considering the matter on its merits I have no doubt that such leave should be given subject to an end limit of 6 months and supported by undertakings to return and an acknowledgment of the continued jurisdiction of this court. Accordingly I make the Placement Order and give the leave sought.</p>

It will be understood, however, that nothing must be reported which might reasonably lead to the identification of the child concerned. I cannot part with this application without expressing my appreciation to counsel for all their assistance.</p>
