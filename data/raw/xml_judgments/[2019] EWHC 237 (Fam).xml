Mrs Justice Knowles listed the appeal for a permission hearing with appeal to follow immediately thereafter if permission was granted. The hearing was listed in that way because of the need for a decision on the appeal to be available in time for the final hearing listed before Her Honour Judge Miller QC, which was listed to commence on 29 January 2019. Mrs Justice Knowles gave directions on the appeal including for the transcript of the judgment of His Honour Judge Levy to be expedited and approved as soon as possible. </p>

Having been required by the order of January 2018 to provide a report as to the progress made by the parties and children in respect of the therapeutic program to include recommendations for any future work and progression of the children&#8217;s contact with their mother this necessarily implied recommendations as to transfer of residence if that was required.

She reported on 25 July 2017. The children expressed views were clear in that they did not wish to see their mother. She considered that the family would not benefit from the involvement of a child psychiatrist or psychologist and concluded that any attempt to direct face-to-face contact would be wholly detrimental to the children and likely doomed to failure. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It is immediately apparent that the wording of the order is different to that adopted in November 2017. Ms Briggs submits that the report requested was clearly a continuation of the November order and thus is clearly a direction for a Part 25 expert report even though there is no reference to part 25, to the court considering that such a report was necessary nor to it being an expert report. If one looks at the substance of what was to take place in terms of the psychotherapist&#8217;s work it is clear that they were conducting therapeutic work and reporting to the court on the outcome of their therapeutic work.  In cases where either a treating clinician is permitted to provide a part 25 expert report or in cases where a part 25 expert subsequently carries out therapeutic or other substantive work there is clearly scope for the blurring of the boundary between their functions. In the course of argument, Ms Briggs accepted that in the public law field an assessment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> will only fall within the parameters of that section if it is a true assessment rather than a therapeutic piece of work or at least that the assessment is the dominant purpose of the report and therapy a secondary component. Whilst such assessments are not entirely analogous to the sorts of private law assessments it does illustrate the distinction that should properly be drawn between part 25 expert assessment and the conducting of therapeutic work and reporting on the outcome. </p>

I have concerns about the harm which is being caused to these children and the risk of further harm being done to them whilst in the sole care of their father. My view is that these children urgently need therapeutic work to rectify the harm done to them during the separation of their mother and father but that it is not possible to deliver that to them whilst they remain in the sole care of their father. I&#8217;m concerned about father&#8217;s insight and the ongoing matter of disguised compliance in which he appears to comply on the surface but underneath his psychological resistance to the children&#8217;s relationship with their mother continues. Father in my view relies upon his belief that the children&#8217;s mother lied about past events and that the children&#8217;s resistance is evidence of that. Father continues in my view to question the judgment in this case and leaks his beliefs that his children&#8217;s resistance is justified in his interactions with them around matters concerned with their mother&#8230;It is my view that the children are alienating and that they hold distorted views of their mother in the present day and in the past as a result of this&#8230;It is my view that the only option to remedy the current graves position is a residence transfer to mother, to enable the delivery of the therapeutic work which is necessary.&#8217;</span></p>

Whilst it may have been the product of the parties&#8217; agreement to the psychotherapist carrying out further work it was certainly not a further report which had been expressly authorised by the court whether under part 25 or as part of a report on therapeutic work. </p>

The children were joined as parties and extensive directions were given for the preparation of evidence. That order provided for a three day final hearing on the first available date after 8 November 2018 with the allocation of the judge to determine the final hearing being referred to His Honour Judge Levy.

It is immediately apparent from the transcript that His Honour Judge Levy had concerns about the status of the psychotherapist; he identifying a concern over whether they were instructed as an expert or not and whether the instruction was a therapeutic one and whether they had gone beyond their remit in expressing a recommendation on a psychological basis which was outside their instructions or their area of expertise. As the hearing progressed, His Honour Judge Levy expressed the view that it may be appropriate for them to give factual evidence but doubts were expressed about whether they had permission to file opinion evidence. Enquiries were made about the letter of instruction that had been sent to them and it seemed to emerge that no one had questioned their status as an expert up until that point. Both the father&#8217;s counsel and the Guardian&#8217;s counsel submitted that the psychotherapist had exceeded her role and was not appropriately qualified to make the sort of recommendation that they had.   </p>

He concluded that was outside their competence even as a psychotherapist. He identified that they would be able to give factual evidence as to what they observed in the sessions but not opinion evidence and thus concluded he did not see a role for them as a live witness. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It seems clear from the documentation that the original instruction of the psychotherapist was on the basis of them being a part 25 expert. The application and the order tie in with each other and the order clearly uses the language of part 25. However the form and substance of the order of January 2018 are in my view different. The task that the psychotherapist was to carry out pursuant to that order was a therapeutic task and they were to report on the outcome of that therapeutic work. Thus the report that was sought was a report upon the therapy and a recommendation as to further therapeutic work. Thus the substance of the work was not an assessment but rather therapy and the report was the treating therapist&#8217;s recommendation as to the future. I appreciate that boundaries can become blurred when experts undertake therapy and that it is not necessarily at the forefront of the minds of the parties, their advisers, or the Judge, the status of the report and whether it is still that of an expert or whether it has transmuted into a report from a treating therapist. The latter will be essentially a factual report in terms of its forensic status rather than a Part 25 expert report although conceivably it might fulfil a dual purpose.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">His Honour Judge Levy clearly concluded that the January 2018 order which gave permission for the second report to be filed was in substance authorising the obtaining of a therapeutic and thus non-part 25 expert report. Having considered the terms of the order and the nature of the work that was done this seems to me to be a perfectly legitimate interpretation of that order. It does not seem that there was a further letter of instruction to the psychotherapist pursuant to part 25. The fact that their reports contained the standard part 25 rubric at their conclusion does not convert the report into a Part 25 expert&#8217;s report if it was not commissioned as such.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The third report, namely that of 18 July 2018 was not commissioned in compliance with a court order at all. It might of course of been possible for the mother to have retrospectively sought permission to rely on the report as a part 25 expert report but that application was not made to His Honour Judge Levy and given his observations on the extent to which the psychotherapist had gone beyond their remit it is of course highly improbable that he would have granted such retrospective permission had it been applied for. Whilst the second report identified the possibility of a transfer of residence as an option it did not advocate it in the way that 18 July report does.  The identification of that possibility in the second report is arguably within the remit of the court order of January 2018 if one interprets the order in a broad sense and analyses the recommendation as being part of that which looks to &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">future work and the progression of the children&#8217;s contact with their mother&#8217;. </span>On the other hand it is equally possible to argue that such a recommendation cannot be described as falling within the definition of future work or progression of the children&#8217;s contact with their mother. As I pointed out, one would usually expect to see in a part 25 instruction to an expert in this sort of situation explicit reference to the issue of potential transfer of residence and one would expect usually to see a detailed letter of instruction setting out questions which would be directed to this possibility. Thus, His Honour Judge Levy&#8217;s conclusion that the opinion contained within the second report was not something they had been instructed to provide was well within the range of reasonable interpretations of that order. It is not possible to argue that he had erred in principle taken into account irrelevant matters failed to take into account relevant matters or came to a decision so plainly wrong it must be regarded as outside the generous ambit of the discretion entrusted to him. To the extent that His Honour Judge Levy also doubted whether advice as to a transfer of residence was within their area of competence or expertise as a psychotherapist I think this has to be viewed within the overall context of his having concluded that they had not been instructed to provide expert evidence of the sort that they ultimately offered. I do not read His Honour Judge Levy&#8217;s observations as inferring that there were no circumstances in which this psychotherapist could offer advice on with whom a child should live. Ultimately it is probably a matter which is case specific and would depend upon the precise nature of the instruction they were given. I have little doubt that a psychotherapist could from a therapeutic perspective provide advice to parties on the issue of whether therapy could be effective depending on who the children were living with. How that translates into the forensic or legal arena is not something I need to address. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In respect of the third report the arguments in respect of the psychotherapist&#8217;s status as a part 25 expert or therapist are of even greater weight given that the third report was not filed in response to any court order at all. It seems that the parties wished to press on before the matter had returned to court. Had it returned to court no doubt consideration would have been given to the question of further reports from the psychotherapist. However the parties chose not to await further court determination but requested a further report which plainly had not been authorised by the court. That being so the report and the opinions expressed in that report plainly could not be interpreted as being filed pursuant to permission being granted by the court for an expert report. That report can only be categorised as a report from a treating therapist. The court was not asked to grant retrospective permission for it to be treated as an expert report although I suppose one could interpret the submissions made to His Honour Judge Levy as such an application given that the mother&#8217;s counsel was plainly arguing that it was an expert report. However for appellate purposes the question is whether His Honour </p>

His linked decision that the psychotherapist should not be called to give oral evidence is an even more pure case management decision. The judge had concluded that three days of court time was an appropriate share of the courts resources to allot to this case. He identified that the essential witnesses were the mother the father and the Guardian. Together with reading and judgment delivery time it would seem that a three day time estimate would allow for those three witnesses and the completion of the trial process. Given he had concluded rightly that the psychotherapist&#8217;s evidence was properly characterised as factual rather than expert he was entitled within his discretion to determine that they need not be called.   </p>

Neither Mr Young nor Ms De Freitas argued for this. Where evidence is filed from a treating clinician almost inevitably it will contain matters of pure fact and matters of opinion. A GP who takes a patient&#8217;s temperature, examines their throat and sees redness and swelling and diagnoses a cold is recording matters of pure fact but also a diagnosis which is an opinion. That does not mean that the court cannot read or consider the opinion. The difference is that it is not the opinion of a court appointed independent expert but rather the opinion of a treating clinician. That of course has consequences in terms of the weight that the evidence will be given by the court. The purpose of the part 25 process, including the court authorising the expert, identifying the questions and imposing obligations pursuant to part 25 gives the part 25 expert evidence greater weight and authority (subject to challenge) than that of a treating clinician who is not subject to the same rigours of that process.  </p>

If Her Honour Judge Miller QC as the trial judge and having considered the trial papers takes a different view of the situation it is open to her as the trial judge to deal with the matter differently.

No doubt in most cases the case management decisions taken at an earlier stage will ensure this outcome at the trial but inevitably there are cases where the trial judge feels it is necessary to depart from earlier case management decisions in order to ensure that justice is done at the final stage. </p>
