The father has indefinite leave to remain in this country, the mother has right to remain as a refugee. They met in 2015. They married under Islamic law but did not marry under civil law. The mother left the family home with the police on 29 January 2021 with B. This led to the father applying for a Child Arrangements Order on 16 March 2021 to allow him to see B and a Prohibited Steps Order to prevent the mother taking the child out of the jurisdiction. The Prohibited Steps Order was made on a without notice basis.</span></p>

At the FHDRA on 12 August 2021 the court determined a fact-finding hearing was required. On 14 October 2021 the case was managed with evidence ordered, a pretrial review set, and the matter listed for a finding of fact to take place in March 2022. This hearing was vacated as police disclosure was incomplete, a July relisting was vacated for the same reason leading to the fact-finding eventually occurring in December 2022 nearly 21 months after the initial application. In accordance with CAFCASS&#8217;s advice there has been no contact between the father and his son during that period.</span></p>

She indicated that when the health visitor visited the father would hide in the bedroom to hear the conversation. She alleged he would threaten to kill her and convinced her the police in the UK would not help her if she called them. She suggested that the father would constantly call her or text her when she was out of the home. She described an incident in August 2020 when she suggests that the father kicked her on the back causing her to lose a second child. This allegation appears to disappear by the time the schedule was prepared. She suggested that the applicant forced her to be involved in a faked accident in support of a road traffic accident claim. She described the incident of 29 January 2021 as including the father picking B up and throwing him against the wall. Finally, she described an incident post separation where the father sent her a picture of his face where he had sewn his lips together.</span></p>

Ip told suspect to leave the address which he refused so she called the police. IP confirmed she had not been assaulted.

Rather, as Kogan states, it is one of a line of distinguished judicial observations that emphasise the fallibility of human memory and the need to assess witness evidence in its proper place alongside contemporaneous documentary evidence and evidence upon which undoubted or probable reliance can be placed. The discussion in Gestmin is expressly addressed to commercial cases, where documentary evidence will often be the first port of call, ahead of unaided memory.&#8221;</span></p>

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities. However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence. Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable.&#8221;</span></p>

As Baker J said in in Gloucestershire CC v RH and others at [42], it is essential that the judge forms a view as to the credibility of each of the witnesses, to which end oral evidence will be of great importance in enabling the court to discover what occurred, and in assessing the reliability of the witness. </span></p>

In family cases at least, that would not only be unrealistic but, as I have said, may deprive a judge of valuable insights. There will be cases where the manner in which evidence is given about such personal matters will properly assume prominence. As Munby LJ said in Re A (A Child) (No. 2) [2011] EWCA Civ. 12 said at [104] in a passage described by the Judge as of considerable assistance in the present case: &#8220;Any judge who has had to conduct a fact-finding hearing such as this is likely to have had experience of a witness - as here a woman deposing to serious domestic violence and grave sexual abuse - whose evidence, although shot through with unreliability as to details, with gross exaggeration and even with lies, is nonetheless compelling and convincing as to the central core&#8230; Yet through all the lies, as experience teaches, one may nonetheless be left with a powerful conviction that on the essentials the witness is telling the truth, perhaps because of the way in which she gives her evidence, perhaps because of a number of small points which, although trivial in themselves, nonetheless suddenly illuminate the underlying realities.&#8221;</span></p>

The issue of the tenancy agreement is a technical one but on the face of it does appear to be an attempt to strengthen her position regarding who, if anyone, was to be asked to leave the flat. These are the proven untruths and need to be placed in the context of a lengthy relationship. They in my estimation do not prove that she is lying in relation to other events under oath in a court.</span></p>

Ms Poselay was very clear that the mother stated she was struck to the left side of her face and yet in the video moved her hand to her right side. If the footage is considered carefully the question put to the mother at 12.50 is phrased as a statement but is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;He grabbed you by the throat?&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> The mother then holds her hand to the right side of the neck. It is far from clear that this is a definitive statement that she was punched to the right side not the left as alleged and so I do not find this to be the definitive lie as it is suggested.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Demeanour: The mother answered most questions put to her though she became less helpful towards the end of her testimony. She provided answers to the questions put to her and could be seen trying to explain events. Ms Poselay was able to demonstrate inconsistencies, but the mother continued to try and answer questions. The father frequently resorted to posing questions back to counsel despite being warned it was not helpful. It was suggested that this was a language feature and that may be correct but at times it appeared he wanted to challenge the questioner rather than engage with the evidence. He also used stock phrases, he said on a number of occasions that if what the mother was saying was true why was he not in prison. This was not helpful. He maintained a full denial to all events and the impression given was of an unwillingness to accept that there were any real problems in the relationship save for outside interference. One example of this was his comment that he had never heard his son cry. That seems implausible. In addition, he seemed to take delight in the mother&#8217;s inconsistencies being explored. At times it almost appeared a game to him.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This is a case which requires a consideration of the evidence in its totality. On one hand I have what I find to be a broadly consistent testimony of escalating abuse on the other I have a blanket denial and some reluctance to engage with the evidence under oath. I find that the established facts support a volatility and aggressiveness in the father which is indicative of a likelihood of violence when under stress. I further find the stress existed through hard work and inadequate living arrangements.</span></p>

The text from the mother to the father saying she would </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;kill him&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> is an odd text within the context of violence. In addition, it is clear that the mother herself is demanding as to the father&#8217;s exact location. Relationships are not as simple as schedules of allegations, but it is not my responsibility to determine these matters. This is not a case where counter allegations have been made which I have to determine.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This is very much a case where I have to have to consider the broad canvass of the evidence. In doing so I note the logic of conflict in the undisputed facts, I am not satisfied that the inconsistence are of such matters of significance that they undermine the general thrust of the mother&#8217;s testimony. I find the counter narrative that nothing untoward happened as inherently unlikely given the volatility of the situation and what we know about the father&#8217;s character. Taking all these factors into consideration I thus find that it is more likely than not that there is an essential element of truth running through the mother&#8217;s testimony. As such I find that the allegations are largely proven as set out in the schedule. I add to that a finding of emotional abuse via threats made by the father to kill himself and the indication that the mother would be responsible for that.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I do not find that the father has harmed B as alleged. The mother was not able to describe how B might have got injured or knocked on 24 January. It is only the bruise which leads her to make this accusation and there is some evidence the bruise may have already existed. With the mother not having seen the incident I am not satisfied it occurred as described. I also do not find that the father threw B against a wall. He was subject to full medical examination by doctors over a four-day period and they found no marks or injuries. It is possible that the father knocked B during that incident but that is not the same thing and is not the allegation made. These findings are not incompatible with the overall truthfulness of the mother&#8217;s testimony as she accepted she did not see the first incident and the second incident was clearly frightening and she may have misjudged what occurred. In any event I find that element of the allegations not proved.</span></p>

However, other elements do not fit the pattern, the driving lessons, the college attendance and the unaccompanied travel to Sweden and Iran. In addition, the texts indicate the mother trying to control or at least monitor the father&#8217;s location. Clearly there were elements of the parties trying to monitor each other as their relationship deteriorated but I do not find there is sufficient evidence for me to find one sided coercion and control.</span></p>
