As such and inevitably the focus has been on the adults and not on the child.  It is important to redress that balance and to return this child to the centre of the process to re-emphasise that it is she who is the court&#8217;s paramount consideration.</span></p>

Complications with her mother&#8217;s labour had been anticipated and delivery had been planned to be by way of Caesarean section.  In the event, the mother was admitted to hospital by ambulance due to reduced foetal movement and spontaneous onset of labour.</span></p>

Her first gasp was not until 20 minutes into life.  Dr.&#160;Daniel Mattison, Consultant Paediatrician, identifies that SL had experienced hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.  This can&#160;result in a&#160;wide spectrum of disability and in SL&#8217;s case she has been left with a&#160;raft of problems.  Firstly, quadriplegic cerebral palsy, which means that she has impaired movement and stiffness of all her limbs as a&#160;direct&#160;result of brain damage to the parts of the brain involved in movement, tone and posture.  </span></p>

Thirdly, she has gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.  That is a&#160;condition where the stomach contents pass into the oesophagus causing symptoms.  The stomach contents are acidic so the symptoms include pain from the acidic contents coming into contact with the oesophagus and the throat.  They also include vomiting, feeding difficulties and respiratory problems if the stomach contents irritate the top of the windpipe or if small amounts enter the lungs.  Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is more&#160;common and may be more&#160;severe in children with severe neuro-disability like SL.  </span></p>

I&#160;am very pleased to have been given the opportunity to see them for neither the papers nor the oral evidence give the complete picture of SL as she is.  That material centres, as is perhaps inevitable, on SL&#8217;s difficulties and health challenges.  The videos and photographs reveal a&#160;little girl who is bright, curious, who has her own sense of fun and who is full of character.</span></p>

The second is an application brought by Southend Borough Council seeking the return of SL as a&#160;child placed for adoption back into their care.  That notice, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/35" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.35</ref> sub-<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section&#160;(2</ref>) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> was served on&#160;6&#160;February&#160;2015 and is, therefore, the second in time.

This experience has been accumulated over many years.  She also has a&#160;clear perception that children with disabilities are children first and foremost and are entitled to the same opportunities as others to play, learn, develop and enjoy life.  However, she is also aware of the increased vulnerability of disabled children who may find it hard to communicate or to understand and she has given thought to how her child could be assisted in understanding their circumstances and history most appropriately and in communicating their wishes&#8221;.  </span></p>

She was diagnosed in 2006 with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a&#160;condition which typically develops during puberty as the body enters a&#160;rapid growth phase.  As a&#160;younger child RY recalls that she was rather clumsy and not very well co-ordinated, but she had not had any problems with mobility as such.  At the age of 12 she started to have pain in her joints but this was put down to &#8216;growing pains&#8217;.  The pain grew worse over time and affected her mobility.  She struggled to keep up with her peers, especially as her school was situated on a&#160;very large campus and classrooms were often far apart.  No cause was found for her difficulties.  RY&#8217;s mother thought her problems might be emotional as she was being bullied at school.  She was referred for physiotherapy which caused her more pain.  At the age of 15, RY refused any more physiotherapy as it was so painful.  </span></p>

Life was difficult at this time.  Although RY was in frequent and in severe pain no condition had been diagnosed and her parents thought her condition might be psychosomatic.  RY told me that she had begun to wonder the same thing herself.  </span></p>

She asked for a wheelchair assessment in her first year.  Because of her contact with her friend Katie and other young disabled people, RY had no reservations about using a&#160;wheelchair and saw it as a&#160;positive option for getting around more quickly and without pain and very preferable to walking laboriously with two sticks.  When she first told her mother she had a&#160;wheelchair, Deborah thought RY was &#8216;mad&#8217; as she still did not have a&#160;diagnosis&#8221;.  </span></p>

So what does this mean for me now at&#160;28&#160;years of age?  The really really obvious bit is that I&#160;use a&#160;wheelchair.  Those wobbly joints, my hips, knees and ankles, are just too wobbly for walking on.  They are so wobbly that the weight pressure does not get shared through the middle of the joint like it&#8217;s meant to, so trying to stand up is also extremely painful.  </span></p>

Now I&#160;weigh around&#160;80&#160;kilograms and while my arms are pretty strong, before I&#160;had my power chair I&#160;was self-propelling a&#160;manual wheelchair, before that I&#160;was walking with crutches and heaving myself upstairs, they are not strong enough given that general wobbliness along with a&#160;shoulder damaged in a&#160;rather nasty fall in 2007 to support my body enough to transfer myself.  Transferring means moving from one place to another, wheelchair to sofa to loo to bed, so I&#160;do my transfers using a&#160;hoist which lifts me by means of a&#160;fabric sling that I&#160;sit on.  I&#160;have hoists fitted in my house.  </span></p>

The Changing Places Campaign details these and I&#160;have an excellent relationship with a&#160;company who can deliver one for hire pretty much anywhere in the country within four&#160;hours&#8217; notice so that going on holiday is no problem.  The hoist in my house is set up so that I&#160;can use it easily myself without any help even to hoist other people.  A&#160;good hoist setup means that even a&#160;very big, heavy and totally physically dependent person can transfer safely without a&#160;care giver needing to apply any strength to the situation at all.  </span></p>

Luckily I&#160;have support from personal assistants so I&#160;can &#8216;delegate&#8217; those jobs which leave me with a&#160;lot of time and energy which can all be dedicated to caring for a&#160;child.  Consequently, I&#160;would actually be far more available to a&#160;child with a&#160;high level of support need than any other single parent would be.  </span></p>

The things I need support with are peripheral, practical tasks which exist outside the parent-child relationship.  Cooking is a&#160;good example.  I&#8217;ll look in the fridge, decide what I&#8217;d like to cook, ask my PA to chop the veg and any other really physical jobs&#160;and then take over with stirring tasting and seasoning.  Or sometimes I&#8217;m just doing the deciding and none of the hands-on stuff.  I&#160;call this cooking by proxy.  I&#160;really like trying new things and making food from scratch.  I&#160;am vegetarian but would happily cook meat and fish for a&#160;child who needed it or asked for it once they were old enough.  </span></p>

My swallow is a little bit out of whack which makes drinking enough to be well hydrated quite hard work.  Because of this I&#160;have a&#160;back-up option, a&#160;little tube that goes straight into my stomach called a&#160;gastrostomy tube or a&#160;PEG tube.  This really has no bearing at all on the rest of my life, it&#8217;s just there.  I&#160;use it when I&#160;need to and as a&#160;result I&#160;am always in as good a&#160;shape physically as I&#160;can possibly be.

Again nobody knows it&#8217;s there unless I&#160;tell them and it has no bearing at all on the rest of my life except for the very useful side effect of making me need to worry a&#160;lot less about where the nearest toilet with a&#160;hoist is.  I&#160;don&#8217;t tend to tell people that I&#8217;ve got a&#160;gastrostomy tube or a&#160;super-pubic catheter, there&#8217;s no good reason for anyone except my GP to know and the district nurses who would give me back-up if I&#160;was having some sort of problem.  They don&#8217;t affect what I do in day-to-day life at all nor would they affect my parenting except possibly to give me slightly more capacity than most.  </span></p>

She submits that the adoption agency recognises that on reflection and with the benefit of hindsight, (a&#160;recurrent phrase) the use of this local pro forma document was not suited to the facts of this case.  It is now, she says, recognised that what was required - and is likely to be required in cases such as this concerning any child with complex care needs - is &#8220;a&#160;bespoke <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> parental responsibility document tailored to the individual circumstances and needs of the child being placed.&#8221;</span></p>

It also intends to raise the issue with the British Association of Adoption and Fostering so that other adoption agencies may benefit from learning from the experience of this case.  I&#160;would add to that my own view that the standardised document is itself lacking in clarity.  The first two requirements permitting consent for emergency treatment and refusing to bestow consent to treatment including operations are not immediately capable of easy reconciliation and generate, to my mind, inevitable confusion.  As I&#160;have said, they require some refinement though, of course, I&#160;recognise, in many cases, issues such as this will simply not arise.</span></p>

Justification for interference on the basis of proportionality will inevitably therefore depend on the complexion of the particular facts, thus a&#160;higher test for removal of a&#160;child from her parents may be required than in the case of removal from prospective adopters who are still engaged in the process of continuing evaluation and assessment prior to the making of the final adoption order and who have, as I have looked at, not yet been conferred with full Parental Responsibility Orders.</span></p>

In a&#160;succinct and focussed way, Dr.&#160;Mattison identified all the key issues in the case and his report thereafter proved to be a&#160;beacon to guide the other professionals involved.  For this reason, and at risk of overburdening this judgment, I&#160;propose to quote from it extensively.  It should serve as a paradigm for others to follow:</span></p>

RY has repeatedly asked about increased intervention such as a tracheostomy (a tube inserted through the neck into the windpipe to produce a safe airway in children with airway problems) and on another occasion a central line (a tube placed through the skin into a large vein in the chest) for the administration of parenteral nutrition (food directly into the bloodstream for children unable to be fed by the usual route). Neither of these interventions would be appropriate for SL' s current medical needs.</span></p>

It was clarified with RY that SL needs her feed to live and so going home without being fed would effectively be palliative or end of life care.  RY understood this but repeated the query despite a clear message that SL was not dying and that the medical plan is to build up her feeds and send her home in the near future. In my experience, parents and carers will usually find the topic of end of life care very distressing and it would be unusual for them to attempt to discuss an end of life plan when the child was not seriously unwell or expected to deteriorate or die. This is more unusual still considering that RY has not yet adopted SL and she remains a looked after child.</span></p>

At the heart of this case is a&#160;little girl who needs a&#160;carer who is able to liaise and co-operate proactively and sensitively and in a&#160;collaborative way with the wide variety of expertise that SL is likely to have to call on during the course of her life, but RY has been unable to establish any constructive working relationships.  She failed with Dr.&#160;Mattison, she failed with Ms.&#160;Taylor, the Ward Manager, she failed with Dr.&#160;Booth, and she failed with Ms.&#160;Deever.

It is, on any view, a&#160;self-evidently unsatisfactory explanation.

I&#160;find her judgment and her behaviour, was irrational, unstable and she had become, I&#160;am truly sad to say, a&#160;real risk to SL.  There are many illustrations of this, but I&#160;must mention just two more.  </span></p>

In her statement, which was not, undermined by cross-examination, during the course of which she responded to fair and balanced questions in a&#160;moderate and reflective way.  She told me that&#160;RY had frequently requested sedation for SL, that she had predicated this upon a&#160;great many unsettled nights, as she described it.  Ms.&#160;Deever, who is the Service Lead, Special Needs Nursing Service organisation, took, she told me, great care to explain to&#160;RY the dangers of sedation to SL.  </span></p>

Moreover, I&#160;am satisfied that was advice that merely reinforced that given by Dr.&#160;Court to&#160;RY.  I&#160;am satisfied that &#160;RY told Ms.&#160;Deever that Dr.&#160;Court had said that sedation was appropriate, he had not done and this was a&#160;dangerous misrepresentation to Ms.&#160;Deever which she was experienced enough, thankfully, to resist.  That this was said by RY is illustrated corroboratively by the fact that Ms.&#160;Deever immediately contacted Dr.&#160;Court to confirm that her approach was right and that it&#160;would be unsafe for SL to sedate her.  Conversely, of course, as we have looked at, when prescribed Oramorph leaving intensive care, RY rejected it.  This leads Ms.&#160;Walker to speculate that the motivation of RY was to maintain control over all that went on.</span></p>

Ms. Heaton and Ms. Walker both considered that publication, in which the name of the carer was not anonymised was likely to be contrary to the interest of the child and to run an unacceptable risk of disrupting her care.

The exercise to be performed is one of parallel analysis in which the starting point is presumptive parity, in that neither Article has precedence over or trumps the other. The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each. It is not a mechanical exercise to be decided on the basis of rival generalities.

In such a case, the child's welfare, which of course includes respect for his or her privacy free from damaging publicity, is the court's paramount consideration see Re Z (A Minor) (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] Fam 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] Fam 1</ref> per Ward LJ at 23C-E, 23H-24A, 28B-D, 29D-E and per Sir Thomas Bingham MR at 33B-D.

There may of course be justifications for the publication of private information by private persons which would not be available to the state - I have particularly in mind the position of the media, to which I shall return in a moment - but I can see no logical ground for saying that a person should have less protection against a private individual than he would have against the state for the publication of personal information for which there is no justification.
