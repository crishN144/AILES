The problem in this case can be stated quite simply.  A financial remedy order, then called an ancillary relief order, made by consent on 9 February 1999, provides that the husband will pay maintenance/periodical payments until remarriage or further order as the 1973 Act requires or limits.  A preamble recital/recital to the order provides that after re-marriage, the husband will pay those periodical payments at the rate in force at the date of her re-marriage and they will be will index linked.  The court could not make an order for periodical payments after remarriage because of the provisions of section 28(1)(a) of the 1973 Act; whereby the term of the order made on or after the grant of a decree of divorce (or nullity) &#8220;shall not extend&#8221;, beyond the remarriage (or civil partnership) of the recipient party.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The parties had been married to one another in 1992 having been living together for a number of years.  The wife had two children from a previous marriage.  They are now adult (in their forties) but were accepted as children of the family, as the wife wishes to stress.  They remain on good terms with the husband and now work in his businesses.  The marriage broke down fairly soon after its celebration, the parties separated, and the wife eventually brought what are now termed financial remedy proceedings. The husband continued to maintain the wife after the separation. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The 1999 order was made by District Judge Bradley at the then Principal Registry of the Family Division, a former family practitioner and very experienced in the field, if that matters.  The parties had had, according to the correspondence, some concern as to whether the order would be accepted by the judge in the terms drafted but she was content with the draft and accepted it without enquiry.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">After the husband stopped paying, the wife&#8217;s solicitors wrote what is effectively a letter before action that she intended to issue proceedings to enforce the agreement in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division as a civil debt.  She enclosed draft particulars of claim settled, I assume, by specialist counsel.  That sets out the facts of the making of the order.  It also states that the order was based upon a compromise of the agreement orally agreed outside court on the morning of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 1998 when Deputy District Judge Willbourne was considering directions.  It asserts that that provision went beyond what the court could have ordered under the compromised ancillary relief claim and by so doing, and as part of the consideration for the agreement, the claimant gave up an immediate right to claim by way of ancillary relief a capitalised sum for lifetime maintenance.  This sum, had it have been awarded, would likely have been calculated based on her life expectancy without taking into account prospects of remarriage.  A lump sum based on a &#8216;Duxbury&#8217; award is a well known concept to family lawyers.  It takes into account that there may be many eventualities in the remaining life of the recipient based upon general actuarial tables with regard to life expectancy, yield, and other factors.  It is still a useful &#8216;tool of the trade&#8217;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I need not go into what happened next.  I have not considered it in detail and there may need to be some evidence about it.  The husband says that he also attempted to issue an application to vary a maintenance agreement pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/35" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 35</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> but there were problems with its issue on the right form, which was later corrected.  There is now, it is agreed, a properly constituted application pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/35" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 35</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> in addition to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> application.  The wife has applied to strike out both applications under rule 4.4 of the 2010 Family Procedure Rules, submitting that the husband&#8217;s application discloses no reasonable cause of action.  She says that there is no jurisdiction to entertain such an application.  The husband disagrees and says that the payment is based on the agreement to make ongoing provision which he is entitled to apply to vary.  </p>

The parties had been separated for a long time and the entirety of the husband&#8217;s wealth, as was agreed, had been acquired or created during the period of separation.  At first instance, the deputy judge (Nicholas Francis QC) had refused to strike out the action.

She also submits that the application has not been advanced in good faith.  She says that the court was misled or potentially misled by the way in which the application came before it as she had been on the brink of issuing her Queen&#8217;s Bench proceedings when the husband made an application stating that it was urgent which it was not.</p>

The Supreme Court through Lord Wilson dismissed the alternative suggestion made by Lord Justice Jackson that an application which had no real prospect of success in itself was an abuse of the court&#8217;s process.  At paragraph 27, he described the touchstone of the application before him as being whether the application was &#8220;legally recognisable&#8221; and, in fact, stated that an application made after the applicant had remarried, or after an identical application had been dismissed, or otherwise finally determined, would be examples of applications not legally recognisable.  Those precise examples are not relevant to this case.  They did not concern an application to vary a purported maintenance agreement.  It is common ground in this case that if there were no such agreement, the wife would not be permitted to make an application for periodical payments now having remarried.  </p>

The wife&#8217;s case is also that once an agreement is incorporated into an order of the court and is approved by it, the agreement which underlies it falls away.

In cases like this where a settlement discussion takes place there could not be oral communication at all.  The representatives would have to pass notes to one another.  Nothing could be said.  That is manifestly absurd.  In my view what <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/34" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 34</ref> requires is that in order for the court to have the power to enforce or vary, terms must be reduced to writing.

He argues that a maintenance agreement can only be one which has no reference to divorce, and which is not made as part of a settlement in divorce proceedings or as part of a financial remedy/ancillary relief order.  He says that &#8216;maintenance agreement&#8217; is a specific term of art, whereas this is &#8220;an agreement for maintenance.&#8221;</p>

This does not exclude an intervening divorce, or intervening court order, or require or exclude reference to the dissolution or annulment of the marriage.  I am satisfied that although these circumstances are unusual, that I am in fact here dealing with an agreement for maintenance, which is a maintenance agreement, and that they are the same whatever one may specifically term them, and that agreement stands alongside the court order.  The agreement made the order capable of being approved by the judge who had to have regard to the totality of what was provided in the order.  That agreement has only been enforceable under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> save pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/34" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 34</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/35" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 35</ref>, or the court&#8217;s own process.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The husband, in fact, has set out a number of reasons for ceasing to pay with which I do not need to deal for the purposes of this judgment.  They include matters which relate to: the conduct of the marriage itself; how the assets were distributed between them; what his financial circumstances were at the time; and whether the agreement was dependent on the ability of his businesses to support the payments.  Most importantly for the purposes of this application is his case that he needs now to have access to the funds represented by the obligation to make periodical payments to support his relationship with his present wife; and his case that the wife and her husband J are now financially sound and do not need the payments so that continuation of the order is unfair.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In that context, it is the wife&#8217;s case that the husband&#8217;s protestations, if not of outright poverty, at least of financial constraint, are untrue.  I was asked to admit a statement by her solicitor setting out as fact various matters relied on by the wife.  This is not a criticism, but a substantial part of its content is not direct evidence but reported assertion from various sources, accompanied by opinion and inference.  Relevant parts of this affidavit can of course be put to the husband when he comes to give evidence if this case gets to that stage.  That is the territory of investigation.  I have not strictly admitted that document for the purpose of these proceedings but I have not excluded it and I have had overall regard to its contents.  In my view it is not to the application before me.</p>

The court may need to look at whether his bypassing of a mediation (MIAM) was based on deceptive grounds, although I note that the wife&#8217;s case before me was not initially that she wanted me to order a MIAM if I was not to strike out these proceedings.  The court may also need to look at the way in which the husband launched his application, his <span style="font-style:italic">bona fides</span>, and good faith generally.  The assessment of his motivation and his conduct may assist the court to consider the totality of the bases upon which he justifies now cutting off the wife&#8217;s support.  </p>

I am not satisfied (I am sorry about the double negatives) that it does not disclose any cause of action.  It does disclose reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the application.  This is a strict and narrow test which is not satisfied. I am satisfied in any event that this agreement constitutes a variable maintenance agreement.</p>

This agreement does not contain any such explicit provision, although the wife says it is implied.  However to draw a distinction between a husband who has entered into a periodic obligation to a wife outside the statutory menu, and a husband who has an obligation by order of the court, and to say that the latter can apply to vary and the former cannot, is potentially arbitrary, discriminatory, and in breach of Article 6 ECHR.  However, I have not heard full argument on that point.</p>

This is not a case where outright capital provision was made and therefore, the prohibition on variation of capital orders is not relevant.  This was not a payment of a lump sump by instalments which in itself is variable at least in some respects.  It was an open ended periodical payment.  The fact of the underlying agreement between the parties, however, is of profound significance as to whether the husband&#8217;s application to vary should be allowed in whole or in part.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This is not a case about property adjustment orders but the interpretation of this agreement.  What it was that the wife gave up, and what the parties accepted that she should have, is an absolutely fundamental point which needs to be decided on the evidence and may very well determine the outcome.  An investigation of the husband&#8217;s means will, of course, be essential in order to determine the outcome.  Speaking in principle, an application to vary an agreement of this type is very different if it is justified on the basis of lack of funds rather than simply brought on the basis that the husband has now reached retirement.  However, those are theoretical thoughts for the moment and I have not come to any conclusions about this case.</p>
