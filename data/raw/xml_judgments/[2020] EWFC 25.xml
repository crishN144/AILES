The local authority says that the only solution for her that will do is that there be a final care order and that she be placed for adoption. The mother, RK does not oppose a care order but argues that she and EK should be set on a path of rehabilitation. Essentially, she argues for one more chance to show that she is fit to care for her daughter. The father, MB, in substance argues for the same thing. He says that the proceedings should be adjourned for him to be further assessed to see if he is fit to raise his daughter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">To make the order sought by the local authority, severing the bond between parent and child, is a momentous thing. It has been said that with the abolition of capital punishment it is arguably the most serious order that a judge in this country can make. The child will grow to adulthood in a completely different family to that which nature had intended. The child will grow with a completely different set of values and experiences to that originally anticipated. It is because of the momentous nature of the decision that the law, both domestic and from Strasbourg, insists that the powers cannot be exercised until there has been proved past serious harm, or the risk of future serious harm. Even then, the powers cannot be exercised in the manner claimed unless the child&#8217;s welfare demands such a solution and where no other solution can be found consistent with the child&#8217;s welfare.

It is one of the crowning glories of our legal system that the state continues to provide non-means tested, non-merit-based legal aid to parents who are facing removal of their children so that the case of the organs of the state can be fully forensically tested and state officials are held to account. That has happened in this case. The state officials involved, namely the social worker NQ and the Guardian KS, have been fully held to account and have been subjected to rigorous, albeit fair, crossexamination by counsel for the parents.  </p>

There were a few hitches, which I think were all referable to one of the locations having a poor Internet signal. However, the problems were all overcome. I heard evidence from five witnesses, one of whom was in Scotland. I had an excellent e-bundle which contained all relevant documents. Counsel were all able to make their submissions without a hitch. This is the second case in consecutive weeks which I have heard in this way. Plainly, for as long as this emergency continues this will be the only way in which the majority of cases can be heard. It is reassuring that notwithstanding the national shutdown the wheels of justice have been enabled to turn. </p>

She has an older and younger brother. When aged five her mother abandoned the home. In 2001 the family became known to the local authority owing to concerns of neglect, supervision and safety. At age 14 she and her younger brother were removed under an interim care order; that order was made final in 2009. A psychological assessment made within those proceedings concluded that the mother suffered from an autistic spectrum disorder and Asperger&#8217;s syndrome, although a later assessment withdrew the latter diagnosis. </p>

Plainly, they were infatuated by each other, but the relationship was flawed, and deeply toxic, from the very start. In March 2015 E was placed first in police protection and then in foster care as a result of concerns about the conflicted nature of the relationship between the mother and the father. In July 2015 the mother announced that she was pregnant with the father&#8217;s child. In October 2015 the mother informed the local authority that she was no longer in a relationship with the father. However, their mutual attraction was overpowering, and their relationship has continued certainly until last year. It could be argued that even now it is not finally extinguished. </p>

The adoption order was duly made. I note that while the adoptive parents of E and R would not be willing to accept yet another child, they would, if EK were adopted, and subject of course to the consent of EK&#8217;s adoptive parents, be happy to allow contact between the siblings. This is an advantage which is material to my decision. </p>

Such is the father&#8217;s need to control the mother that he installed CCTV in their dwelling so he could monitor her, he suspecting her of infidelity. His explanation to me that he did so in order to identify an abusive neighbour who was damaging his property (which neighbour was an uncle of the mother) is completely implausible given that he placed cameras all over the interior of the property. On 19 November 2018 the father reported the mother to the police as being missing. On the police locating her wandering the streets of the local town the father refused to allow the mother back into their dwelling. Between December 2018 and February 2019 there were no fewer than 15 police callouts to the parents&#8217; dwelling. On one such occasion father called the police because the mother had refused to go out for a walk with him. He seemed to believe that this was a perfectly reasonable thing to do and could not recognise that this was a grossly irresponsible waste of police time. On 26 March 2019, the father reported that the mother was packing her belongings and was leaving him. She was, of course, then eight months pregnant.  </p>

The mother had really no explanation as to why in September and October 2019, when she knew she was under the spotlight, she chose to embark on the utterly reckless course of conduct involving her triangular relationship with A and D.
