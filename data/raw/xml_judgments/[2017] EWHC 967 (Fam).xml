	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are care proceedings relating to a teenager I shall continue to refer to as Y. He was born in the latter part of 2000 and is 16 years old. On 12 September 2016, I handed down a judgment which summarised events down to that date: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re X (A Child) (Jurisdiction: Secure Accommodation), In re Y (A Child) (Jurisdiction: Secure Accommodation) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/2271" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 2271 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 2271 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] Fam 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] Fam 80</ref>, paras 4, 6-9. I now hand down this short judgment to explain briefly why, on 23 March 2017 and without any opposition, I made a final care order in relation to Y.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s final threshold document is dated 14 March 2017. I do not propose to go into the details: there is no need to do so. In short, both of Y&#8217;s parents (his mother died very unexpectedly earlier this year; his father does not have parental responsibility) were, as a result of various problems of their own, unable to care satisfactorily with Y. He suffered neglect and was beyond parental control, demonstrating various behaviours which, as I explained in <span style="font-style:italic">In re X, In re Y</span>, para 6, in due course required him to be placed in secure accommodation. However, as I went on to record (para 9), by 1 September 2016 &#8220;It was apparent that Y had done well in secure accommodation and was ready for a &#8220;step-down&#8221; move to suitable residential non-secure accommodation.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was, and in my judgment plainly could be, no challenge to the local authority&#8217;s case on threshold. I am therefore concerned exclusively with Y&#8217;s welfare.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although there have been some fits and starts along the way, Y has made remarkable progress over recent months and weeks. That reflects great credit on the local authority, but even more so on Y himself. I do not need to go into the details: they are summarised in his social worker&#8217;s &#8216;Leaving Care Assessment of Need&#8217; dated 21 March 2017 and the position statement dated 22 March 2017 prepared by his guardian&#8217;s solicitors. Y wants to get his life sorted out; his thinking about himself and his future is positive; he is engaging well with his social worker and other professionals; he wants to engage in education. With his agreement, he has moved into a semi-independent placement, which is better suited to him and (as I can well understand) more to his liking than other placements where he has been, and where, in contrast, he has settled well. </p>

This level of engagement has enabled Y to regain some control within his life &#8230; [he] is accepting of the support, guidance and boundaries that are now in place as he feels that he has been listened to &#8230; It is remarkable that Y has been able to demonstrate the maturity required to maintain the placement of his choice &#8230;&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s plans for Y are set out in a final Care Plan dated 21 March 2017 and a Pathway Plan likewise dated 21 March 2017. Both reflect the hard work and careful thought of the local authority; the latter, if I may say so, is a model of what a Pathway Plan ought to be. In the order I made I &#8220;commended the local authority for the work undertaken in the case, in particular the in-depth nature of the pathway planning.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the date of the hearing before me on 23 March 2017, everyone was of the view that the time had come to make a final order. I agree. Everyone was of the view that the appropriate order was a care order. I agree. I am happy to approve both the Care Plan and, insofar as it is a matter for me, the Pathway Plan. I place on record that, although he did not consent to the making of a care order, I was told that Y had &#8220;indicated that he is content with his current placement and is willing to work with professionals going forward, in accordance with the local authority&#8217;s Care and Pathway Plans&#8221;</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My reasons for agreeing that a care order is appropriate are very simple. It will give Y the best chance of obtaining from the local authority, both so long as he remains in care <span style="font-style:italic">and, after he leaves care, in accordance with the &#8216;leaving care&#8217; legislation</span>, the help, the support and the assistance from the local authority which he needs and wants and which, I emphasise, the local authority must provide &#8211; as it has made clear it will. As I said at the hearing, and no-one challenged this, the vital function of the local authority, as Y transitions through to adult life, is not to be a bossy nanny but to provide him with support and services. That is why the order I made contains this recital:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The court expressed the importance of it being explained to [Y] that a care order is not in place in order to place restrictions upon him, but rather to assist him and provide him with practical support during his transition into adulthood.&#8221;</p>
