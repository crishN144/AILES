	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with KF who is aged 34. She has a condition of agenesis of the corpus callosum which causes her to have a learning disability and which has an impact on her capacity to make decisions for herself. On 13 May 2022, HHJ Whybrow considered a report from Dr Mynors-Wallis, Consultant Psychiatrist, dated 2 May 2022, and concluded on an interim basis that KF had capacity to engage in sexual relations but that she lacked capacity in respect of the conduct of the proceedings, to manage her property and affairs and to make decisions about residence, care and contact with others. He made declarations accordingly.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I understand that KF has had two children in the past but they are no longer in her care. More recently, KF has been in a long term relationship with KW. Following events that I shall describe more fully later in this judgment, and having made its interim determinations about KF&#8217;s capacity, the court also most recently declared on an interim basis on 13 May 2022 that it was in KF&#8217;s best interests to reside at her current placement and to continue to receive care there, and to have in person contact with KW and two other named persons only in a suitable public place by prior agreement with staff from the placement and on a supervised basis, such supervision to be undertaken by an appropriate representative of the placement. That order was agreed by the parties.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to those best interest declarations is one of violence perpetrated by KW against KF. The evidence provided to this court shows that during the course of their relationship, KW would encourage KF to have sex with other men. In September 2020, one of these men had sex, including anal sex, with KF over a three day period. The fact that they had anal sex caused KW to become offended and angry so that, whilst he himself had sex with KF, in his anger he &#8220;fisted&#8221; KW causing tears to her vagina such that she required hospitalisation, the administration of two units of blood, and suturing. Such was the loss of blood that the evidence suggests that without emergency treatment, KF could have died. Nevertheless, after a period of separation, KF returned to live with KW. In December 2021, the police were advised of an incident at KW&#8217;s flat when he had lost his temper and slapped KF to the face. In January 2022, KW again assaulted KF and she moved into emergency accommodation. Shortly afterwards she moved back in with KW. Shortly thereafter, whilst she was lying in bed, KW entered the room and placed one of his hands onto KF&#8217;s throat. Police disclosure reveals a number of incidents of verbal aggression by KW to KF and adult social services have had serious concerns about KW exercising coercion and control over KF, including taking her money and using it for his own purposes, and overbearing her decision-making. Earlier this year KF was moved from the accommodation she had shared with KW to her current care home placement.</p>

There is clearly a significant overlap with decision that KF wants to live with KW and KW is the person she wants to have the most contact with.  I will not repeat the information from the section on capacity to make decision about residence.  It is my opinion that KF is not able to weigh up the reasonably foreseeable consequence that she might be assaulted by KW if she has contact with him or be the victim of financial and emotional abuse.  She is therefore, in my opinion, unable to weigh up the risks and benefits.&#8221;</p>

I do not know whether conditions were sought, but rejected by the court, or whether they were not sought. Whatever the reasons, there are no conditions on KW&#8217;s bail and so, were it not for the proceedings in the Court of Protection, KF would not have been afforded any protection against KW pending his sentence for his violent assault on her.</p>

The only statutory test is in relation to the ability to decide. In the context of sexual relations, the other vocabulary that has developed around the MCA, of &#8220;person-specific&#8221;, &#8220;act-specific&#8221;, &#8220;situation-specific&#8221; and &#8220;issue-specific&#8221;, should not be permitted to detract from that statutory test, though it may helpfully be used to identify a particular feature of the matter in respect of which a decision is to be made in an individual case. For instance, &#8220;the matter&#8221; in this case cannot be described as being &#8220;person-specific&#8221; as there is no identified person with whom  JB  wishes to engage in sexual relations.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[71] Where the matter relates to sexual relations, it will ordinarily be formulated in a non-specific way because, in accordance with ordinary human experience, it will involve a forward-looking evaluation directed to the nature of the activity rather than to the identity of the sexual partner. Moreover, &#8220;[to] require the issue of capacity to be considered in respect of every person with whom P contemplated sexual relations would not only be impracticable but would also constitute a great intrusion into P&#8217;s private life&#8221; (emphasis added): see A Local Authority v TZ <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2013/2322" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCOP 2322" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCOP 2322</ref>, para 23. A general non-specific formulation of &#8220;the matter&#8221; is also informed by considerations of pragmatism, as recognised by Sir Brian Leveson P, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, in In re M (An Adult) (Capacity: Consent to Sexual Relations) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/37" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 37" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 37</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] Fam 61" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] Fam 61</ref>, para 77. However, I respectfully disagree with the statement (in para 77) that &#8220;capacity to consent to future sexual relations can only be assessed on a general and non-specific basis&#8221; (emphasis added). Pragmatism does not require that consent to future sexual relations can only be assessed on a general and non-specific basis. Furthermore, such a restriction on the formulation of the matter is contrary to the open-textured nature of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2(1)</ref> MCA. A general and non-specific basis is not the only appropriate formulation in respect of sexual relations as even in that context, &#8220;the matter&#8221; can be person-specific where it involves, for instance, sexual relations between a couple who have been in a long-standing relationship where one of them develops dementia or sustains a significant traumatic brain injury. It could also be person-specific in the case of sexual relations between two individuals who are mutually attracted to one another but who both have impairments of the functioning of their minds.</p>

Moreover, the practicable steps which must be taken to help P under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> MCA may be informed by whether &#8220;the matter&#8221; in relation to sexual relations may be described as person-specific. For instance, it might be possible to help P to understand the response of one potential sexual partner in circumstances where he will remain unable to understand the diverse responses of many hypothetical sexual partners. Furthermore, if the matter can be described as person-specific then the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or another (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(4)</ref>(a) MCA and para 73 below) may be different. There may, for example, be no reasonably foreseeable consequence of a sexually transmitted disease in a long-standing monogamous relationship where one partner has developed dementia. Finally, the potential for &#8220;serious grave consequences&#8221; may also differ (see para 74 below).</p>

I understand that an activity in a public place followed by a meal at a restaurant have been arranged. Other arrangements for after the meal could be made.

I am concerned that KF&#8217;s wishes and feelings are still influenced by her long relationship with KW during which he has coerced and controlled her and overborne her decision-making. The circumstances of the sexual assault on KF also give rise to concern that KW could again &#8220;lash out&#8221;, as KF put it. If they were to meet in private now it would be on the eve of his possible incarceration for the assault on KF. KW&#8217;s mood might well be unpredictable. He might again become angry and take that out on KF. There is at least a risk that this might happen. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court has already made an interim declaration that KF lacks capacity to make decisions about contact with others. There is no new evidence nor any change in circumstances that would lead me to reach a different decision on that issue. The expert medical evidence is that KF lacks capacity to retain information about past assaults on her by KW and the risk of further assaults on her from him. Although Dr Mynors-Wallis did not take that into account in relation to decision making about contact with others, but only in relation to decision making about residence, it seems to me to be highly relevant to the issue of capacity in relation to contact with others. In any event, Dr Mynors-Wallis has also advised that KF is unable to weigh up the risks and benefits of contact with KW. Hence, if the matter for decision is framed as one of contact with KW, then I have no hesitation in concluding that KF lacks capacity to make that decision as has been previously determined on an interim basis. </p>

Sexual intimacy is a form of contact with another or others. If, however, the matter for decision is framed as engagement in sexual relations then I have to have regard to Dr Mynors-Wallis&#8217; opinion and the court&#8217;s previous declaration, on an interim basis, that KF has capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations. On the other hand, Dr Mynors-Wallis has concluded in his addendum report that KF lacks capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations with KW. Are those legitimate and persuasive conclusions?

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The application before this court concerns a person-specific decision about sexual relations. As Lord Stephens said in <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span>, even though decisions about engagement in sexual relations are usually assessed on a general or non-specific basis, the &#8220;matter&#8221; for decision may be framed as person-specific. Lord Stephens gave examples of when the &#8220;matter&#8221; might be framed as person-specific. His examples were not exhaustive and he emphasised the need for pragmatism. In the present case, KF does not want to make decisions about having sexual relations in general, she wants to have (the opportunity for) sexual relations with KW and for that to occur within the next few days, prior to his likely incarceration. Information relevant to that specific decision includes information about the history and nature of the relationship between KF and KW. KW has been violent to KF in that relationship and has perpetrated sexual violence against her. KF is at specific risk of harm or assault by KW including in a sexual context. That risk is a foreseeable consequence of KF&#8217;s decision-making about having sexual relations with KW. Dr Mynors-Wallis had already advised that KF cannot retain information about KW&#8217;s past assaults on her or the risk that KW will assault her again. That is information relevant to the matter for decision, particularly given the nature and circumstances of the most serious assault by KW on KF, which was a sexual assault. Dr Mynors-Wallis also advises, that KF cannot weigh or use the foreseeable consequences of deciding to have sexual relations with KW, which include the risk of assault from him as has happened in the past. Dr Mynors-Wallis&#8217; previous report approached the matter for decision as general &#8211; the capacity to engage in sexual relations. He has now considered capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations in a person-specific context and, unsurprisingly given his previously expressed opinions, concludes that KF lacks capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations with KW.</p>

In my judgment, alongside the relevant information set out in <span style="font-style:italic">JB </span>(above), the information relevant to that decision in this case includes that KW has sexually assaulted KF previously, that the assault was very harmful to KF, whether further sexual intimacy between KF and KW gives rise to a risk of a further assault on KF and/or harm to her, the degree of that risk, the consequence if it should materialise, and the means by which the risk could be mitigated. KF is unable to retain, and weigh or use the relevant information.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note Baker J&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v TZ</span> (No. 2) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/973" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 973" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 973</ref>, [2014] COPLR 159, in which he found that whilst P had capacity to engage in sexual relations, he did not have capacity to make a decision whether or not an individual with whom he may wish to have sexual relations was safe. Baker J then considered whether P had &#8220;the capacity to make a decision as to the support he requires when having contact with an individual with whom he may wish to have sexual relations.&#8221; That judgment shows not only that there can be a refinement of the general capacity to make decisions to engage in sexual relations, but also that in an appropriate case, when P has capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations, the court may consider whether P has capacity to decide what support they may need when having contact that may lead to sexual relations. In the present case, however, the matter in question is person-specific and I have decided that KF lacks capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations with KW. She cannot be supported to have safe sex with him. However, for completeness, I record that I am satisfied on the evidence that KF lacks capacity to make decisions about support required to keep her safe when having any form of contact with KW. The information relevant to that decision includes the risk to KW from contact with KW, which KF is unable to retain, and weigh or use. KW has been given notice of these proceedings but has not engaged in them. I do not know what he would say about the risk of him causing harm to KF or what reliable assurances he might give about not having sexual relations with her if afforded unsupervised contact time. There may be work that could be done with him if he were available and willing. There may be longer term work that can be done with KF about keeping herself safe when having contact with KW or others. But the particular circumstances of this application do not allow time for that kind of long-term support. The application is for a specific, one-off contact with a specific person. For the avoidance of doubt, I find that KF does not have capacity to make decisions about what kind of support might be required and when, during unsupervised contact with KW.</p>

The court cannot consent to sexual relations on behalf of a person. If someone had sexual relations with KF without her consent it would be an assault. Sexual intercourse without her consent would be rape. Therefore, having decided that KF lacks capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations with KW, the court cannot decide that it is in her best interests to have sexual relations with him. </p>

KW is liable imminently to be imprisoned. He says he wants to have sex with KF. Their mutual desire to have sex means that there would be a significant risk that, whatever promises were made in advance, if they met in private without supervision, sexual intercourse or other sexual relations would occur.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In principle, support could be offered to KF before and during private, unsupervised contact with KW in an attempt to keep her safe but in my judgment such support would be impractical and could not effectively keep her safe. Given an interim finding that KF lacks capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations with KW, support would have to be provided to prevent sexual relations with KW taking place. However, any effective support arrangements would rely on KF seeking support or help at an appropriate time and KF cannot weigh and use relevant information about the risk of harm to her from sexual relations with KW. She wants to have sexual relations with KW and could not be relied upon to seek support to prevent that happening. I have no information about the reliability of KW to stop sexual relations occurring. I also have to consider the practicality of preventing physical or emotional harm to KF including by KW coercing or controlling her when in private and unsupervised. By the time any alarm was raised, harm may well already have been caused. In any event it would be unreasonable to expect support workers to enter a hotel room to intervene to prevent sexual intimacy or physical harm. I cannot see any role for support in the circumstances of this case such that it would be in KF&#8217;s best interests to allow unsupervised contact in a private place with KW, whether overnight or at all.</p>

I therefore endorse the best interests declarations made previously by the court. </p>

KW has not been reliable in attending, but such contact has been controllable and has not caused harm to KF. Mindful of the potential difficulties in drawing the line between affection and sexual relations, I nevertheless see no reason why it would be contrary to KF&#8217;s best interests to accede to her wish to kiss and cuddle KW during a final supervised contact in a public place. Fully aware that KW has caused significant harm to KF in the past, I nevertheless have no substantial concerns for KF&#8217;s safety if they are allowed to kiss and cuddle in a public place with support workers supervising nearby. Their meeting this week, which may be their last and which I hope KW will attend, can be meaningful to them, but it must be supervised and in a public place such as a park, caf&#233; or restaurant.</p>
