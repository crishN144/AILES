It was sad to see the antipathy between the parties, which I am convinced has been significantly exacerbated by these proceedings which commenced as long ago as September 2021. W was at times visibly emotional, but I am sure H, although more collected, has also been impacted by the litigation and the breakdown of the marriage. The children, I am told, have suffered, and in my judgment a clean break is vital. For W, there is a tangible sense of loss as she exits the marriage, the family business and the lifestyle. As to their evidence generally, I felt that at times W was a little unrealistic about the lost marital standard of living which she wants to replicate as much as possible. H was somewhat evasive and legalistic about his trust interests, deferring to the trustees&#8217; &#8220;brick wall&#8221; replies without focusing on the realities of what is needed here.</p>

W&#8217;s family member invested in the business and holds a minority stake. Although the business has had a variety of interests, its core is a luxury beachfront hotel on an island (Country B). The original funding was provided by H&#8217;s family, and W added thereto with assets of her own. W describes the business as a way of life for them, which I consider to be an accurate assessment. It was the centre of the marriage and the family. Broadly, W was responsible for sales and marketing, and H oversaw operations. They worked together on strategy, ideas, and general decision making. I am satisfied that it has taken a great deal of hard work by both of them to build the business over many years.</p>

Additionally, in the last 7 years the total dividends paid from the business to the owning trust was about $1m, or approximately $150,000pa. H says that for the year Jan 2019 to Jan 2020 (the last full year before separation), the family&#8217;s personal expenditure was just over &#163;500,000, and he produces a schedule to corroborate that figure. In addition to these sums, I am satisfied that the business met certain expenses direct, such as first class and business flights where the foreign travel might be deemed to be for research purposes, occasional holidays, life insurance, health insurance and some miscellaneous smaller items.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.61in;margin-right:0.11in">It strikes me that this is not the whole picture of the lifestyle enjoyed by the parties. They had during the marriage the use and enjoyment of magnificent properties and opportunities which cannot readily be measured in economic terms. They used their homes in Country A and Country C. They travelled internationally. They used the luxury hotels owned by the business for personal enjoyment and pleasure, enjoying all the facilities and activities. This enabled them to entertain and mix with wealthy guests who invited them for reciprocal holidays. Their house in City A is cheap by English standards but is on a prestigious estate, with ample room and facilities. The classical property in Country C, to which they are both attached, is spectacular, but again modest in value. It has land on which there is a farm and winery, and was used by the family for frequent entertaining. They had the benefit of full-time staff at their properties; for example, the cost of staffing the property in Country C is about &#163;50,000 pa.</p>

The reasons for this are many. In the first place there is likely to be no obvious market for a private company. Second, even where valuers use the same method of valuation they are likely to produce widely differing results. Third, the profitability of private companies may be volatile, such that a snap-shot valuation at a particular date may give an unfair picture. Fourth, the difference in quality between a value attributed to a private company on the basis of opinion evidence and a sum in hard cash is obvious. Fifth, the acid test of any valuation is exposure to the real market, which is simply not possible in the case of a private company where no one suggests that it should be sold.

Again, I emphasise, this is not to mandate a particular structure but to draw attention to the need to address this issue when the court is deciding how to exercise its discretionary powers so as to achieve an outcome that is fair to both parties.

It was considered in 2013 but not progressed, as it was not thought to be viable. A residential development is high risk in Country B, there is no freehold tenure on the land, and there is no evidence that planning would be granted. It is in a conservation area which complicates the position. The parties cannot agree precisely on the size of the area; either 2.5 or 4.5 hectares. A property valuer has reported in the alternative and put the value at either $107,000 or $167,000. The SJE has incorporated the lower figure (subject to a 30% discount). The figure is de minimis and I propose simply to split the difference (allowing the 30% discount), which must be added to the SJE business figure of $11.688m. That gives a total of $11,709,000.</p>

It was bought in 2018 for $978,000. The parties intended to open a hotel there in 2024. It was planned to be a different offering from the main hotel; smaller, less premium, with fewer facilities. Mr Caldwell proceeded on that basis and factored in potential revenue from the proposed development. Shortly after he first reported, H told him that it was unworkable for funding and other reasons, and that he did not intend to go through with the development. That had a knock-on effect for the report which was predicated on the assumption that Hotel N should be included as an income-generative prospect. The consequence was that the business valuation dropped from $12,784,108 to the current figure, a reduction in value of about $1m. Mr Caldwell has valued Hotel N at the net asset figure attributable in the accounts of $295,878 rather than on an income approach.</p>

In her view, H would not treat her well, and would make her life too difficult. She told me it would be too big a risk for her. I observed the ill-will between the parties. Time, and the conclusion of the proceedings, might be a mitigating factor in the future, but there is at present no love lost between them. H fears that their personal warfare could turn into corporate warfare if W were to set up a nearby hotel. I bear in mind that the children have suffered as a result of the breakdown of the marriage. For their sake, in my judgment a clean break in every sense is desirable. The relationship between their parents risks, I consider, continuing to be poisonous if they are locked in commercial competition on the same small island (Country B), looking towards similar markets and working with the same agents.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.61in;margin-right:0.1in">Mr Caldwell was cross examined on this issue at some length by both parties. He says that the 10-year forecast is occupancy at 55%, and that between 2015 and 2019 the actual occupancy rate was 50-56%. He recognises it was 67% in 2022, but says that was due to carry over from Covid, and in any event these were Country A tourists who pay less than Americans and Europeans. In 2023, the average occupancy rate was 57%. This included February, March, and part of April when the hotel was struck by a cyclone/tropical storm, and numbers were low as a result of closures, but it was low season and the forecasted occupancy was not much higher; in any event, if one excludes those three months, the average is about 60%. It is because of the updated 2023 information that Mr Caldwell revised his assumption from 55% to 60%. It was suggested to him that he should have carried out a weighted average on a monthly basis which, so it was said, would have captured higher room rates in high season. But he was never asked to do this in his reports, it was put for the first time when he was in the witness box, and in any event, I consider that his approach of doing annual averages fairly captures the highs and lows.</p>

By that process local corporation tax in Country B was reduced. The scheme was then suspended because of legal requirements by the Country B Central Bank for a formal consultancy contract to be prepared. It is no longer an allowable deduction, such that the profitability of the business has been reduced.

H was asked about this in the witness box. He was at best confused, and at worst evasive. He denied that he had seen the letters of wishes for this trust and Trust Y, but accepted that copies were kept in a cupboard in the  property in Country C; this did not really make sense to me, although I add that W appears to have obtained copies herself after separation and asked questions of H without disclosing the fact that she had the documents, contrary to well-established <span style="font-weight:bold">Imerman </span>principles. H seemed reluctant to acknowledge the obvious, namely a greater sum potentially available to him as discretionary beneficiary in a substantial trust as a result of his mother&#8217;s death. He repeatedly told me that it is a discretionary trust, which is self-evident, as if that fact alone meant his interest was unaffected by his mother&#8217;s death. I am satisfied he had always known he would benefit upon his mother&#8217;s death in that his notional allocation would increase. To say, as he did, that he thought her death had no impact on the trust was little short of ridiculous. W told me, and I accept, that it was well known within the family what would happen, in general terms, on H&#8217;s mother&#8217;s death. She also told me that it was well understood the trusts were there to support the family which, at one level, is a statement of the obvious, but I did not detect H truly acknowledging this.</p>

After deducting the &#163;4.45m of loans already received by him, his &#8220;headroom&#8221; of unapplied funds forming part of his notional allocation is about &#163;5.8m. I say &#8220;notional&#8221; as the trustees may decide not to effect a formal partition or sub-fund arrangement, but the principles are clear. In passing, I note that H has in the past received distributions of &#163;400,000 which might reduce the notional sum of &#163;10.26m, but the figure is relatively modest in the context of the case, and no clear evidence was provided by H or the trustees on this.</p>

H, by contrast, puts forward properties in Fulham and the Home Counties at up to &#163;1.75m which are of a similar size but in cheaper locations. The fund for housing in Country C which W suggests is higher than the value of the property in Country C as a result of her intending to purchase in a different area; H puts forward properties in Country C at about &#8364;200,000.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.61in;margin-right:0.1in">I have taken all matters into account when considering housing. In my judgment, the claim for three properties is manifestly excessive. The family had two homes during the marriage (Country A and Country C) with a combined worth of about &#163;1.2m. To seek properties in those countries as well as a &#163;4m home in London is untenable. It is W&#8217;s choice to come to London, and in principle it is not unreasonable for her to do so. She has friends and family here, and all the children are studying at school or university in England or Country D. She feels safe and secure here. The difficulty, it seems to me, is that she is endeavouring, as far as possible, to replicate her previous lifestyle in Country C and Country A while in addition having what she says would be her number one priority, a family home for her and all the children in London, which she intends to have as her permanent home. She cannot have it all. By choosing to input so much of her award into a &#163;4m property in London, it is inevitable that her ability to spend as freely as she would like will be curtailed. She is electing to prioritise housing over lifestyle; that seems to me to be the inevitable consequence of her decision to move to London. Had she elected to make her main base in, say, Country A, she would have had far greater funds available for a second home and her income requirements.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.61in;margin-right:0.11in">&#163;250,000pa. I bear in mind the marital standard of living, and I consider her likely expenditure will be higher in the next few years while the children still make a base with her. But the marriage has come to an end and circumstances have changed; her housing sum is so much greater than the value of the marital homes that her income needs are necessarily circumscribed. I also consider that the housing sum contains within it the possibility, if she chooses, of selling a property and/or trading down to release funds when she gets much older. She will not have to, but it is open to her to do so up to a figure of, in my view, about &#163;750,000 (leaving &#163;2.5m on current figures for her subsequent property). On balance, it seems to me that an appropriate figure for her income needs is &#163;250,000pa until she is age 65, decreasing by 20% thereafter. That, per a Capitalise calculation, is about &#163;4.5m. Should she choose to spend some of that on housing (main home and, if she wishes, a second home), that is a matter for her; it is not for me to dictate how she in fact spends her money. If she does release funds from her property in due course (perhaps &#163;750,000) as I have suggested, then she will be able to spend more on her income needs.</p>
