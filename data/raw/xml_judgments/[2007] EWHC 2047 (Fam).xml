They met in this country in 1988 and married (in this country) in 1992. They have two children, both born in this country: a son L born in 1996 and another son, A, born in 2000. The husband &#8211; he is a medical doctor &#8211; moved to Greece to work in October 2002. The wife and the two children followed in December 2002. The husband accepts that the move to Greece was initially for a &#8216;trial&#8217; period of one year, later extended, he says, by mutual agreement. The wife says that it was a temporary relocation, capable of termination at any time. Be that as it may, both children went to school in Greece, L starting school in January 2003 and A beginning at nursery in September 2003 and joining L at his school in September 2006. They remained there until this year. On 31 January 2007 the wife returned to this country with the two children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The original matrimonial home had been a house in Holland Park which the husband had bought before the marriage. In 1996 that property was sold and the parties bought a house in Chiswick. In September 2000 the husband&#8217;s employment took him to Norfolk. They let the Chiswick property to tenants and bought a house in Norwich. Following the move to Greece that also was let. The tenancy agreement dated 22 November 2002 shows the husband and wife&#8217;s address as being in Greece. The property was re-let to new tenants in June 2003. The tenancy agreement dated 26 June 2003 again shows the husband and wife&#8217;s address as being in Greece. The Chiswick property was re-let to new tenants in September 2006. When the wife and children came back to this country on 31 January 2007 both properties were still tenanted, though the wife had on 3 January 2007 given the agents instructions to serve notice to quit on the tenants of the Chiswick property. The notice was given the following day (4 January 2007) in terms permitting the wife to reoccupy the property with the children from 3 March 2007.</p>

That matter came before Sumner J, who by an order dated 21 June 2007 dismissed the application. A subsequent application for permission to appeal was refused by the Court of Appeal on 31 July 2007. Nothing turns on any of this except that in his judgment (<span style="font-style:italic">Marinos v Marinos </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2007/1404" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 1404 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 1404 (Fam)</ref>) Sumner J recorded (at para [9]) as being common ground between the parties that the children had been habitually resident in Greece when they left in January 2007 and found (at para [14]) that the wife&#8217;s return alone to this country with the children and her remaining here with the children was with the husband&#8217;s consent.</p>

I heard oral evidence from both the wife and the husband. Save in point of detail the oral evidence added little to what had been said in the parties&#8217; affidavits. The wife reiterated that she had not seen the move to Greece as permanent and that she had always considered this country to be her home. Greece was not her home, it was somewhere she was staying. All her ties were here. The only thing that attached her to Greece was the children. She reiterated that she was the children&#8217;s primary carer and described them as &#8220;the centre of my life &#8211; they are very, very important to me.&#8221; She accepted that she was in Greece slightly more than in this country and said &#8220;I would consider myself resident in both countries.&#8221; She accepted that the children had been habitually resident in Greece until 31 January 2007. The husband in his oral evidence said that his wife had had difficulty settling in Greece. He suspected that she was not happy in Greece and said he was not surprised that she did not consider Greece her home.</p>

However, although not applicable under the 1968 Brussels Convention, particular account was taken of the definition given on numerous occasions by the Court of Justice, i.e. &#8216;the place where the person had established, on a fixed basis, his permanent or habitual centre of interests, with all the relevant facts being taken into account for the purpose of determining such residence&#8217;. Other proposals were therefore rejected whereby it would be sufficient for the applicant to have his or her habitual residence there for a total of at least one year in the five years immediately before the application was made, even when combined with nationality or &#8216;domicile&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

In deciding where the habitual centre of someone&#8217;s interests has been established, one has to have regard to the context. Many of the ECJ cases to which I have referred are cases where what was in issue was the entitlement of a worker to social security benefit. So the claimant&#8217;s place of work was obviously an important factor in ascertaining the location for that purpose of the habitual centre of his interests. Here, in contrast, the issue is as to the identification of the court (or courts) which have jurisdiction in relation to family matters, specifically, in the context of Article 3 of the Regulation, in relation to matters of divorce, legal separation or annulment. So the place where the matrimonial home is to be found, the place where the family lives, <span style="font-style:italic">qua </span>family, is equally obviously an important factor in ascertaining the location for that rather different purpose of the habitual centre of a spouse&#8217;s interests.</p>

In neither case is there any analysis of the actual language used in the Regulation.

(And neither discussion, incidentally, considers any of the ECJ case-law.) In my judgment, and despite distinguished assumption to the contrary, the Regulation means what it says. &#8220;Resided&#8221; means just that.

At the time of the family&#8217;s move to Greece she was on leave of absence from her employment. She returned to work with BA in July 2003, working on a 33&#8531;% contract &#8211; that is, working three weeks out of nine. On 1 August 2006 BA confirmed by e-mail that she would temporarily change to a 50% contract &#8211; that is, working four weeks out of eight &#8211; for six months with effect from 13 September 2006. She returned to a 33&#8531;% contract on 24 March 2007. At all times the home base for her employment with BA has been at Heathrow. She has been paid in England, though as her payslips from March 2006 through to 28 February 2007 show (these are the only ones I have seen) she was treated by Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue &amp; Customs as non-resident in this country for income tax purposes.</p>

While over here studying for the LPC the wife generally stayed with her parents in Uttoxeter, which was obviously convenient for Birmingham. While over here working for BA she would either live in a hotel close to Heathrow or, at least once during each three or four week period, with her parents.

The impression one derives from all three letters from HMRC is that HMRC had been told only fairly recently of the wife&#8217;s return to this country. Certainly none of the letters suggests that HMRC had been told as long ago as the autumn of 2006. What is clear &#8211; and in all the circumstances most informative &#8211; is the fact, as we have seen, that BA was still treating her as non-resident as late as 28 February 2007. I strongly suspect that HMRC was first told what had happened sometime between the end of February 2007 and late April or early May 2007.

As against this, he says, the various matters on which the wife relies are insufficient, whether taken individually or collectively, for her to have been habitually resident in this country, quantitatively or qualitatively. As Mr Allen puts the point, it is inherently unlikely that the wife&#8217;s habitual residence has been throughout in this country if the children were living in, indeed habitually resident in Greece, not least given that, as she has been at pains to point out in her evidence, and as she repeated to me in the witness box, she has always been the children&#8217;s primary carer.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Castle&#8217;s response to all this is that the wife&#8217;s use of her Greek address is counter-balanced by her use of her address in this country, that one joint savings account in Greece does not significantly affect the overall picture, that non-resident tax status is determined by a mathematical calculation of nights spent in the UK and is not determinative of habitual residence and that the crucial question is not where the family &#8220;home&#8221; was located but, rather, where the wife&#8217;s centre of interests was located. Obviously, as he accepts, the location of a person&#8217;s family, and of the family home, is highly relevant, but it is not determinative of where that person is habitually resident, especially when, as here, that person is in stable employment in another Member State. So the fact that the wife relocated to this country, whether in the summer of 2006, as she would have it, or on 31 January 2007, does not detract from her case that her centre of interests remained here throughout. Relocation of the family home here is not, he says, the same as a change of habitual residence, nor is it inconsistent with there having been prior residence here. And so far as the increase in her BA contract from 33&#8531;% to 50% is concerned, what is important, he says, is not so much the date &#8211; 13 September 2006 &#8211; when the new arrangements came into effect but the date &#8211; 1 August 2006 &#8211; when BA signified its agreement to the change. </p>

And in many cases the mere fact that a spouse has for many years crossed the border from one Member State to another to get from his home to his place of work will make not the slightest difference. In this context at least, a husband who lives with his wife and children in Kent is surely habitually resident in this country and not in France even though he has for many years been commuting by Eurostar to his place of work with a French employer in the Pas de Calais.

That is, indeed, what I find. She had a place of residence in both countries &#8211; in Greece the matrimonial home, in this country the room kept for her exclusive use in her parents&#8217; house &#8211; and she spent roughly equal amounts of time in both countries, albeit that on balance she probably spent rather more time in Greece than in this country. The wife described herself in her evidence, both to me as previously to Sumner J, as considering herself resident in both countries.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question to be determined is the location of the habitual centre of the wife&#8217;s interests. The difficulty is presented by the fact that whereas the centre of many of her interests was indubitably this country, the centre of at least some of her interests was equally obviously Greece. On the one hand the centre of her employment and education interests was plainly in this country, the land of her birth, the country to which she retained the emotional commitment which she never had to Greece, and the country with which she retained all the other links identified by Mr Castle. As against that, the centre of her emotional, personal and family interests was equally plainly Greece, the country where her children lived &#8211; the children who not surprisingly were, in her own words, &#8220;the centre of my life.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of the day all these various factors, some pointing in one direction, some in the other, have to be balanced and evaluated with a view to identifying <span style="font-style:italic">the </span>habitual centre of the wife&#8217;s interests. One cannot, as it seems to me, say <span style="font-style:italic">a priori </span>that any one factor is of more or less intrinsic weight than another. How the balance comes to be struck must depend upon all the factors in issue in the particular case, the task for the judge being to attribute to each of those factors the weight which in his estimation attaches to it in the particular circumstances of the particular case. In one case the factor of employment may weigh more heavily than in another superficially similar case. In another case the location of the matrimonial home may carry particular weight.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Acknowledging that the factors which are in play in this case point very sharply to starkly opposing conclusions, and recognising that they are, when all is said and done, very evenly balanced, I am nonetheless persuaded that the overall balance points to this country as being <span style="font-style:italic">the </span>habitual centre of the wife&#8217;s interests. Evaluating all those interests together and in the round, the centre of gravity is located in this country and not in Greece. If the wife was a mother she was also a career woman, and if her children were in Greece both her current career and her planned future career were in this country. </p>

On this basis she was entitled to petition in this country when she issued her petition on 1 February 2007.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Even if I am wrong in this, there is, in my judgment, another basis upon which the wife is entitled to succeed. She was, for the reasons I have already given, resident in this country at all times from September 2004 onwards, in particular, resident in this country for at least six months before she issued her petition on 1 February 2007. But she was also, in my judgment, habitually resident in this country on 1 February 2007 even if not before then.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to remember the circumstances in which the wife returned to this country on 31 January 2007. She had severed her links with Greece. She was returning to this country with her children, intending to make it her, and their, permanent home. She had arranged schools for them and taken steps to obtain early vacant possession of the Chiswick property. Moreover, and as Sumner J found, she and the children came with the husband&#8217;s consent, not merely consent to them coming over here but consent to them staying here. I can see no reason why, in these circumstances, she did not immediately acquire a habitual residence in this country upon her return here on 31 January 2007 even if, immediately prior to that, she was in fact habitually resident in Greece.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is of course trite learning under our domestic law that although habitual residence can be lost in a day it cannot be gained in a day. There must be an appreciable period of residence before it becomes habitual, though that period need not be very long. It can certainly be measured in weeks rather than in months and in an appropriate case it can probably be measured in nothing more than days. But here, of course, we are concerned with a period of less than 24 hours, for the wife returned on 31 January 2007 and issued her petition the following day.</p>

As Singer J said, and I agree, so far as concerns the Regulation one can in appropriate circumstances establish habitual residence very quickly, in my judgment very quickly indeed. As the Court said in <span style="font-style:italic">Swaddling v Adjudication Officer (<ref href="#" uk:canonical="Case C-90/97" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">Case C-90/97</ref>) </span>[1999] ECR 1-01075, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 184" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 184</ref>, at para [30], the length of residence is not an intrinsic element of the concept of habitual residence in this context. </p>

In a situation such as that in which the wife found herself on 31 January 2007 there is nothing in Community law to prevent the conclusion that just as (on this hypothesis) she lost her habitual residence in Greece as the aircraft in which she and the children were travelling took off from Greece, in the same way she acquired a new habitual residence in this country as the aircraft touched down at Heathrow.</p>
