	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with W, who is nearly two years of age.  On 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July of last year an interim care order was made on the basis of issues in relation to domestic abuse, breach of a safety plan, and unexplained injuries.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset of the proceedings the parents sought for W to return to their respective care.  They maintained they were no longer in a relationship and were in competition with one another.  I note that father applied, pursuant to Part 25, for a psychological assessment and residential assessment.  That initially was adjourned, but ultimately refused.  By order of 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2023, an application for an independent social work assessment was granted.  A subsequent issues resolution hearing was not effective because the local authority failed at that time to file their final evidence.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are a number of additional pieces of evidence within the proceedings, more notably in relation to a series of reports from Lextox in relation to the father which confirms that he has desisted and abstained from alcohol.  They are dated 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2023, 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2023, and 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2024.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a report from the Community Mental Health Team for father, which states he has a mental and behavioural disorder due to alcohol dependency syndrome.  He also has emotionally unstable personality disorder, depression, PTSD, and possible sociative disorder.   However, at the time of that report there were no concerns.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a report from CDL in relation to the father, which records positive engagement, and various alcohol tests from January to April 2023 which were negative, and the case was closed.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a very favourable report from Hampton Property Management, which says the father has undertaken a remarkable transformation with regard to his mental health and alcohol intake.  I note that there are some historic police disclosure of incidents from 2021 and 2022 in relation to alleged assaults.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the mother, at the outset she accepted that the child sustained a bruise in her care, where she says he hit his head on a wooden block, which she witnessed.  She states that the relationship with the father was abusive, and the father had a drinking issue.  I note that the mother&#8217;s own GP report confirms that she has a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, PTSD which are due to adverse childhood experiences, which has included suicide attempts.  She is also a victim of domestic abuse.  </p>

	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mother&#8217;s position for this hearing is that she accepts that the child would not be safe in her care, and therefore does not actively challenge the local authority&#8217;s plans, and that is to her credit.  If possible, she would like the child to remain in long-term foster care with his current carer, with whom W has remained throughout, but accepts that this may not be possible due his young age.  She accepts that she has not been open and honest with regard to her relationship with the father, and that her mental health has fluctuated.  She herself acknowledges that W would be at risk in father&#8217;s care, and she recognised that she needs to break the hold that she says father has on her.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have read the parenting assessments in support of the mother.  The initial report says there was some concerns as to the impact of domestic abuse upon her mental health and her parenting, and it recommended that she needs to undertake work in relation to her relationship choices, and access support with regard to her mental health.   She has a limited support network and would need a robust support plan.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The addendum parenting report proposes a transition rehabilitation plan over six weeks, which would be community-based.  Sadly, a further addendum report of 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2024 is negative on the basis that it would appear that she was unable to prioritise W as she remained in a relationship with the father, which she concealed from the local authority.  Therefore, concerns remain as to her ability to protect W from risky adults.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This issue with regard to the parents&#8217; relationship, and effectively the cessation of the transition plan, is reflected in the order of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2024, where mum was arrested for drink driving on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2024.  Subsequently, no further action was taken with regard to that.  The transition plan was halted, and contact reverted to being fully supervised.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was on that occasion that the mother believed it was the father who had notified the police.  The police disclosure refers to an anonymous referral where the referer gave the URN and mother&#8217;s address.  The local authority therefore sought analysis of the parents&#8217; phones, the issue being one of honesty around their relationship.  By way of order of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2024 I made a mobile phone disclosure order, with negative inferences to be drawn if the father failed to co-operate.  At that hearing I also dismissed the father&#8217;s application for an independent social work assessment. </p>

	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the last hearing before myself the local authority sought to conclude matters on the basis of submissions, as did the mother and the children&#8217;s guadian.  Father&#8217;s counsel submitted that he had been candid about his history, but has made progress and demonstrated significant change, namely, abstinence from alcohol and his mental health was stable.  He wished to challenge the assessment of him, which is the reason why the application for an independent social assessment was dismissed, and wished to challenge the evidence of the social worker by way of cross-examination, a position that I acceded to given that the local authority&#8217;s plan in this case is one of placement for adoption.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s contention is that he has maintained and evidenced change which has not been addressed by the social worker.  Therefore, on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2024 I listed this matter for a final hearing today, with a witness template to ensure the matter was dealt with within three hours which, to their credit, everybody has abided by.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_17">
	  <num>17.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s position is that his dependence on alcohol has now ceased, his mental health has improved, he accepts he can get emotional, but he wishes to care for W.  The basis of his Part 25 application was for an updated parenting assessment, and at that time he was a back-up to mum&#8217;s rehabilitation plan by way of parallel planning.  He says that the previous assessment of him dated 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2023 was based on historic information going back a significant period of time, that he has made substantial changes to maintain sobriety, and is not confident that the local authority would address this in their final evidence.  </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.59in">&#8220;The paramount consideration for a court when considering the outcome for a child is the child&#8217;s welfare.  It is a principle of the law that the welfare of the child is best met by maintaining the connection with the birth parents to as full extent as possible, and that principle is underpinned by the application of the least interventionist principle enshrined in s.1(6) of the Children Act.  Adhering to those principles reflects the importance of the right to family life set out in Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, and the limited scope of interference with that right as set out in Article 8(2).  Inteference in the right of family life, which is the right both of the parents and the child, is parametered with necessity, proportionality and legality.  As a consequence, the permanent severing of ties between a child and their parents is an outcome only to be ordered in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child&#8217;s welfare.  To arrive at that conclusion, the possibility of parental care with alternative care by members of the wider birth family must be shown to be the options which are not realistic, either by reason of unavailability, they do not exist, or because such that they cannot meet the welfare needs of the child.  The option of parental or family care should not be rejected if identified deficits could be remedied through appropriate and proportionate support provided by the local authority, even if such support will be necessary for an extended period of time.  In order to arrive at a valid conclusion of the child&#8217;s welfare, because the child&#8217;s welfare requires their permanent removal from family care, it is necessary to consider all of the competing options of care to assess their respective strengths or weaknesses, and to look at those options against each other to ensure that every option is fully considered against every other option.  Having done so and identified the outcome most able to meet the welfare needs of the child, it is necessary to consider whether the outcome is itself a proportionate interference with the rights of the child.  </p>

Father&#8217;s opening evidence was that he did not tell the local authority or indeed anybody about it because he knew it would be held against them.   But I am afraid that is not an excuse.  How can the local authority, indeed anybody, work with anyone, if effectively that degree of deception has taken place.  Safety planning requires the parents to buy into it, and a working and open relationship to ensure the safety of the child.  </p>

In other words, there is no compromise, particularly so in the event that the local authority was to disagree with his views in relation to unsupervised contact with the mother.
