Her parents are her main carers, which they undertake with significant commitment and devotion. A measure of this commitment is demonstrated by one of the intensive care consultants reporting how the father set the alarm clock at 2 hour intervals during the night to ensure AB received suctioning at an appropriate frequency. During her stay in hospital they have not left her alone, other than when they took part in these court proceedings. Their dedication to her has been rightly commended by Dr Bell (Consultant, Intensive Care Medicine and Anaesthesia) who was instructed by the OS to prepare a report. Most of the time AB is bed bound, but is able to spend small amounts of time sitting in an especially adapted chair. Her mother reports her having small amounts of deliberate movement in one of her hands. She is fed through a naso-gastric tube and is faecally incontinent. AB is registered blind and is hard of hearing. She is able to communicate in a limited manner through facial expressions and sounds and responds to those she knows well, such as her parents and siblings.</span></p>

She remains on 24 hour non invasive ventilation (NIV) and is currently free from infection, her chest secretions have reduced, her temperature normal as is her white cell count and C-reactive protein. She has reached a stage with her restrictive lung problem that she has chronic respiratory failure and a very limited reserve to maintain her oxygen saturation if she develops any further lung damage. Her condition could very quickly deteriorate. At the moment she requires more oxygen than could be delivered by a home oxygen system. A multi disciplinary meeting to discuss discharge arrangements is arranged to take place in mid August. In his very helpful oral evidence Dr X was clear that upon discharge AB will require an appropriate ventilator, her parents will need to have been trained in the use of that ventilator, and appropriate persons will need to be available to support the use of the ventilator in the event that her parents are not available. Those are matters that will need to be discussed at the forthcoming multi disciplinary meeting.</p>

It is recognised that on the ground difficult professional judgments have to be made, and there will remain truly urgent cases that require applications to be made out of hours. However, I hope the message is clear that in this type of case; where significant medical treatment or withholding of treatment is at issue, or likely to be at issue, applications should be made sooner rather than later. As Mr Sachdeva and Ms Paterson submitted, this will ensure all the necessary safeguards are in place in terms of legal representation and notification to the Press. In addition, the advantages of a hearing taking place in normal court hours includes the court being able to hear parties and evidence in person, and proper recording facilities being in place.</span></p>

They have conducted themselves with great dignity in what was clearly a very distressing situation for them, where the subject matter of the out of hours hearing concerned such an intensely personal subject as to whether their daughter (who they devote such remarkable care to) should have life-sustaining treatment.</span><span/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">They rightly deserve the admiration of the court.</span></p>
