	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 10 October 2019, District Judge Hudd made a final order at the conclusion of a four-day trial of the financial remedy proceedings between the parties. She ordered the husband (as I shall call the applicant) to pay the wife (as I shall call the respondent) &#163;950,000 in a series of lump sums commencing with &#163;150,000 on 1 November 2019, followed by four payments of &#163;200,000 at yearly intervals commencing on 1 November 2020 and ending on 1 November 2023. A pension sharing order of 30% of the husband&#8217;s pension was made. Tapering spousal maintenance in lieu of interest was ordered against the husband until payment of the final lump sum. The husband was ordered to pay child maintenance and school fees for the parties&#8217; two children aged 17 and 15.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The effect of the order was to divide the total assets of &#163;4.75m in the ratio 58%: 42% in the husband&#8217;s favour. The District Judge justified this departure from equality by reference to the husband&#8217;s retention of the most valuable asset - a business providing school meals. The retention of this business by the husband was not controversial &#8211; both parties proposed it in their open offers. This asset predated the marriage and therefore to some extent had a non-matrimonial constituent. The shares in the company were characterised by the judge as having an element of risk and not comparable to cash in the bank. These two reasons justified the departure from equality.</p>

He contended that the arrival of the pandemic was both unforeseen and unforeseeable, and its impact had caused devastating financial consequences which invalidated the fundamental assumptions on which the final order was based. As a result, he claimed that he was unable to discharge his unpaid obligations under the order.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;In applications under rule 9.9A, the starting point is that the order which one party is seeking to have set aside was properly made. A mere allegation that it was obtained by, e.g., non-disclosure, is not sufficient for the court to set aside the order. Only once the ground for setting aside the order has been established (or admitted) can the court set aside the order and rehear the original application for a financial remedy. The court has a full range of case management powers and considerable discretion as to how to determine an application to set aside a financial remedy order, including where appropriate the power to strike out or summarily dispose of an application to set aside. If and when a ground for setting aside has been established, the court may decide to set aside the whole or part of the order there and then, or may delay doing so, especially if there are third party claims to the parties&#8217; assets. Ordinarily, once the court has decided to set aside a financial remedy order, the court would give directions for a full rehearing to re-determine the original application. However, if the court is satisfied that it has sufficient information to do so, it may proceed to re-determine the original application at the same time as setting aside the financial remedy order.&#8221;</p>

Provided that it is not the fault of the person alleging the mistake, it is open to the court to give leave for the matter to be reopened. Although falling within the <span style="font-style:italic">Barder</span> principle it is more akin to the misrepresentation or non-disclosure cases than to <span style="font-style:italic">Barder</span> itself.</p>

Then, provided that the other three conditions are fulfilled, the <span style="font-style:italic">Barder</span> principle may apply. However, the circumstances in which this can happen are very few and far between. The case-law, taken as a whole, does not suggest that the natural processes of price fluctuation, whether in houses, shares or any other property, and however dramatic, fall within this principle.&#8221;</p>

The wife applied for leave to appeal out of time; this came before Hale J in May 1994. By then, the share price had risen to &#163;10.04; this had the effect of leaving the wife with only 20% of the assets. The reason the share price had risen so much was because of shrewd management, the introduction of new products and the exploitation of the U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal from the ERM.

A reasonable but well-informed person may well have given in 2019 a very different answer to the question:</p>

If H wishes to assert that there has been a fundamental change in his worth so as to justify a reopening of the inquiry, then it is up to him to provide prima facie evidence. It is trite to say that the pandemic has affected different sectors in different ways. Some, such as hotels and airlines, which make up part of the wealth of H and his family, will undoubtedly have been negatively affected but so varied are his interests that it is far from obvious that there has been a collapse in his global fortune.&#8221;</p>

However, the business availed itself of the government&#8217;s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (&#8220;the furlough scheme&#8221;) which was introduced in April 2020, and up to 13 June 2021, had received &#163;3.1 million from this source. In addition, it had taken a low interest Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan from the government of &#163;460,000. The accounts show that between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2021, which covers the Covid period, the net assets of the business increased from &#163;939,000 to &#163;1.2 million, and the cash at the bank increased from &#163;830,000 to &#163;1.8 million. </p>

Eating in classrooms, as is now frequently the case seems to be less popular. Secondary school income is down between 20 to 50% with no break or breakfast services. Our labour costs are greater proportionately for less income and this will be the case until at least September. Schools still operate &#8220;bubbles" for year groups and we still have reduced school populations due to year groups being out. Contrary to what C says the company trading in December 2020 does not demonstrate a return to profit. In December 2020 we received income from schools for free school meals that we had not provided as schools depopulated. This source of income is no longer relevant as schools have returned.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In the summer of 2021, the husband produced a cash flow forecast to December 2022, which suggested, if normal trading conditions resumed, that by the end of that month cash at the bank would have risen to &#163;2.4 million. Mr Chandler was astute to disavow this prediction as speculative and inaccurate. However, the second footnote to the forecast states: &#8220;The company has lost 9 schools over the summer but has picked up 12 new units to replace &#8211; no real impact overall on business levels.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This did not suggest that turnover would be reduced once full trading recommenced in the post-Covid era. I therefore conjectured during Mr Chandler&#8217;s submissions that there must be actual forecasts in existence which have at least an attempt at accuracy. Overnight, the husband created a document (&#8220;the husband&#8217;s document&#8221;) which surmised that for the 12 months beginning on 1 October 2021, there would be a 10% reduction in turnover compared to that for 2019, the last full prelapsarian year, and an 8% general increase in the cost of food supplies and catering labour. The document also surmised that in that period it would be possible to reduce administrative expenses by 25%. The result of the decrease in turnover and the increase in costs would be to reduce an operating profit of &#163;734,000 to a loss of &#163;206,000.</p>

The best the husband could do was to say to me that that&#8217;s just what he thought would happen. He speculated that more parents are sending children to school with packed lunches, rather than with money to buy lunches from the cafeteria provided by the husband&#8217;s business. This is not hard evidence.</p>

On the contrary, the relevant question when determining foreseeability is the second one set out at para 21 above. In my judgment, a reasonable person would have said in October 2019 that there was certainly a chance, which could not sensibly be ignored, that in the next year there would be an economic downturn which would have the effect of reducing turnover and increasing costs. </p>

He proposes to retain the value within his shares. Both parties propose that he should retain all of his shareholding.

A net profit of &#163;600,000 will be comfortably adequate to pay the &#163;200,000 to the wife and around &#163;175,000 or thereabouts to the husband by way of dividends net of tax. Obviously, tax will need to be paid at 38.1%. However, looking at the company&#8217;s accounts for the past five years, it has achieved that level of profit in four of those five years and across those five years, there has been a comfortable excess of sums that will be required to pay sums in that order. The company is financially sound and has considerable leeway in how it operates. It seems to me that there is always the option for finance if there are any cashflow issues, but I am satisfied, on the basis of the expert&#8217;s opinion, that given the retained earnings that are in the company, there should not be any difficulty in realising those sums and the issue would simply be one of liquidity rather than one of a level of profits to enable those dividends to be declared.&#8221; </p>

It may, in its discretion, vary or alter them even though made originally by consent."</p>

An order for a lump sum of &#163;5,000 payable by f&#8204;ive yearly instalments of &#163;1,000 is to be distinguished from f&#8204;inancial provision of &#163;1,000 per annum for f&#8204;ive years. Apart from the different tax consequences, the former should not end on the death or remarriage of the payee whereas the latter would. <span style="font-weight:bold">If a lump sum is ordered it should be on the basis that the payee is entitled to it here and now although, to soften the blow to the payer, actual payment may be spread over a number of years.</span><span> </span><span style="font-weight:bold">In our view once an order for a lump sum has been perfected its amount should not be variable whatever may happen later.</span> This, of course, does not mean that a subsequent order cannot be made which may have the effect for the future of undoing the original payment. If, on a judicial separation, the husband had been ordered to pay the wife &#163;1,000 and if the husband subsequently divorced her because of her adultery and was granted custody of the children, it might well be that the court would then order her to pay him &#163;1,000 or some other sum. This would not be a variation of the original order, but a new order made in the light of the changed circumstances when a second occasion arose to review the f&#8204;inancial position.&#8221; (emphasis added)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The emphatic recommendation of the Law Commission was therefore that the variation of a lump sum payable by instalments could not alter its overall quantum. The timing and size of the instalments could be altered, but the overall quantum had to stay the same. A careful reading of the provisions in the draft Bill shows that the power to vary applied only to the instalments and not to the amount of the lump sum itself. This was a crucial feature of the new scheme which appears to have been overlooked in all the later cases which have considered the variability of a lump sum payable in instalments.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;I think that the purpose of the words "or sums" must be to enable the court to provide for more than one lump sum payment in one order; indeed, that is what has been done in the present case, for there is an order for the payment of &#163;2,000 and for the payment of &#163;5,500, the latter being expressed by the registrar in his judgment to be "so that she may, should she so wish, acquire a capital interest in her home." Many examples suggest themselves - an order for a lump sum to cover expenses, as in <ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1970/45/section/2/2/a" canonical="1970 c. 45 s. 2" type="legislation">section 2(2)(a)</ref> of the <ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1970/45" canonical="1970 c. 45" type="legislation">Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970</ref>, or for the purchase of the house or for furnishing the house, or in lieu of maintenance, or it may be that one lump sum is to be payable immediately and another by instalments. Then there are wives like the present wife who must have money at once for at least the deposit on a new home for herself and the children, but the final amount she should receive cannot be fairly decided until the selling price of the former home (owned by the husband) is known. At the present day that may be in a bracket of many thousands of pounds. This problem can be resolved within the section by requiring the husband to give her an immediate lump sum for the deposit and adjourning the question of the further lump sum (if any) until after the sale of the former home</p>

It cannot be said that any of the husband&#8217;s evidence in support of his application had been disclosed under compulsion. On the contrary, all of that evidence was volunteered by him. Therefore, I consider it most unlikely, had journalists or bloggers attended, that the husband would have succeeded in persuading me to grant an order preventing a report identifying the parties or any of the financial details about the business.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This divergence in practice, depending on whether the application is proceeding at first instance or on appeal, is impossible to defend. It becomes yet more arbitrary and irrational when one considers that, where during the interlocutory journey of a first instance application, there has been an excursion to the Court of Appeal, the judgment at the final hearing will often be given without anonymisation: see as an example the recent decision of Peel J in <span style="font-style:italic">Crowther v Crowther &amp; Ors (Financial Remedies)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2021/88" isNeutral="true" canonical="[2021] EWFC 88" court="ewfc" year="2021" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[2021] EWFC 88</ref>, where everybody and everything were named.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Chandler has argued that anonymity of the adult parties and the children and of the name of the husband&#8217;s business should be granted in this case. He relies on the convention which I have set out above. In principle, this argument should be rejected. The convention does not apply to a set-aside application. In any event, where it does apply, it is time for it to be abandoned. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Chandler argues that naming the husband will lead to identification of his business and that its financial details as set out above at [23] &#8211; [36] would be of great interest to commercial competitors. I reject that reason also. Mere assertions of this nature do not justify the imposition of secrecy. Hard evidence would be needed before that argument could be accepted. A judgment on a petition under <ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/994" canonical="2006 c. 46 s. 994" type="legislation">s. 994 of the Companies Act 2006</ref> would no doubt contain much information about the company of interest to its competitors. But I very much doubt that that would lead to redaction from the judgment of the name of the company or of the identities of its members. The same standard of openness should apply to a financial remedy judgment. The desert island syndrome should be avoided. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">However, Mr Chandler argues that there are two good reasons why I should depart from my initial intention and grant anonymity to the adults. First, he argues that naming the wife will inevitably be picked up at the children&#8217;s school where she teaches, leading to a detrimental impact on the children&#8217;s welfare. Thus, he argues, my grant of anonymity to the children may well be ineffective. I accept that submission. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Second, he argues that the parties in this case came to the hearing before me with a reasonable expectation that the hearing would preserve their anonymity. Although I have held above that reliance on the convention of anonymisation of financial remedy judgments should now be abandoned, I accept that it would be unfair for me to spring this change of practice on these parties without forewarning. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">However, it should be clearly understood that my default position from now on will be to publish financial remedy judgments in full without anonymisation, save that any children will continue to be granted anonymity. Derogation from this principle will need to be distinctly justified by reference to specific facts, rather than by reliance on generalisations.</p>
