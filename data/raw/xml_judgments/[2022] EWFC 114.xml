	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband was born in Nigeria on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 1962 and is, therefore, now aged 60.  His father was ZO, a successful businessman in Nigeria. His own father, AO, had much earlier invented and successfully marketed a medicine which is to this day very popular in Nigeria for those feeling unwell, and had built a family business around it, which in due course came to be owned by ZO. The husband&#8217;s step-mother was BO (who also features in this story). As a result of this family business, the husband was born to a family of some wealth and was brought up against this background. His parents owned real properties in England and the USA as well as business and property interests in Nigeria.  He was educated in England, at least for part of his education, at a private school and then Cambridge University. Having completed his English education, the husband returned to Nigeria and worked in the family business and, in due course, as we shall see, acquired ownership of the family business from his parents. He continues to live in Nigeria. He had a first marriage in Nigeria which ended in Divorce and there is one (now adult) child from that marriage.</p>

Her date of birth is 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 1973 and she is, therefore, now aged 48, very nearly 49.  She describes her upbringing as comfortable rather than wealthy, but she accepts that, as she entered adulthood and as she entered the marriage, she had little wealth and what wealth she has, has come from financial activities during the marriage. She was, however, university educated in Nigeria and (before and after meeting the husband) had remunerative employment, working for an airline and for an international body in Nigeria. On her case she has also played a significant part in the development of the family business in Nigeria during the marriage; but she was also a home-maker and the primary carer for her children and in recent years she has been attracted by life in England with them and has been living in England since 2018 and hopes and expects to remain (and it is unlikely that there are any substantial impediments to this from an immigration law perspective). </p>

They married in Lagos, Nigeria and, for many years, that is where they largely lived, although they did engage in a good deal of international travel. My impression is that the marriage was a happy and loving one, for a period at least, but sadly appears to have deteriorated over the subsequent years.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">By at least 2018, the marriage was plainly in very real difficulty.  There was an incident on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018 which was, on any view, a bad-tempered one and an unpleasant one.  I do not think it is appropriate for me, in the context of this application and this hearing, to make any particular findings about what happened; but whatever happened certainly triggered the separation and really from shortly after that moment the marriage had ended and the parties went their separate ways.  They have not lived together since then and have spent very little time together since that day.  </p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">Shortly after that, in April 2018, the wife moved to England. That did not come out of the blue because both the parties had always spent a great deal of their time travelling around the world, often the USA, but more particularly in England.  They had access to pleasant homes in Nigeria, USA and England, so they were able to do that. From April 2018 the wife has spent almost the whole of her time in England and there has been little contact between her and the husband.  The last time that they were together at all was, I believe, in February 2019.  </p>

The husband&#8217;s applications went through various interim/directions hearings, at some of which <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> costs orders were made against him; but for the most part the husband and his legal team were properly engaged in these proceedings and filed a number of statements and other documents. </p>

The financial remedies proceedings had initially moved forward, apparently uncontroversially, on the basis that the Miami property was owned beneficially, as well as legally, by the husband and wife. The husband had expressly supported this proposition in writing a number of times, including in his Form E. </p>

The &#8216;verified complaint&#8217; document takes the form of what in England would be called a pleading or statement of case, so it is possible by reading this document to see how the case is put in legal terms.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I made the decision to proceed with the final hearing, notwithstanding the absence of both the husband and AA Limited. I made this decision because both of them have been well aware of the final hearing, have had ample opportunity to prepare for and be represented at the hearing and, in both cases, have made a positive and deliberate decision not to attend or be represented and not to engage in proceedings or comply with directions orders. No reason, certainly no adequate reason, has been advanced as to why they have both decided to conduct themselves in this way. The overriding objective in FPR 2010 Rule 1 requires me to deal with cases expeditiously and fairly and in a way which saves expense for the parties and which takes into account the need to allot a fair share of court resources both to the present case and to other cases. It would in my view be unfair to the wife, and would certainly increase her costs significantly, for me not to proceed to determine the case in the three days allotted to this case. It would certainly introduce more delay and be less expeditious for me to adjourn. In so far as proceeding in the absence of the husband causes him any unfairness, this is entirely of his own making. An adjournment would waste precious court resources and potentially affect future listings of other cases if this case had to be relisted. None of this absolves me from making a proper judicial determination of the outcome on the facts as I find them. It is my duty and task to scrutinise the facts and arguments put forward on behalf of the wife and this I propose to do; but it would be quite wrong for me not to proceed with the hearing.</p>

The property was formerly owned by ZO, the husband&#8217;s father, and BO, the husband&#8217;s step-mother. On the death of ZO in June 2005, his interest passed to BO and she became the sole owner. On her death on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2008 the property effectively passed to the husband as the sole beneficiary of BO&#8217;s Will. Documents produced for this case show that the changes in ownership have not yet been executed at HM Land Registry, but it has not been in dispute in this case that the husband could call for the transfer of the legal and beneficial title to himself as sole beneficiary if he so wished and, accordingly, it is appropriate for me to proceed on the basis that the husband is, in effect, the sole legal and beneficial owner of this property. The property was valued (by Purple Bricks) at &#163;2,000,000, a figure which was not controversial at the stage when the husband was engaged in the proceedings and there is no reason for me to take any different view now. It is unencumbered by borrowings. For my purposes I shall proceed on the basis that the net value of this property is &#163;2,000,000 less sale costs at 3%, i.e. &#163;1,940,000. It seems likely that there will be some Capital Gains Tax (and/or query Inheritance Tax) to pay on any formal disposal of this property; but the husband has not at any time sought to calculate or otherwise put forward a figure and, for the purposes of this judgment I can do no more than note the likelihood of some unidentified liability.</p>

The only figure I have for the value of this property is the wife&#8217;s assessment that it is worth N600,000,000. The husband has not cooperated with the valuation directions and has produced no other figure. For this purpose, and for all other conversions of Nigerian currency (Naira or N), I shall use the conversion rate of N1 = &#163;0.002 or N1,000,000 = &#163;2,000. Accordingly, assuming the above value, this property is worth &#163;1,200,000. Whilst noting that this is the husband&#8217;s home, I do not think it is appropriate to include this on the asset schedule as the husband&#8217;s asset because it is not owned directly by him, rather it is in fact owned by a company, BB Limited, albeit that this company is owned as to 75% by AA Limited and another 24% by the husband himself. I shall in due course be making an assessment of the value of the husband&#8217;s corporate interests and I do not think it would be appropriate for me to double count this asset as if it was his personal asset, albeit that it is his home and he is, for all practical purposes, the controller of what happens to the property.</p>

The wife&#8217;s Form E suggested a figure of $3,105,695. The husband&#8217;s Form E suggested a figure of &#163;3,774,498 (at the then exchange rate of &#163;1 = $1.21 this would have been $4,567,143). The wife&#8217;s narrative statement records that she has recently been told by an estate agent in Miami that the value is more like $9,000,000. I queried whether this figure was likely to be correct, given the much smaller estimates by both sides in the Forms E. Mr Warshaw, I think appropriately, suggested that I should accept the later figure because (however vague it is) it is the &#8216;best evidence&#8217; available and that it was probably against the wife&#8217;s interests for the value to be over-estimated rather than the reverse. For these reasons I shall adopt the figure of $9,000,000 or &#163;7,964,602 (at the current exchange rate of &#163;1 = $1.13). </p>

It was anticipated that the wife would seek a property adjustment order in her favour of the Miami property and (whilst the matter was contested on the facts) there did not appear to be any jurisdictional hurdle to such a course. The information obtained by the wife&#8217;s legal team was that such a property adjustment order, if made, would be likely to be enforced by the courts in Florida (certainly no evidence to the contrary was produced) and the case seemed to fall within the established case law permitting such a course: see <span style="font-style:italic">Hamlin v Hamlin</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] 1 FLR 61" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] 1 FLR 61</ref>.</p>

In reading this I have reminded myself that he is instructed by the wife and is not an independent SJE, but it does not follow from this that I should not attach appropriate weight to it if I consider that it is fair so to do. In the circumstances of this case, where AA Limited disengaged and were therefore not cooperative with the investigation of Florida law in this respect, I take the view that it is fair and appropriate for me to admit this document and attach such weight to it as I consider fit.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">I have been addressed on the issue of whether, in making such a determination, I should apply English or Florida law. I have considered the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition 1985, Articles 4 and 7, which was imported into domestic English legislation through the Recognition of Trusts Act 1985,  Schedule 1. Although, on the facts of this case, there is possibly some difference in this context between assessing whether a trust arises at all and determining what are the beneficial interests under the trust, I have in the end concluded that this issue is properly decided under Article 7, which reads: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Where no applicable law has been chosen, a trust shall be governed by the law with which it is most closely connected. In ascertaining the law with which a trust is most closely connected reference shall be made in particular to: (a) the place of administration of the trust designated by the settlor; (b) the situs of the assets of the trust; (c) the place of residence or business of the trustee; and (d) the objects of the trust and the places where they are to be fulfilled</span>.&#8221; In my view this conclusion takes us firmly towards a decision that I should apply Florida law. The most significant &#8216;connection&#8217; feature here is the location of the property and I am persuaded that the principle of <span style="font-style:italic">lex situs</span> should be given precedence here within an analysis of Article 7.

Constructive trusts are not governed by the Florida Trust Code and instead are imposed on a case-by-case basis by a trial judge using his or her equitable powers. Constructive trusts are sometimes called involuntary trusts (or trusts ex maleficio), and are imposed to achieve a fair and equitable result. If the court finds that the person holding the property is, in fact, holding title as trustee for the benefit of those equitably entitled to the property, then a constructive trust will be declared. Constructive trusts are creatures of equity and are traditionally within the chancery jurisdiction of the court. The principle underlying constructive trusts is the avoidance of a result that allows a party to be unjustly enriched through abuse of confidence, duress, or fraud, whether the fraud is actual or constructive. Such trusts will arise where there is actual fraud, constructive fraud, or the application of some equitable principle not involving fraud. Florida case decisions on constructive trusts are not clear in that some decisions speak of a fraud requirement while others state it is not required. Constructive trusts have two objectives: to restore property to the rightful owner and to prevent unjust enrichment&#8230;There is no definition under Florida law as to what constitutes a &#8220;confidential relationship,&#8221; but the concept is similar to a fiduciary relationship. The seminal Florida Supreme Court case of Quinn v. Phipps described a fiduciary relationship as follows: &#8220;The relation and duties involved need not be legal; they may be moral, social, domestic or personal. If a relation of trust and confidence exists between the parties (that is to say, where confidence is reposed by one party and trust accepted by the other, or where confidence has been acquired and abused), that is sufficient as a predicate for relief. The origin of the confidence is immaterial&#8221;. Since the concept is based on equity, the Florida courts have not established a precise definition as to what is necessary to establish a constructive trust. Florida courts have stated that where one, through a confidential relationship, acquires an advantage which one should not, in equity and good conscience retain, equity will convert the individual into a trustee and direct the individual to restore that which was unjustly acquired.&#160;Real estate transactions have furnished constructive trust cases but are subject to the same rules&#8230;It should be noted throughout this discussion, but especially on this claim, that the benefit was allegedly given to the Husband&#8217;s parents many years ago and the Plaintiff did not seek to have the money returned or impose a constructive trust until presently. Likewise, Plaintiff did not seek to record a mortgage (a simple matter under Florida law) to publicly declare its interest in the Miami property nor make a claim for the allegedly outstanding funds during the probate proceedings of the Husband&#8217;s parents. It will be a challenge for the Plaintiff to establish under Florida law that the son and daughter-in-law should be charged with returning money when so much time has passed and no claims were made until present. Under Florida law, the claim will face significant legal challenges&#8230;In my opinion, the facts as set forth in paragraph 17 to 25 of XO&#8217;s <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> statement constitute a substantial and significant defense to the claim. Furthermore and based on paragraphs 17 &#8211; 25, there are sufficient facts to determine the case in favor of Wife.&#8221;</span></p>

I need to make my own assessment of the facts against this legal test. I do not regard myself as being in any way bound by the conclusion Mr Farach has reached as to the merits of the case, but as it happens I entirely agree with him. On the facts of the case as I have set them out to be (which are in essence the same facts which Mr Farach is referring to which are to be found within paragraphs 17 to 25 of the wife&#8217;s narrative statement) the claim by AA Limited is simply not made out. There is no abuse of confidence. There is no unjust enrichment. There is no advantage which should not in good conscience and equity be retained. I have no hesitation in dismissing the claim made by AA Limited for the equitable remedy of an imposition of a constructive trust.</p>

Whilst expressed in slightly different terms, a court applying English law would be considering not dissimilar issues in the context of whether a common intention constructive trust is established. What were the actual or imputed intentions of those who acquired the property and did those change over time? In addition, the English court would be likely to take a starting point that the beneficial interests follow the legal interests (see <span style="font-style:italic">Stack v Dowden</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 2 AC 459" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 2 AC 459</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Kernott</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/53" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 53" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 53</ref>) and would be likely to note: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The burden will therefore be on the person seeking to show that the parties did intend their beneficial interests to be different from their legal interests, and in what way. This is not a task to be lightly embarked upon</span>.&#8221; It is my view that AA Limited must fail on these tests as well. There is no evidence of any actual common intention that AA Limited were the true beneficial owners and it would be very difficult indeed on the facts of this case to impute it. Further, the person who was the owner and controller of AA Limited, i.e. the husband, not only executed a transfer to himself and the wife, but also deposed on three occasions in 2021 to the fact that they were their joint beneficial owners. </p>

I am not sure whether it is stated that that is net or gross of tax, but I suspect she has in mind &#163;1 million coming into the family kitty net per year.&#160; Certainly, a large sum of money funding a very expensive lifestyle. I have asked Ms Syme on her instructions whether that is about right, and she has not certainly suggested to me that that is an absurdly high figure.&#160; She has rather put a barrier up to giving any information on the subject at all.&#160;It seems to me that on the information that I have and with the absence of very much information from the Husband at all on this subject in comparison with quite a lot of information from the Wife on the subject, it seems to me that I can and should make the robust assumption that that is the sort of level of income that we are dealing with.&#160; If that turns out in due course not to be correct and to be an exaggerated figure, and the Husband as a result suffers interim payments of more than he thinks is fair, then he really has himself to blame to a significant extent for that by not really making much of an effort to inform the court about what the situation was. Likewise, the Husband has produced almost no information about the company revenues or balance sheets or what they pay to him in terms of expenses or dividends. It seems that he owns most of the shares of most of the companies. It seems inexplicable that he has not been able to give some sort of assessment, even if it was a very broad one, of what we are talking about here. Again, I have only therefore the Wife&#8217;s assertion that the value, when it comes in, will be measured in the hundreds of millions of pounds. I do not know whether that is right. I cannot be sure that it is right, but it is pretty much all I have got to go on at the moment.

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;My broad conclusions as to the approach the court should take when dealing with non-disclosure are as follows.  They are broad because, as I have sought to emphasise, non-disclosure can take a variety of forms and arise in a variety of circumstances from the very general to the very specific.  My remarks are focused on the former, namely a broad failure to comply with the disclosure obligations in respect of a party's financial resources, rather than the latter&#8230;(i) It is clearly appropriate that generally, as required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref>, the court should seek to determine the extent of the financial resources of the non-disclosing party;  (ii) When undertaking this task the court will, obviously, be entitled to draw such adverse inferences as are justified having regard to the nature and extent of the party's failure to engage properly with the proceedings.  However, this does not require the court to engage in a disproportionate enquiry.  Nor, as Lord Sumption said, should the court &#8216;engage in pure speculation&#8217;.  As Otton LJ said in Baker v Baker, inferences must be &#8216;properly drawn and reasonable&#8217;.  This was reiterated by Lady Hale in Prest v Petrodel, at [85]:"&#8230; the court is entitled to draw such inferences as can properly be drawn from all the available material, including what has been disclosed, judicial experience of what is likely to be being concealed and the inherent probabilities, in deciding what the facts are. (iii) This does not mean, contrary to Mr Molyneux's submission, that the court is required to make a specific determination either as to a figure or a bracket.  There will be cases where this exercise will not be possible because, the manner in which a party has failed to comply with their disclosure obligations, means that the court is &#8216;unable to quantify the extent of his undisclosed resources, to repeat what Wilson LJ said in Behzadi v Behzadi. (iv) How does this fit within the application of the principles of need and sharing?  The answer, in my view, is that, when faced with uncertainty consequent on one party's non-disclosure and when considering what Lady Hale and Lord Sumption called &#8216;the inherent probabilities&#8217; the court is entitled, in appropriate cases, to infer that the resources are sufficient or are such that the proposed award does represent a fair outcome.  This is, effectively, what Munby J did in both Al-Khatib v Masry and Ben Hashem v Al Shayif and, in my view, it is a legitimate approach&#8230;  This approach is both necessary and justified to limit the scope for, what Butler-Sloss LJ accepted could otherwise be, a &#8216;cheat's charter&#8217;. As Thorpe J said in F v F, although not the court's intention, better an order which may be unfair to the non-disclosing party than an order which is unfair to the other party.  This does not mean, as Mostyn J said in in NG v SG, at [7], that the court should jump to conclusions as to the extent of the undisclosed wealth simply because of some non-disclosure.  It reflects, as he said at [16(viii)], that the court must be astute to ensure that the non-discloser does not obtain a better outcome than that which would have been ordered if they had complied with their disclosure obligations.&#8221;</span></p>

It is further agreed that following W&#8217;s appointment a whole new management team was rebuilt from the ground up. Thus, the wife has more information than many wives in her position might have and this information, although not obviously of the quality which one might expect from an independent SJE accountant, is still helpful in the context of an otherwise blank canvass and, of course, the husband has not done what he could and should have done if he thought the wife was over-egging her claims, come to court and cause the wife to be cross-examined about what she was saying. He had the opportunity to do that; but chose not to take it.</p>

The husband worked in the business for some years prior to 2005; but became its owner as a result of an inheritance of approximately 70% of the shares from ZO on his death in 2005 and a subsequent acquisition of the further 30% from BO in 2006 (under an agreement which had some ongoing obligations, but these ceased when BO died in 2008).</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in">This headline fact is rather blurred by a number of other facts. First, it is common ground that the wife, in 2009, was employed by the business as &#8216;Group Managing Director and Brand Director&#8217;. In this sense she did make a significant work <span style="font-weight:bold">contribution</span> to the marriage (in addition to what she did as a home-maker and primary child-care giver). Secondly, the wife has asserted that in that role she very dramatically turned around the company&#8217;s fortunes. Although I think I have to treat this assertion with an element of caution because there is not very much figurework provided to support that proposition and some of the evidence I have read, including some of the evidence provided by the wife, suggests that the substance of the business was already well established by that point; at the same time the wife&#8217;s assertion that she made a major contribution to the fortunes of the business has not been challenged by cross-examination, which it could have been. Thirdly, it is correct that the wife received some shares in some of the underlying businesses and the family lived off the companies and, to an extent, this suggests that the husband was treating the business as a joint operation, a mingled operation. Fourthly, some of the business operations, including the II Group entities, were developed by investments made in the course of the marriage.</p>

As with many other figures in this case, the 30% suggestion is not based on any mathematical calculation, but a broad assertion of fairness; but that is the currency of this case because of the absence of any proper accountants&#8217; evidence by reason of the husband&#8217;s litigation conduct.</p>

For me this gives a fairer recognition of the initial source of these assets, though I acknowledge that it is no more mathematically based than Mr Warshaw&#8217;s figure. On the basis that the wife transfers to the husband all the shares that she retains in what are effectively the husband&#8217;s businesses (i.e. specifically not including the shares that I have entered on the asset table separately as the wife&#8217;s own shareholdings, but including all other shareholdings) I have concluded that I should treat the wife as having a strong sharing claim to 50% of the husband&#8217;s business assets.</p>

Plainly, in one sense, these figures would produce a lifestyle very much higher than most people would regard as one which met anything which could be described as &#8216;need&#8217;; but these figures are broadly commensurate with the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage by the wife and children. In any event, even if I accepted the whole of this analysis, the total figure would fall below what I have assessed to be the sharing claim and I do not consider that I need to make any adjustment to my &#8216;sharing&#8217; analysis by reference to a &#8216;needs&#8217; analysis.</p>

The husband believes and has asserted that the wife (in concert with her sister and brother-in-law) has removed certain monies from the husband&#8217;s businesses, dishonestly and without proper authority. He has reported these allegations to the Police in Nigeria and they are, apparently, being investigated. Amongst other things which have happened, the wife&#8217;s brother-in-law has been arrested and has had his passport confiscated and is being held in Nigeria against his wishes. The wife is concerned that the allegations against her may make it difficult for her to return to Nigeria in that she might be subjected to similar treatment as her brother-in-law if she returned. The wife believes that these allegations have been made maliciously and that the husband has the ability to influence police behaviour in a dishonest and corrupt way. Mr Warshaw has invited me specifically to determine these issues in the wife&#8217;s favour, but I decline to do so, save to say that neither of these allegations has been established in the course of this hearing to the requisite standard of proof, that I do not need for my purposes to investigate these matters or make any findings, and that I do not propose to adjust my order on the basis of these allegations.</p>

In my view it is reasonable for me to reflect this conduct by adding on to the lump sum referred to above a costs order for a portion of the wife&#8217;s legal costs bill (said to be a total of &#163;515,526) which can be said to be attributable to the husband&#8217;s failures.
