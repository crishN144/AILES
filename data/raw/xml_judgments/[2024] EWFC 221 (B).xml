Finally, whilst neither a part of the order nor the recitals to the same, the Section 7 report completed in respect of those proceedings made clear that after three months of the children spending time with him during overnight contact, then he should apply to the Court for a further order in respect of him taking them on holiday to his home country of Turkey. </span></p>

If he finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place. He is not allowed to sit on the fence. He has to find for one side or the other. Sometimes the burden of proof will come to his rescue: the party with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied him that it did.

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities. However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence. Indeed, in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable.&#8217;</span></p>

Experience has shown that inconsistencies in accounts can happen whether a person is telling the truth or not. This is because if someone has a traumatic experience such as the kind alleged in this case, their memory may be affected in different ways. It may affect that person&#8217;s ability to take in and later recall the experience. Also, some people may go over an event afterwards in their minds many times and their memory may become clearer or can develop over time. But other people may try to avoid thinking about an event at all, and they may then have difficulty in recalling the event accurately. Your assessment of this factor will be influenced by your conclusions as to the facts of this case. You must form a view of what happened in this case based on all the evidence you have heard.&#8217;</span></p>

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the 'lie' is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is 'capable of amounting to a corroboration.'

Much material to be found in local authority case records or social work chronologies is hearsay, often second- or third-hand hearsay. Hearsay evidence is, of course, admissible in family proceedings. But, and as the present case so vividly demonstrates, a local authority which is unwilling or unable to produce the witnesses who can speak of such matters first-hand, may find itself in great, or indeed insuperable, difficulties if a parent not merely puts the matter in issue but goes into the witness-box to deny it.&#8221;</span></p>

The father refused and explained to her that he could not do this because he was a barber and could not cut girl&#8217;s hair.

I find that it is too great of a coincidence that these, most serious of, allegations are said to have occurred right at the time that the children&#8217;s contact with their father was about to move from one overnight a week to two which would then have built up to him making an application to take them on holiday to Turkey, something the mother told me she was concerned about him doing. </span></p>

Miss Bragg recommended that in this scenario a stepped approach be implemented with no less than three sessions of supervised contact of ninety minutes each over a three-week period, this should then progress to two sessions of contact facilitated by an agreed third party who would drop the children off with the father, and later collect them, but who would again remain contactable and in the local area. Following this she told me that there should be weekly unsupervised contact which should then return to overnight contact.</span></p>
