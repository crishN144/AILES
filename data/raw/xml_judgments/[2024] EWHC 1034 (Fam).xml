As I set out in a little more detail below, he has a strong religious objection to blood transfusion, and/or the administration of blood products, as an article of his faith; this objection is, he says, rooted in the scriptures, both the Old Testament and the New Testament.  Receiving bloods would be fundamentally at odds with J&#8217;s considered religious beliefs and would carry for him the potential considerable lifelong social, mental and spiritual harm. Some months ago he signed an &#8216;Advance Directive&#8217; making clear that he would not under any circumstances wish to receive blood products.  In relation to the proposed surgery he has refused to give his consent to blood transfusion or the administration of blood products in the event that this becomes necessary during the operation.  </span></p>

Unacceptable risks would be posed to J if the kidney obstruction were left untreated for very much longer, including (but not limited to) the development of sepsis.  Moreover, J is in pain and occasionally acutely so to the extent that it has a significant impact on his life; he told me that he now seeks urgent relief from his physical distress.  The additional complication which would arise from a delay is that a permanently and irreversibly damaged kidney may well need to be removed entirely in due course by nephrectomy.  This procedure carries with it a higher risk of bleeding than pyeloplasty because the large vessels supplying the kidney need to be cut. Leaving the situation for any length of time now only seems to me to raise the risk of more intricate surgery which correspondingly raises the risks of intra-operative or post-operative bleeding.</span></p>

The benefit of taking the operation in two discrete stages would be to relieve J of the symptoms of the obstruction now, and tide him over until he is 18 so that he can then, as an adult, make an unchallengeable decision about more definitive treatment which will not include the administration of unwanted blood products.  However, the disadvantage of this course would be that the insertion of a stent is only ever a temporary &#8216;fix&#8217;; the procedure would need to be repeated in 6 months time, and if the pyeloplasty is attempted at that stage there is an elevated (albeit still small) risk of severe surgical bleeding from the area of the renal pelvis and stented ureter.

I shall further provide that if prior to the procedure J consents to having such blood or blood products, such treatment will be provided as long as his clinicians consider this to be clinically indicated.</span></p>
