	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with ML who is a young man of 25 years of age.  ML has severe learning disability, developmental disorder, autism, epilepsy and diabetes.  He has very limited conventional skills of communication or social interaction. With the exception of a period of admission to the Vale Hospital in 2012, ML has lived in the family home with his parents all his life.  EL (his mother) is the primary carer providing full time care and support.  BL (his father) has full time employment as a computer software engineer but he is very much involved with ML&#8217;s life in the evenings and at weekends.  ML also has an elder brother who is important to him but who has now left home.  3 days per week ML attends the National Autistic Society Day Centre between 10.00am -3.00pm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the Day Centre all the staff care about ML but he has a particularly strong relationship with a Mr Ian Weston.  Mr Weston attended court to give evidence at my request and for reasons that I will refer to later in this judgment,  Mr Weston is plainly fond of ML, knows him well,  knows how to manage him and keep him happy.  He is enthusiastic to develop ML&#8217;s potential.  Some aspects of ML&#8217;s behaviour are very challenging, inevitably these have to be the focus of my attention when I come to consider the issues before me, but I should like to emphasise, that which BL has properly insisted upon at this hearing, there is a great deal more to ML than either his raft of problems or his, at times, violent outbursts.  He is a young man who often radiates a sense of his own happiness and contentment to others; he has a real capacity for enjoyment, especially swimming.  He can be warm and affectionate to those he trusts and knows well, particularly his mother.  He has a sense of humour that is entirely his own, which occasionally has a subtlety and nuance to it that both delights and sometimes inspires his parents.  He enjoys walking and visiting charity shops to root out DVDs and videos.  His father tells me he is a great fan of videos.  He was fortunate to have a very committed teaching assistant at school with whom he remains in contact.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The most important people in ML&#8217;s life are his parents.  They are a strong articulate couple utterly committed to their son.  Their love for him is powerful and unconditional and they are tenacious advocates on his behalf both within and outside these proceedings.  They have opposed the declarations being sought by the Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and the NHS Nene Clinical Commissioning Group (&#8216;the Applicants&#8217;). The applications are supported by the Official Solicitor acting on ML&#8217;s behalf.  The parents have opposed the applications for a complexity of reasons which I will analyse in due course but the sincerity of their opposition is beyond question.  ML is very lucky to have his parents, they have provided him with a secure and loving home and set a template for his relationships which, many professionals in the case have observed, has equipped him well for forging new relationships in the future. They would say, without hesitation, that they are equally lucky to have ML.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Behind these deceptively simple draft declarations is a history of professional and family conflict which has frequently been bitter and occasionally rancorous (amongst the professionals).  It is a case which has engendered many high emotions in people who feel strongly about the important nature of the work they are involved in and who are very highly motivated to achieve the best outcomes for ML. Some, though certainly not all, witnesses have overstated their cases, been selective in their use of material, emotive in their use of language, disrespectful to those who hold contrary views.  In consequence, despite their laudable objectives, they have made it difficult for me, at times, to get a clear picture of how ML functions and how his needs might best be met.  If I accept the evidence of Susan Freeman, Nurse Consultant, ML is one of the most dangerous patients she has encountered still living within the community.  She had, she told me, &#8220;only experienced one other person with more aggressive behaviour impact on others to the severity that ML&#8217;s does&#8221; and this was in the context of 30 Years of nursing people &#8220;whose behaviour challenges services&#8221; as she puts it.  In her statement of the 31st January 2014 Ms. Freeman observed &#8220;I am a very experienced learning disability nurse. In all the years that I have been practicing ML is one of the most complex and challenging patients that I have been involved with, the range of his needs is quite vast&#8221;.  Ms Freeman described ML as showing high levels of aggression &#8220;impacting on every area of his life and inhibiting appropriate health care intervention&#8221;.  She believed his abilities were diminishing in an isolated routine.  She said &#8220;If ML is not transferred out of his current environment and routines his world is going to continue to decrease&#8221;.  ML&#8217;s diet said Ms Freeman was entirely unsatisfactory.  By way of example she said ML ate only jam sandwiches and that little attempt was made to vary the diet.  Certainly jam sandwiches, as Mr Weston, later confirmed were all ML ever ate at the Day Centre.  I have heard in evidence that this resistance to new experiences, taste or routines is a feature of his autism, not uncommon at this severe end of the spectrum.  Ms Freeman was uncompromising in her professional criticism of the National Autistic Society Day Centre.  Their approach to ML&#8217;s care was she said &#8220;fundamentally flawed&#8221;  it was &#8220;managing him at a distance&#8221; it involved withdrawing from him to avoid outbursts, it left him isolated and under stimulated and it served to reinforce his reliance on aggression.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was not possible for the mother (EL) to come to London, it would have required an intolerable and unsustainable interruption to ML&#8217;s routine.  I took her evidence by telephone link so all could hear it.  She told me that she had made progress with ML&#8217;s diet, that he was now eating a broader range of foods: &#8216;pasties&#8217;, &#8216;crisps&#8217;, &#8216;sausages&#8217; she said, by way of example, not particularly nutritious but an important improvement .  She and her husband had attributed the peak in ML&#8217;s violent behaviour at the end of 2012 and early 2013 as being a consequence of his distress during his term as an inpatient in the Vale Hospital, where they considered he had been too readily &#8216;secluded&#8217; (locked in a partially padded room) and for extended periods of time (4 &#189; hours on one occasion).  He had since calmed down and become more manageable.  They had experienced no difficulty in managing him at home for months.  Both parents said he was happy at home, well known and protected in their local community.  He enjoyed seeing his brother and enjoyed the Day Centre.  They have a padded room at home and both BL and EL told me that ML goes willingly to it when required.  They simply do not see the extent of aggression that is attributed to ML and believe that the documented case gives only a partial picture.  &#8220;We do not keep records at home&#8221;, they say.  Moreover, they assert, the case papers inevitably concentrate on problem episodes rather than the many times when ML is relaxed and content.  In their carefully presented closing submissions they undertook an analysis of the advantages of their proposals.  It purported to be a comparative analysis but in truth, it was, understandably, largely one sided.  They wish the present arrangements to continue and submit</p>

Mr Weston could not have been more positive: he told me that ML enjoys walks but had, for example, easily been distracted from his usual routine when routes were impassable due to recent flooding.  That was a good indicator of some of the progress being made he thought.   He saw his role as &#8220;giving him the enjoyment that he needs&#8221;.  I am impressed by the extent to which Mr Weston knew how ML was able to enjoy himself: &#8216;his Ipad&#8217;; &#8216;YouTube&#8217;, especially &#8216;Winnie the Pooh&#8217; videos which he regularly enjoyed.

Mr Weston knew that ML&#8217;s parents want to keep him at home and attending the Day Care Centre.  I am clear that he intended to support them in his evidence.  However, his commitment to ML and I thought real affection for him also communicated a sense of his own evaluation of ML&#8217;s potential.  He seemed to me to be enthusiastic, to go beyond &#8216;keeping him happy&#8217; and to bring him on.  Mr Weston had, in my judgement, a strong sense that ML had greater potential than was being realised.  Both ML and the NAS Day Centre are very fortunate to have Mr Weston.

These difficulties, coupled with some probable sensory sensitivity, mean that he finds the world hard to predict. Social interaction and communication with others is problematic and thus he chooses to spend time in an environment that he can control with limited interaction with others.  When ML is out of this environment he needs to know exactly what is expected and the purpose of an activity and to be supported by someone he trusts or his levels of anxiety may increase to such a point that he is unable to regulate his behaviour, culminating in an incident of physical aggression&#8221;.</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;The rationale of our current approach to behaviour support is to ask staff to leave at set intervals, so that ML&#8217;s need for time alone is respected before he has to present with physical aggression, which automatically causes the staff to withdraw.  This approach aims to weaken the relationship between the presentation of the behaviour of concern and the reinforcer.  This is achieved because the reinforcer is delivered independently of the presentation of the behaviour of concern. At the same time staff are modelling a more socially acceptable way for ML to communicate that he would like to spend time alone (waving of the hand). The full rationale is outlined in exhibit HE3.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:0.98in">Since the introduction of the behaviour support programme the day service has seen a drop in the amount of incidents to a maximum of 5 in one month, from up to 12 previously; with no incidents that have caused harm to others in a 3 month period.  Analysis of the incident reports also indicates that the length of time of incidents has decreased from a maximum of 5 hours per day to a maximum 3 minutes.  The intensity of incidents has also seen a decrease, with 55% of incidents post intervention requiring minimal response from his support team and not interrupting his activity, compared with 21% prior to the intervention - Exhibit HE4.</p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:0.98in">I feel that the current approach to supporting ML is successful, although it is slow paced, and we have seen a decrease in both the frequency and intensity of behaviours of concern and an increase in the amount of time that staff are spending in the space that has been dedicated to ML.  It must be acknowledged that ML only currently spends 15 hours per week at the day service.  The aims of the Behaviour Support Programme are now to increase the amount of time that staff are actively engaged in meaningful activity with ML &#8211; Exhibit HE5</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:0.98in">In terms of the NAS continuing to support ML it is my opinion that whilst his levels of anxiety and physical aggression remain at current frequency and intensity then ML is not posing a high risk to those supporting him, himself or others who use the service.  I would be cautious about using any other approach at the day service than the current Behaviour Support Programme, which relies on Non-contingent reinforcement, in which staff give ML structured periods of time when they are not in his company, as well as teaching functionally equivalent skills for him to tell us that he wants us to leave (rather than use of physical aggression), as this is having the affect of decreasing the number of incidents that ML is having, however it is a slow process and would need ML to continue to have his own safe space  at the centre and to be more tolerant of staff before we can begin to look at preference assessment to find other activities that interest him.</p>

It is also equally clear that this difference did not engender any creative thinking in which both views were respected.  Rather, in my judgment, it led to an oppositional approach in which, I regret to say, ML&#8217;s best interests were frequently eclipsed by disagreement in which the defence of theory and amour propre became the priority.   The sadness of it, in my view, is that there is a real legitimacy in both perspectives.  In her evidence Ms Eyers responsibly but with some regret recognised that the rate of progress made by ML at the Day Centre was very slow.  The resources at the Day Centre were of necessity limited compared to the Bestwood option, so too was the time that they had with ML.  I cannot say for sure, though I suspect that she had also seen in Mr Weston&#8217;s evidence, his strong sense of ML&#8217;s unfulfilled potential which emerged guilessly in his descriptions of him.</p>

In other words, every time ML is aggressive or threatens to be aggressive, it typically results in the removal of the aversive stimulus which, for ML, is the proximity of a person, the expectation of interaction with a person or other unwanted task demands or a combination of these factors.  Introduction of any of these absent elements automatically and often abruptly raises the probability of aggression&#8221;.

Dr McCann certainly did not accept the gains the NAS Day Centre considered were being made.  In my view, however, the reality is that professional polarisation, and ultimately rather poor professional communication had obscured the picture to a degree that inhibited accurate assessment.

Nonetheless, with that caveat in mind, it implies that if ML is confronted with something he does not like (stimuli of any kind) his fight instinct is aroused.  The essence of the technique is to not respond in spite of the aggression and to continue the stimulus.  It seems inevitable that until ML realises that his aggression is not causing the removal of the stimulus his aggression will accelerate.  Breaking through this cycle, as I understand it, is termed the &#8220;extinction burst&#8221;.  As ML recognised, he and EL are simply not able to manage this strategy.  The reality (as opposed to the theory) is very painful and distressing both emotionally and likely physically too.  BL told me he was profoundly afraid for his son, frightened about the technique and about the consequences if as he puts it &#8220;it all goes wrong&#8221;.</p>

I have found that to be a very disturbing document indeed.  BL was unrepresented at this hearing and so I, on his behalf put this document under considerable forensic scrutiny.  It is intrinsic to BL&#8217;s case that ML&#8217;s past treatment at the Vale Hospital has a direct bearing on future treatment and the declarations sought to enable such treatment to be implemented.  Analysing carefully the periods of &#8216;seclusion&#8217; whilst at the Vale Hospital is therefore crucial to this forensic process. BL is not a lawyer, he is a father.  Though very effective in other aspects of the presentation of the case, the material relating to seclusion was something he found difficult to organise and evaluate.  In my judgment that period was so full of pain for him as a father he could barely face revisiting it.  His distress was visible despite his determination to remain controlled.</p>

Both the framework of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> are rigorous in affording a regime of both protection and review.  Public funding for family members in both systems is rarely available and so they regularly appear unrepresented.  This inevitably imposes an even greater burden on the offices of the Official Solicitor to ensure that those who they represent are fully protected.  The enquiry into the extent and safety of ML&#8217;s detention in the Vale Hospital here was Judge led.  It ought not to have been necessary for it to be so.  The facts ought to have triggered, at very least, forensic curiosity.  The Official Solicitor has provided, valuable assistance on the legal issues the case raises but the welfare investigation was, in my judgement, not sufficiently searching.</p>

She is very experienced, she is, as is already evident from this judgment, forthright in her manner of expression.  I should have thought that anyone hearing her views on this particular issue would have responded immediately and with some alarm.  Astonishingly, and I do not use that word lightly, what followed was an email exchange that challenged the necessity of the additional padding largely on the grounds of expense.  On one occasion ML knocked himself unconscious and on another may have sustained two black eyes.  I say &#8216;may&#8217; here because there is a possibility that the black and swollen eyes were the consequence of rubbing eyes affected by hay fever.  ML is very resistant to physical examination and the Doctor who saw him was unable to come to a conclusion.  Ms Freeman preferred the more benign explanation but with respect to her the proper course was to have remained open minded.</p>

ML&#8217;s safety and his dignity were avoidably compromised.

It is distinctly possible he will not want to see them in hospital.  If his behaviour were to deteriorate, as it did following the Vale admission, he would potentially be entirely unmanageable in the community (as Ms Freeman already feels he is)  and there would in effect be no way back.  ML would have lost the delicate security of the present status quo and be consigned to permanent institutional care.  For BL that heartbreaking prospect is simply too great a risk.</p>

Autism is included within the category of mental disorder as is apparent from the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> Code of Practice  (the &#8220;1983 COP&#8221;) at paragraphs 3.13 to 3.17.  There is also particular reference to autism in Chapter 34.  It is clear, to my mind, that such is the extent of ML&#8217;s difficulties stemming from his autism that he falls within the category of Learning Disability defined pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> (sub<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref>).  Here all agree that ML&#8217;s autism in and of itself is a mental disorder encompassed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Applicant and the Official Solicitor diverge as to which is the correct framework.  The Applicant submits that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> provides the Court with jurisdiction to authorise the deprivation of ML&#8217;s liberty and should be used for that purpose and to make the further orders and declarations necessary in these proceedings.  The Official Solicitor disagrees, he contends that the Mental Health Act is the only regime by which ML can be detained at Bestwood Hospital.  Any deprivation of ML&#8217;s liberty can not, the argument runs, be authorised under the Mental Capacity Act because ML is &#8216;within the scope of the MHA (within the meaning of paragraph 12 to schedule 1A and the conditions in paragraph 5 to Schedule 1A are met).  I will analyse these below but I record here that the Applicants submit that if they are wrong as to the scope and reach of the MCA, a lacunae emerges which can be accommodated by use of the inherent jurisdictional powers of the High Court to authorise ML&#8217;s treatment and deprivation of liberty.  That, counters the Official Solicitor, would be to subvert the will of Parliament as expressed in the MHA and absent a true lacunae would be an unlawful use of the inherent jurisdictional powers.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">BL aligns himself entirely with the Official Solicitor&#8217;s interpretation of the law.  He does so not in a passive or uninformed way.  On the contrary, BL is alert to the significant advantages and disadvantages of the two legal frameworks.  From his own perspective he is acutely aware that his wife has historically been successful in discharging ML from detention under the MHA.  Indeed in the light of my findings he and his wife will recognise that I have, by implication, endorsed the tribunal&#8217;s decision given my findings relating to ML&#8217;s detention whilst at the Vale Hospital. I have already stated that BL and EL are profoundly resistant to the Bestwood option.  Their resistance is almost irrational because, as BL readily accepts, it is rooted in fear.  The parents fear is that ML may in consequence of this decision be condemned to permanent institutional care if Bestwood is ultimately unsuccessful in its objectives.  It has been emphasised that if the treatment at Bestwood is to be effective it would take between 18 months and 24 months perhaps even longer.  It is simply not possible to be more precise about timescales.  Undoubtedly there will be difficult and challenging times.  It seems to be distinctly possible that at some point within this contemplated period there will be incidents which are so distressing to BL and EL and indeed to ML himself that BL and EL will feel compelled to try to derail the assessment, albeit as I emphasise through the best of intentions.  In my judgement BL aligns himself with the Official Solicitor&#8217;s arguments because he believes he will have greater prospect of halting the treatment if he perceives that to be necessary, by application to the Mental Health Tribunal who will not have had the advantage of hearing everything that I have heard in this case.  I do not intend to be in any way discourteous to BL by being so blunt.  It is entirely natural that he should build what perceived advantages he can into the options available to him for the future given his fundamental resistance to the Applicants&#8217; plan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Conversely, it is precisely because I have heard so much evidence on such difficult and sensitive issues that the Applicants are keen that I, as a Judge of the Court of Protection, retain conduct of the case.  The only basis upon which I could achieve this they recognise is to make orders and declarations under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> both in relation to &#8216;best interest&#8217; and in authorising the deprivation of liberty and any further treatment, seclusion or restraint.  The importance of judicial continuity as a protective measure in and of itself has been emphasised repeatedly in relation to vulnerable children in proceedings in the Family Division (see, for example, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D (a child) sub nom F v M</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 1 FLR 226" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 1 FLR 226</ref>; [2004] Fam Law 490 in which Munby J, as he then was, emphasised not only the importance of judicial continuity but also consistency of judicial approach in shaping the strategy of a case.)  These principles have distinct resonance in relation to incapacitous adults.  I confess that I was very much attracted to this course and I applaud the efforts Mr McKendrick has made in seeking to analyse the law in such a way as to facilitate such an outcome.  Ultimately however, I have come, somewhat reluctantly, to the conclusion that to follow the course the Applicants&#8217; contend for would strain both the language and the underpinning philosophy in section 16 A (1) of the Mental Capacity Act, clunking and inelegant though the wording of that section is.  </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;Para 38.  In response to the Official Solicitor&#8217;s invitation, I would hold that, in order to succeed in an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/29" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 29</ref>, the applicant must demonstrate that the statutory criteria are met out both at the date of the application and at the date of the hearing.  The Judge held that the language of the section indicated that the relevant date is the date of application. In that I think that he was right.  The language of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/29" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 29</ref> demonstrates jurisdiction arises upon an application being made in accordance with the provision of the sections.  The identity of the applicant is set by sub<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> on the grounds by sub<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref>.  The grounds so defined are described in the present tense as at the date of the application (grounds|) (a), (b) and (c) or, in relation to ground (d), the past and future tense are reference to the date of  application.  The Judge rightly looked to the decision Re M 1994 2AC 424 as a relevant analogy.  The argument there approved applies even more strongly to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/29" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 29</ref> which directly links the grounds to the making of the application whereas <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> links the grounds to the making of the order.  However the grounds in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/29/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 29 (3)</ref> not only specify the basis of the courts jurisdiction but also its power to make an order.  In consequence I am of the opinion that the Judge must also be satisfied that the grounds exist at the date of the final hearing.&#8221;</p>

That seems to me not merely speculative but likely. Such a situation might trigger, he contemplates, an application by the &#8216;nearest relative&#8217;, already fundamentally resistant to the regime, to apply to discharge ML from his section under the Mental Health Act.  Mr McKendrick then postulates a situation in which the tribunal come to consider episodes in isolation and without the history that this Court has to put them in context.  From one perspective, albeit not one I agree with, this could be said to have happened in the past.  The worst possible situation for ML I have been told by all involved is for the Bestwood plan to breakdown.  That would have catastrophic consequences for ML&#8217;s welfare.</p>

I can, as Mr Patel has alluded to, reserve to myself any application to displace the nearest relative by constituting myself as a Judge of the County Court but there is no equivalent opportunity for me to substitute myself as the Chair of the Mental Health Tribunal.  I do however consider that some of these concerns can be addressed in the proposals that I set out below.  It is suggested that the second limb of the test under paragraph 12 could not be met because ML could &#8216;not be detained in hospital because in relation to an application for detention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> it is more likely than not his nearest relative would object.&#8217;  As I have said that is not an inference I feel able to draw at this stage. My real concern is an application to discharge the section at some stage in the treatment process.  That would be particularly damaging because, as all the professionals have agreed, disruption of the therapeutic programme before it was completed could have catastrophic consequences for ML.  Most likely of which being that he would have a very poor prospect of returning to community living at all.  </p>

I also propose to release this judgment to the President of the First Tier Tribunal with an invitation to him to allocate a judge of the First Tier to hear any applications in this case, to ensure judicial continuity.  I will provide that a copy of this judgment follows this case.</p>

To accommodate the hearing of this case it was necessary to sit long hours and to overrun into the following case. No time was allocated to read the extensive papers in advance. Two volumes of authorities were presented in closing submission, and no time at all had been allocated to reflect on the submissions to write the judgment or to reflect on the submissions.</p>

Those who practice within the Court of Protection must understand that it is part of the responsibility of the lawyers to ensure that there are realistic time estimates given to the court. The instinct to underestimate the timescale of a case in order that it might be heard more expeditiously is misconceived as this case certainly has proved. I make these observations because this case is far from an isolated example.  That said I have received invaluable assistance from all Counsel to whom I am extremely grateful.</p>
