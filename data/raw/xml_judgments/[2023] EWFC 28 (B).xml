The Court was concerned with cross-applications from each of the respondents. The proceedings came to an end on 20 September 2022.  The local authority had prepared a section 7 report for the Court.  The author of the report concluded that the children had witnessed serious domestic abuse perpetrated by the father towards the mother over a period of time, and had also experienced abuse directly from him.  The author of the report recommended that the father should not have any caring responsibilities for the children, and that the children should not have any contact with their father at all, not even supervised contact. </span></p>

He said that the mother had illegally obtained recordings of his private conversations, and that it was this evidence that was the foundation of the social services&#8217; recommendations.  Stating that he had lost faith in the system, he said that he wished to withdraw his application, and would consent to an order reflecting social services&#8217; recommendations.</span></p>

I made orders in line with their recommendations, providing that the father should not have any contact with his children, due to the risks he posed to both them and their mother, and consistent with the girls&#8217; own wishes and feelings, based on their own experiences of him.

The reasons given for wanting further information, as either &#8216;mitigation&#8217; or &#8216;corroboration of defence&#8217;, are not explained and cannot on their own justify disclosure of material from the Family Court.</span></p>

The father has been convicted of assault against the mother, is the subject of a lifetime restraining order, and protective orders in the Family Court.  The police have attended MARAC meetings and have all the CCTV and audio material.  </span></p>

The applicant has not set out in submissions that the Re EC checklist approach should be applied to private law as well as public law proceedings.  But assuming the checklist does apply, the Court would need to carry out a balancing exercise, with reference to each of the Re EC checklist factors.  It is not enough to have cut and paste the factors into a skeleton argument.  I have not been provided with evidence or analysis to enable me to carry out that process.</span></p>

The documents would be disclosed to the police, to the Crown Prosecution Service, and the application is for the material to be used within any subsequent criminal proceedings, so they are likely to end up in the public domain.  Any impact upon the mother is likely to have a significant impact on the welfare of the children.  The application has no regard to this at all, and invites me to disclose documents merely on the basis that they may be relevant to their investigation.</span></p>
