An ACO is not a judge of the Court of Protection, but a civil servant, who, in most cases, has considerable experience of the court&#8217;s practice and procedure and is authorised to make a number of specified decisions on the non-contentious property and affairs side of the court&#8217;s business. Over 90% of the applications to the court involve non-contentious property and financial matters, and can potentially be dealt with by an ACO.</p>

GN was not given notice of the application because CN specifically asked me not to. Additionally, Social Services and Harrow Association of Disabled People specifically confirmed at the time of my application that the family were estranged for several years, save for DN who lived in Jamaica. DN was, of course, notified of my proposed application and raised no objections thereto. At the time of the application I had been alerted to the fact that there had been allegations that GN had physically assaulted his mother, not only from her directly but also from three independent sources and I therefore believed it was inappropriate to include him as a respondent and to respect the wishes of CN.&#8221;</p>

Whenever I tried to speak to my mother about it she always became very angry and violent. Due to her drug and alcohol abuse my mother was prone to bad tempers and violence, culminating when asked why she had chosen to cheat me. CN destroyed my belongings when I was at work and attacked me with a bottle when I got home from work. I had no choice but to call the police but chose not to press charges. I also had to pay a visit to Northwick Park Hospital to get my injuries caused by the bottle she had used seen to, including having my eyebrow glued back together. Fearing for my safety I was left with no other option but to leave the property. I have an equitable interest in the property.
