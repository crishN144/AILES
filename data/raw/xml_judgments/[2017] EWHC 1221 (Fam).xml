On the 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> March 2017 I handed down a judgment in which I analysed the basis upon which the &#8216;threshold criteria&#8217; were met pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31 (2)</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

On the 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> April 2017 I heard submissions in relation to a planned move for H to MCU.  The evidence pointed overwhelmingly to such a move being in H&#8217;s best interests.  It needs to be emphasised that H is at the centre of this process.  The proceedings are driven by an imperative both to identify and promote his welfare needs.  </span></p>

There were 40 lever arch files of medical records which were the subject of comprehensive submissions by counsel and which required to be addressed fully.

I concluded that this had led not only to his emotional harm but to his physical harm.  In consequence, particularly of the exaggerated gastrointestinal pain, there was the unnecessary insertion and thereafter the prolonged use of a&#160;Hickman line, which exposed H not merely to the risk of short-term infection, but to the risk of liver failure in the long term.  It perhaps requires to be underlined that in consequence of his parents' actions H's life was placed in peril.</span></p>

In the hospital it generated a&#160;febrile atmosphere in which there was an&#160;elevated risk of clinical error, I found this compromised H's safety.  </span></p>

The effect of this, though it did not immediately threaten H&#8217;s health was, again, to cause confusion and alarm on the ward and jeopardise professional objectivity.</span></p>

The mother presented H to the world as dying, in extremely alarming e-mails.  Moreover, on the evidence, she inculcated in H himself, a&#160;view that he was dying.  The parents' actions led to prolonged stays in hospital, the consequence of which was that H has been robbed of much of his childhood and teenage years.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.19in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This is of course a desperate situation made all the more depressing by the fact that H has an outstanding, lively, irrepressible intellect and a keen and zany sense of humour.  It is a tragedy that these talents have not been allowed to flourish and grow as they ought to have been.  I reiterate, in order that the point is not lost in the detail of my&#160;judgment, the harm caused to H by his parents, protracted over many years, exposed him to significant harm at the most serious end of the spectrum, ultimately risking his life.</span></p>

Initially, all that was available was &#8216;Unit A&#8217; which I shall not name as there are other vulnerable young people living there.  From the very beginning nobody thought that it was a facility that would be sufficiently equipped either to assess or evaluate the complex panoply of H's needs.  </span></p>

I caused it to be checked with the doctors whether H could eat orally now and I have been told that he can.  Staff at Unit A did not have the medical qualifications to make such an assessment.  The social services have been advised that H should be tempted by foods that he is interested in and encouraged, in consultation with a&#160;dietician, to try to eat. This has not yet been achieved.  Again, this is not part of the training or experience of those who work at Unit A.  </span></p>

I exhorted both parents to support H in that move because he was understandably apprehensive, picking up, I find, chiefly on his mother's own anxieties.

However, with the agreement of all the advocates, I visited H at the unit.  It was very plain that H was anxious, to say the least, about going to Great Ormond Street.  I spent, it is recorded, fractionally more than an&#160;hour with him.  I add my voice to the many others.  I found him delightful, stimulating and very good company, with a&#160;wide range of interests.  His central preoccupation was, of course, his access to the outside world via the Internet.  The restrictions contemplated are very hard for him to bear.  I am entirely satisfied that they are necessary, not least because they are the route by which H can communicate with his mother, who is, as I have said, so extremely resistant to this assessment and to the MCU.   Moreover, because the assessment itself is multidisciplinary and wide ranging it requires to be undertaken in a calm and cooperative atmosphere and for H this will likely be more constructive away from the endless stimulation that the Internet brings.</span></p>

It has been necessary for me today to inquire as to what in fact led to the visit, which all agreed took place, between Ms&#160;Reid and H at the unit on 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> May.</span></p>

Today there were filed, on behalf of Ms&#160;Reid, a&#160;number of e-mail communications, which have been helpfully set out by Mr&#160;Browne QC and Mr&#160;Wolanski, who represent her through Associated Newspapers Limited.   A key communication is an&#160;e-mail sent at 18:30 on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> May by H&#8217;s mother to a&#160;Miss&#160;Miray Kester, whom she describes as a friend.  It is clear from that email and the earlier discourse that it was intended to provide a summary of H&#8217;s situation from the mother&#8217;s own perspective.  It is, characteristically, a gross distortion of the facts.  It presents H, in melodramatic terms, brutalised and neglected by the system.  Yet again the mother describes H as suffering from serious illness.  As those reading my earlier judgment will appreciate and as time has now borne out, H is not suffering from any serious illness.  Those conditions which he does have are not seriously debilitating. </span></p>

Firstly, I am satisfied that, in the context of the email communication as a whole, the email I have referred to above was written by the mother as a briefing document for the press.  The document, which I do not propose to read into this judgment, speaks for itself.  Secondly, Ms&#160;Reid obtained H's telephone number and spoke to him directly before she spoke to the mother.  This she agreed in evidence.  Thirdly, Ms&#160;Reid later spoke to the mother on the telephone and the conversation lasted some 40 or so minutes.  In that conversation Ms&#160;Reid plainly formed the view that the mother was at her wits' end, very distressed and agitated.  Much of the content of the e-mail of 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> May seems to have been replicated in that conversation, which Ms Reid agrees took place.  </span></p>

She refers to his </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;being locked away&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and she caricatures it as a&#160;focus on </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;mental disorder&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> rather than the contemplated across the board evaluation of his needs that I have described.  This is all deep-seated, the mother has been hostile to Great Ormond Street now for many years.  It was very much a&#160;feature of her evidence in January and February of this year.  The mother denies giving Ms Reid permission to speak to her son.  However, she says: had this journalist asked me directly if she could have permission to speak to my son, I would have said yes.  But, she says, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;it was never asked&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.  </span></p>

The mother is highly manipulative, as Ms Reid has now plainly found out.  I think it unlikely that she gave her express permission but I am quite clear that she enthusiastically contrived with Ms Reid to facilitate the interview.  Ms Reid told me, and I accept, that the mother gave her the address and details of the unit.</span></p>

This struck me as a somewhat bizarre observation from a journalist of Ms Reid&#8217;s seniority.  She is the &#8216;Special Investigations Editor&#8217; for the Daily Mail.  I should have thought that a healthy degree of scepticism would underpin everything she does.  </span></p>

Ms&#160;Reid went to Unit A.  She did not make herself known to the staff.  She did not identify herself as a&#160;journalist and she did not seek permission from a&#160;responsible executive to enter these non-public areas.  It is also clear and again she accepts that she was aware that H was subject to a Care Order (in fact it is an Interim Care Order but that is of no consequence here).</span></p>
