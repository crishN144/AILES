However, on 7 September 2022 the mother travelled to the UK with the children. The same day their father reported their abduction to the police in Italy. The police contacted the mother by telephone.

It reports that the mother had stated that if the court ordered the children&#8217;s return to Italy, she would accompany them. She also told the reporter that the children had told her that their father and paternal grandmother had physically chastised them with a belt and that the children did not want to go back to Italy.</p>

L told her that she did not like living with her father and his mother in Italy as they hit her and S with a belt on the legs. L emphasised that she wanted to remain in the UK. She would be sad if the judge ordered return. She thought her mother would be sad too. If the mother accompanied them, she would not feel as sad, but she still would not want to return. S did not want to talk about her father or her paternal grandmother or her life in Italy, she said she would be scared if she saw her father but would not say why. S wanted the judge to say that she and her sister can stay in the UK. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">On 21 March 2023, the mother applied to vary the order of Mr Verdan KC to permit her to return the children to Italy after she had recovered from her elective C-section. The application was heard on 23 March 2023 by which time the mother was 35 weeks pregnant. The position statement filed on behalf of the mother for that sets out how the mother&#8217;s legal representatives learned during the February 2023 hearing that the mother was pregnant. It accepts that the court and the father&#8217;s legal representatives at the hearing in February 2023 were informed. The February hearing had proceeded on the basis that there was no reason the mother could not travel to Italy with the children. The judge rejected arguments for delaying return based on the mother&#8217;s lack of support in Italy after the birth of her child and the fact it would leave her unable to care for L and S. The position statement makes it clear (see paragraph 21) that the mother was not then seeking to set aside the return order rather she was seeking an extension of the time by which the children were to be returned. Given the advance stage of the mother&#8217;s pregnancy the father took a pragmatic stance and agreed to extend the time for the children&#8217;s return to 14 June 2023.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">Within my bundles, I had the report from the jointly instructed Italian lawyer, Avv Achironpaola Cortazzo. Within that report, she explained that because of notice to return letter that the mother had received on 10 June 2023, the mother had been invited by the Italian Prosecuting authority to declare an address in Italy at which she would receive all further communications in relation to the criminal proceedings. If she had not done so, then the notice stated that the mother should proceed to appoint defence counsel to assist her in the proceedings. The mother should declare that she wishes to receive communications at her lawyer&#8217;s office. In the absence of appointing her own lawyer or declaring an address in Italy at which she wishes to receive further communications, Avv Cortazzo advised that the mother will be represented and defended by a lawyer assigned to her by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. On the basis of the notification order (and having no other documents or information), Avv Cortazzo<span style="font-style:italic"/>reported that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it can only be stated that there is a criminal proceeding pending against [the mother] for the offence of abduction and detention of children abroad ... and that on the date of 26.5.2023 the proceedings against [the mother] were in the preliminary investigation stage</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>Her report, in summary, stated that the Prosecutor may decide to dismiss the proceedings because she believes from the evidence gathered during the investigation it is not possible to make a reasonable prediction of conviction, but she may consider the complaint well-founded and bring it to trial. The crime is being prosecuted <span style="font-style:italic">ex officio </span>and the father cannot do anything to stop that prosecution. The decision to continue the investigation is a matter for the Prosecutor&#8217;s discretion.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">In her report, Avv Cortazzo analysed the risks for the mother of arrest and detention should she return to Italy. In her opinion the precautionary measure of placing her in custody could not be applied because the crime the mother is accused of is punishable by one to four years. in prison. House arrest could be applied but only if there was a danger of absconding and a judge considered the mother will commit another crime against the person and family care. Thus, in the opinion of Avv Cortazzo, the likelihood of the mother being placed under house arrest is low, but it cannot be ruled out. Avv Cortazzo would need more information to say how long any proceedings will last. In terms of the ultimate sentence the mother could receive if convicted, the offence is subject to is one to four years imprisonment. However, the judge has a discretion, and the mother&#8217;s character and the likelihood of reoffending would be considered. Failing to return the children to Italy without valid explanation and failing to co-operate with the Italian authorities would be aggravating features. Those features would preclude qualification for non-punishability for tenuity to act (the non-application of a sanction even though the defendant is guilty). Failing to return the children may cause a judge not to grant a suspended sentence and thus she would not have the possibility of the crime being extinguished after five years. By not engaging with the Italian authorities, in Avv Cortazzo&#8217;s opinion, the mother is depriving herself of the right to plea bargain which remains open until the trial is opened in court and the ability to accept probation, which once completed, extinguishes the offence. The birth of the mother&#8217;s third child would have no ultimate influence on sentence, but it would mean that whilst her third child was under one year of age, the sentence would not be carried out and the execution of sentence, including imprisonment, could be postponed by the judge until her third child reaches the age of three years.</p>

I listened carefully to what she had to say. As she was cross-examined on behalf of the mother, she stated again that the offence for which the mother is being investigated is ex officio. The investigation will thus continue regardless of the views of the victim of the offence. The notification the mother had received usually meant that it was likely that the preliminary stage of the proceedings was coming to an end. If the prosecutor has an address for the person under investigation, then they can inform that person whether the investigation is continuing or coming to an end. That is the purpose of the notification. </p>

She reiterated her advice in relation to Precautionary measures (pre-trial measures). Prison was not an option and house arrest unlikely. If the mother were to return to Italy with the children, co-operate with the authorities, then there would be no risk of absconding and no need for precautionary measures such as house arrest. If she cooperated with the Italian authorities and took the children back, it was at least possible the investigation would conclude or the offence would be expunged but if that did not happen, then her sentence would be likely to be suspended or community-based such as probation.</p>

		<paragraph>
		  <intro>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention is predicated on the principles of international comity and confidence. As such, it has created a summary jurisdiction intended to ensure that applications made pursuant to it are determined expeditiously. Intrinsic to the Convention is a recognition that delay in the legal process is likely to be inimical to the child's welfare. Underpinning the philosophy of the Convention, is an understanding that a speedy return of the child to his home country will, in principle, enable the child's future to be determined more effectively. The exception which arises in cases where a child objects to return is generated by two conditions: first, that the child himself objects to being returned and second, that he has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to have regard to his views. As is well established, this does not mean that the child's views are determinative, or even presumptively so. The court has a discretion which it will exercise, bearing in mind the nature and strength of the child's objections, particularly, the extent to which they are authentically his own and not merely reflective of the influence, intentional or otherwise, of the abducting parent. Thus, the Convention does not yield identical results in all cases. The central principles that I have mentioned have to be weighed alongside the facts which produce the exception and such pointers as there are which illuminate the welfare of the particular child. As Baroness Hale stated in Re M (Abduction: Rights of Custody) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2007/55" uk:canonical="[2007] UKHL 55" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] UKHL 55</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 3 WLR 975" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 3 WLR 975</ref>, at paragraph 48:</span></p>

Indeed, in almost all cases it will not be possible to exclude entirely the risk that the abducting parent will face arrest and prosecution on return. The authorities make clear that this risk will generally not be sufficient to satisfy the terms of Art 13(b).</span></p>

First, a parent who chooses to abduct a child from one jurisdiction to another must expect to be the subject of arrest and prosecution. That is simply one of the proper consequences of a parent unwisely taking the law into his or her own hands rather than seeking relief through the courts. It sits ill in the mouth of a parent who has abducted a child to complain about the consequent risk of arrest and prosecution. Within this context, there is a principled argument that the court seeking to enforce the return of the child, and thereby maintain fidelity to an international instrument designed to discourage and prevent child abduction, has no business trying to protect the abducting parent from arrest and prosecution upon their return under domestic laws designed to achieve precisely the same end.</span></p>

In my judgment, it is perfectly proper for the father to ensure that his undertaking does not bring him into conflict with the domestic laws of the United States. Once again, there is a principled argument that it would be entirely wrong to expect the innocent left behind parent to place themselves in conflict with the laws of their home country in order to prevent the lawful arrest and prosecution of the culpable abducting parent. In short, it is wrong in principle to expect the left behind parent to assume some of the legal risk created by the abducting parent by giving undertakings that have the potential to or do come into conflict with the laws of the home state. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the caveats the father places on his undertaking are both reasonable and necessary.</span></p>

The objective of the Convention is to ensure that a child who has been removed unilaterally from the country of his or her habitual residence in breach of rights of custody is returned forthwith in order that the courts in that country can decide his or her long-term future. It is likewise important to recall that a decision by the court to return a child under the terms of the Convention is, no more and no less, a decision to return the child for a specific purpose and for a limited period of time pending the court of his or her habitual residence deciding the long-term position.</span></p>

She took matters into her own hands and acted without the sanction of the Italian family court or consent of the children&#8217;s father. The risk of criminal investigation, prosecution and potentially punishment in the Italian criminal courts which the mother says she fears springs from the mother&#8217;s abduction of the children. The mother&#8217;s case on the papers and before me singularly fails to acknowledge or appreciate that the criminal consequences she may face in Italy are the result of her own actions. </p>

However, the Italian proceedings are ex officio. That means that despite the father acting on his undertaking and withdrawing the original complaint, the criminal investigation and proceedings in Italy are continuing and their continuance remains a matter in the discretion of the Prosecutor. It has been argued on behalf of the mother that that is a risk which was not factored into the original order. However, I have reminded myself of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">H v K</span> (above). I agree. In almost all cases under the Convention it will not be possible to exclude entirely the risk of arrest and prosecution on return. The case before me is no different.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">Stripped back, the mother&#8217;s argument is unattractive. She will not return to Italy with the children for fear of arrest and detention. However, she has not taken and has no apparent intent to take any steps to mitigate and manage those risks. Because of those risks she refuses to return with the children and asserts the order for return is fundamentally undermined and the children will be at an intolerable risk of harm. I consider that there is an unpalatable circularity to the mother&#8217;s argument before me which is self-serving. Her refusal to return is based on a self-generated set of circumstances. In effect she has changed her mind. That change of mind is not on the evidence objectively reasonable. Indeed, it is objectively unreasonable.  I do not consider that an objectively unreasonable change of mind can amount to a fundamental change of circumstances. Nor, given the policy and principles behind, the Hague Convention, should it.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">Nevertheless, I have asked myself does the mother&#8217;s change of mind of itself fundamentally undermine the order made by Mr Verdan KC. I have considered the wording of the order of Mr Verdan KC with care. The basis of the return order itself is captured in paragraphs 3- 5 of the recital to the order wherein his primary findings are set out (see above). He found that the defence of the child&#8217;s objections was not made out but, in any event, he specifically stated he would have ordered return. He used the same formulation when considering the Art13(b) defence which had been advanced at that hearing. In the light of the father&#8217;s undertakings which included an undertaking to only have supervised contact pending the first hearing in relation to the children&#8217;s welfare in the Italian family court, he found the Art13(b) defence was not made &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">and in any event the court would have exercised its discretion to order a return</span>&#8221;.<span style="font-style:italic"/>The plain reading of that recital is that the pertinent and thus the cited protective measure was the father not having unsupervised contact with the children, not the mother&#8217;s presence in Italy.  The provision of supervised contact is and was not dependent on the mother&#8217;s presence in Italy or the children living with her. If the mother continues to refuse to return with the children, they could live elsewhere with the friends put forward by the father or in State care until the family court in Italy was seized of the matter. Where they live until the Italian court is seized of the matter in this case, I consider is ultimately an issue of implementation. It does not fundamentally undermine the return order.</p>
