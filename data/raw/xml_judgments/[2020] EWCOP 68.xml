	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">JK is an 18 year old woman who has been subject to a Deprivation of Liberty order since January 2020. The issue before me today is whether that order should now come to an end. I am extremely familiar with the case having had JK before me, remotely, on a number of occasions throughout 2020. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The background, relatively briefly, is that JK was diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 when she was 8 years old. She has had very many problems over the years with managing her diabetes and with her mental health. She has had frequent stays in hospital by reason of the diabetes, eating disorders and wider mental health issues. There has been extensive involvement by her Local Authority and by the Courts. In June 2018 Baker J made interim orders permitting treatment against her wishes and those orders were subsequently extended by Theis J. In August 2018 Theis J made a final order stating that JK lacked capacity in respect of her care and treatment. In October 2018 JK was admitted to a psychiatric unit under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. Sadly, JK then spent over 12 months in a psychiatric hospital. She was discharged to the care of her family but immediately had great difficulty in maintaining her treatment regime for her diabetes and was admitted back to hospital following an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis. There were a series of events in January 2020 when she was reported missing by her parents and did not comply with her treatment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 25 January 2020 JK was admitted to Intensive Care having had four seizures as a result of not controlling her diabetes. This was a consequence both of her not taking her insulin and of not controlling her diet as advised. On 26 January JK was placed in an induced coma.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 30 January HHJ Scarratt made an order depriving JK of her liberty at the Regional Hospital. She was assessed for being sectioned under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> but was found not to meet the statutory criteria. On 5 February she was transferred to KC Hospital and resided there under Deprivation of Liberty orders until 5 October 2020. JK first came in front of me on 10 March 2020 and I have had numerous hearings in the case since then.  At most of those hearings JK has been present and has spoken to me (remotely) and I feel I have got a reasonably good sense of her. JK is an intelligent and articulate young woman who feels a deep sense of frustration at what has happened to her. In particular, she is frustrated by the fact that her diabetes, combined with other factors, has prevented her from having a more normal childhood and from doing the things that she wants to do. She now wants to get on with her life in as normal a way as possible. JK is very strongly driven, and sometimes drives herself too hard. It is plain, even from relatively short hearings, that JK can become very emotional when stressed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Whilst at KC Hospital there was some history of JK absconding, particularly in the early months, but she became more accepting of the regime she was required to live under and the restrictions upon her. In the main, given that JK was a 17 year old who was being kept in a hospital ward for months on end and not let out very much, I think she coped quite well with the experience. JK&#8217;s restrictions at the hospital have been made more difficult by the fact that it has taken place against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Hospital has been understandably concerned to minimise the risk of Covid-19 being spread within the Hospital and therefore has been very concerned that JK does not leave for short periods and meet with other people. This has created a more restrictive regime for her than might otherwise have been necessary.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Through the summer, extensive efforts were made by all concerned to find a more appropriate placement for JK so that she could leave the Hospital. She was closely involved in these efforts and in the final decision that she should be discharged to a supported placement run by AV. This is an independent placement where JK is the only person living there but with 24/7 care and support. She is supported on a 1:1 basis and the staff have been trained in diabetes management. There was a transition period but ultimately JK was discharged from hospital and went to live full time at AV on 5 October 2020. </p>

I had continued the case under the inherent jurisdiction for as long as possible because that meant that she still had the benefit of the Guardian Ms Mitchell, and there were no difficulties with legal aid. The Hospital Trust were also very helpful in keeping JK in a children&#8217;s ward for a period after her birthday to maximise continuity of both care and staff for her.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is a very great credit to JK that despite all these difficulties she obtained a place at a university near where she has been living and has been undertaking a university course since September 2020. JK&#8217;s ambition is to go into the police and in the short term to become a Special Constable, at least in part because of help that she has received from the police in the past. It is not merely that this is highly admirable in itself, but also JK&#8217;s focus on this ambition is plainly helpful in motivating her to keep on track and to abide by the restrictions placed upon her. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">After about three weeks at AV, on 28 October JK was admitted to A&amp;E as a result of high ketone levels and stayed overnight. Both AV and Dr Price, her treating paediatrician, consider that the admission was as a result of JK&#8217;s mismanagement of her diabetes. I note that although the Deprivation of Liberty order was in place, it was not necessary to force JK to go to hospital, she did so voluntarily.  It happened that there was a hearing fixed for 29 October and I therefore saw JK that day. She was exhausted but determined to try to keep up with her university course and her application to be a Special Constable. She was very clear at that hearing that she wanted the proceedings to end and the Deprivation of Liberty order to come to an end. This was in part because she wanted her autonomy, but also more specifically because she has been told that she cannot be made a Special Constable if there is a Deprivation of Liberty order in place.  </p>

His principal conclusions are: (a) JK has capacity to make decisions about the care and treatment of her diabetes, except when she is under considerable distress and has overwhelming emotions; (b) during those times JK is unable to weigh information about the management of her diabetes condition and during those periods she lacks capacity to manage her diabetes; (c) developing skills to cope with her extreme emotion will help JK to develop her capacity. In particular, Dialectic Behavioural Therapy would be beneficial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">The LA wishes the Deprivation of Liberty order to continue, albeit in a limited form. Mr Squire submits that JK continues to lack capacity when she is under stress and at those times, she is unable to weigh the information about her treatment. He relies on the great risk posed to JK if she does not comply with her insulin and diet regime. Dr Price&#8217;s medical reports explain that JK&#8217;s diabetes requires two forms of insulin administration: one injection of long-acting insulin which must be taken daily at the same time each day, and the second is short-acting insulin which must be taken with food, and the dose calculated according to sustenance intake. This is usually required 4-5 times each day. If JK does not have insulin administered as required, she will develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This may lead to JK developing cerebral oedema. If mismanaged, JK is at real and significant risk of death.  </p>

There is also the complication of cerebral oedema (which can occur during treatment of DKA), this is a swelling of the brain which leads to coma and death if not treated. Even with treatment the mortality risk is high. [JK] has had cerebral oedema also on several occasions, episodes which required intensive care admission.

The only restriction is that for periods when she becomes ill and loses capacity, the LA can restrain her for medication and take her to hospital.

The Strasbourg Court necessarily considers the position once the events in issue have arisen and therefore has concrete facts upon which to decide whether there has been a deprivation of liberty which engages article 5. The position here is that the LA wish to have authorisation to take measures which, in their view, would amount to a deprivation of liberty even if in practice they may not do so. It appears to me that in those circumstances the appropriate course is for me to assume that there would be such a deprivation, even if in reality the restraints placed upon JK (if they happen) would be either too fleeting or too consensual to meet the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Storck</span> tests.  </p>

It is important that she can explain to the Court those wishes and feelings at a point when she has undoubtedly got capacity. That factor alone must lead to the Court giving more weight to those wishes and feelings.  It is also important that she has the insight to understand that there are times when she gets highly stressed and has in the past struggled to deal appropriately with her diabetes. JK is entirely clear that she does not wish the Deprivation of Liberty order to continue. Her reasons can be summarised in two parts. Firstly, she very much wants her autonomy and not to feel that she is under the control of the Court. She undoubtedly currently feels considerable stress around the Court proceedings and the sense that the Court is making decisions about her life, which she feels she should make. Further, the effect of the Deprivation of Liberty order is that she feels under constant scrutiny and supervision, which itself is highly unsettling. Secondly, the existence of the Deprivation of Liberty order makes it impossible for JK to become a Special Constable and ultimately to pursue her ambition of becoming a Police Officer. She feels that the Deprivation of Liberty order is having a highly detrimental impact on her life. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In determining what weight to give to JK&#8217;s wishes and feelings, an important factor is her age. JK is now 18 and thus an adult. She has a right, within the bounds of the MCA, to personal autonomy. A Deprivation of Liberty order, quite apart from engaging article 5 is also a very serious intrusion into her article 8 right to a private life and to personal autonomy. Although such an intrusion can, of course, be justified under article 8(2), those factors need to be balanced in determining whether it is in her best interests to make the order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">The LA understandably have a highly protective approach to JK. The LA argue that past history shows that when JK gets stressed she loses the ability to control her diabetes and this puts her life at very serious risk. The medical evidence is clear that if she does not take her insulin she could die, and that very serious complications can come on at great speed. Those risks are manifest, and very significant. However, I refer to the judgment of Mr Justice Munby, as he then was, in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Local Authority X v</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">MM &amp; Anor</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2007/2003" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 2003 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 2003 (Fam)</ref> at [120] and the importance of understanding that those who lack capacity, must, to a proportionate degree, be allowed to take risks and to test out their own capabilities. It is not the function of the Court of Protection to remove all possible risk and protect the individual at the expense of a proportionate balance:  </p>

The fact is that all life involves risk, and the young, the elderly and the vulnerable, are exposed to additional risks and to risks they are less well equipped than others to cope with. But just as wise parents resist the temptation to keep their children metaphorically wrapped up in cotton wool, so too we must avoid the temptation always to put the physical health and safety of the elderly and the vulnerable before everything else. Often it will be appropriate to do so, but not always. Physical health and safety can sometimes be bought at too high a price in happiness and emotional welfare. The emphasis must be on sensible risk appraisal, not striving to avoid all risk, whatever the price, but instead seeking a proper balance and being willing to tolerate manageable or acceptable risks as the price appropriately to be paid in order to achieve some other good &#8211; in particular to achieve the vital good of the elderly or vulnerable person&#8217;s happiness. What good is it making someone safer if it merely makes them miserable?&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Over the last 9 months JK has grown in maturity, self-awareness and self-control. She has begun to manage her own life and own her decisions, which was not the case when she was younger. She also has a very strong motivation to stay on course and to achieve her goals. In my judgement, she has reached a stage where she needs to be trusted to make decisions. If the Deprivation of Liberty order stays in place, I think </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Having said all of this, I do not underestimate the physical risk to JK of poor management of her diabetes. However, as Ms Thomas has said, the recent evidence suggests that if JK does need to be admitted to hospital as an emergency, she has consented to this happening. There does not need to be an order in place for her to receive emergency treatment if that should prove necessary or for her to be transported quickly to hospital. I am therefore not convinced that the order serves a useful purpose in any event. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Further, in my view, the order is by now counter-productive. It undermines JK&#8217;s desire and motivation to achieve autonomy and thus her progress towards fully capacitous decision making. For these reasons I think the time has come to cease the Deprivation of Liberty order and respect JK&#8217;s wishes and feelings in that respect.  </p>
