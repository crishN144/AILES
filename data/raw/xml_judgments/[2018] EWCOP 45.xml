As a result they dealt with the matter by way of a safeguarding referral to the Local Authority and it was only at some point during that process they were alerted to the fact that actually the appropriate course was to issue an application to this court, resulting in an application being issued yesterday and the matter being heard today in the urgent applications court, which already had an extremely busy list.   </span></p>

One of her daughters, C, has been at court today and has been involved in detailed discussions outside court.  She addressed the court with eloquence and compassion in relation to the situation she has found herself in, having to be here to deal with the extra information that she wanted to be provided about the arrangements for the care of her mother prior to any operation and the post-operative care arrangements.  As she said, with understandable feeling, she is now not going to see her mother before the operation because of the lateness of this application and the extra information that was required.   </span></p>

It appears there was a conversation with J yesterday when she was told that the papers were going to be emailed to her.

There was some suggestion that he had not much involvement in relation to SE&#8217;s recent medical care, although in fact the notes only related to a relatively short period of time, so the position remained unclear.  I took the view that I needed to be satisfied that J had received the papers by email, and arrangements had been put in place to notify W of the existence of the application and the evidence.  That resulted in an adjournment and a note being sent through from Ms Butler-Cole to the court timed at 17.19, confirming that the Official Solicitor had spoken to both J and W by phone, separately.   </span></p>

Timetabling and case management must focus on a sensible and proportionate evaluation of P&#8217;s interests and not become driven by the exigencies of the litigation. Whilst the Mental Capacity Act does not have incorporated into it the imperative to avoid delay in the way that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> does, the principle is nonetheless embraced by the Court of Protection Rules, which require the application of the </span></p>

Whilst, of course, it is understood emergencies do arise, in this case the emergency was due to the failure to have any effective system in place for securing legal advice for clinicians in the Trusts.

According to C, this is something she has been asking about for some time, and now has more understanding about precisely what is being done.

That is confirmed by the opinion expressed by Dr Taylor and is confirmed by the position taken by the Official Solicitor, where they have set out that they are satisfied that by reason of her schizophrenia, the patient lacks the capacity to decide whether to undergo an amputation.  </span></p>
