The time came, however, when the aunt&#8217;s own grief reaction to the death of her sister proved too much for her to continue to care for G. The maternal grandfather, PA, sought to support his daughter in caring for G and for a short period she lived with him. </p>

I joined the maternal grandfather and his former wife, referred to as the maternal step grandmother, BA, on 3 October 2013.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Initially the maternal grandfather sought to care for G under the auspices of a special guardianship order.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The maternal step grandmother initially did not seek to care for G for wholly understandable reasons. She wished for G to be cared for by a member of the maternal family and strongly opposed G remaining in long term foster care. The maternal step grandmother, at the outset of this hearing wanted the maternal grandfather to care for G. That changed overnight having listened to the maternal grandfather&#8217;s evidence to a proposal that she and her sister care for G. By the end of her evidence, however, she agreed that if the court found that G&#8217;s genuine wishes were to remain with her foster carers, it was in her best interests to remain in foster care. </p>

She resents the fact that, as she saw it, the number of members of the paternal family who are to have contact results in a reduction of the frequency of her contact. I gained the sense that she would prefer that she should have one half of the contact visits to G and the other half should be shared between the paternal family.</p>

During the course of the hearing the maternal grandmother told me that she had written in a card to G that she and her granddad &#8220;did not get on&#8221;. The maternal grandmother could not accept that was a wholly inappropriate message to send to this traumatised and vulnerable little girl. Sadly she had no insight to the potential adverse effect on G. Her explanation was self centred and not child focussed; she had wanted, she said, to explain to her why she had not seen her for so long. (Contact between the maternal grandmother and G did not commence, after these proceedings were started, until October last year). </p>

I propose that the above paragraph should appear as a recital to my order. Furthermore, it is in my judgment in G&#8217;s best interests for the court to make a s34 (4) no contact order in respect of the father. Such an order removes the statutory duty of the local authority to promote contact between father and daughter. It does not, however, prevent the local authority and the father agreeing, at an appropriate juncture, for contact in some form to take place. </p>

I unhesitatingly accept that professional opinion. I accept that G&#8217;s family are hugely important to her and that ongoing contact is in her best interests. I am in no doubt, however, that monthly contact for the grandparents or even just the maternal grandmother and maternal step grandmother would be too much for G. She is very anxious about the outcome of this hearing. She needs time to be reassured that she will be staying with her current foster carers. She needs time to live and settle into her own routine and activities with her foster carers and with her friends. </p>
