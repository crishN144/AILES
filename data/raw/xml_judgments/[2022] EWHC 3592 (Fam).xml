JL attends respite care at a property called Cherry Trees. She also attends school  (from 9.00am &#8211; 3.00pm in term). Carers (usually staff members from the school) are paid by the local authority and attend JL at her home 6 hours per week during term and 12 hours per week during the school holidays. The local authority has prepared a safety plan for JL dealing, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, with respite care, school and her life at home with her mother. The local authority&#8217;s Special Educational Needs (SEN) Department has also drawn up an Education and Health Care Plan for JL. When JL achieves her majority in January 2023, her support will thereafter be funded by NHS Surrey Heartlands Integrated Care Board and the provision of her care will fall under the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.

Although there is no doubt that they, and indeed everyone else involved, had D&#8217;s best interests at heart, we cannot ignore the possibility, nay even the probability, that this will not always be the case. That is why there are safeguards required by article 5. Without such safeguards, there is no way of ensuring that those with parental responsibility exercise it in the best interests of the child, as the Secretaries of State acknowledge that they must. In this case, D enjoyed the safeguard of the proceedings in the Court of Protection.

In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the effect of the order sought by the local authority under the inherent jurisdiction would be to require KS to be removed from his mother's care and be accommodated by the local authority.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of KS, Mr Spencer submits that the starting point of any analysis must be that KS has never been made the subject of a care order and has not (save as a result of the interim order made by HHJ Sharpe on 26 April 2019) been accommodated by the local authority. Further, Mr Spencer submits that it is not now possible, by virtue of his age, for KS to be made the subject of a care order and, in circumstances where his mother, who is willing and able to provide accommodation for him, objects to him being accommodated for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 20(7)</ref>, he cannot be accommodated pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 20(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. In these circumstances, in common with the position of the local authority, Mr Spencer submits that it is not possible to bring KS within the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> as he is not and has at no point been "looked after" for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25(1)</ref>.</p>

As the Court of Appeal observed in (<span style="font-style:italic">Re E (A Child) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1773" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1773" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1773</ref></span> (cited by Macdonald J <span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>) at [16]:</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">So in the end it seems to me that this is a simple point. Plainly the intention and effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 100</ref> is to prevent the court in wardship making any order which has the effect of requiring a child to be placed in care or under the supervision of a local authority. That end can only be achieved by going through the proper route of threshold finding opening the court's discretionary jurisdiction to make either a care or a supervision order. The same result cannot be achieved under the court's inherent jurisdiction. But there is nothing in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 100</ref> that either explicitly or implicitly precludes the court from making an order in wardship where the child is not required to be accommodated but is voluntarily accommodated.</p>

Moreover, given that the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court have now made clear that the court is not authorising the placement itself when making a declaration authorising the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty, it is perhaps unlikely that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> would now be infringed on the facts in <span style="font-style:italic">A City Council v LS</span>.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Ultimately, as regards the proposed restrictions, it is the absence of consent in JL&#8217;s case which establishes that a genuine lacuna exists which only the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction can fill. Ms Verity&#8217;s in her skeleton argument submits that &#8216;if JL were aged under 18 years, had capacity to consent and did not consent to the restrictions and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> [of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>] was not available, the court under the current law could not authorise the restrictions under the inherent jurisdiction.&#8217; [49] Since JL cannot consent to the restrictions and the consent of her parents, although offered, is ineffective (see <span style="font-style:italic">D(a child)</span> at [15] above) and in circumstances where <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> will not be infringed by the proposed restrictions, then, in my opinion, it must fall to the court, through the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction to act in JL&#8217;s best interests and to keep her safe from serious harm by authorising the deprivation of her liberty.</p>

In essence, its duties are threefold: a duty in appropriate circumstances to investigate; a duty in appropriate circumstances to provide supporting services; and a duty in appropriate circumstances to refer the matter to the court. But, and this is a key message, whatever the positive obligations of a local authority under Article 5 may be, they do not clothe it with any power to regulate, control, compel, restrain, confine or coerce. A local authority which seeks to do so must either point to specific statutory authority for what it is doing &#8211; and, as I have pointed out, such statutory powers are, by and large, lacking in cases such as this &#8211; or obtain the appropriate sanction of the court.
