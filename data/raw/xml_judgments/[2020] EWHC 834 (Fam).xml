The application, which is dated 10 March 2020, has been brought by the father, KR, under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> incorporating the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980 ("the Convention"), and under Article 11 of Council Regulation EC 2201/2003 ("Brussels IIa"). By the application, the father seeks the summary return of PT to Spain. </p>

At the end of the hearing I announced my decision that the child should return to Spain forthwith and made orders to put that decision into effect.  I indicated that I would provide a written judgment setting out the reasons for my decision as swiftly as possible.  This is that judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Following the parents&#8217; separation, legal proceedings were brought in Spain by the mother concerning PT&#8217;s welfare.  A judgment was issued in these proceedings by the Spanish Courts on 25 May 2012.  This provided for the mother to have custody and for parental responsibility for the child to be shared by both parties.  The order provided for the father to have contact with PT on alternate weekends from after school on Friday until Sunday evening.  In addition, she was to spend half of each school holiday with each parent.  Orders were also made for the father to provide maintenance for the child.  I note that the order also required that the parents should inform each other of any change in address thirty days in advance. </p>

The evidence on behalf of the father is that the child was removed from Spain by the mother without his knowledge or consent. </p>

A location order was made and the matter adjourned to a &#8220;with notice&#8221; hearing on 13 March 2020.  At that hearing the mother attended in person.  She brought with her a letter from Duncan Lewis Solicitors which I understand asked the Court for an adjournment for her legal aid options to be explored and indicated that she would be seeking to defend the application on the basis of (1) the father&#8217;s consent and / or acquiescence and (2) Art. 13(b) of the Convention that is to say the existence of a grave risk that a return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation. </p>

She told Ms Roddy that she had not wanted to come to England, and that she wanted to be with her father, although she did not want to be separated from her mother either.  PT&#8217;s clear wish, as expressed to Ms Roddy, was that she wanted to return to Spain with her father rather than stay in England. </p>

She directed that Ms Roddy put her notes from her meetings with PT into the form of a witness statement, but given the time constraints, indicated that no formal report was required.  Lieven J directed both parties and Ms Roddy to attend the final hearing.  She also directed the mother to file an answer indicating the Convention grounds upon which a return was being opposed and a witness statement in support by 23 March.  The father was given the opportunity to file a witness statement in response by 25 March.  The order also provided for weekly overnight contact between the father and child (as the father is staying in the UK pending the determination of the application), for the mother to return the child&#8217;s mobile phone to her and for her to have unrestricted telephone contact with the father.   </p>

He noted that the mother had been in court when Lieven J had made her order on 13 March and had been aware of the directions that had been made and what was required of her.  He pointed to her failure to comply with the Court&#8217;s directions (including in relation to contact) and the mother&#8217;s refusal to engage with the Applicant&#8217;s solicitors.  He also pointed to PTA&#8217;s need for the application to be promptly determined, highlighting concerns that had been raised regarding the mother&#8217;s present partner and the risk that further restrictions on travel from the UK to Spain could be implemented in the coming days. </p>

However, the father does not speak English, and this meant that the hearing had to be translated into Spanish for his benefit.  This meant that all participants needed to frequently pause to enable what had just been said to be translated.  Whilst this unavoidably made it more difficult for all concerned to make submissions or give evidence, I am fully satisfied that the hearing was a fair one for all parties.  Another practical difficulty that was encountered related to the administration of oaths to participants at various locations without immediate access to their relevant holy book.  I therefore required the translator, Ms Roddy (who gave oral evidence) and the mother (whose submissions inevitably contained factual matters) to affirm in the prescribed manner.   </p>

PT had described her life in Spain to Ms Roddy, living with her mother and sister S, but seeing her father every other weekend.  She has a room at her father&#8217;s house.  She described having regular contact with her wider paternal family and told Ms Roddy of her regret that she had not seen new baby sister in Spain for some weeks.  PT explained to Ms Roddy that her mother had told her that they were going to move to another town in Spain and had not told her that they were coming to England, and that after their arrival her mother had initially told her to lie to her father as to where they were living.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Ms Roddy expressed the view that she felt that PT was under-estimating the challenges she would face from being separated from her mother and S and that she would find such a situation very challenging indeed. She also recognised that if PT returned to Spain she would (unless and until the Spanish Court decided otherwise) be living on a full time basis with her father, as opposed to just spending weekends and holidays with him. However, she also considered that PT was very angry with her mother for taking her to England against her wishes, and that her current predicament in which she has been removed with everything familiar to her was the source of what Ms Roddy termed &#8220;desperation&#8221;.

Nonetheless she explained to me that this needed to be balanced against the psychological harm that PT has suffered (and will continue to suffer) as a result of being brought to England against her wishes. </p>

I explored this issue with her, and whilst she asserted that she had had discussions with the father about moving to England with PT and Maria, she told me that she was not able to say whether he had ever agreed to such a move or not.  The burden of proof is on her, and I do not consider that she has come close to discharging it.  PT herself told Ms Roddy that her mother told her to lie to her father about where she was. The father brought these proceedings very swiftly following PT&#8217;s removal and I accept the sworn evidence filed on his behalf that the removal was effected by the mother without his knowledge or consent.   </p>

She indicated that she had a recording of the father threatening to kill her and had a number of other relevant text messages as well.  However, she explained that the current coronavirus restrictions meant that she had been unable to access these.  She described him as being &#8220;horrible&#8221; with PT and suggested that when PT had contact with her father she would in fact spend her time with her paternal grandmother.  She also suggested PT had been told by her father what to say to Ms Roddy and that the Spanish address given by the father to this court was that of the paternal grandmother rather than the father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I have to deal with this matter on a summary basis.  It is clear that from the date of the Spanish Court welfare order in May 2012 until February 2020, PTA was having contact with her father on the regular basis therein set out, and there is no evidence that the mother objected to this or sought to raise any concerns about the father with the Spanish authorities.  I note also that shortly after the present dispute began the mother was prepared to allow not only PT, but S as well, spend a night with the father at his hotel in England.  This does not suggest that the mother harboured any genuine concerns about the father&#8217;s ability to care for PT.  Furthermore, PT has spoken to Ms Roddy about her relationship with her father in very positive terms.  The father has exhibited to his witness statement pictures of what clearly appeared to be a child&#8217;s bedroom, which I am told is PT&#8217;s room at his house, and has produced evidence that a school place will be available for her in Spain. </p>

Nor would it place her in an intolerable situation. </p>

Against this I must balance the alternative harm which Ms Roddy has identified that PT is currently suffering and the risks that are posed by continuing the existing situation; one that Ms Roddy described as having given rise to &#8220;desperation&#8221; on the part of PT.  Having regard to the analysis of MacDonald J in <span style="font-style:italic">BK v NK </span> that I have set out above, I consider that although the separation from her mother and S clearly poses a real risk of some psychological harm to PT, it falls a long way short of being the &#8220;grave risk&#8221; required by Art. 13(b) of the Convention.  Indeed in circumstances where some element of harm to PT appears inevitable whatever I decide, I am clear that a return to Spain would be significantly less harmful to her than continuing the present situation.  </p>

She will be living with her father full-time, rather than just on alternate weekends and holidays and I do not doubt that this will be a challenge for her.  That said, I do not consider that this poses any real risk of psychological harm, let alone the grave risk required by Art. 13(b).  Nor can the circumstances to which she will return be said to amount to an intolerable situation.  She will be returning to a home which is familiar to her and in which she has her own bedroom, and will be able to build a relationship with her baby sister.  Her wider maternal and paternal families are all in Spain and a return will enable her to maintain contact with them.  Although she will attend a different school from the one she previously went to, she will be taught in Spanish, her primary language.  </p>
