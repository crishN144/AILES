	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I am concerned with the welfare of a child known as Eve who was born in 2013 and so she is currently nine but soon be ten. Eve is a party to these proceedings and her children&#8217;s guardian instructs Miss Vickers. Eve has two older brothers, A, who is 18 and D, who is 17 who are no longer the subject of any Children Act proceedings. The Applicant is her mother, who is represented by Miss Miller of counsel and the Respondent Father appears in person as he has done in the previous proceedings before me.</p>

The mother&#8217;s application for enforcement was followed by her application for permission to vary the order of July 2022 and to change the living arrangements of Eve. I granted her permission at the Directions Hearing on 18 November 2022 and went on to direct a psychological assessment by an expert Chartered Psychologist, which all parties agreed was necessary in the circumstances of this case. Her reports were filed in February and April 2023.</p>

The father&#8217;s application to relocate the children to a country in Africa &#8211; &#8220;Country A&#8221; &#8211; was refused, both parents were prevented from taking Eve to any non-Hague Convention country until she reaches the age of 16, Eve was to live with her father and by doing that I refused the mother&#8217;s application for a change of residence last year and that father was to make Eve available to spend time with the mother as follows; every other weekend during term time, the entire of the Easter holidays, half of the summer holidays, half of each day of Eid, every day indirect contact by telephone or Facetime and for such other contact as the parties were able to agree.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I do not repeat the extensive background to these proceedings because, as I said, this judgment needs to be read with the one I gave last year. Save to say that this is the fourth set of proceedings in this jurisdiction for Eve. The judgments that need to be read are the judgments of Judge Ambrose in 2019 sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, Judge George 2021 and, of course, my judgment of 5 July 2022 where she, Judge George and I, have sat and I continue to do so, Section 9.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The parties&#8217; positions have been that the mother&#8217;s application is to change the residence of Eve and for her to be removed from her father&#8217;s care, living in a city in the East Midlands, and to live with her in a city in the South of England where she is settled and has a large community of support from both Muslim and non-Muslim groups.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The father opposes this application vehemently. He has already told the Children&#8217;s Guardian that if I switch the residence/living arrangements of Eve he will be appealing my decision. Such was the concern of the mother and the Children&#8217;s Guardian that last week at the Pre-Trial Review I decided to make a freestanding Port Alert Order to prevent the father from removing Eve from the jurisdiction in light of the findings against him regarding abduction of the children from Country B to Country A and then to England and as a result of that I made the order out of an abundance of caution.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Children&#8217;s Guardian now supports the mother&#8217;s case having previously given significant weight to recommending that Eve remains in her father&#8217;s home so that she could grow up with her two brothers. Matters since July 2022 can only be described as having &#8216;deteriorated&#8217;. There is, to an extent, an agreed chronology since the last hearing which is rather striking.</p>

Both children arrived at the mother&#8217;s home some hours later having been sent in a taxi from a city in the East Midlands. On 4 August 2022 the father returned to England and within a few hours&#8217; notice went to collect the two younger children.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">On 10 August 2022 the mother sent an email to the father enquiring why she had been unable to have her indirect contact with the children which particularly for Eve was daily and the father did not reply. She also asked about their whereabouts. On 12 August the mother&#8217;s solicitors contacted the father enquiring why the mother has not been able to have indirect contact and where they were. Again, the father did not reply. On 15 August the mother was so concerned that she contacted the police to ask if enquiries could be made with the paternal family about the children&#8217;s whereabouts.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I pause at this stage to say that in his oral evidence the father blatantly admitted that he took the children to Portugal and deliberately failed to inform the mother or even ask for her consent because he was upset that her cousin was staying at her house when the children were there, and she had not bothered to tell him.</p>

The mother alleges that the father was furious with her during the call for calling the police and says that the father instructed Eve about what to say to the mother which was making Eve upset. On 18 August 2022 the mother received a call from Eve to say that she was back in England. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">On 25 August 2022, the father emailed D&#8217;s exam results and later that day the mother spoke to D but it was a difficult and awkward conversation. On 26 August 2022, the mother emailed the father asking for her direct contact to resume after the summer holidays and the father proposed 2 September knowing full well by that point, it seems, that the mother was going to her sister&#8217;s wedding in a country in Asia, something that everybody had notice of during the proceedings that ended in July 2022. On 30 August the mother travelled to a country in Asia and went to her sister&#8217;s wedding and therefore did not have any contact with the children.</p>

On 30 September she sends a WhatsApp message enquiring about contact and the father says that she is welcome to come for the children but he does not reply when the mother asks for the details of their new address &#8211; he accepted that he had he moved addresses without even informing her.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">On 4 October 2022 the mother sends another WhatsApp message enquiring about contact and there is no response from the father. On 6 October the mother emails the father enquiring about contact for the weekend of 7 October again there is no response. On 9 October by that point the mother, of course, had already issued her application and so I made directions for both parties to file statements. On 10 October the mother emailed about half-term contact and on 12 October the mother&#8217;s solicitor served the father with the mother&#8217;s application to enforce the order of July 2022. That appears to then have triggered a response from the father which was that he will drop the children at the mother&#8217;s home on the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> on route to the airport and she is to return them to a city in the East Midlands on 23 October.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_17">

	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">On 14 October the children were dropped off at the mother&#8217;s home. The mother alleges that the father was aggressive towards her, that he also told her that Eve was not permitted to leave the house. A&#8217;s behaviour is described by the mother as being &#8216;disrespectful and aggressive&#8217;. In his oral evidence the father admitted that A had told him that he did not want to go and stay at his mother&#8217;s but because he did not have a ticket for A to go to Country A he would have to go to his mother&#8217;s. This period of contact, therefore, occurred after the father had not allowed there to be any direct contact between the children and their mother from the end of August, I appreciate she was away for September, but certainly nothing from the end of September until October half-term.</p>

A&#8217;s behaviour deteriorated to the extent that he was physically abusive towards his mother. The mother ended up having to call the police and he was removed from the home, taken to the police station and then eventually discharged to a paternal relative as a result of the father being, of course, in Country A. I have seen the videos related to this incident that were supplied by the father. The video of the aftermath of Eve and D pleading with A to calm down before the police arrive is poignant and it is fair to say that the incident is nothing short of horrific behaviour on A&#8217;s part.</p>

On 4 November the mother drives to a city in the East Midlands to collect Eve for her weekend contact, the father refuses to allow Eve to go for contact and when the mother refers to the court order she is very clear that he tells her he &#8216;did not care what the court orders says&#8217;, that Eve was not going with her and he tells her to go to the police station. As a result of that the police were contacted and a welfare check was undertaken.</p>

But in reality the fundamental application before me is a fresh application to change Eve&#8217;s residence on the basis that if she continues to live with her father she will never be able to have a deep, meaningful and consistent relationship with her mother. The mother&#8217;s case is that the father will continue to engage in alienating behaviours as he has done so with A and D which is a pattern that demonstrates that he will not or cannot stop. Her case is that the evidence, by virtue of the facts before me, is that the pattern of the father&#8217;s behaviour has resulted in neither of the boys wanting to speak to her, they do not answer her calls and they do not respond to any of her messages.</p>

This is a highly fact specific scenario in which labels and generalisations are not in my view helpful. In a very large number of cases that appear before the Family Courts, particularly concerning private law, the parents have some degree of animosity towards each other &#8230; whether consciously or unconsciously may influence the views of children about the other parent. It must however be remembered that children are autonomous human beings who have their own feelings and their own perceptions. That becomes particularly true as they become older and begin to wish to assert their own personalities separately from any parental control. </p>

This, says the Children's Guardian, is a clear indicator of the likely outcome for Eve if she remains in her father&#8217;s care.

She acknowledged that moving Eve from her father was going to be distressing, that Eve will miss her brothers and that she will struggle to initially settle. However on balancing the welfare factors for Eve she remained clear that these negatives come nowhere near the long term negative impact on Eve&#8217;s emotional and psychological wellbeing of not being able to have a lifelong relationship with her mother which if she remains with her father, she will not be able to have.</p>

She also confirmed that the Improving Child and Family Arrangements Service (ICFA) will be able to support the family and that she has permission to take this referral forward by her service manager which would mean a referral to a local service (to the mother) who will be able to start work, hopefully, within the next four weeks and offer six sessions of supervised contact to the father.</p>

They demonstrate that all the children have already been exposed to their father&#8217;s strong and denigrating views about their mother being an inferior parent and in effect a second class citizen to them. Eve says to A:</p>

The father&#8217;s behaviour over years and years has simply not changed. After hearing all of the evidence it is very clear to me that he has not been able to control himself. He has not been able to prioritise the emotional wellbeing of any of the children by allowing them to be loved by their mother.</p>

Enforcement is not covered by the s.91(14) restriction and any applications for leave will come to me.

I have no confidence he will comply with that paragraph, even with a penal notice attached, even if it is personally served on him, but I am really conscious of the cost to the Mother of personally serving him in Country A and that it is going to be really difficult.  I want to limit the need for the Mother to come back to Court, so in the event that he does not comply, from 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> October onwards the Mother is permitted to make an application for a passport in Eve&#8217;s name and she will have permission to do so without the need to obtain the Father&#8217;s consent in writing.  I make that as an order of the High Court.</span></p>

	      <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I have published the judgments in this case for a number of reasons. Firstly it is important for the purposes of transparency that the Family Court publishes its reasons for making decisions in respect of children, especially where there has been a change of living arrangements. It is also important to be transparent about cases where there have been findings of emotionally abusive behaviours by one parent against the other and the impact this has on the relationship a child might have or not have with their other parent for the rest of their minority and likely into their adulthood. It is important for transparency that the Family Court publishes its reasons for deciding whether it can do something about such behaviours and whether it can actively address the way the child has been impacted including taking into account the child&#8217;s own views in so far as their age and understanding allows and based on whether they have been negatively influenced or not, or whether it is simply too late. The court also sometimes has to consider whether to continue to take active steps to promote a child&#8217;s relationship with the other parent when that child is resistant and question whether there comes a point where this in itself becomes an emotionally abusive process. It is important to be honest about this because in some cases it is just too late. </span></p>

	      <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In this case I found that for Eve it was not too late and so I acted in her best interests. I am pleased that she has managed to settle and a huge amount of credit has to be given to her mother who over many years of litigation did not give up hope of being able to have an unfettered relationship with her daughter. I hope that in the years to come Eve will be able to reflect on my decisions for her and see that. I still hold out the hope that in the future Eve&#8217;s brothers will be able to see the good in their mother. </span></p>
