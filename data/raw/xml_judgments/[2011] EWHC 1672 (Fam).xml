	    <p style="text-align:justify">This judgment is being handed down in private on 4 July 2011 It consists of 26 pages and has been signed and dated by the judge. The judge hereby gives leave for it to be reported.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The judgment is being distributed on the strict understanding that in any report no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name or location and that in particular the anonymity of the children and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I would like to begin this judgment with an apology to the parties and to the profession for the length of time it has taken me to produce it. This has in part been due to the pressure of other work, but mostly because I have found the issues left to me difficult. Part of the difficulty has been the fact that, in my judgment, some of the issues (which I will identify later) are simply not justiciable. This is a judgment, not a paper or a lecture. There are, however, areas of the case; (a) which I think are properly justiciable; and (b) in which I can properly offer guidance. Where I have concluded that I simply cannot adjudicate on a particular matter, I propose to say so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What I proposed to do is; (1) to outline the facts which give rise to the case reaching my court; (2) to set out in some detail the arguments presented to me; (3) to identify the issues which I do not think are justiciable; (4) to explain why I have not resolved issues of fact and have dealt with the case purely on submissions; and (5) to discuss those issues which are properly justiciable and on which I can reach proper conclusions. The result is a judgment of greater length than I had originally intended. The issues are, however, important, and require full ventilation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 1 September 2010, the East Sussex County Council (the local authority) issued care proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>) relating to a male infant, whom I will identify only as TL, and who was born on 1 January 2009. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 8 September 2010, the local authority&#8217;s application for an interim care order (ICO) in relation to TL came before the Hastings Family Proceedings Court (the FPC). The local authority&#8217;s care plan under the proposed ICO was for TL to be separated from his parents and placed in foster care whilst his parents&#8217; capacity to care for him was assessed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the care proceedings are currently continuing in the Brighton County court before Her Honour Judge Norrie, I propose to say nothing about the merits of the case, or the local authority&#8217;s reasons for instituting proceedings and for seeking an ICO save that TL&#8217;s parents (rightly, in my view) accepted that the threshold criteria for an ICO under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> were met. I need also to record that TL&#8217;s parents are currently aged respectively 20 (his mother) and 23 (his father); that they are not married and have no other children: TL&#8217;s father, however, has parental responsibility for him, having been named on TL&#8217;s birth certificate. TL was represented at the hearing in the FPC on 8 September by a solicitor and his guardian (whom, henceforth. I will call &#8220;the guardian&#8221; without naming her), who had been appointed when the proceedings were issued.  TL&#8217;s parents were also legally represented.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both TL&#8217;s parents and the guardian opposed the local authority&#8217;s plan to remove TL from his parents&#8217; care. The guardian proposed that he should remain at home under an ICO. The local authority, I was told, did not feel able to share parental responsibility if TL was at home. In these circumstances, it &#8220;reluctantly&#8221; (the word used by its Practice Manager in her subsequent statement dated 15 September 2010) changed its care plan to seek an interim supervision order (ISO) with TL remaining at home. In the event, after argument, the FPC made an ICO on the basis that TL would remain at home.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The justices&#8217; reasons record what occurred. The Lay Bench had read the papers, and did not hear any oral evidence. The only point at issue was &#8220;whether the home placement should be supported by an (ISO) or an (ICO)&#8221;. The essence of the justices&#8217; reasoning is contained in paragraph 12 of their reasons, in which they state: -</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;... It is our view that an (ICO) is necessary to allow the local authority to share parental responsibility whilst the assessments are concluded. Both parents have suffered difficult lives with poor parenting themselves and both are relatively young. At times, they have shown a good level of understanding of (TL)&#8217;s needs, but at other times, their own needs have taken priority. It is this area which gives rise to concern because of the parents&#8217; volatility and inconsistency in parenting. &#8221;</p>

The ICO was, however, predicated on the indication given by the parents &#8211; as recorded by the justices - of  &#8220;their agreement to sign a written agreement, a draft of which has been shown to them&#8221;. The justices also gave a number of directions which it is not necessary for me to set out. </p>

The justices were plainly presented with an agreement about where TL should live: the only issue was the legal framework under which he was to reside at home. In this context, they made a direction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> that TL was &#8220;placed with his parents for the purpose of the assessments&#8221; which were to be carried out &#8220;subject to the terms of the written agreement&#8221;.</p>

She had also been provided with the CVs of the various experts (adult psychiatrists) who were to report on the parents in the proceedings. She said she had read these before she attended court, and at court received hard copies which she read. She also had a detailed discussion with counsel instructed on behalf of the child and discussed the matter with the parents. She says that she considered all of the risk issues set out in the court papers but was not persuaded that TL should be removed from his parents. She says she was also aware that a local family centre had begun their assessment of the parents. She agrees she discussed other options with the local authority&#8217;s social workers &#8211; for example a residential placement - but without success.</p>

As you will be aware, [name] was the Guardian appointed to represent (TL) in these proceedings. The case plan (sic) and documentation were reviewed by a CAFCASS manager on 8.9.10. The review resulted in a discussion between the Guardian and the Operational Head of Service for (the local authority) regarding the risk assessment, and decision making on the case. Specific to that discussion was the Guardian&#8217;s recommendation to leave the child at home on an ICO despite the significant evidence and concerns expressed by Children&#8217;s Services social worker. The concerns were clearly outlined in the Local Authority&#8217;s statement to court.</p>

The local authority, by seeking to change their position, following communications with CAFCASS outside court have, at the very least, added to the perception that there is unfairness and collusion preventing a fair decision making process. The impact and pressure that this places upon parents involved in care proceedings for the first time and facing the forced removal of their son cannot be under-estimated.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Two points are, I think, worth noting at this stage. The first is not strictly a point of statutory construction, but remains of importance nonetheless. The acronym <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">CAFCASS</span> stands for Children and Families Court Advisory and Support Service. The penultimate &#8220;S&#8221; was, as is well known, inserted by the late Bracewell J and the Children Act Advisory Committee. But in my judgment, one of the functions of CAFCASS &#8211; indeed one of its principal functions - is to advise the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">court</span> on what is in the best interest of the child whom it represents in the proceedings. It is, in my judgement, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">a court advisory service</span>.</p>

Firstly, it is the court which appoints the guardian, and the court alone which can revoke or change such an appointment: secondly, every binding decision about a child is made not by CAFCASS, nor by its officer nor by the local authority but by <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">the court</span>. </p>

The local authority&#8217;s case is that whilst it was notified of CAFCASS&#8217;s decision to replace the guardian it did not influence it, nor did it have any direct knowledge of what took place between the guardian and her managers as a consequence of the internal CAFCASS review.

The local authority therefore makes a number of suggestions for the reform of the decision and reasons form used by the FPC.

In the interests of individual children or in the discharge of CAFCASS&#8217;s statutory functions generally, to communicate their views of a particular guardian&#8217;s work to the court and / or the parties. Added to which, of course, the court was entitled to bring a guardian&#8217;s appointment to an end and to hear evidence on issues in dispute in the event that the termination of a particular appointment was contested.</p>

However, if the manager concluded that the recommendations were either flawed or irrational, or did not properly represent the interests of the individual child, then the proper course was for CAFCASS as a body to seek to intervene in the proceedings with a view to the manager&#8217;s analysis being brought to the attention of the court.

Normally, of course, these discussions concern system issues: whilst there may be reference to individual cases (in discussions with local authorities), this is normally in the context of illustrating an issue.</p>

They have the assurance both from X herself and from the local authority. In my judgment they do not need any further reassurance.

Where I struggle with Mr. Clark&#8217;s statement is his assertion that in these circumstances it is automatically the view of the Manager which will prevail.</p>

The words &#8220;quality assurance&#8221; have been misused &#8211; see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re G and B (Disclosure: Protocol</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/2630" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 2630 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 2630 (Fam)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 1089" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 1089</ref> - but the function is both important and a part of the structure of CAFCASS. However, in my judgment it has to be balanced against the independence of the guardian appointed by the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Striking the balance is not always easy, but where the two come into conflict, it does not seem to me that the views of the manager should invariably prevail over those of the independent guardian. In any event, as I have already indicated, the final decision is for the court &#8211; not for either guardians or their managers. Thus whilst I see the force of the argument that an employer (CAFCASS) must assure quality, it does not follow in my judgment that the independent views of the employee (the independent guardian appointed by the court) should invariably and inevitably be subservient.</p>

At the same time, CAFCASS has to manage, and to &#8220;quality assure&#8221;. Can the circle be squared? I believe it can, and the means of doing it lies with the court. I therefore agree with Mr. Clark that the proper course, in the event of an irreconcilable difference of view is for CAFCASS to apply to intervene, and for there to be placed transparently before the court the views of the guardian and the views of the manager, each explaining why the other is not to be preferred. As I have already indicated there is nothing  either wrong or humiliating about such a course of action. The court will then decide. It may decide to replace the guardian: it may not. But the decision will be that of the court &#8211; as it should always be.</p>

It does not seem to me &#8211; although I have not, quite deliberately, made findings of fact - that CAFCASS followed a transparent procedure. Added to which, of course, it was complicit in the failure to notify the parents of what was going on.</p>
