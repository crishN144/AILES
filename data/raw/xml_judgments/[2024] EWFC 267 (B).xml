It is unfortunate that the court has not had the benefit of this professional expert assessment which was determined to be necessary to help the court and all parties resolve the difficult issues in this case.</span></p>

[Adam] had written to the school asking to come and meet with [Zayn] in person. [Zayn] was becoming very distressed and was feeling pressurised by [Adam] trying to make arrangements directly with him for meeting up, with offers of presents.  [Zayn] was reported to be feeling blamed by [Adam] for not seeing him. [Adam] had been looking at [Zayn]&#8217;s school website with him. [Zayn] was becoming increasingly anxious that his father and brother may turn up in Oxford without warning. [Zayn] was upset by some negative comments [Adam] made to him, teasing him about his haircut. Out of character, [Adam] did not turn up to two virtual contacts in December, which made [Zayn] very worried about what had happened to him.</span></p>

[Adam] has not participated in any contact with [Zayn] since that time. In discussion with the NYAS caseworker following the hearing, [Adam] did not accept that he had said anything to upset [Zayn], and said he had recorded all sessions of the video calls. </span></p>

[Zayn] has reported (as has [the mother] who has overheard) that at times following the Court order that contact between him and his father should be supervised, his brother has blamed him for not seeing each other and said other things which [Zayn] has reported caused him to be sad and anxious. [Zayn] is desperate for a relationship with his brother, and the caseworker does not believe he would wish to create unnecessary worries which may then prevent that. Whether it is the underlying fear that [Zayn] has about his father and risk of being taken to London which is fuelling these, the emotions he has experienced following these discussions have felt real and caused him anxiety, which again has been witnessed by school and CAMHS. Unfortunately, we do not have the benefit of a psychological assessment which would have been able to provide greater clarity on the discrepancy in how [Zayn] shares information and what [Adam] and [the father] report.&#8217;</span></p>

It has been noted that although [Zayn] has been very sad not to see his brother, and asks after him every day, his anxiety levels have been greatly reduced and he has been very much more settled since he has not been having contact. LC weighs in the balance the lack of alternative supervisors, [Adam]&#8217;s anger towards the current situation, and his position that he will not agree to any contact with his mother as supervisor. [Adam] has said he would be prepared to agree to a different person supervising contact. I have not been given any proposals as to who that supervisor might be. There would need to be a contract setting out expectations of behaviour, and an agreement about what information about the family proceedings might need to be shared.</span></p>

[Adam] repeatedly reassures [Zayn] that the police are good people, that they are there to help and they can be trusted. [Zayn] is sometimes playful, taking his shoes off and giggling. The police officer comes to speak with them and explains that the court order is in place, and that is what they must stick to, and if [Zayn] wants a change, that is a conversation that will need to be had another day. </p>

However, the factual basis for him holding that view remains unclear. Initially he said she had held him up by the front of his shirt and grabbed his arm. Later he said that at times he could not remember, a long time ago, she had slapped him and hit him. At the same time, his father said that the children&#8217;s mother had never hit them. More recently, [Adam]&#8217;s complaint against his mother has been that she is the one that has stopped him having contact with his brother. This is not true. The decisions around contact have all been made by a judge, in light of a large amount of evidence from various professionals of their concerns about the impact of that contact on [Zayn].</p>
