The FCA was told by the Mother that the children struggle to spend time with the Father and she wishes the time they spend with him to reduce in line with their wishes and feelings. In the FCA&#8217;s opinion the children were likely resisting post-separation time with the Father &#8220;due to justifiable resistance, affinity and attachment to the Mother, alignment with her anxieties, exposure to harmful conflict and intermittent alienation&#8221;. The reason for that conclusion was grounded in the Mother&#8217;s behaviour because &#8220;she will not make the children do something they don&#8217;t want to do; uses negatively loaded terms such as not forcing or dragging the children to contact; [and] she has applied to reduce the amount of time the children spend with [the Father] ...&#8221;.</span></p>

The section provides a powerful tool with which Judges can protect both children and the parent with whom they live, from corrosive, demoralising and controlling applications which have an insidious impact on their general welfare and wellbeing and can cause real emotional harm. This amended provision strikes me as properly recognising the very significant toll protracted litigation can take on children and individuals who may already have become vulnerable, for a variety of reasons. It also dovetails with our enhanced understanding of the nature of controlling and coercive behaviour. When all other avenues are lost, too often the Court process becomes the only weapon available. Lawyers and Judges must be assiduous to identify when this occurs, in order to ensure that the Court is not manipulated into becoming a source of harm but a guarantee of protection.&#8221;</span></p>

I decline to order this. I have ordered a neutral location for handovers unless the parents agree a different place. It is open to the Father not to agree to his home being the place where handovers take place. Perhaps in the fullness of time, when temperatures cool, other arrangements will be possible and the significance of a recording by a piece of existing CCTV equipment will be less prominent. Regrettably, these parties are not yet in that place.</span></p>

Nothing was put to the Mother about this document in her evidence. I heard no argument about it. I decline to order what is sought by the Father.</span></p>

I heard no evidence or argument on this. I decline to make any orders in this regard, save each party must do all acts and things required to renew the passports when those renewals are due. When the renewals are due the Mother can present the Father with the information she says supports her understanding of the steps required for the renewal of the Country Q passports. If a party does not do all the acts required of them then, sadly, there may need to be recourse to the court with costs consequences for the defaulting party.</span></p>

I wish to spare the children&#8217;s doctors and nurses that despairing experience so far as is possible. The children&#8217;s welfare requires no more than each parent be informed within 24 hours of attendance. It is not necessary in the children&#8217;s welfare interests that the Father attend all medical appointments. He does not need that control. My order authorising each parent to obtain information about the children&#8217;s medical records will enable each parent to be kept informed.</span></p>
