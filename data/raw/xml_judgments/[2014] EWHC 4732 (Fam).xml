For convenience I will refer to them as &#8220;the husband&#8221; and &#8220;the wife.&#8221;  It raises questions as to how to deal fairly with the fact that the husband brought into the relationship and marriage substantial wealth (&#163;13 million) upon which the current kitty of some &#163;25 million is directly or indirectly based.  It also raises fiercely disputed factual issues as to when the parties&#8217; &#8216;relationship leading to marriage&#8217; began; whether in 1995 or 1997.  This is said to matter because within that disputed period the husband received a crucial payment of &#163;9 million from a particular business transaction which enabled his business to grow.  It is a case of considerable bitterness as between the parties which has impacted negatively on their attitudes to one another and on their approach to a fair overall outcome.  </span></p>

I have been provided with extensive written and oral submissions together with a bundle of authorities regarding pre-marital wealth and the so-called &#8216;marital acquest&#8217;.  There are two core bundles and some 14 lever arch files of documents which would certainly not have satisfied the new dispensation as regards bundling in financial remedy cases.  I have heard evidence from the following witnesses: (i) the wife; (ii) her accountant, Jason Lane; (iii) the husband; (iv) his accountant Julia Wallace-Walker; (v) the husband&#8217;s daughter B; (vi) his son, C, and (vii) his PA, Mrs D.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There is a drive for shorter judgments in financial remedy cases (see eg per Wilson LJ as he then was at paragraph 24 of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">K v L</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 2 FLR 980" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 2 FLR 980</ref>).  But there is much ground to cover here and I have failed in my objective of brevity.  Apart from the 14 issues set out in the undated &#8216;agreed composite statement of issues&#8217; there are numerous sub-issues and mini-disputes.  An attempt to resolve them is neither necessary nor proportionate for the resolution of the simple underlying issue: &#8216;how much should the wife be awarded?&#8217;  I have however read and re-read my notes all the documents to which reference has been made and so have all these sub-issues well in mind.  </span></p>

That would be on the basis that she would transfer to the husband a property (&#8220;The Small House&#8221;) in the country adjacent to the former matrimonial home at a value of &#163;450,000 gross.  This would leave her worth &#163;8.7 million on a clean break basis with no order as to costs.  She accepts that the husband will retain the former matrimonial home (&#8220;The Big House&#8221;) and the seaside holiday house (&#8220;The Seaside House&#8221;).  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The husband maintains that this is a so-called &#8216;needs&#8217; case because the wealth brought by him into the marriage, coupled with &#8216;passive growth&#8217; on it, means that there is in fact no &#8216;matrimonial property&#8217; or so-called &#8216;marital acquest&#8217;; all the assets are non-matrimonial property.  Alternatively, he says that the maximum amount of &#8216;matrimonial property&#8217; as calculated by the wife&#8217;s accountant is only &#163;6.3 million, which he accepts would be insufficient shared equally to meet the wife&#8217;s needs.  His open offer, ignoring timing of payments, is to pay the wife &#163;3.5 million, comprising a lump sum of &#163;3.3 million and preference shares worth &#163;200,000 in the main company, redeemable after five years.  He would retain The Big House and The Seaside House.  The wife would transfer to him her interest in The Small House, being responsible for her own tax on the transfer.  There would be no order as to costs.  So the parties&#8217; open positions are &#163;5.2 million apart (&#163;8.7 million sought, &#163;3.5 million offered).</span></p>

In 1964, aged 21 (some 50 years ago), having qualified at night school as a Chartered Surveyor, he began property holding and development as his business.  He has continued in that business ever since.  He has a particular interest in giving new life to historic old buildings, which he has combined with a significant degree of charitable work.

It does however contain six points upon which agreement had not been possible.  In a case with this degree of wealth, I do not consider that these non-agreed items are of any significance, save perhaps for point (f).  So I shall take them quite shortly.  (a) As to the &#8216;marriage value&#8217; of the Big House and The Small House when The Small House is transferred by the wife to the husband, this put at &#163;184,000.  I consider it should be included in the Schedule as an asset of his.  Miss Bangay said in submission (I do not think it is in evidence) that the husband intends to do The Small House up and sell it for liquidity; so there is no &#8216;marriage value&#8217;.  In response, Mr Southgate said that in that case the wife would prefer to keep it.  In my view, the continued ownership of adjacent properties would be a recipe for disaster.  It is much more sensible that the agreement for the transfer of The Small House by the wife to the husband should proceed.  It is a matter for the husband then what he does with it, but the disputed &#8216;marriage value&#8217; would be established.  </span></p>

Julia Wallace-Walker for the husband contends for such a discount from the going concern valuation.  She originally quantified it at &#163;2 million, described as 20% (although the maths do not correlate) and she now puts it at &#163;1 million.  This halving of the proposed discount is to take account of the fact that when she and Mr Lane reached their agreed value for H Ltd it was based on deducting 3% from its net asset value (NAV) to allow for realisation costs, including tax.  Mr Lane does not agree with any further discount beyond that 3% already deducted.  He contends that it is quite inappropriate and that having taken the 3% off NAV, the resulting figure is the value at which he would expect any sale to proceed.  He does, however, more or less accept a further deduction of &#163;250,000 to take account of contingent Corporation Tax arising from updating the Balance Sheet property values.  So the experts are effectively &#163;750,000 apart. </span></p>

I have read both their CVs.  I am satisfied that each is doing his/her best objectively to assist the court.  They appear however to have conflicting experiences of valuing unlisted companies such as this.  Ms Wallace-Walker describes a 20% discount as commonplace, whilst Mr Lane states that he has never come across it.  Both are predominantly experts in the forensic sense, as distinct from seeing their valuation opinions regularly validated in the marketplace.  </span></p>

Ms Wallace-Walker says that it is so referable, as there is no reason to distinguish between the two types of company.  Mr Lane says that listed and unlisted companies are distinct entities, to which different valuation considerations apply.  For example, he points out that listed shares are influenced by outside considerations, such as market sentiment, which is not the case (or is less so) as regards unlisted companies.  The experts disagree further as to whether the fact of the children&#8217;s trust owning 22% of H Ltd should be seen as a contributory justification for the disputed discount.  Ms Wallace-Walker says it should.  Mr Lane says that the trustees of the children&#8217;s trust would very likely conjoin with the husband on any realisations, because everyone involved is &#8216;in the family&#8217; and would probably be pleased to achieve useful liquidity.  So he maintains that a purchase of H Ltd would be buying &#8216;control&#8217;; whereas most purchasers of listed shares are not doing so.  Other points on this discount issue were made and challenged which I have in mind, but which are not necessary to rehearse.  </span></p>

I did not find Ms Wallace-Walker&#8217;s oral evidence on this particular occasion to be as well marshalled as would have been more persuasive.  I was given the impression that the justifications for the disputed discount emerged in a somewhat unscientific way, although this in itself does not of course mean that she is not right.  For example, both her substantive reports of 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2013 and 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2014 state the rationale for a 20% discount as being &#8220;to take into account of realisation costs (such as agent&#8217;s fees and legal expenses not provided for in the accounts) and mortgage penalties&#8221;.  However, in her oral evidence, other justifications for the disputed discount emerged; for example, the perceived disadvantages attaching to certain properties within the husband&#8217;s companies&#8217; portfolios.  Mr Lane&#8217;s evidence came over as clear and precise, supported to some extent by chapter 14 of Tolly on Valuations which, whilst referring to the level of discounts as being subjective, does not mention a conventional percentage discount of the type under discussion.  There seems a logic to Mr Lane&#8217;s point that common discounts to NAV in respect of listed companies would not necessarily transpose to unlisted companies, unless justified by the particular circumstances of the company and its assets, I observe, too, that when Ms Wallace-Walker first introduced her point about the 20% discount, it was in the context of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">listed</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> companies.

Taking the husband&#8217;s column, his calculation of his own wealth goes down from &#163;25,679,895 to &#163;25,004,730.  That is by the deduction of the &#163;500,000 discount from H Ltd&#8217;s NAV and the sum for his unpaid costs of &#163;175,165 (which although set out in the Schedule in red, had not been included when reaching the total of &#163;25,679,895).  The husband&#8217;s estimate for the wife reduces from &#163;503,073 to &#163;306,498 by the deduction of the sum for her jewellery in the sum of &#163;196,575 which sum (by contrast) is included within the stated total of &#163;503,073.  These adjusted totals of &#163;25,004,730 (husband) plus &#163;306,498 (wife) give an aggregated figure of &#163;25,311,228.  Making similar adjustments in the wife&#8217;s column I get a slightly higher figure but the difference is small and would not affect the outcome.  I therefore take the overall net wealth in this case as being roughly &#163;25.3 million.  </span></p>

Such skiing holiday (although not the presence of B or C) is noted in the wife&#8217;s 1995 diary.  Further, the wife&#8217;s diary has a clear entry for June 1995 &#8220;dinner B&#8217;s birthday.&#8221;  B also agreed in cross-examination that the husband (her father) brought the wife on the family&#8217;s summer holiday in Majorca in the summer of 1995, which she (B) was on.

In addition, there are letters in the &#8216;thank you letters bundle&#8217; from which one can infer that C must have met the wife much earlier than he recalls.

All three of them had thought and had stated in statements that this had happened in 1997.  It was only when the computer records of the lease were obtained during the hearing that the correct date of 2000 emerged.  All agree that she (Mrs D) started working for the husband as his PA in August 1995, at which time she says in her statement that &#8220;... neither the husband, his children nor anyone else was living at The London House.&#8221;  She must, however, be wrong about that for this reason.  The wife asserts and the husband accepts that from the beginning of 1995 he employed a housekeeper at The London House called Miss X.  She (Miss X) was employed by him there in that capacity until the summer of 1995 when he asked her to leave and took on Miss Y as housekeeper in her place.  The husband said in evidence that the duties of Miss X had been to keep the house (The London House) clean and to make a bed for him if he was sleeping there; but that he had found her to act inappropriately, as she would put chocolates on his pillow.  Mrs D told me that she had not heard of Miss X.  This shows (contrary to Mrs D&#8217;s recollection) that the husband must have been living at The London House (Miss X being employed there as his housekeeper) </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">before August 1995</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> when Mrs D started.  The evidence of Mrs D was, however, firm that the wife had not moved into The London House until the staff moved out to a new office in London W1 (seemingly from her statement in about February 1997, but in her oral evidence in about June or July 1997).  Mr Southgate urges me to be cautious about Mrs D&#8217;s evidence since she accepts that she has read the papers in this case and has accompanied the husband to conferences with his lawyers.</span></p>

I have mentioned how, on his own evidence, Miss X was putting the chocolates on his pillow before Mrs D started working as his PA in August 1995.  So he must have moved in earlier in 1995.  The wife&#8217;s recollection is proved to have been right on that point.</span></p>

The wife has throughout said it was in September 2012.  He has throughout said April 2011.  The wife, however, produced a five page detailed list of social events which they attended together from May 2011 to August 2012.  It led the husband to shift a long way in cross-examination towards the wife&#8217;s case, including his having to amend his written evidence for their last appearance together at a particular Arts Festival from July 2011 to July 2012.  That is only two and a half years ago.  It is clear, and I find, that the wife&#8217;s case about the date of the ending of the marriage is right and that the husband&#8217;s recollection was flawed.  I reiterate his response to the wife&#8217;s solicitors in February 2013 that even then he did not agree that the marriage had broken down.  I accept the husband saying in his evidence that his age makes it more difficult to remember details nowadays; but then the wife would say that this may explain how he has misrecalled the date when their cohabitation began.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">One factual issue blew up at the very end of the case which contributed to both parties being briefly recalled.  During the hearing Miss Bangay called for the wife&#8217;s letters and diaries on which the wife had relied in her written evidence.  She, the wife, therefore, returned from London to The Big House overnight to collect them.  Unbeknown to her, the husband was himself also staying there that night.  She had thought that, like her, he was staying in London during the hearing.  Late at night there was an unseemly confrontation between them at The Big House.  Both behaved in a manner which I expect they regret.  The wife accuses the husband of not disclosing the letters, as he should have done being relevant to the issue of the parties&#8217; cohabitation.  He accuses her of being in his study without permission and rifling through his documents trying to find them.  She says it is not &#8216;his study&#8217; but &#8216;the study in our house&#8217;.  Miss Bangay submits that the husband is so much more likely to be right about the study being his &#8216;sanctuary&#8217; that this goes to show the wife&#8217;s overall lack of credit.  I cannot, however, accept that.  Given the late stage at which the issue emerged, there was no opportunity for any meaningful investigation of it and I decline to &#8216;take a punt&#8217; at who is right.  It seems counter-intuitive that during the happier times of a marriage one spouse should &#8216;ring-fence&#8217; a particular room and, having seen this wife, I rather doubt that she would have accepted it.  It may very well be, given the bitterness between the parties, that their perceptions of the status of the study have become polarised.  In any event, whoever is right (or whether the truth is somewhere in the middle) this is not a point which I find assists me as to which party is generally the more credible.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">So where on this review of the evidence am I left on the issue as to when the parties started to live together?  On any view everyone&#8217;s recollection, the husband&#8217;s, the wife&#8217;s and Mrs D&#8217;s, was comprehensively wrong about the date of the wife taking the flat in N Street.  The suggestion that this was leased in 1997/1998 originally came from the husband in a Questionnaire and it looks as though the wife just went along with that date assuming it to be accurate.  The recollections of B, C and Mrs D as to certain dates have also been shown by clear evidence to be wrong although, that said, they remained firm on the point of the wife not moving into The London House until 1997.  The husband&#8217;s Christmas card in December 1995 and the &#8216;thank you letters bundle&#8217; clearly imply a couple who were, if not living together, then at least very close.  But what about the wife&#8217;s 1995 diary with its scribbled out entries?  Assuming for the sake of argument that the words scratched out after the word &#8220;dinner&#8221; are &#8220;at Ivor&#8217;s,&#8221; it could nevertheless be that someone in the very early stages of cohabiting would still refer to the home concerned as being that of its owner.  I accept it could be that by scratching out &#8220;at Ivor&#8217;s&#8221;, if the wife did so, she was trying to pre-empt Ms Bangay&#8217;s point referred to at paragraph 51(iv) above.  If so, she did it in a remarkably inept way, including leaving one such entry fully legible.  I find myself left in a state of uncertainty about the scored out diary entries, the late stage during the hearing at which the point emerged having impeded my being able to come to a reliable conclusion.  Nor do I consider that the wife&#8217;s removal of the two diary pages has been established as being &#8216;sinister&#8217; (i.e., that the pages may have shown something detrimental to her case) because, as she said, she could simply have used those end pages of her diary for scrap notes.  All in all, although the diary deletions concern me, I am not persuaded that the wife scribbled out the words concerned with a devious intention; or, if she did so (which I repeat I am not finding), I do not consider, having seen and heard her, that this shows that she was in fact not living at The London House when she says she was.  </span></p>

I do not consider that any witness has set out to lie about when the parties&#8217; cohabitation started.  These events happened getting on for 20 years ago.  It must be extremely difficult to remember dates which were unimportant at the time, as the unanimous but wrong recollection about N Street shows.  In addition, the parties are, as I say, in bitter conflict about this litigation, each fighting vigorously his/her polarised corner.  This affects the reliability of recollections.  There is no doubt from my having seen and heard the husband that his attitude to the wife has been negatively influenced by his sense of affront at the extent of her financial claims.  Having brought all the wealth into the marriage, he feels (as stated expressly in his Form E) that her claim should be assessed in the context of the rented the East London House from which she came.  He told me and clearly believes that she married him for his money.  I do not, however, find that to be so.  On the contrary, the contemporaneous correspondence implies that he would have been proud of her and grateful to her.  I have no doubt that she was in love with him and he with her.  His evidence is that he took all the decisions and that the wife &#8220;always lived in my houses.&#8221;  He does not consider that she contributed anything much to the marriage at all.  </span></p>

For example, her first budget was for &#163;360,000 per annum which was too high and the husband clearly saw it as provocative.  It has since been reduced to nearer &#163;160,000 per annum.  She exaggerated in one of her statements the speed with which the property in Chelsea became available to the parties as a London pied &#224; terre.  She has spoken of &#8216;a fleet of luxury cars&#8217;, which I find to have been an exaggeration.  She referred to a box at Ascot in terms which made it sound like a regular event, although in cross-examination she accepted that the last time was eleven years ago in 2003.  On the other hand, contrary to the husband&#8217;s perception, I am satisfied that she supported him fully within the home in the various ways of which she spoke in evidence; and that she complemented him as a supportive businessman&#8217;s wife and hostess within the social world of culture and the arts (music, opera and museums) and of philanthropy and fund-raising in which he moved.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Taking everything into account, my conclusion is that the wife probably did start living essentially at The London House at or about the time when she says she did.  I do not consider it was as late as the latter part of 1997.  It may well be that there was a transitional period of time after October 1995 when she stayed most but not all nights at The London House, although that presupposes The East London House having remained available for her to use after her sister&#8217;s return to Ireland in September 1995, which was barely explored in evidence.  The question still arises as to when this became a settled, enduring cohabitation of an equivalence to marriage but without the paper work.  The husband&#8217;s case is that the relationship was not originally in his mind committed or exclusive.  This was not amplified until during the hearing.  However, his evidence was clear about it and I doubt he was lying.  In addition, he has support on this point (of his not originally being &#8216;committed&#8217;) from B and from Mrs D, even though I take Mr Southgate&#8217;s point that such evidence was introduced other than as obvious answers to the particular questions asked.  There is also a small measure of support for the husband by way of a letter dated 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 1996 in the thank you letters bundle about the valuation of a watch which he says belonged to a named lady friend.  I have to take a broad view about this and I acknowledge the submission on behalf of the wife that the husband&#8217;s evidence may show merely that he was &#8216;two-timing&#8217; her.  Nevertheless, the question is by when the parties&#8217; cohabitation had settled into a committed and enduring relationship of an equivalence to marriage and I have concluded that the most likely date is the mid to latter part of 1996.  This is the product of taking a broad view of the probabilities and is not expressly supported by any particular piece of evidence.  I do not, however, think it does injustice to either party and I suspect that, nearly 20 years on, it is about the best that fallible judgment can achieve.  </span></p>

It is common ground that she did buy some flat-pack type furniture for it; nevertheless, she was very clear that she actually spent very little time there, because she was scared of sleeping there alone and because the flat was noisy.  She also said she left the majority of her clothes and belongings at The London House, which I do not think was rebutted by the husband.  I accept that she did not use N Street for very long and I do not consider that such a break in the parties&#8217; relationship interferes significantly with the otherwise &#8216;seamless&#8217; move from settled relationship starting in the mid to latter part of 1996 to marriage in 2003.  </span></p>

The husband does not draw a conventional income.  He takes money from his DLA in H Ltd as and when he needs it to fund his living and other expenses.  He has a wide portfolio of properties held through his many special vehicle companies and there is no reason to think that he will not be able to continue living to a comfortable standard following the outcome of this application.  His budget for the future is in the sum of about &#163;161,000 per annum, brought up to &#163;181,000 per annum by the addition of school fees for his grandchildren.  Within such budget there is a sum of &#163;84,000 per annum for &#8216;household&#8217; at The Big House and a sum of &#163;26,800 per annum for The Seaside House, aggregating to &#163;111,000 per annum in respect of expenditure on accommodation.  The wife has no current income from any kind of paid work and she has about &#163;14,000 a year rental income from the flat in Oxford net of mortgage but pre-tax.  At the age of 47 she could augment the additional investment income which she will have after this hearing, but I do not think to a very significant extent.  She has not been a PA for nearly 20 years.  It would not be reasonable, given the lifestyle to which she has been accustomed, to expect her to go back to &#8216;mopping and emptying buckets&#8217; (her words) in floristry.  I shall approach the case on the basis that if she does want a better standard than is available through the award which I shall make, then she could find something modest to do to augment it.  Her budget for the future is in the sum of about &#163;164,000 per annum.  It is uncannily similar to the husband&#8217;s of &#163;161,000 per annum (excluding his grandchildren&#8217;s school fees) but made up differently.  For example, her estimate for her future housing needs is only &#163;59,000 per annum (less by &#163;52,000 per annum than the husband&#8217;s for himself) but her aggregated figure of &#163;48,000 for clothes, shoes, entertainment and holidays is greatly larger than his for those items. </span></p>

As for the wife, her needs will probably be of much longer duration than the husband&#8217;s.  The award should enable her to continue not in the same way as before the marriage broke down, but to have a standard of life which bears a proper relation to that to which she has been accustomed and to that of the husband.  It should not be assessed, as the husband has said, in the context of her rented accommodation in East London in 1994.</span></p>

The wife says this was very high, bordering on the luxurious.  The husband says it was good but not spectacular.

However, the wife does not accept that.  She says (although the Schedule concerned was put in too late for her for comment) that she was not spending as much as usual by 2012.  She also asserted, in paragraph 14 of her statement at C106, that much spending went through the business.  I do not think I have the husband&#8217;s express response to that, although I note that at C113 when dealing specifically with the wife&#8217;s paragraph 14 he does not gainsay that particular assertion of her&#8217;s; nor do I know the amounts said to be involved as going through the business.  </span></p>

All the usual household expenditure, staff and motoring were on top, as well as the husband&#8217;s own personal expenditure.

The date for valuing his wealth at the outset does not correlate precisely, since the accountants&#8217; exercise relates back only to 1997, whereas I have held that it was by the mid to latter part of 1996 that the parties&#8217; relationship had gained a sufficient equivalence to marriage for their cohabitation to be counted as such.  But this difference is not significant.  The accountants have agreed that the husband&#8217;s total net assets were at the outset around &#163;13 million and are now around &#163;26 million.  The revised figure of &#163;25.3 million net for the present combined total of the parties&#8217; assets as found at D above is slightly lower essentially by the incidence of outstanding costs.

There would then be a notional equal sharing of the &#8216;matrimonial property&#8217; following which the wife&#8217;s share would be tested against her needs.  Any additional sum required to meet those needs would come from the sum characterised as non-matrimonial property.  This process would in itself create a fair outcome: sharing would not come into it.  It was with this approach in mind that Ms Wallace-Walker was instructed on behalf of the husband amongst other things to calculate the &#8216;marital acquest&#8217;.  Her report was exhibited to the husband&#8217;s Form E.  It says that the &#163;13 million introduced by the husband, enhanced by passive growth on it, can be seen as accounting for the entirety of the current &#8216;kitty&#8217;.

With hindsight this was an error of case management.  The exhibiting of an expert&#8217;s report by the husband was without the leave of the court and contrary to the rules.  It should have been dealt with robustly by an order for a single joint expert.  That is what would or should have been ordered if the husband had not jumped the gun.  The single joint expert would or should then have been told that what the court needed was a broad-brush approach set out in a succinct page-limited report.  It would greatly have reduced the costs and reading time.  It would have lessened the significant burden on the lawyers and on the court of having a lever arch file (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">sic</span><span style="font-size:14pt">) of competing accountancy evidence.  </span></p>

His calculations and analyses led him to the conclusion that the current &#8216;matrimonial assets&#8217; amount to some &#163;6.3 million being referable to the husband&#8217;s &#8216;active management&#8217; of particularly (a) H Ltd itself; of (b) The London House (the husband&#8217;s decision to sell it and invest most of the proceeds into H Ltd); and of (c) The Big House which was refurbished and improved at a cost of about &#163;500,000, using part of the proceeds of sale of The London House.  The balance of the current total kitty (being &#163;25.3 million less &#163;6.3 million equals &#163;19 million) would thus be referable to the husband&#8217;s pre-relationship wealth augmented by its passive growth.  However, Mr Southgate emphasised from the outset that, notwithstanding Mr Lane&#8217;s opinion, this was not actually how he was putting his case; rather, that this is a case for simple sharing of the current kitty, albeit in proportions favouring the husband.</span></p>

It contains the nearly &#163;8 million injected into H Ltd from the sale of his interest in K Ltd.  Contrary to the wife&#8217;s case, I find that the basis for this funding from K Ltd was in place before the parties met and that the sale negotiations essentially took place before they were in a settled relationship bearing a sufficient equivalence to marriage.  The fact that the deal was completed and the money paid to the husband at the time of the start of their &#8216;relationship akin to marriage&#8217; is not such as to make the money &#8216;matrimonial property&#8217;.  The husband continued to &#8216;work&#8217; his company assets during the parties&#8217; relationship and marriage by way of property development, sales and property holding for rental income.

Done properly it requires an accountancy retrospective over practically every transaction from the 1990s to date so as to try to distinguish the cause of each component of gain.  The issue is further complicated here by the existence of matrimonial homes, three over time, and by the fact that most of the proceeds of sale of The London House went into H Ltd in 1997.  </span></p>

Broadly such an exercise would bring the husband&#8217;s 1997 wealth up to between &#163;19.3 million and &#163;23 million, depending on the precise approach used.  That alone, she pointed out, would show the marital acquest to be minimal.  Both accountants go on to explore other Indices and other methods of trying to assist the court.  They do so necessarily with a number of caveats, assumptions and broad-brush discounts.  Ms Wallace-Walker makes the point that to do the job properly would require &#8220;... an economist to identify macro-economic variables and to apply statistical techniques and econometric modelling.&#8221;  Mr Lane says that it would be necessary to find &#8220;... clear dominant and reliably objective data identifiable as affecting H Ltd&#8217;s performance,&#8221; which would require &#8220;... an economist to identify significant statistical correlations that have a causal impact on the company.&#8221;  Such expertise would obviously be wholly disproportionate when the underlying task is essentially discretionary.</span></p>

Their illustrative range for the worth of the husband&#8217;s active management of H Ltd, The London House and The Big House is between Ms Wallace-Walker&#8217;s &#163;3.6 million and Mr Lane&#8217;s &#163;6.3 million.  For the reason at paragraph 64 above, it is unnecessary to decide between them.  Erring in the wife&#8217;s favour, I will take a round sum of &#163;6 million to represent the matrimonial property.  Sharing that equally would give the wife &#163;3 million.  The husband accepts that this would be insufficient to meet her needs and I agree.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Before considering those needs in more detail under heading H below, I need to deal with Mr Southgate&#8217;s argument for a straight application of the sharing principle, leading to an award of 33% to 40%.  I have paid particular regard to his arguments cogently marshalled at paragraphs 83.1 to 83.14 of his Skeleton Argument.  However, given the sum of which I am about to assess the wife&#8217;s needs I have not been persuaded that an enhancement of my intended award is necessary or would be fair based on sharing.  As already noted in paragraphs 69 to 71 above, this has not been done before where all or the bulk of the wealth has been brought in by just one of the parties to the marriage.  Like Moylan J in re </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">A R</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, I can see no particular basis here for fairness to require such sharing.  The husband is aged 71.  The wealth which he brought into the marriage is effectively the product of his life&#8217;s work, even bearing in mind the collapse of J Ltd.  He does not have a wide range of opportunities and choices before him, except as to the date of his retirement.  At the age of 47 comparatively more of the wife&#8217;s life is self-evidently ahead of her and she still has opportunities; but she will have them in addition to the fact that by virtue of her needs based award, she will be very comfortably provided for during the entirety of that life.  Moreover, her award will be by way of a lump sum or sums (unless perforce some part of the award is by way of shares); whereas the husband will be left with the risk of being in property for so long as he is able and willing to continue in business.  He may do better or worse than expected; but that goes with the territory.  In contrast, the wife&#8217;s position with &#8216;cash&#8217; will be certain and secure.  In addition, whilst liquidity has not been profoundly investigated at this hearing, I must pay some regard to the accountants&#8217; agreement that liquidity is scarce within H Ltd.  Although the husband&#8217;s Form E shows that he has contemplated retirement, he spoke to me in terms of continuing to work so as to honour his commitments.  My &#8216;needs based&#8217; order is inevitably going to require sales and/or other re-financing within the companies.  If it were augmented by &#8216;sharing&#8217; up to an award of some &#163;8.7 million as sought by the wife, I do not consider that the impact on the businesses would in the overall circumstances be fair or justified.  In the result, I accept Ms Bangay&#8217;s submission that I should treat this as a needs&#8217; case.</span></p>

The husband&#8217;s case is that a maximum of &#163;1.3 million should be allowed; however, his suggested properties can readily be seen from the estate agents&#8217; particulars and from the wife&#8217;s subsequent researches to be too modestly priced.  One such property is next door to a takeaway; one is adjacent to a block of characterless flats; another has railings outside the front door to protect those leaving it from a busy road.  None are of a sufficient quality against the background of The Big House, a most elegant six bedroomed Georgian Grade 2 property of almost 7000 square feet with extensive gardens, a swimming pool, a lake and woodland, having a gross value of about &#163;3.3 million.  The photographs of it in the papers show it to be, as the wife says, an exceptional property.  Her proposed properties are, however, over-aspirational.  There are many beautiful properties around the country town to be purchased for significantly less, bearing in mind that she will be single.  She, herself, spoke in cross-examination of seeking a property with a master bedroom and two to three further bedrooms, although that may have been said in an unconsidered moment.  Such a modest sized property is certainly not what she has been seeking and I accept that she has a large family whom she would like to have to stay with her on occasions.  She specifically seeks gardens but not additional land.  The task of the court, after considering the illustrative property particulars, is to determine a reasonable figure in all the circumstances of the case.  That figure, in my judgment, is &#163;1,750,000.  Under the new rules since 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2014, I calculate the stamp duty as being some &#163;124,000 and I shall allow a sum of about &#163;8000 for moving in and settling in expenses.  The wife will need to furnish her new property.  She has accepted that the husband will retain the lion&#8217;s share of the valuable contents of The Big House and the contents of The Seaside House.  She has not put in any evidence as to the likely cost of new furnishings, merely seeking &#163;300,000 (for both the homes she seeks) by reference in some way to the contents of The Big House.  In the absence of evidence I propose to allow a sum of &#163;180,000. </span></p>

This is vigorously opposed by the husband who says that there is absolutely no need for it.  The wife&#8217;s written case was that the parties always had a flat in London after The London House was sold.  I accept that this was not literally correct (see Part C above); however, she asserted at paragraph 9.3 of her statement at C100 and reiterated in her oral evidence that a London flat was always planned from 2009 onwards, but took a long time to materialise.  That is a suggestion which I do not think the husband challenged and I observe that at C128, where he deals with other aspects of the wife&#8217;s paragraph 9.3, he does not gainsay that particular assertion of hers.  The question is whether such a flat can be characterised as a need.  The wife&#8217;s proposed prices are from about &#163;1.2 million to about &#163;1.5 million for two bedroomed accommodation in SW10.  I have regard to the fact that for most of the parties&#8217; relationship they had the advantage of three properties, The London House in London, The Big House near the country town and The Seaside House.  As it is, the husband will be retaining the two remaining homes, The Big House and The Seaside House, a six bedroomed cliffside holiday home with swimming pool and pool house, having a gross value of some &#163;990,000.  That he should do so is reasonable given the background and of course he is free to transfer The Seaside House to B and C if he so wishes.  But is it fair and reasonable that the wife should be limited to one home in or around the country town as the husband seeks?  I have concluded that it is not.  She lived in London for 16 years from 1993 to 2009 when The London House was sold and she still has friends here.  I shall allow a figure of &#163;750,000 together with stamp duty, which I calculate at some &#163;28,000, and estimated costs of moving and settling in of &#163;5000.  Although the wife is going to have the contents of the property in Chelsea, it is probable that she will need other furnishings, equipment and bits and pieces which I assess broadly in the sum of &#163;20,000.  </span></p>

The husband&#8217;s case is that the wife can continue quite adequately with her seven year old vehicle.  I do not accept that.  He has just purchased a brand new vehicle for some &#163;79,000.  That the wife wishes to start her independent living with a decent new car is not unreasonable.  I find a fair sum for this purpose to be &#163;65,000.  </span></p>

Circumstances are different now, since both parties were then sharing one household.  They no longer do so, nor will again.  Nevertheless, I consider that a budget for the wife of around &#163;100,000 per year would be reasonable.  An alternative would be to assess a larger amount at the start with a step down in, say, 15 years&#8217; time; but I propose to take a simple flat line approach.  The relevant Duxbury figure as per At a Glance for a little over &#163;100,000 net per annum for the wife&#8217;s probable lifetime is &#163;2,500,000.</span></p>

I do not propose to accede to the wife&#8217;s request for specific funding for expeditions.  She herself seeks some &#163;37,000 per annum although in Mr Southgate&#8217;s opening presentation the sum shown is  a single capital sum of only &#163;100,000.  Her expeditions [mountain ranges named] only happened after April 2010 and by the end they were a source of tension between the parties.  I do not consider that they represent a need.  If the wife does wish to go on future expeditions, she has the wherewithal to do so by managing her finances accordingly.  She will have the rental from the flat in Oxford of some &#163;12,000 to &#163;14,000 per annum (or she can sell it) on top of her investment income under (d) above and she can, as I have said, probably find some employment if she is minded to do so.</span></p>

It is agreed that the wife will continue to own the flat in Oxford valued net at around &#163;240,000.  Deducting the value of the flat in Oxford from the wife&#8217;s assessed need figure of &#163;5,840,000 gives &#163;5,600,000.  That is the lump sum which, following the necessary crosscheck referred to below, I have decided to award, with The Small House to be transferred by the wife to the husband.  It will be on a clean break basis.  Timing of payment will require consideration once the husband has had a chance to take accountancy and other professional advice as to how this sum can best be raised.  I urge the parties as strongly as I can to agree timing and mode of payment and they must use their very best endeavours to do so.  In default, there will be liberty to apply as to timing and implementation, reserved to myself if available.  I do not think CGT on the proposed transfer of The Small House from the wife to the husband has been taken into account.  Assuming it has not already been covered, I struggle to see why it should be borne solely by the wife.  It is in the interests of both parties to tidy up The Small House&#8217;s ownership by uniting it with The Big House, avoiding further disagreements.  In such circumstances I propose that any CGT on the transfer of The Small House should be shared equally.  </span></p>

The real question is not whether this matches some conventional or intuitive percentage of the total, for example &#8220;about a third&#8221;, but whether it is fair as between the parties in all the circumstances.  These include, amongst other things, their ages; the wife&#8217;s contributions in the home and by supporting the husband generally; by her accepting that &#163;4.2 million from the proceeds of sale of The London House should go into H Ltd and by her accepting The Big House as being theoretically &#8216;put at risk&#8217; by the refinancing of P Ltd; and by the husband&#8217;s working within his businesses and making his contribution of wealth at the outset.  It is true that part of this wealth was comprised in homes and that certainly the main home is conventionally seen as &#8216;a matrimonial asset&#8217;; also that the wealth represented by the companies was used by the husband during the marriage to provide the family&#8217;s standard of living.  So there is force in the wife&#8217;s submission that the introduced wealth became part of the &#8216;fabric&#8217; or &#8216;backbone&#8217; of family life (although it was not &#8216;mingled&#8217; in the strict sense of being transferred at any stage from the husband&#8217;s sole name into joint names).  Giving full weight to that submission, however, it is an inescapable fact that the introduced wealth represented a huge contribution to the welfare of this family.  It was a &#8216;magnetic factor&#8217; which must be substantially reflected in the outcome.  I recognise that the wife will regard my award to her as far too low to meet her aspirations and that the husband will regard it as far too high.  That said, when I stand back to review it in the overall context and ask myself the core question, &#8216;is this fair by both parties?&#8217;, my answer is yes.  </span></p>
