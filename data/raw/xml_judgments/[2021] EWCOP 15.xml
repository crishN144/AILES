	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As the hearing began, there was, however, a dispute as to whether HD has capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations.   The Local Authority was of the view that the presumption of capacity<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

	      </authorialNote> in this regard was not displaced.  The Official Solicitor was more circumspect; she posited the view that, on the basis of the written evidence, the presumption of capacity in this regard was, or was likely to be, rebutted.  The specific issue on which the Official Solicitor focused my attention was that HD did not appear to understand that a sexual partner &#8220;must in fact consent before and throughout the sexual activity&#8221; and further &#8220;must have capacity to consent to sexual activity&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="6">

Y had been made the subject of <span style="font-style:italic">Sexual Harm Prevention Orders</span> in 2009 and 2019; he is also said to be learning disabled.  There were wider concerns expressed by the family and professionals regarding Y&#8217;s physical and financial abuse of HD.   HD&#8217;s family ultimately concluded that she could not continue living at home whilst continuing her relationship with Y.  HD denied any concerns about Y, or his status as a Registered Sex Offender. </p>

While there, she has been the subject of assessment and monitoring.  She requires prompting to undertake personal care; she is considered to be at serious risk were she to have liberty to come and go as she pleased.  </p>

She has expressed sexual interest in male agency care workers at Kingsbridge House.   HD has a history of making what appear to be unfounded allegations of sexual assault, including rape, against men; she also has been known to share naked photographs of herself on the internet. These issues have been problematic for those responsible for her care and support. </p>

They had sexual relations; HD made allegations that Y had sexually assaulted and raped her. Y was imprisoned for assault (unrelated to HD) and released in March 2020, he committed a further assault on a female and was recalled by probation and further imprisoned.  HD nonetheless continued to discuss her intention to marry Y on his release from prison.  She remained in contact with him when he was in prison by way of &#8216;love letters&#8217; and weekly telephone calls.  Fortunately, HD ended this relationship in or around May 2020.   Y was understood to be released in December 2020. </p>

HD and Z speak most evenings on the phone, the current Covid-19 lockdown restrictions prevent them seeing each other in person. Staff at Kingsbridge House have at times listened in on these calls; the conversations are sometimes mildly sexual in content.  HD wears a ring on her wedding finger and reports that Z gave it to her and asked her to wear it; she says they have discussed marriage. Her support plan describes him as her &#8220;partner&#8221;.

The decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re JB </span>marks an evolution in the Court of Protection&#8217;s approach to this difficult issue.   JB was a 36-year-old man with a complex diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder and impaired cognition.  He lived in a supported living placement with restrictions on his independence, principally because of his tendency to behave inappropriately towards women. He wanted to have a relationship with a girlfriend, and engage in sexual relations. Evidence from clinical psychologists indicated that he understood the mechanics of sex, but not the emotional state or intentions of others or the concept of consent. The analysis of capacity with regard to sexual relations had, until this case, been framed almost exclusively in terms of the capacity to <span style="font-style:italic">consent</span> to such relations, but the Court of Appeal reflected that giving consent was only part of the decision-making process. The fundamental decision was whether to <span style="font-style:italic">engage</span> in sexual relations and that was how the question of capacity with regard to sexual relations should be assessed in most cases. </p>

But that is because the issues arising in this case and the arguments presented to us have not been considered by this Court before. In my judgment, however, it is not inconsistent with the earlier authorities of this Court. As recognised by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">B v</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A Local Authority</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="10">

		      </authorialNote>, "what comprises relevant information for determining an individual's capacity to consent to sexual relations has developed and become more comprehensive over time." That development has continued in this case. The Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">IM v LM</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">11</span> stressed that "the notional process of using and weighing information attributed to the protected person should not involve a refined analysis of the sort which does not typically inform the decision to consent to sexual relations made by a person of full capacity". But as already stated, the information which a capacitous individual must take into account in deciding whether to engage in sexual relations includes whether or not the other person is consenting. My decision in this case is therefore not inconsistent with earlier decisions of this Court. </p>

He was very doubtful indeed that education could help her to process the somewhat abstract requirement for her to assess the capacity of any sexual partner; he thought that (at best) she could be supported to understand this in relation to an individual partner, but recognised that the test is not person-specific.  </p>

I might add that had the question of HD&#8217;s capacity to engage in sexual relations been listed before me several months earlier, i.e., prior to the Court of Appeal&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re JB</span>, I would probably have reached the opposite conclusion (i.e., that HD <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> capacity).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In his submissions, Mr McKendrick reflected more widely on the circumstances in which the court could tailor, or disapply any of, the relevant information contained in [100] of <span style="font-style:italic">Re JB</span>, in an assessment of capacity to engage in sexual relations.  This discussion germinated from the suggestion in <span style="font-style:italic">Re JB </span>at [101]-[103] that it was still an open question &#8220;whether the information relevant to the decision whether to engage in sexual relations must <span style="font-style:italic">always</span> include all of the matters identified in the previous paragraph&#8221; (my emphasis by italics). Notwithstanding the inevitably distressing implications for HD of the conclusion to which the parties were drawn on the evidence, Mr McKendrick accepted that the circumstances did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> exist here for the court to tailor or disapply the application of any of the relevant <span style="font-style:italic">Re JB </span>information.  I agree.  In short, there is no proper basis for distinguishing HD&#8217;s case from the ordinary run of cases which it seems to me were contemplated by Baker LJ, and I could not therefore but conclude that the information relevant to HD&#8217;s decision should be those set out in [100] of <span style="font-style:italic">Re JB</span>.   </p>

In this regard he was to some degree at odds with Miss A (see [23] above).  For my part, I consider that there is nothing to be lost, and possibly much to be gained, by providing HD with a package of further education<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="14">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Within the wider reflections on the current law referred to in [28] above, Mr McKendrick invited me to consider the analogous position of &#8216;consent&#8217; under the criminal law.  He drew attention to the commission of the offence of rape if the alleged perpetrator &#8220;does not reasonably believe [their partner] consents&#8221; - see <span style="font-style:italic">section 1(2)</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">3(1)(d)</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">Sexual Offences Act 2003</span> (the &#8216;reasonable belief&#8217; defence).  He argued that an anomaly may well arise where the capacitous may lawfully reasonably believe their partner has capacity to consent to sex, and does consent, as a matter of criminal law, whereas in the context of welfare proceedings in the Court of Protection P must understand, retain, weigh up and use the fact her partner <span style="font-style:italic">must</span> have capacity to engage in sex. He submitted that the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re JB</span> does not explain why a heightened civil test is required beyond that needed by the criminal law.  His submission in this regard chimed with the observations of Macur LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">R v GA</span> [2014] EWCA Crim 299 in which she said this: </p>

That said, I note that Baker LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re JB </span>was clear that the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection has a distinctly different focus from the criminal law and that it was not &#8220;appropriate to view these issues through "the prism of the criminal law"&#8221; ([106]).
