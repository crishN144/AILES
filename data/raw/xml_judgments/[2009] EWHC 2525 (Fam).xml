	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no doubt that, whilst she was living with him and his family, M transferred to Z very significant sums of money, being in substance the whole of her savings and capital with the exception of her house: a total of at least &#163;177,041 between 6 July 2004 and the beginning of January 2006. And the fact, whatever Z may protest, is that despite the strong adverse comments that I felt compelled to express first in a judgment I gave on 12 May 2008 and, again, in a judgment I gave on 19 December 2008, and despite the orders I made on those two occasions, Z has never provided a full and proper accounting of what has become of these monies. What he says was a specific gift of &#163;110,041 in April 2005 was, he says, applied in the purchase in his own name of a property in Cyprus; some &#163;26,000 he says he applied in repairs and improvements to M&#8217;s house; and some &#163;32,000 he says he applied to M&#8217;s general maintenance and living costs whilst she was living with him and his family. </p>

Z applied to the Court of Protection (11297039) to register the EPA. In the Family Division proceedings the local authority contended that it was not in M&#8217;s best interests to continue to live with and be cared for by Z and his family.  In the Court of Protection proceedings the local authority objected on various grounds to the registration of the EPA.</p>

Following that review at a hearing before me in October 2008, M was removed on 24 October 2008 to her present address for assessment. At a further review hearing in December 2008 I declined to direct M&#8217;s return to Z&#8217;s care, explaining my reasons in the judgment I gave on 19 December 2008: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2008/3425" uk:canonical="[2008] EWHC 3425 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWHC 3425 (Fam)</ref>.

On 19 March 2008 Z withdrew his application to register the EPA and the Official Solicitor was appointed as interim property and affairs deputy. The local authority&#8217;s objection on the ground of Z&#8217;s unsuitability had been supported throughout by the Official Solicitor and was accepted by me in the judgment I gave on 12 May 2008 and which also explained why I was appointing ITW to act as M&#8217;s property and affairs deputy. The order dated 12 May 2008 appointing ITW contained a number of directions as to the provision of co-operation and information to ITW by Z. Z&#8217;s default in complying with this order compelled me to make a further, more stringent order, in October 2008 and a yet more stringent order, backed by a penal notice, on 19 December 2008. </p>

Z asserts that he has complied in full with that order. He has not. Let me give just one striking example. Paragraph 2.7.1 of the order required Z to give a &#8220;detailed account&#8221; of how certain specified withdrawals from M&#8217;s bank account were &#8220;utilised&#8221;, including, as specified in paragraphs 2.7.1.5-2.7.1.12, withdrawals on various identified dates between November 2004 and October 2005 of the sums of &#163;2,000, &#163;3,000, &#163;3,000, &#163;200, &#163;3,000, &#163;3,000, &#163;10,000 and &#163;6,000 respectively &#8211; a total of some &#163;30,000. Z&#8217;s response to this, in an affidavit he swore on 16 January 2009, was simply &#8220;I cannot remember how these payments were utilised.&#8221; Given the size of the sums involved this assertion is simply incredible.</p>

In a report dated 13 February 2009 Dr PO, giving clear and convincing reasons for having come to this conclusion, said that he believed M to be without testamentary capacity. He described M as: </p>

I should record that the parties and the court were not aware of its existence (nor therefore of its contents) at the time of the hearing in February 2009. It is on any basis a curious document the meaning of which is far from clear. Clause 1 directs the insertion after clause 2 of the 2001 will of a new clause 2A, whilst clause 2 provides that &#8220;in all other respects I confirm my Will.&#8221; The new clause 2A appears to contain both a devise of M&#8217;s house (described as &#8220;the Property&#8221;) and a discretionary trust of her residuary estate. As to the former, it is to be noted that although clause 2A(2) provides for the house to be held &#8220;upon a trust of land and with and subject to the powers and provisions hereinafter declared concerning the same&#8221;, none are set out, unless (which is not what clause 2A says) this is intended to be a reference to what is set out in clause 2A(3) in relation to the discretionary trust of residue. As to the latter, it is to be noted that whereas, on the face of it, the effect of clauses 1 and 2 of the Codicil is to preserve the gift of the residue in clause 4 of the Will (ie, the gift to the various charities), clause 2A(3) identifies the beneficiaries under the discretionary trust of residue as being, primarily, PM and his issue.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already drawn attention to some of the difficulties in relation to the codicil dated 13 December 2003. But it is necessary, as counsel point out, also to have regard to what appear to have been M&#8217;s instructions to the solicitors who prepared the codicil. Here I focus only on the essentials. A letter from M to the solicitors and signed by her dated 15 September 2003 referred to &#8220;the residue of my estate&#8221; being &#8220;passed to my nominated charities.&#8221; A letter to PM (who appears to have been assisting M on the matter) from the solicitors dated 27 October 2003 refers to the effect of the draft codicil as being &#8220;to place her property into a discretionary trust&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;property&#8221;, as I have noted, being the word used in the codicil to describe M&#8217;s house. When the unhappy drafting of the codicil is considered in the light of these circumstances, there are, as it seems to me, and as Mr Smith and Miss Rich submit, powerful arguments in favour of the view that the codicil as drafted did not properly give effect to M&#8217;s wishes and that accordingly she did not &#8216;know and approve&#8217; its contents, with the consequence that an action for rectification under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/53/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/53" uk:canonical="1982 c. 53" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1982</ref> would have been successful. Specifically, there is a powerful argument that M&#8217;s intention was to give only &#8220;the Property&#8221; &#8211; her house &#8211; to PM and his family whilst leaving the residue to the charities.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the will dated 30 September 2004 the question is raised by Mr Smith and Miss Rich as to whether M had testamentary capacity or whether, as they suggest, the testamentary incapacity which it is common ground now prevails was already present then. In this connection they point to a report dated 21 September 2004 by a Locum Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr SM, who on 1 September 2004 &#8211; that is, just four weeks before the will was executed &#8211; assessed M in relation to &#8220;her mental state and her capacity to make financial and other decisions&#8221; and who concluded that M &#8220;obviously has significant cognitive impairment which could indicate a diagnosis of early dementia&#8221;, albeit she had &#8220;a very basic understanding about financial issues.&#8221; They point also to a report dated 4 March 2005 by another Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr MG, who had assessed M on 23 February 2005 and, specifically addressing the issue of testamentary capacity, expressed the opinion that &#8220;on the balance of probabilities&#8221; M had not been of testamentary capacity &#8220;for at least 18 months&#8221; &#8211; which would, of course, take one back to a date well before the execution of the 2004 will. </p>

Dr T, describing the occasion when she witnessed M&#8217;s signing of the will, says that M was &#8220;fully aware of what she was signing&#8221;, that she &#8220;had the mental capacity to understand the meaning and effect&#8221; of the will, and that &#8220;she was of sound mind and had made her own decision to sign the document.&#8221; She adds: &#8220;Had I thought otherwise, I would not have agreed to witness her signature&#8221;. Ms D says that she was &#8220;very conscious of the question of mental capacity and undue influence&#8221; although, she says, she had seen no evidence of either. On the contrary, she says that her own opinion of M was that she was &#8220;mentally well and alert but physically frail.&#8221; She describes the events when M, Z and Dr T attended at her offices for the will to be signed: M &#8220;appeared well and in good spirits&#8221;. She handed M the will and allowed her time to read it and then went through it with her. M said that she understood it and was happy to go ahead and execute it. The will was then executed. I should add that the will is a very short and simply expressed document covering only two pages of text, the central provisions covering no more than ten lines of text on the first page. </p>

As Lewison J said (para [36]), <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> marks a radical change in the treatment of persons lacking capacity, in particular (para [37]) by enacting the overarching principle that any decision made on behalf of P must be made in P&#8217;s best interests. Thus it follows, as he says (para [38]), that the guidance given in the cases decided under the Mental Health Acts 1959 and 1983 about the making of settlements or wills can no longer be directly applied to a decision being made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I would go somewhat further. It seems to me that, not least for all the reasons given by Lewison J, such well-known authorities as <span style="font-style:italic">In re L (WJG)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1966] Ch 135" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1966">[1966] Ch 135</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">In re D (J)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1982] Ch 237" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">[1982] Ch 237</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">In re C (A Patient)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 FLR 51" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 FLR 51</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">G v Official Solicitor</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/816" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 816" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 816</ref>, [2006] WTLR 1201, are best consigned to history. The starting point now must be what Lewison J aptly described (para [38]) as the &#8220;structured decision making process&#8221; prescribed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>, a process which requires the decision maker &#8211; here the Court of Protection &#8211;  to take a number of steps before reaching a decision, including, as Lewison J described it, encouraging P to participate in the decision, &#8220;considering&#8221; P&#8217;s past and present wishes, and her beliefs and values, and &#8220;taking into account&#8221; the views of third parties as to what would be in P&#8217;s best interests. And there is, in my judgment, no place in that process for any reference to &#8211; any harking back to &#8211; judicial decisions under the earlier and very different statutory scheme, decisions which, as Lewison J justly observed, required the judges to perform &#8220;mental gymnastics&#8221; and which, as Palmer J equally justly observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Fenwick, Application of JR Fenwick &amp; Re Charles </span>[2009] NSWSC 530 at para [87], reached the high water mark of artificiality in <span style="font-style:italic">In re C</span>. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is, in contrast, a process very familiar to judges in the Family Division, with their long experience of applying structurally somewhat similar schemes such as the statutory schemes under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> and, in a financial context, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.

In some cases, in some situations, they may carry much, even, on occasions, preponderant, weight. In other cases, in other situations, and even where the circumstances may have some superficial similarity, they may carry very little weight. One cannot, as it were, attribute any particular <span style="font-style:italic">a priori </span>weight or importance to P&#8217;s wishes and feelings; it all depends, it must depend, upon the individual circumstances of the particular case. And even if one is dealing with a particular individual, the weight to be attached to their wishes and feelings must depend upon the particular context; in relation to one topic P&#8217;s wishes and feelings may carry great weight whilst at the same time carrying much less weight in relation to another topic.

Thus, for example, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>(a) refers to &#8220;any relevant <span style="font-style:italic">written </span>statement made by him when he had capacity.&#8221; An oral statement, if relevant, is not, however, to be ignored, for it will be a &#8220;relevant circumstance&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(2)</ref> and, if it goes to wishes and feelings, will in any event fall within the opening words of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>(a).

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;There is one other aspect of the &#8220;best interests&#8221; test that I must consider. In deciding what provision should be made in a will to be executed on P&#8217;s behalf and which, ex hypothesi, will only have effect after he is dead, what are P&#8217;s best interests? Mr Boyle stressed the principle of adult autonomy; and said that P&#8217;s best interests would be served simply by giving effect to his wishes. That is, I think, part of the overall picture, and an important one at that. But what will live on after P&#8217;s death is his memory; and for many people it is in their best interests that they be remembered with affection by their family and as having done &#8220;the right thing&#8221; by their will. In my judgment the decision maker is entitled to take into account, in assessing what is in P&#8217;s best interests, how he will be remembered after his death.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree entirely with this. Best interests do not cease at the moment of death. We have an interest in how our bodies are disposed of after death, whether by burial, cremation or donation for medical research. We have, as Lewison J rightly observed, an interest in how we will be remembered, whether on a tombstone or through the medium of a will or in any other way. In particular, as he points out, we have an interest in being remembered as having done the &#8220;right thing&#8221;, either in life or, <span style="font-style:italic">post mortem</span>, by will. Lewison J&#8217;s analysis accords entirely with the powerful analysis of Hoffmann LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Airedale NHS Trust v Bland </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] AC 789" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] AC 789</ref> at page 829.

It is clear that any distribution on intestacy would require further genealogical research. The evidence filed strongly suggests that only M&#8217;s cousin J (a son of one of her maternal aunts) has had any personal connection with her or taken any interest in her welfare in recent years.

Ms Ilett&#8217;s attendance note of her visit to M on 12 February 2009 contains the following illuminating passage: &#8220;This comment and other comments made by M during the meeting left me with the impression that M&#8217;s expressed views as to the contents of her Will were motivated by what she thought was expected of her rather than what she actually wanted. She also appeared to believe that, having made a Will, its terms should not really be departed from.&#8221; So far as concerns her previous wishes, Miss Rich submits that the previous wills are prima facie evidence of M&#8217;s past wishes (save, as she points out, to the extent that the 2003 codicil seems not to have been executed in accordance with M&#8217;s true intentions). And as Mr Smith points out, until the making of the 2003 codicil M had reasonably settled wishes, giving a legacy to PM and the residue to charities.</p>

There is no evidence of any belief by M in adherence to a &#8216;dynastic&#8217; pattern of inheritance nor is there evidence of any particularly strong connection with any of the charities named in the 1996 and 2001 wills. On the other hand, as Mr Smith puts it, there does seem to be a consistent desire from 1996 to 2003 to benefit charities.</p>

M no longer lives with Z and his family or has any contact with them, and is unlikely ever to return to live in her own home or another private household. Z is not responsible for her property and affairs and the validity of substantial transfers of funds from M to Z has been questioned and may be pursued in litigation on her behalf. And Z has not as yet provided sufficient or satisfactory explanation of his dealings with M&#8217;s property and affairs.</p>

The views of the local authority and its employees engaged in caring for M or interested in her welfare are not in evidence and, says Miss Rich, are unlikely to be relevant, as the local authority has no concern with M&#8217;s property and affairs or knowledge of matters which would be relevant under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>.

Given the valuation uncertainties, Miss Rich submits that it would be appropriate for any legacy or legacies to be expressed as shares rather than as fixed sums, in order to avoid a potentially unjust imbalance between legatee(s) and residuary beneficiaries on eventual distribution. </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">As regards the 2003 codicil, there is, for all the reasons I have already rehearsed, a strong likelihood that it was not executed containing the provisions that M intended and that it might well have been subject to a successful rectification claim under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/53/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/53" uk:canonical="1982 c. 53" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1982 Act</ref> if it had remained unrevoked and been admitted to probate. Miss Rich further suggests that knowledge and approval would have been in issue, given what she says was the extent of involvement of PM&#8217;s family in procuring the execution of the codicil via correspondence with professional intermediaries at the same time as giving instructions for work on PM&#8217;s behalf, and given also the fact that the wording of the codicil as it stands suggests that M did not read it over and understand it before she executed it. In all the circumstances, she submits, I should accordingly consider it more likely than not that the &#8220;past wishes&#8221; which M intended to express in the 2003 codicil were in fact a wish to devise her house to PM&#8217;s family, and the residue of her estate (which at that date included the value of her share portfolio and other cash in deposit accounts or other investments of a sum which may have been as much as &#163;300,000) to the charities named in the 2001 will.</p>

The 1996 and 2001 wills largely benefit charity (to a substantial extent the same charities as between the two) with a legacy to a friend and neighbour, PM, which is clearly above the level of being a token but nevertheless represents a minor fraction of her estate. The 2003 codicil (if analysed as she suggests I should) preserved the charitable intention and structure of the residuary gift of the 2001 will but introduced a substantial gift of property &#8211; the house &#8211; to PM&#8217;s family. The 2004 will, made only nine months later, entirely excludes both PM&#8217;s family and the charities in order to benefit Z alone.</p>

Moreover, as Miss Rich also points out, Z himself in his witness statement of 27 February 2009 says that &#8220;when M signed the 2004 will she did so in the expectation that she would spend the remainder of her life in my home.&#8221;</p>

As there is no longer any question of her care being provided by a neighbour or other private household on the basis of an understanding or expectation that the carer would inherit a substantial part or all of her estate, there is, she submits, no reason why either PM&#8217;s family or Z should benefit to the extent of their expectations under the 2003 codicil and 2004 will respectively. As Mr Smith puts it, given that there is no longer an individual on whom M is dependent for her security, the impetus behind the 2003 codicil and the 2004 will has probably disappeared.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">As regards Z, and the issue of whether he should be entitled to any legacy to reflect his expectations under the 2004 will, Miss Rich submits that M&#8217;s past wishes have to be balanced against Z&#8217;s subsequent conduct in relation to her and her property and affairs, the court-imposed cesser of contact between M and Z and his family, and the prospective proceedings for recovery of M&#8217;s funds from him. The Official Solicitor, she tells me, considers that the weight to be given to these factors is sufficient to exclude Z and any member of his family from any benefit under a statutory will made on this application. It cannot conceivably, she says, be in M&#8217;s best interests both to litigate the recovery proceedings (which have already been directed by the Court) and at the same time to make any provision under her will for Z, who is the prospective defendant to those proceedings. And for good measure, she adds, in considering M&#8217;s best interests it would be wrong for the court to depart from the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Rhodesia Goldfields Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1910] 1 Ch 239" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1910">[1910] 1 Ch 239</ref>, which I referred to in my judgment of 19 December 2008, and make an order which conferred a prospective benefit on Z before he had restored any funds found to be due to M&#8217;s estate.</p>

He relies in this context upon the large sums of money transferred by her to Z, my criticisms of Z as set out in the passages in the two judgments to which I have referred, the fact, as he suggests, that Z seems to have made himself the central focus of M&#8217;s life at the time the 2004 will was made and to have discouraged her contact with others (as to which see my judgments) and the fact that the 2004 will left everything (that is, everything which had not already been transferred to him) to Z.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the charities, Miss Edge supports the making of the statutory will as proposed by the Deputy, essentially for much the same reasons as those put forward by Mr Smith and Miss Rich. The charities agree that they should take equally, the approach in the 2001 will taking precedence over that in the 1996 will. Where she takes issue with their approach is in relation to the question of a possible legacy to J, a matter to which I return below.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Z&#8217;s position is simply stated: that I should direct a statutory will in the terms of the 2004 will. In support of his case he puts forward four propositions:</p>

The fact is, as he points out, that she did spend over four years with him and his family being looked after by them.</p>

He disputes that what he calls any ill motives on his part should be imputed to him; certainly not so as to justify excluding him completely as a beneficiary under M&#8217;s will.</p>

He makes clear in his position statement that, not merely does he seek to dispute any claim the Deputy may bring against him for recovery of any part of the monies transferred to him by M; he asks the court to &#8220;assess and repay to me the full time care costs of M from June 2004 until October 2008&#8221; at the rate of &#163;20,100 per annum.</p>

The Court of Protection has no jurisdiction to rule on the validity of any will; I have (appropriately) not heard all the evidence which it would be necessary to hear if findings were to be made on these issues; and it has to be borne in mind that the validity and propriety of the <span style="font-style:italic">inter vivos </span>transactions may yet be the subject of litigation in the Chancery Division. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are, in my judgment, a number of key reasons &#8211; magnetic factors &#8211; demonstrating why Z should be excluded from benefit:</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">First, there is the fundamentally significant change of circumstances correctly relied on by Miss Rich and Mr Smith. Its significance, despite what Z would have me accept, is only borne out by his own acknowledgement that, and I repeat what he said, &#8220;when M signed the 2004 will she did so in the expectation that she would spend the remainder of her life in my home.&#8221;</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly, there is the fact that Z has already received large sums from M and, on top of what he has already had, is seeking in addition reimbursement at the annual rate of &#163;20,100 for the cost of her care. Now it seems to me that Z is really here on the horns of a dilemma, impaled, as it were, upon one or other prong of Lord Chancellor Morton&#8217;s well-known fork. Either he has properly received, and without any impropriety on his part, the various monies transferred to him by M or he has not. If he has, then what further call can he have upon M&#8217;s bounty, given (a) the sums he has already received and (b) the further sums he is claiming, when both are evaluated in the light of his caring for M for some four years and not, as matters have turned out, for the rest of her life? How can it be in her best interests on this hypothesis to give him yet more? The simple fact, in my judgment, is that there is only one possible answer to such questions. But if, on the other hand, he has not &#8211; if he has indeed been guilty of impropriety &#8211; then how can it possibly be in M&#8217;s best interests to &#8216;reward&#8217; him by making yet further provision? Again, there is only one possible answer to the question.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Thirdly, and in any event, there are the serious findings I have made against Z as set out in my earlier judgments and the fact that he has still failed to comply fully with the order I made on 19 December 2008. How can it possibly be in M&#8217;s best interests to make testamentary provision for someone who has shown himself so unwilling or so unable to act in her best interests and who has acted in defiance of orders of the court made for her protection and in furtherance of her best interests? Again, the answer is obvious.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to PM and the charities. I can take this shortly. For all the reasons given by Miss Rich and Mr Smith I agree that provision should be made for both PM and the charities, essentially along the lines of the 2001 will. In contrast to the much more speculative questions raised in relation to the 2004 will, there is, as I have said, a compelling case for concluding that the 2003 codicil was intended to give PM&#8217;s family only M&#8217;s house and not her whole estate. Be that as it may, however, the changed circumstances since 2003 amply justify the submission that PM and his family cannot reasonably expect to receive &#8211; that it is not in M&#8217;s best interests that they receive &#8211; provision at the level which she may have thought appropriate in 2003. The balance, in my judgment, is appropriately struck in M&#8217;s best interests by giving PM the legacy proposed by the Deputy and the Official Solicitor.</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">First, M&#8217;s reported statements as to why J should not benefit under her will. During her interview with M on 12 February 2009, Ms Ilett asked M whether she would want to benefit J and his wife; &#8220;she said that she would not as they did not need the money.&#8221; The information supplied by J himself to Ms Ilett, in a letter he sent her dated 11 March 2009 and in a telephone conversation with her on 12 March 2009, was particularly illuminating, for he reported what M had told him <span style="font-style:italic">when she still had capacity</span>. In relation to the 1996 will, of which he was the executor, J recalled M commenting that &#8220;we had good provisions for ourselves&#8221; &#8211; the phraseology may be slightly odd but the meaning is clear. In the course of the telephone conversation, Ms Ilett told J what M had said: &#8220;she had been most emphatic that they&#8221; &#8211; J and his wife &#8211; &#8220;need not be included, as they had more than enough money of their own.&#8221; J&#8217;s response, as recorded by Ms Ilett was that M &#8220;had made the same comment to him when she had capacity.&#8221; </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Second, the fact that J&#8217;s involvement in M&#8217;s life since she was  removed from Z&#8217;s care has hardly been assiduous: seemingly a limited number of telephone calls and visits on two occasions </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with Miss Edge. A particularly compelling feature, as it seems to me, is that were J to be included as a legatee he would be gaining a benefit which M, while she had capacity, felt that he did not need and which, it would seem, she still thinks he does not need. How can it be in her best interests to go counter to such long-held views? The only proper answer, it seems to me, would be if it could be said that giving him a legacy was either an appropriate reward for what he is now doing for M or an inducement to him to do more for her; but neither, in my judgment, can be justified in the circumstances as they exist. </p>
