	    <p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This application was heard on the 23 and 24 August 2022. A draft judgment was dated 5 September 2022 and reached the parties on or about the 12 September 2022. The matter was due to be handed down on the 19 September 2022 but was adjourned due to the late Queen&#8217;s funeral. A combination of court room and judicial availability has therefore resulted in the formal handing down taking place on the 18 November 2022.</span></p>

This is an application made by Form A. It is an application for financial remedies made in divorce proceedings. The 2008 agreement (or an unenforceable order, during the life of the judicial separation proceedings) was never a final order made in a divorce. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since 2008. It therefore seems to me that I am duty bound not to simply interpret and implement the 2008 agreement as if this was a &#8220;liberty to apply&#8221; application, but to look at fairness afresh in 2022, applying s.25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The fact of the agreement, and the weight that the parties have attached to it, looms large in the discretionary exercise. However, it seems to me that to do justice to the parties in this application, I have to make a full determination under s.25 and not simply seek to implement an agreement as if time stood still between 2008 and 2022.</span></p>

Had the application commenced as a notice to show cause application, proper consideration could have been given as to what case management was appropriate in all the circumstances. This court was therefore placed in an invidious position.  However, my view is that the overriding objective requires the case to be determined rather than simply adjourned. </span></p>

H stated that W kept changing her mind about things and then the nephew&#8217;s visa ran out. It made no sense to set up a trust for him, which H did not think would be of any use to him once in AB Country, due to currency controls. Also, the nephew&#8217;s studies were in the field of improving his English and &#163;15,000 would have been way over the top of those costs.

After the marriage break down H had gone to a medical appointment, largely to support W&#8217;s daughter who in turn was supporting W. When the news appeared grim, H accepts that he did say something along the lines that W would be able to come and stay with him for a time. However, he says that a kind gesture made when W was in a low place has been twisted in the letter. Logically, why would someone who is separating offer to look after their ex-partner for life? Further, to the best of H&#8217;s recollection, this episode occurred after the 2009 agreement had been reached. I do not accept this aspect of W&#8217;s letter.</span></p>

W denied this but went on to give a confusing and unsatisfactory explanation of what resources may be at her disposal. W stated that she intended to visit AB Country in the near future and would ultimately return to AB Country. She said at first that her mother would provide for her. In cross-examination she readily accepted that her mother had already died and stated that she meant her mother&#8217;s estate. She denied any outright entitlement to property/inheritance but said that her younger brother would look after her if that was what her mother wished. She said she had not spoken to her brother about this. H said that W has an interest in a property which is rented in AB Country and that her sister retains the rents which has been used to purchase a property on the coast in AB Country. W denies this. Given that W has not fallen into debt, despite being in receipt of Universal Credit, it may be that W is already in receipt of some family support or inheritance. I do not have the material on which to make a finding. I doubt that with any procedure it would be possible to get to the bottom of all of this. The best I can do is say that I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that W will have resources that will assist with living and housing costs when she chooses to return to AB Country, which she will do at some point.</span></p>
