Before the hearing commenced articles appeared in this jurisdiction in The Times, Daily Mail and The Sun. In these the parties&#8217; identities were not revealed. However an article also appeared in the Daily Telegraph of Sydney, together with an accompanying photograph, in which the parties and D were named. It is difficult to understand how that newspaper obtained the details for that story, which is written very much from the father&#8217;s perspective and obtained the photograph without the father&#8217;s cooperation and Miss Renton on his behalf was unable to provide the court with any clarity on this point. I was told that the details of the case, by link to the Australian article, are available by using Google UK but only with a search of the names of both the father and mother. </span></p>

Miss Renton makes the point that presence of the Australian article does not justify wider reporting of the evidence as the evidence goes much further in terms of the details about the parties&#8217; private lives than what has been reported to date. In addition, she states that the Australian article is relatively difficult to find as it requires a Google search of both the parties names at the same time and so the story is relatively buried online. In her oral submissions Miss Renton clarified that the father does not seek orders to prevent the publication of the parents&#8217; identities or oppose in principle the publication of the judgment.</span></p>

However the mother opposes any reporting of the parties&#8217; evidence. Mr Devereux submits that the balancing exercise in this respect comes down in favour of Article 8 given the very personal nature of the evidence which focused on the private lives of the parties and the limited public interest in knowing these details as opposed to knowing the outcome of the case.</span></p>

This was a highly unusual part of the application and none of the advocates were able to provide me with any authority where the restriction has previously been lifted. Mr Callus also accepted that if my judgment was published which identified the parties and provided sufficient detail to explain the outcome and satisfy the legitimate public interest, the corresponding public interest in seeing a report of the evidence was much diminished. He accepted the two applications were linked. Moreover, on the facts of this case, I am completely satisfied that there is no legitimate public interest in a report of the evidence which would be a significant interference with the parties right to respect for private and family life and pose a risk of harm to D&#8217;s welfare if it was reported given that the evidence included full details about his parents&#8217; private lives, in particular the allegations of the father&#8217;s infidelities. The real public interest in knowing about the detail of these matters is minimal; on the contrary the interest would be inappropriately inquisitive, prying, prurient and voyeuristic. My judgment comes down firmly in favour of Article 8 and so I refuse the application to report the evidence.</span></p>

I accept that currently, given his young age, he can be protected by his parents from exposure to any such publicity. I accept that in years to come he may, as a result of the press reporting this case and his parents being named, learn more about the history of the case and some personal details of his parents&#8217; private lives and he may suffer harm as a result. However there is also a chance, despite the digital footprint left by this news that in years to come such details will be less accessible. The court has to look at the likelihood of this harm and evaluate how serious the risk is but these are not the only factor to take into account and do not take precedence and in my judgment on the facts of this case are outweighed. My assessment is that the likelihood of harm and risks are relatively low given the contents of my judgment, which is carefully crafted to avoid the sensationalist detail. The reality also is that identification of D is already possible given the press reports today in particular the Australian article and the resulting Google searches and although this is not a determinative factor it is an important one.  </span></p>
