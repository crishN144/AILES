      <p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">This judgment was handed down on 12 May 2023. It consists of 56 pages. The Judge has given permission for the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition that in any report, no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name, current address or location [including school or work place]. In particular the anonymity of the child and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court. For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and current addresses of the parties and the child will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain.</span></p>

I was informed that a full detailed judgment with headings would be appropriate. This is actually somewhat counter to the information in the intermediary&#8217;s report which states that a short simple summary of the decision and reasons why should be given although this I assume pre-supposed an oral judgement at the conclusion of the hearing. There was insufficient time to proceed with an oral judgment and in any event, I am of the opinion that a written judgement should be prepared for the sake of both parents and indeed Joe. I am aware from the intermediary assessment that short sentences are better for the mother, she has a &#8220;4 key word level&#8221; but it is simply not possible to produce a full written judgment on that basis. I will therefore rely on the mother&#8217;s advisers / intermediary / an advocate to go through the full judgment with mother if she wishes them to do so.</span></p>

The court must be proportionate, and it is not possible in this judgment to refer to all of the evidence and all the arguments advanced. I have given careful consideration to all of the material placed before me, but only refer herein to that which is necessary to resolve the key issues. Mother should be aware that just because I have not mentioned a particular point does not mean that I have ignored it.

I have deliberately done a far more detailed assessment of the written evidence within this judgment than usual for the benefit of the mother. I considered that this would be helpful to her even if she does not agree with or accept my decision, as I anticipate will be the case. Nothing in this judgment should need any further comment or explanation and unless it is a significant and relevant error of law or fact, I will not provide clarifications or deal with additional areas.

The Local Authority believed that mother required a high level of contact with Joe to evidence that she can meet his needs consistently. For this to happen she would need to be able to have Joe in her care most days and some evenings to demonstrate her ability to care, on a time increasing basis. This would require several workers coming in and out of her home day and night to be able to demonstrate her ability to care and include overnight stays for Joe. It would likely have to be outsourced by the Local Authority. The Local authority could not guarantee that the same workers would be able to support mother or that they would be trained to support mother with her own current needs. The social worker had had discussions with mother regarding this and they both did not feel that this would be manageable for mother. Mother told the social worker herself that she would be too fixated on making sure that the contact workers would be comfortable in her home, that she had food for them, that she had space for them, and she would become very overwhelmed. It was the Local Authority&#8217;s position that this plan would indeed set mother up to fail and this would not be a fair or realistic option.</span></p>

The placement was terminated due to ongoing safeguarding concerns, mother&#8217;s inability to accept and act upon advice from professionals alongside her inability to manage her own needs alongside those of Joe.

The cause of mother&#8217;s behaviour cannot be determined, and there is likely a combination of factors such as trauma, neurodiverse difficulties and / or personality traits, however, most significantly, Joe would be at risk of harm in his mother&#8217;s care, and testing out further support, will necessitate continuing delay. I cannot support any further delay for Joe aged [a number]-months-old, with proceedings standing at week 96.&#8221;</span></p>

Risks of illicit substance misuse remained although his use could be low level, and this would need consideration within future planning. The main risk factor at this time was father&#8217;s alcohol use and whilst his latest drug and alcohol report concluded positively in respect of no recent excessive alcohol use, they were reliant upon blood sample analysis which was not ideal as it can only analyse shorter periods. However, observations from professionals and the fact that father maintained employment did act to offer some reassurances in that respect and whilst caution must be exercised, he held the view that risks factors could be managed under a comprehensive risk management plan. This would ideally take the form of a Home Placement Agreement under a Care Order should Joe be placed within father&#8217;s care or within a period of transition / increased contact. He felt that such a plan could be considered if ongoing drug and alcohol testing was in place to measure use, reduction, or abstinence over a longer period.</span></p>

At one point I had to reassure the mother that her counsel was certainly conducting appropriate cross examination in accordance with the mother&#8217;s statement and representing her best interests in an entirely proper manner. Sadly the mother was unable to see that this was the case and she clearly did not like the social worker&#8217;s evidence being unchanged upon challenge; she appeared to be frustrated with her barrister being unable to secure the answers which she wanted to hear or considered to be appropriate.

There are other examples. These were all denied by the respective professionals and I do not think the mother was being untruthful, it is clear that these were related to her communication issues and misunderstandings. Having the opportunity of seeing mother in the witness box it was clear how she can misunderstand and needs frequent clarification.

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the 'lie' is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is 'capable of amounting to a corroboration.' In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Middleton [2001] Crim. L.R. 251. 'In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should, therefore, take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt'.&#8217;</span></p>

A local authority cannot press for a plan for adoption simply because it is unable or unwilling to support the child remaining at home. A judge must therefore be rigorous in exploring and probing the local authority&#8217;s thinking in cases where it may be affected by resource issues. Support for parents with learning difficulties may have to be long-term, extending throughout the child&#8217;s minority, in part because parents with cognitive difficulties, even if they understand the information they have been given, may find it difficult to retain it or to apply it as the child gets older, but also because, as the child gets older, [her] needs will evolve and the range and level of support and guidance required by the parents must evolve alongside. Judges need to be wary of arguments based on the concept of &#8220;substituted parenting&#8221;. They should carefully scrutinise the evidence adduced by the local authority that the level of support required by the parents would be on a scale that would be adverse to the child&#8217;s welfare and should look for options for ameliorating the risk of harm that might result from the high level of support. It is all encapsulated in the simple sentence in paragraph 1.4.4 of the Guidance quoted above &#8211; &#8220;every effort should be made to support not supplant the parents&#8221;.</span></p>

He has stopped attending contact on the basis that he considers it is not in Joe&#8217;s interests.

The negatives include ceasing all contact with his natural family including his half siblings and this potentially affecting his identity but there are more positives. These include him ceasing to be a looked after child subject to corporate parenting, being placed with carers who have effectively chosen him and will care for him throughout not only his childhood but also the rest of his life and the possibility of having his own new family and family unit. This is the only option that offers Joe the option of secure and safe family life according to both the Local Authority and the Guardian and I accept that assessment. </span></p>

Joe&#8217;s immediate needs are for stability, security and permanence. In my judgment this can only be achieved by way of adoption and his welfare requires this, and accordingly I dispense with the consent of his mother and father.  I accept that this interferes with the rights of Joe and his parents to a family life together but in my judgment the making of such an order and the interference are proportionate given that there is no alternative which would meet his needs.</span></p>

There are other variables to consider too, for example, the parents&#8217; inability to support or accept a plan of adoption, the reasons which have led to this being the proposed final care plan for Joe, their inability to support Joe in an adoptive family, and the potential to undermine and disrupt any future placement. Consideration would need to be given to how Joe might respond to this and whether arrangements would undermine the sense of security that would be hoped for in an adoptive placement. The views and skills of prospective adopters would also need to be considered.</span></p>

In terms of risk, there are concerns about the parents&#8217; relationship, ability to regulate their emotions and behaviour. Regarding Jack, there are concerns about substance misuse, and negative lifestyle features that would likely impact upon stability for Joe and his adoptive placement should direct contact be maintained. It is felt the risks relating to Joe&#8217;s parents could therefore not be managed should direct post-adoption contact take place&#8221;.</span></p>

However, this is a mother, and indeed father, who at no stage of these proceedings have sought to undermine the foster placement or caused trouble in that regard. They clearly adore Joe and would not, as I have stated in this judgment, deliberately cause him harm. It remains to be seen how they accept and adapt to the outcome of these proceedings but as yet, there is no evidence, which has been brought to my attention, that they would seek to undermine or seek to disrupt any adoptive placement. I have more concern about the father due to his recent drug driving conviction and his failure to engage with Joe and the proceedings thereafter but the mother has conducted herself well and with dignity in what to her must be terrifying and difficult circumstances throughout this final hearing despite the special measures in place.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.65in"><span style="font-family:Arial">I would therefore recommend that the Local Authority invite prospective adoptive carers to keep an open mind about direct contact at some point in the future, particularly with the mother. There are benefits of direct contact within adoption, as well as risks, and these include maintaining important relationships between the child and birth relatives; providing reassurance to the child and birth relatives; helping the child with issues of identity and loss; and helping the child to deal with their dual connection to the birth and adoptive family. It can help a child to make sense of the past. Social media has changed the landscape for closed adoptions, as children grow older and curious. It is often better for any such direct contact to take place in a controlled and supported manner rather that at the child&#8217;s own volition. Letterbox contact cannot, in my judgment, ever be considered to be truly &#8220;good quality&#8221; as it is so limited in nature, but I accept that it is often the only way to maintain any links.</span></p>
