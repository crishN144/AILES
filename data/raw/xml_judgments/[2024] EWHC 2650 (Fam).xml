He has gone missing once before, about ten years ago, but only for about six weeks.  He has also travelled abroad in the past, occasionally at times when he has been suffering from declining mental health, but during those periods has invariably kept in touch with the Claimant; complete cessation of contact is, I am told by the Claimant, &#8220;out of character&#8221;.</span></p>

He abandoned his car at Morpeth station (it acquired multiple parking tickets). <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">SB apparently sent a letter to the </span>vicar by e-mail in late-September / early-October 2023; the letter contains random musings of SB but it suggests, by its contents, that he was by then on the Shetland Islands.  This indeed was confirmed by a sighting of SB by the police in Lerwick on 25 September 2023.  It now transpires (from police disclosure) that, while in the Shetland Islands, SB attempted to board a boat heading to Norway; he was unsuccessful in doing so.  It is likely that SB then returned to the Scottish mainland before flying to Dublin (probably on 3 October 2023), and then he travelled (though it is unclear how) to Munich.</p>

Police intelligence reveals that SB&#8217;s laptop was used in Germany on or about 12 October 2023.  On 13 October 2023, SB apparently sent an e-mail to the vicar, saying that he was in Switzerland, having travelled on a bus &#8220;between Spain and Paris&#8221; (this would tend to validate his claim to have travelled by boat to Bilbao); he indicated his intention to travel to Israel (where he had previously visited).  His bank card was indeed used once in Switzerland at about this time; later bank transactions placed him in <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">southern Italy on the 14 October 2023, 16 October 2023 (Bari) and on 17 October 2023 (in Maglie, Lecce).  It seems likely (by reference to card purchases) that he had travelled to Maglie by train.  There has been no activity on his bank account since that date, and there has been no other trace of SB.</span></p>

Enquiries have been made of all places which SB regularly visited near his home (including his gym) to no avail.  There has been surprisingly little record of his passport having been used in the period under review; i</span>t is possible that SB has two passports (the Claimant suspects that he may have acquired a second passport in the country where his father lives), but border controls in the UK and in Europe appear not to have detected him at any stage as he travelled from country to country.</p>

Within those documents (which have materially informed the information which I have set out at </span>&#167;&#167;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">5-8 above) it is noted that i</span>n May 2024 an unidentified body had been found in Germany which was initially thought by Interpol to be SB; DNA evidence disproved this.

A missing person is defined in section 1 of the G(MP)A 2017.  For present purposes, it is sufficient to record that the relevant provisions are that SB &#8220;is absent from his &#8230; usual place of residence&#8221;, and from his &#8220;usual day-to-day activities&#8221;, and his whereabouts are &#8220;not known at all&#8221;.

In spite of the considerable efforts made by the police, and also by Kevin Bartram, and the family, SB&#8217;s  whereabouts are truly unknown.  Given the dismal state of SB&#8217;s finances, the risk of re-possession of his home, and the sizeable debts which are mounting and being pursued, I am satisfied that that it is in SB&#8217;s best interests to make an order appointing a guardian (section 18 ibid.), so that his finances can be regularised.  I am further satisfied that the Claimant is an appropriate appointment to fulfil this role (section 4 ibid.). </p>

This part of the order is of course extendable (section 12 G(MP)A 2017).  In many cases it is appropriate for the Court to require the Guardian to give &#8216;security&#8217; for the exercise of their functions (see section 6(3) G(MP)A 2017); I have had regard to the Claimant&#8217;s modest financial circumstances, and to the extent to which she has already made considerable financial outlay to settle liabilities incurred by SB in his absence.  I do not consider that I should, additionally, require the Claimant to give security in this case.</p>
