	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">To anyone hearing my judgment now, or reading it later, it might be thought that it is very unusual for the Court to make a swathe of serious findings against a mother, of domestic abuse perpetrated by her against a father. However, it is my role to set aside stereotypical views of domestic abuse when hearing cases in the Family Court. This case underlines, in my judgment, the need to approach each and every case with no preconceived views as to who might be an abuser, and who might be a victim. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">In this case, I have significant concerns around the irrational and unpredictable behaviour of the mother. I need to set out with care why I say that is, and that will take some time. However, in fairness to both parents, I wanted them to know from the outset, in broad terms, the conclusions I have reached so that they are not kept in limbo until I have finished. </p>

The children&#8217;s mother is A, and their father is B. I mean no disrespect to either of them, but I am going to refer to them as the mother and the father throughout my judgment.</p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">The father issued these proceedings on 29 June 2022, at which time he sought a Prohibited Steps Order and a Child Arrangements Order. On 4 July 2022, Deputy District Judge Lowe made a number of orders, including that the mother&#8217;s contact with the children needed to be supervised by an independent social worker pending a contested hearing. She also made a Prohibited Steps Order to prevent the mother from removing the children from the jurisdiction, and she gave other directions as well. Separate <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> proceedings were issued under case number BH22F00201 which were then consolidated with these proceedings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">On 21 July 2022, an interim Child Arrangements Order was made at the contested hearing by District Judge Miles, as a result of which the parties were to share the care of the children. The requirement for the mother&#8217;s contact to be supervised fell away but, since then, an independent social worker has facilitated handovers.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">On 9 December 2022, District Judge Lacey determined that a Fact-Finding Hearing was not necessary. That appears in part to have been based on the recommendations of Cafcass&#8217;s Part 1 child impact report dated 5 December 2022, which set out that, if the parties wished to continue with the shared care arrangement, the need for a Fact-Finding Hearing was reduced. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, in the Part 2 of the child impact report in February 2023, Cafcass identified that the shared care arrangement was reported by the parents no longer to be working, and so Cafcass determined that it was therefore unable to safely make recommendations absent a Fact-Finding Hearing. Within these proceedings, allegations had been made by both of the parties against the other. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">On 8 March 2023, Recorder Sharp KC revisited the question of whether a Fact-Finding Hearing was necessary. The recitals to that order confirm that the mother did not pursue her allegations against the father, and that was on the basis that he does not present any risk to the children while they are in his care. The Court, however, determined that it was necessary, or to use the Judge&#8217;s word, &#8220;essential,&#8221; for a Fact-Finding Hearing on the allegations made by the father.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">The father&#8217;s allegations are allegations of physical abuse, verbal abuse, coercive and controlling behaviour and psychological abuse. The majority of those behaviours are ones which he alleges were perpetrated by the mother against him, but some are also said to involve abuse of the paternal grandmother, and some involve the alleged exposure of the children to the risk of harm. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">It is relevant, however, to say that the mother made allegations against the father of controlling and coercive behaviour, including financial abuse, isolation of the mother from sources of support, and persuading her to withdraw allegations that she had made to the police to resume their relationship. She made also allegations of sexual abuse, including an allegation of rape in April 2020, and she made allegations of physical and emotional abuse, including removal of the children from her care and covert recording of her.</p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">I have read very full bundles of evidence and I have been assisted during the course of the hearing by the parties&#8217; legal representatives. I have heard evidence from a number of witnesses, and I will come back to those shortly as well. The fact that I do not mention something in my judgment does not mean that I have not fully considered it, but the parties will appreciate that it is impossible for me to refer to absolutely everything that I have heard and read.</p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">Looking briefly at their objectives within these proceedings, the parties&#8217; positions are, in summary, these. The father seeks that the children live with him and spend time with the mother provided it is safe for them to do so. The mother seeks that the children live with her and spend time with the father, albeit, as I have said, she does not raise safeguarding concerns in respect of the father&#8217;s care of the children. </p>

When parents live separately, it follows from that that the starting point is that children should remain in contact with the parent that does not administer their day to day care. That starting point is of course subject to their welfare. Making an order for no direct contact is a serious and draconian order. The Court should not do so unless it is satisfied that it is both necessary and proportionate to do so and that no other less radical form of order will achieve the essential end goal of being in the children&#8217;s welfare interests whilst also promoting the involvement of each of their parents in V and W&#8217;s lives.</p>

In the context of serious sexual abuse, there is no typical victim and no typical offender. Delay in reporting such behaviour does not mean it is untrue.

Consent can be given enthusiastically or with reluctance, but it is still consent. But when a person gives in to something, against his or her free will, that is not consent, that is submission. They may submit due to threats, out of fear, or by persistent psychological coercion, and in those situations, they do not have free choice and that does not amount to consent freely given. </p>

Although the mother said she was not treated fairly by the police, because she was not offered an interpreter, it appears that she was provided with one on the one occasion when she asked. In any event, it is apparent from the evidence that she was able to communicate effectively verbally.

The paternal grandmother said that there were daily communications between the three of them, and that she needed to speak to the father all the time. In terms of geography, the father is based in a different office to that where the paternal grandmother and the paternal aunt are based, and so I did not consider what the paternal grandmother and the paternal aunt to have said to be inconsistent with one another. </p>

The mother says that she met the paternal grandmother about four times in 2017. Surprisingly, in my judgment, she did not recall if the father spoke about his mother much at that stage, and said that he did not speak much about her before she went to [her native country] in late 2017 or early 2018. However, the mother did agree that the father was a caring and supportive son to the paternal grandmother, which was a positive quality. </p>

Afterwards, the mother sent a text to the paternal aunt which included this: &#8220;It might be rude to take my baby back when he is crying, but I think it&#8217;s much more rude to keep a crying baby and don&#8217;t give him back to his mother.&#8221; She went on to say that she wanted, by sending the text, to set some boundaries. </p>

The father accepted in cross-examination that there was a height difference in the damage shown in the photographs of the side of the van. The father's evidence was that V witnessed this incident and that it had not been reported to the police. The mother denied following the father out of the house and shouting at him. She thought the argument was two-sided. The suggestion that the van was kicked by her, she says, was totally fabricated. </p>

She had gone to speak to the paternal grandmother and the only contact she made with her was to kiss her on the cheek. When asked by the police what sorts of issues the mother was experiencing in her relationship with the father she said: &#8220;The only issue in our relationship is his mum.&#8221;</p>

I have referred to her apparent intelligence. She knew that realistically the father would not be able to move to [her native country]. His ability to provide for their family and, more than that, to sustain what must have been a better than average standard of living, depended on his ability to continue to work within the successful family business which was firmly based in England.

The idea that coercive and controlling behaviour is an insidious form of abuse is consistent with the evidence in this case that the father did not, at the start, keep corroborating evidence of everything that was going on, but that he started to keep records in diaries, photographs and covert recordings, which he secreted away from the mother, as the abuse worsened. </p>

There is ample evidence in the case that discussion of the paternal grandmother would trigger dysregulated behaviour from the mother, which at times would cause her to react in a way in which there was no thought about the consequences of her behaviour. It is right that he did not take a photograph of his injuries, but I have just dealt with the Court's view that, as one of the earlier incidents, the father may not at this time have started to keep corroborating evidence.

Although the mother accepts breaking a mug on another occasion, I do not accept that that was to stop unwanted sexual advances from the father. I will come to her rape allegation shortly, but in my judgment it is implausible that throwing a mug on the floor would prevent a serious sexual assault.

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">There is a consistency between the evidence that the paternal grandmother gave about the mother mentioning her perfume and the mother's own evidence about the paternal grandmother's perfume. Although there is no independent evidence of the physiotherapy that the paternal grandmother said she had afterwards, and I have struggled to see marks on the paternal grandmother's cheeks in the photographs that have been exhibited, there is clear injury to her lip. I have directed myself about similar fact evidence and note that the slaps alleged by the paternal grandmother bear a striking similarity to the slaps which the mother administered to the father. I therefore find that the mother had a propensity to slap people in the face when she was angry. </p>

After all, someone had walked into her house, her safe place, and physically assaulted her [allegation 1h physical abuse]. In all the circumstances, to have suggested to the police against that backdrop that the mother merely kissed the paternal grandmother on the cheek is downright audacious, lacks remorse, and shows no insight into the effect that her abuse has caused. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">Allegation 2a [anger and verbal abuse] is to a great extent proved based on the findings that I have already made. There is evidence of the mother calling the father a &#8220;mummy's boy,&#8221; as I have already said, and I accept that the mother told the father and paternal grandmother that they were enmeshed as a form of abuse, given the evidence which I have rehearsed. Those were not innocuous comments, but designed to demean the father. The events of 5 May 2020 are ones which the mother says are made up. However, given the way in which the paternal grandmother presented when giving her evidence generally, on balance I considered her to be a credible witness, and indeed one unlikely to have fabricated something so odd. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">As for Allegation 2b [22 June 2021 anger], I am bound to say that the mother's evidence that she bought the locks for her protection, intending to keep the purchase under the radar, but using the father's Amazon account and having them delivered to the father's work address by accident, was bordering on the ridiculous. The father's account that he bought them is consistent with the way in which they were purchased and with his other evidence, namely that the mother became so angry when trying to get into his room on 22 June 2021 that she damaged the door with her wedding ring when she was banging on it. The fact that there may have been pleasant texts earlier in the day is nothing to the point. I accept the father's evidence that the mother's temper could go from zero to 100 in very little time at all. </p>

I accept that the mother has presented as dysregulated and irrational at family functions, has made the paternal aunt feel that she has done the wrong thing when she had not, that she punished the father for giving her unwanted ticket to the racing to the paternal aunt, just taking a few of the examples that I have gone through. I have already dealt with the fact that the mother told V that the paternal grandmother is a narcissist and that she destroyed photos of sentimental value to the father. I accept too the father's evidence that the mother tried to airbrush the paternal grandfather's name from V's name, and the mother's evidence about the deed poll changed during the course of her giving it. In reality the problem was the mother herself and her behaviour, which was far from normal. If she herself felt excluded or isolated, in my judgment, she only had herself to blame. </p>

I do not accept, as she told the Court, that the mother&#8217;s concerns about the bike rides with V were at all times Covid-19 restriction related. The restrictions had been relaxed on a number of the occasions referred to, as I have already said. Far more likely was what she said in July 2021, which was that she did not trust the father and she demanded therefore that he use Strava. The disagreement on 25 April 2020 was about the fact that the father was playing with V, to take another example. I therefore find Allegation 3b [controlling the time that father spent with the children] proved. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">When I come to Allegation 3c [false allegations of rape], the starting point is that the mother first reported the rape in September 2021, almost a year and a half after it was alleged to have occurred. There would by then have been no physical evidence save that, as I understand the allegation made by her, the mother of course says that W was the result of it. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">I have directed myself already in relation to late reporting of sexual abuse. When I consider that in this case, in my judgment, I simply do not believe the mother when she seeks to persuade the Court that she did not know until the police told her in September 2021 that rape could take place in the context of a marriage. There are multiple reasons for this. I have referred to her being intelligent and articulate, that she had a formal legal education in [her native country] and had studied crime, and I infer that she would likely have learnt about sexual offences during her studies. Her evidence is internally inconsistent with the idea that she threw a mug to prevent the father engaging in non-consensual sex with her. It is also inconsistent with the evidence that she reported the sexual assault to the police online before they had spoken to her about that same report. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">When I consider the mechanics by which she alleges that she was raped, that involves on her account a move from the kitchen to the lounge, during the course of which she put up no resistance, save that she says she told the father in the kitchen that she did not consent. Her account is short of any real detail, but assuming for a moment that she did not consent, why did she then end up in the living room, instead of maintaining her position that the father's advances were unwanted? That would be inconsistent with almost every other finding I have made so far in terms of the mother being the more controlling party of the two, in terms of her willingness to speak her mind, and in terms of her anger when she does not get what she wants. On balance, that the father never had sexual intercourse with the mother that was non-consensual, is, in my judgment, more likely. That then brings me to the timing of her report to the police. </p>

If she had not reported it to the police at the time, she could have done so when she reported the father to the police on 10 August 2021 for coercive and controlling behaviour, or within her Children Act application a couple of days later. As it was, the report was made almost immediately after the police determined that they would take no further action against the father on the mother's allegations of coercive and controlling behaviour. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">In my judgment, the truth of the matter was that the report was made, as the mother confirmed herself on 14 June 2022, in retaliation for the father having reported the mother to the police for the assault of the paternal grandmother. While she apologised on 18 June 2022, it is instructive that the mother maintained her lies throughout this hearing and told the Court that she wanted the police to know that it was she who was the victim. She was not the victim though, and she knew it.</p>

It could have potentially deprived him of his liberty and indeed his family. It is difficult to conceive of anything which she could have alleged in order to punish him more. That she is then still willing to allow the parties&#8217; children to learn that W was conceived as a result of rape demonstrates, in my judgment, that the mother remains vindictive and has zero insight into the psychological harm caused to the father already and into the potential for harm to the children in the future. </p>

Had it not been for the fact that she accepted that the allegation that she made was not true, my finding would have been that, aside from the fact that there is no evidence in the recording made of any pressure put on her by the father not to go to the gym, or of the physical assault which she then alleged to the police, her whole allegation was completely inconsistent with the idea that the father wanted her to leave the house so that he could leave with the children. That is before one even considers why she would have left the children in the care of someone who had just assaulted her. I would have determined on balance therefore that the assault did not take place as she alleged, as she now admits that it did not. </p>
