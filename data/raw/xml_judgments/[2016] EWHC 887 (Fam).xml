I am satisfied that he has twice been served with notification of these proceedings but he has not taken any steps to become involved or be represented.  In consequence, it has been impossible to undertake DNA tests to prove his paternity, although there was some suggestion that DNA testing was done in Spain.  He clearly believes he is EB&#8217;s father.  He certainly appears to have been living with the Mother at the time she became pregnant.  I am satisfied he made complaint to the Spanish Police when she disappeared with EB in September 2015.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that he is EB&#8217;s father.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.88in">The Mother is very nearly twenty years of age.  She is of Roma Gypsy background.  It is clear that her mother abandoned her when she was approximately eight months old.  Her mother moved to Spain.  The Mother was therefore brought up by her maternal grandmother and had no contact to her mother form the age of eight months until she was aged six.  She had no contact to her father until she was approximately fourteen years old.  I accept that all of this must have had a profound effect upon her. There were undoubtedly difficulties, including an apparent attempt to traffic her to Germany by an adult she met when she was aged about thirteen.  She says she was threatened with a gun before being rescued by the Police.  I make it quite clear that none of this was her fault in any way.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.88in">At the age of fourteen to fifteen, she moved to live in Spain with her mother but this was clearly not a success.  I have been told that she does not now speak to her mother.  The one mystery is that I have also been told that the maternal grandmother is now a doctor.  I do not know if that is true but her irresponsibility in relation to her own family does not sit easily with her responsibilities as a doctor.  In 2012, when the Mother was approximately sixteen, she commenced a relationship with a Mr N, who was also of Romanian origin.  He was then around twenty four.  She moved in with him within a week of meeting him.  The move involved a seven hour car journey from Salamanca to Valencia, undertaken without her mother&#8217;s knowledge.  The Mother says that there were two incidents in which he was violent to her.  She also accuses him of taking illegal recreational drugs, including cocaine, cannabis and &#8220;meth&#8221;.  The Mother became pregnant by Mr N but the relationship then broke down.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.88in">She then moved in with a Mr A, who was some 17 years older than her.  She met him at the bar he owned.  She says she commenced a relationship with him approximately two weeks after meeting him.  After she moved in with him, she became aware of his criminal lifestyle.  She alleges that he was living off immoral earnings and that he got the Mother to collect the money from the homes of the prostitutes who were working for him.  She told Mr Travis Whittaker, the Local Authority social worker, that she progressed into &#8220;entertaining and escorting clients&#8221;. Initially, she said no but was intimidated into complying with his wishes.  In her oral evidence, she denied engaging in prostitution.  Although a serious matter, I see no need to make findings as to this.  Again, she says that Mr A was involved in taking cocaine, cannabis/marijuana and crystal meth.  </p>

The Mother says that, towards the end of 2014, M went into foster care for between one and two months.  She told me this was as a result of threats made to her by Mr A on the breakdown of their relationship but later indicated that it was only whilst she was living with her next partner, Mr V.</p>

He also abused drugs including speed, marijuana and cocaine.  He has a criminal record.

It is suggested that he was also a former partner of the Mother and that he was enticed by her to a flat where attempts were made to extort &#8364;30,000 from him by a number of men.  The Local Authority says the Spanish Police have said that the Mother has been found guilty in her absence and sentenced to a year in prison.  The Mother denies this but has indicated an intention to enter a guilty plea.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.88in">As already indicated, the Mother gave birth to EB on 2nd September 2015.  On 17th September 2015, she flew to this country and met up, for the first time, with the Second Respondent and Ms M.  She stayed with them at the home they then had in Cardiff for six days before the Mother returned to Spain on 23rd September 2015, leaving EB in their care.  She says she went back to sort out M, with the intention of bringing her to Wales as well but, according to her evidence to me, she did not see M whilst she was in Spain.  It is her case that she intended to return to Wales on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015 to find work/care for EB.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.88in">The Second Respondent and Ms M did not, of course, have parental responsibility for EB.  On 6th October 2015, the Second Respondent travelled to Spain to register himself falsely as EB&#8217;s father.  It is alleged that the Mother had told both Mr I and EB&#8217;s actual Father that EB had died in the United Kingdom following an operation here.  It appears that the Father made a complaint to the Spanish Police, who asked the Mother if it was true.  She denied it and got the Police to telephone the Second Respondent and Ms M.  The Police heard EB crying in the background.  The Mother said that the only way to extricate herself from the mess was for the Second Respondent to pretend to be the father, although it appears that this was always the intention as he had already booked a flight.  </p>

He was placed in foster care.  The following day, 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015, the Mother arrived in Bristol, having been summoned by the Second Respondent and Ms M.  The Second Respondent and Ms M were both arrested on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October on suspicion of EB&#8217;s kidnapping.  The Mother was arrested the following day.  Regrettably, all three lied to the Police.  They all said that the Second Respondent was EB&#8217;s father.  It was said that the Second Respondent had travelled to Spain in January 2015 as part of a stag party and that EB was conceived as a result of a &#8220;one-night stand&#8221; between the Second Respondent and the Mother.  This was all completely untrue.   </p>

The Cafcass Officer has grave concerns about the Mother returning to Spain with EB, not just because of the possibility of a 12 months&#8217; custodial sentence but also because of the Mother&#8217;s inability to work in an open and honest way with professionals.

A child&#8217;s circumstances may &#8220;require&#8221; statutory intervention, perhaps may even &#8220;require&#8221; the indefinite or long-term removal of a child from the family and his or her placement with strangers but that is not to say that the same circumstances will necessarily &#8220;require&#8221; that a child be adopted.  They may or they may not. The question, at the end of the day, is whether what is &#8220;required&#8221; is adoption.&#8221;</span></p>

It is what is demanded rather than what is merely optional or reasonable or desirable.  It is a stringent and demanding test.  The court should begin with a preference for the less interventionist rather than the more interventionist approach.  This should be considered to be in the better interests of a child unless there are cogent reasons to the contrary (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re O (Care or Supervision Order)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 2 FLR 755" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 2 FLR 755</ref> at 760.</p>

He said it was time to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">call a halt</span>&#8221;.  The evidence placed before the court must address all the options which are realistically possible and must contain an analysis of the arguments for and against each option and, in particular, the nature and extent of the risk of harm involved in each of the options (Paragraph [34]).  The need for analysis of the pros and cons and a full reasoned recommendation was essential if the exacting test set out in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> and the requirements of Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention are to be met (Paragraph [36]).  There must be adequately reasoned judgments (Paragraph [43]).  The court rejected a linear approach whereby each option other than the most draconian is considered and rejected in isolation.  Instead, a balancing exercise is required in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives.  Each option should then be compared, side by side, against the competing option or options (Paragraphs [49] &#8211; [50]).  </p>

He pointed out, however, that M has had virtually no relationship with EB to date.  He said that he had referred to the loss of a relationship with the birth family when considering the placement application, although acknowledged the importance of the Article 8 right to family life.  Finally, he said that he understood that the Mother intended to plead guilty to the charges against her in Spain relating to Mr V.

I have reminded myself that he originally lied about his paternity of EB but he was the first to give the court the truth. He was extremely polite and gave the clear impression that he was doing his best to tell me the truth in his oral evidence.  However, I find that he was wary of criticising the Mother.  It may be that he remains concerned about possible criminal prosecution in Spain.  There is no doubt that he gave contradictory evidence about what was intended as to the long term care of EB.  He told Ms Withers for the Local Authority that he and Ms M were going to look after the baby in the long term as &#8220;legal guardians.&#8221;  The Mother was going to bring M over as well and live here with M but she would be able to see EB whenever she wanted but she was not going to live with EB.  He gave contradictory evidence when cross-examined by Mr Weston for the Mother.  He told me then that he and Ms M were going to help her look after the baby whilst the Mother was looking for a job and a house but that they did not speak in detail about the arrangements thereafter.  I reject this second account as I will explain later when I turn to my findings.  I simply do not accept that they did not talk about what would happen thereafter.  I equally accept that neither he nor Ms M would have gone to all this trouble if they were only going to be glorified babysitters in the long term.  </p>

I find that this was not because he did not have evidence to give but rather that he did not wish to give it.  For example, he eventually accepted that he was concerned as to the Mother&#8217;s commitment to EB but he only gave one example, namely that she once went out the night before a contact visit so that she did not have any money to go and see EB the next day.  He said she asked if he could take her in his car but he could not as he had to go to work.  His friend could not take her either and she was annoyed.  I do not consider, however, that I was being given the complete picture.  I do, though, accept his denials that he paid the Mother for EB.  I accept his evidence that all they did was pay for the flight to bring the Mother here; bought some items such as a cot and a pushchair for EB and loaned the Mother &#163;100 for an Ipad to be given as a present to Mr I.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.88in">Ms M was a very complex witness.  Again, I remind myself of her initial lies about paternity.  In the early part of her oral evidence, she came over as terrified of the court process and, it soon emerged, of the Mother.  When cross-examined by Ms Withers, she was quiet, nervous and reluctant to say very much, although even then she was far more critical of the Mother than the Second Respondent. When Ms Withers finished, I allowed a short adjournment.  As there was only one competent interpreter in court, I had to ask the Mother&#8217;s interpreter to act as interpreter for all witnesses.  Mr Weston wished to take instructions from his client in Spanish so I rose for a short period to enable him to do so. Immediately that I left court, Ms M broke down and displayed great emotion.  She said she was distressed by the presence of the Mother in court, although I make it absolutely clear that I make no findings at all that the Mother did anything improper.  I therefore arranged for a screen to be installed but it became clear that Ms M did not want the screen so it was removed.  Thereafter, she became very considerably emboldened.  In essence, she went onto the attack as to her view of the Mother&#8217;s failings.  I consider her subsequent evidence to far better reflect her true feelings as to the Mother.</p>

He would live with them.  The Mother would not do so.  She was going to go back to work but could see EB when she wished.  I find that this was exactly what was agreed.   Later, she told me that she found the Mother intimidating and that she was scared to say anything the Mother did not like or thought should not be said.  She told me she did not approve of the Mother&#8217;s lifestyle when in her house.   She did not share the Mother&#8217;s approach.   I accept Ms M&#8217;s evidence in that regard.  She is a very different personality to the Mother.  She is homely and not a party person.  The Mother is outgoing and brash.  Ms M was shocked by what she discovered about the Mother&#8217;s lifestyle and wanted nothing to do with it.  It was inevitable that they would fall out badly and that is what happened.  She has an unblemished past but considers the Mother had dragged her into disreputable conduct, including lying to the authorities.  I find that she bitterly regretted doing so and deeply resented the Mother for, in her eyes, making her do so.  I am sure that she has been extremely distressed by the whole affair.  She is clearly desperate for a child, having suffered multiple miscarriages.  She thought she had found a baby to look after but had it taken away from her in what must have seemed to her to be extremely cruel circumstances.  I do not in any way underestimate the effect on the Mother of having EB taken into care but I consider the effect on Ms M to have been profound as well. </p>

First, in relation to her alleged relationship with Mr C, she says that he is just a close friend of hers.  She says that Mr C split up from his girlfriend and was distressed to see pictures of the girlfriend with another man on her Facebook page.  The Mother therefore agreed to post pictures of her and Mr C &#8220;in a relationship&#8221; to make Mr C&#8217;s girlfriend jealous.  If true, it was immature and stupid.  But it is clearly not true.  I reject this explanation.  It is absurd.  Both their Facebook pages said they have been in a relationship since January 2016.  There were intimate pictures of them kissing, including one in which they appear to be in bed, albeit clothed.  Mr C came over to see the Mother in Wales during February.  During that period, the Mother did not have contact to EB.  I find that she put her new relationship with Mr C ahead of EB.  When confronted by this by the Local Authority, she did not admit the position.  She deleted the entries and got Mr C to do so as well.  I reject her account that this was just coincidence and she removed the entries before seeing Mr Whittaker&#8217;s statement because Mr C was back with his old girlfriend.</p>

I simply do not understand why she did not see her in September/October 2015 when she returned to Spain, ostensibly to secure M&#8217;s move to Wales.  If she was not seeing M then, what was she doing in Spain?  I accept that she placed M in voluntary care when she commenced her relationship with Mr V.  At the time, M was only aged eight months.  This is an odd thing to do unless there is very good reason.  One possibility may be that she recognised that the relationship with Mr V might well be abusive and not conducive to M&#8217;s needs.   It might be said that this shows insight but it equally shows an inability to put M first.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.88in">The Local Authority postulates that M remained in care throughout 2015 until she moved to live with Mr N.  Reliance is placed on Mr I saying that he had a limited relationship with M but assisted the Mother &#8220;in travelling to meet her&#8221;.  I am unable to make a finding as to this as the ground work was not properly undertaken by the Local Authority in sufficient time.  I am, however, entitled to question why it is that M has ended up being cared for by a man who was violent to the Mother and, according to her, was a habitual user of hard drugs.   Moreover, if I accept her case, he had no contact to M until July 2015 but she then allowed him to be placed in his full-time care the following month.  She has not seen M since.  I recognise entirely the difficulties for the Mother of being in Wales with very limited resources and without travel documentation but she is responsible for the actions she has taken.  It cannot be said that she has put M first.</p>

I have no doubt that she is not telling me the truth when she says she did not tell either Mr V or Mr I that EB had died in an operation in the United Kingdom.  I am satisfied she did do so.  Although I have not heard from either gentleman, both say she did and I cannot see that they would both make this up independently if it was not true.  Whatever Mr V&#8217;s faults, it was very wrong to say that to him about his son.  I am equally satisfied she initially told a woman police officer that he had died.  Later, she was constrained to admit he was alive and well in Cardiff but then came up with the idea that she would say that the Second Respondent was the father.  It was equally wrong to involve the Second respondent in lies.  A criminal offence was committed in Spain when he falsely registered himself as the father.  I am clear that this was the Mother&#8217;s idea, albeit that the plot was hatched before the Police got involved.  </p>

I find that she seriously considered allowing EB to be adopted whilst she was pregnant with him.  She went onto the Saludisima website and found a &#8220;surrogacy&#8221; type forum.  She made contact with a woman called D and it seems clear she promised D that she could have EB, possibly by way of adoption.  D then commenced fertility treatment and so put the Mother in touch with Ms M.  I find that it is quite inconceivable that the second Respondent and Ms M agreed on a mere babysitting arrangement.  The agreement was that they would care for EB permanently. They would bring him up and educate him but it would not be adoption and the Mother could retain contact with him.  If they were experts on English and Welsh law, they would have been asking for a Special Guardianship order.  </p>

On the one hand, I recognise the Mother&#8217;s lack of money but I consider her contact record does not show her putting EB first.  She had no contact with EB from September 2015 until 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015.  She managed to attend on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November but then missed the next two contacts.  I find this staggering.  Even accepting her financial and language difficulties, I find it amazing she did not find a way to get there.  She then visited on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November before missing the next two visits.  Thus began a disturbing pattern.  Of the first 44 visits, she missed 16 which is over one-third.  She has since missed a further ten.  I accept she was ill at times but she has not regularly telephoned to say she is not going.  In February 2016, she missed two whole weeks of contact.  Since 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016, she has failed to ring in on nine occasions.  She has cancelled once when she had an appointment with the Police and I accept she could not attend on the day of the IRH although many parents ask for the time to be moved to accommodate such hearings.  Once, contact was cancelled by the foster mother.  A young baby requires consistency. This history does not show consistency.  Three times per week for an hour is not a huge commitment.  It has worried me considerably that she has not been able to maintain even that level of contact. Mr Evans described it as the acid-test.  I accept that submission.</p>

I am quite satisfied that she has given this case anxious consideration.  Indeed, she has identified a number of significant gaps in the Local Authority case, particularly in relation to the failure to establish paternity; to contact the paternal family; to contact the maternal grandmother until very late in the day; and to speak to Mr N.  All of these are genuine causes for complaint but I am satisfied that it would not be proportionate or in EB&#8217;s interests to require further investigations now.  That was the Guardian&#8217;s position.  She told me that, if she felt there was any other person who was a possible option, she would be asking me to adjourn to explore that.

The Mother did not put Mr N forward for assessment.  Given that he is not EB&#8217;s father and the evidence I have about him does him no credit, other than his recent care for M, I cannot see any significant advantage in adjourning to contact him.

She acknowledged that the extremely difficult experiences the Mother has had are partly cultural and that she self-reported many of the matters that have highlighted risk. She told me it is not just the Mother&#8217;s nomadic lifestyle that is relevant to her ability to protect EB but the very nature of the way EB came to Wales is a huge cause for concern.

I accept that criticism but I will apply the correct checklist in coming to my decision.  Mr Weston asked her in particular about the loss of a relationship between EB and M if I make a placement order. She accepted that sibling relationships are important and such attachments are one of the most enduring but she reminded me that they do not know each other and, it appears, have not even met each other.  There is therefore no attachment at present.   </p>

It was not a surrogacy arrangement in the sense that this is known to English and Welsh law.  It was not an illegal adoption but it was a plan that placed EB at risk of very significant harm.  The Mother has chosen disastrously with nearly all her relationships.  She was, in fact, lucky that the Second Respondent was not cut from the same cloth as Mr N, Mr A and Mr V.

I have already found that he cannot be brought up by his Mother.  I have to consider his welfare throughout his life.  He is entitled to security, stability and permanence.  He should not languish in the care system for all eighteen years of his minority, with the uncertainty and difficulties that this would inevitably bring.  I have come to the clear conclusion that he is entitled to better than that. I find that his Mother would recognise that if she was able to consider this objectively.  I further find that his half-sister would do so as well.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.88in"> I therefore accept the analysis of both the Local Authority and the Guardian.  EB needs permanency for the rest of his life.  Nothing else will do, notwithstanding the loss of the chance of any relationship with his Mother and his half-sister.  It follows that I dispense with parental consent as that is what his welfare requires.  I accept the proposals in relation to the Mother&#8217;s future contact.  I approve the care plan, although I accept Mr Weston&#8217;s submission that it should be amended to correct what I accept was an error as to developmental delay.  EB does not show any developmental delay whatsoever.  </p>
