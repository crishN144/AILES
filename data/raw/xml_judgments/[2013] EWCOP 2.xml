Mrs Church asked me to do some work for her whilst I was there (viz. prepare an inventory of items in their flat and take photographs of the rooms). This I did (and more), and as a result I incurred expenses on their behalf (namely the purchase of a disposable camera and photo development charges). On July 7th I submitted a letter to Mrs Church, including a note of my expenses.</p>

On 4th August I telephoned her secretary who said she would get Mrs Church to call me back as soon as she came in. However, Mrs Church did not call me, neither did she heed my letter. I faxed a second letter to her on 4th August, stressing how urgently I needed the funds, but again Mrs Church ignored this letter. I subsequently faxed three separate letters to Mr Sparrow, senior partner, advising that I was incurring bank charges as a result of Mrs Church&#8217;s refusal to pay me, but again these were ignored. Eventually, I had to approach the PGO, who put pressure on Mrs Church to pay me, and it was only after their intervention that Mrs Church finally reimbursed my expenses &#8211; by which time we had incurred some &#163;561 worth of charges from our banks. I persuaded my bank to let me off the first set of charges (&#163;70), but in the end my husband and I were left with charges totalling &#163;491, plus interest on these.&#8221;</p>

Had the PGO carried out an unbiased investigation into my complaint/claim in 2005 and had they ensured DC&#8217;s compliance with panel receiver rules, this would not have become a contentious matter. The reason that it has escalated to this level is because all concerned within the system, have &#8216;protected the deputy&#8217; and catered for her best interests, rather than those of her vulnerable clients.</p>

This is clearly unjust, unfair and unreasonable. The present position for the clients in this case is that to date, they have been forced to pay in the region of &#163;40,000 for an ineffective and abusive receivership service, for which the only real; financial outcome was the payment of 13 bills.</p>

They have also incurred losses estimated at around &#163;12,000 for bringing court actions which should not have been necessary, and been asked to pay MH/DC&#8217;s costs of around &#163;11,000, when MH/DC fought to stop the estate claiming on security bonds, which the clients had paid for.</p>

The manner in which she has raised, pursued and contested these proceedings has been disproportionate and her assertions regarding &#8220;fraud&#8221;, &#8220;bias&#8221;, &#8220;cover up&#8221; and &#8220;vulnerable clients&#8221; have been overstated. There was no fraud on Mrs Church&#8217;s part and the charges of bias and cover-up that Mrs Tricker levelled against both the Office of the Public Guardian and Solicitors for the Elderly are without foundation. </p>

Its decision not to call in the bonds in Mrs Church&#8217;s case was a reasonable exercise of its discretion.</p>

Mrs Tricker seems to be determined to wreck Mrs Church&#8217;s reputation and career: otherwise, her complaints to the professional and regulatory bodies referred to in paragraph 21 above would make no sense. To some extent she has succeeded. In his witness statement dated 30 November 2012, Nicholas Marshall commented:</p>

She is held in high esteem by professional colleagues in the Suffolk/North Essex area where she practised for over 30 years and was chair of the Suffolk and North Essex branch of the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners for several years up to 2006 as well as a panel receiver to the Court of Protection.</p>

Accordingly, I order that Marshall Hatchick&#8217;s costs be assessed on the standard basis and paid by Mrs Tricker personally.</p>
