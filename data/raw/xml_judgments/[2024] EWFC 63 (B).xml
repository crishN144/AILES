[child C] is an anxious child currently settled in school. His relationship with his father has been tenuous since the separation. There is only a recent history of more settled contact arrangements. A move to [city X] could have long term consequences, in particular increased distance between [child C] and his father and perhaps future anger and resentment from [child C] towards his mother if the move is unsuccessful.  Their lack of support network would mean that [child C] and his mother are very reliant on each other, possibly developing an increasingly intense and dependent relationship. I feel [child C] needs increased external relationships, particularly with positive male role models. If [child C] and [the mother&#8217;s] relationship becomes strained in adolescence it will be valuable to have [the father] and their network close by; currently [the mother] describes having a very active and supportive network of friends who helped her following separation from [the father] and during her move to [area of London A].&#8217;</span></p>

She needs around &#163;450,000 to &#163;500,000 to purchase a new property. The sum of &#163;150,000 gives a cushion to cover stamp duty, immediate alterations and repairs, and moving costs.  She would then be mortgage free and on an eventual salary of around &#163;16,000 to &#163;18,000, supplemented by child maintenance (&#163;6,500) and child benefit (&#163;1,000). She has put her current outgoings at &#163;43,000, but that includes &#163;24,000 a year in rent.

Thereafter it is difficult to predict now whether [child C] will go to university, have a gap year or not.  The danger of pegging reversion of funds to what is happening to [child C] is that he may feel a sense of responsibility to make decisions that favour one parent or the other, rather than pursuing his own agenda.  For example he may feel obliged to take a gap year if this means delaying sale of the home in which he and his mother are living.  Other than taking judicial notice of the fact that school and university leavers are likely to depend upon their parents for housing longer than was once seen as usual, there is nothing about [child C]&#8217;s particular circumstances to tell me that there should be a delay in the return of the &#163;150,000 to his father.  </p>

Some of these are quite big-ticket items that may come as a birthday or Christmas present with contributions from other members of the family.  I do not consider it appropriate to direct that the father should have to pay for these items.  However, as with the school fees, the order may record that the father will pay two-thirds of the costs of school uniform as he proposes, and fifty percent of sports equipment.</p>

There may be capital gains tax if she sells the <span style="font-style:italic">[City X]</span> house.  Her position has been to look to the father to cover what she needs.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I have determined that nevertheless this is an order that I should direct the father to make.  Doing the best I can on the evidence before me, I find that a contribution of &#163;150,000 would meet [child C]&#8217;s housing need, and on my assessment of the mother&#8217;s resources, she would be able to sustain it.  On balance it would be better for her to have the equity from <span style="font-style:italic">[City X]</span> retained in property so that she can use it for housing when [child C] is an adult.  If she were to continue renting she is likely to have to dip into funds from the <span style="font-style:italic">[City X]</span> property which would then be depleted over time.</p>
