	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Justices were concerned with a little girl, A, who was born in October 2007. A fortnight after her birth she was accommodated by the local authority under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> and placed with foster carers. The local authority commenced care proceedings on 23 January 2008. An interim care order was made on 30 January 2008 and was renewed throughout the period with which I am concerned. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It became apparent that neither the First Respondent nor the Second Respondent, her mother and father, were going to be able to give A adequate care (in due course threshold was agreed on 17 November 2008). On 18 September 2008 the Third Respondent, C, who is A&#8217;s paternal great-grandmother, applied for leave to apply for a residence order. On 6 October 2008, she and the Fourth Respondent, S, A&#8217;s paternal aunt, were joined as parties. On 17 October 2008 there was a positive viability assessment of them. On 5 November 2008 they were granted leave to apply for special guardianship orders. On 6 November 2008 the local authority filed a care plan (updated on 5 December 2008) which contemplated a plan for special guardianship to them with a contingency plan for adoption. On 8 December 2008 a special guardianship report supported them as special guardians for A.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus the state of affairs when the Justices sat on 16 December 2008. The mother and the father had effectively been ruled out as carers for A. And the guardian was firmly of the view that the local authority&#8217;s plan for special guardianship was appropriate. The paternal great-grandmother and aunt had been having contact with A for four hours a week. By 16 December 2008 it was common ground between the local authority and the guardian that A should be placed with them. And, as Mr Jonathan-Jones put it, the family wanted A moved to a family placement &#8211; to the paternal great-grandmother and aunt &#8211; as soon as humanly possible and before Christmas if at all possible. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Against this background there was, nonetheless, a difference of view before the Justices as to how this placement should be structured in the interim before a final order could be made. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The paternal great-grandmother and aunt had canvassed with the local authority the possibility of a placement with them in accordance with regulation 38(2) of the Fostering Services (Wales) Regulations 2003, that is, a family placement. But the local authority would not agree, seeking an interim residence order, coupled with an interim supervision order. Apparently the aunt has a conviction which the local authority felt would probably disqualify her under the Regulations though <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> in its view otherwise being relevant to her capacity to care for A. The guardian was concerned that the volatile nature of the parents necessitated that some form of protective measures remain in place whilst the suitability of special guardianship was investigated, and therefore argued that the local authority should retain parental responsibility so as to be able to step in urgently if the need should arise. There were particular concerns about the reaction of the parents during contact and as to how the paternal great-grandmother and aunt would handle that.</p>

	    <num>10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once the local authority had rejected the idea of a regulation 38(2) placement, the paternal great-grandmother and aunt aligned themselves with the guardian. They wanted A to be placed with them as soon as possible but could also see the importance of the local authority continuing to share parental responsibility pending the making of a final order. They were also concerned that if A was moved to them under the aegis of a residence order they might be left without the support they felt they needed, particularly in the early days of the placement. The mother also aligned herself with the guardian, agreeing with the guardian&#8217;s view that the placement needed a testing period before a final order was made and seeking the local authority&#8217;s continuing involvement, not least to provide assistance to the parties with the issue of contact. The local authority, although agreeing, as Ms Henke puts it, that the social worker should assess the placement prior to the final hearing, differed from the guardian as to the propriety of the order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> which the guardian was seeking.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The dispute between the local authority and the guardian (supported broadly by the other parties) was aired before the Justices. The guardian submitted that the Justices should continue the interim care order and exercise their powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> and direct the local authority to place A with the paternal great-grandmother and aunt for the purpose of the local authority carrying out an assessment, both as to how they (the paternal great-grandmother and aunt) and A would cope with A living with them and, in particular, as to their ability to cope with and supervise A&#8217;s contact with her mother and father (see on the latter point paragraph 2 of the order made by the Justices as set out in paragraph [14] below). As Mr Powell put it to me, both the local authority and the guardian needed the kind of re-assurance as to the ability of the paternal great-grandmother and aunt to cope which could only be obtained if A was placed with them and assessed, as it were, <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span>.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority sought an adjournment as it had had no prior notice of this application and its representative was without instructions and wished to have an opportunity to consider the relevant authorities. Some time was spent trying to find out whether the parties could reassemble before Christmas, so as to give the local authority time to consider its position, but that proved not to be possible. The Justices agreed that time was of the essence for A, particularly given the forthcoming Christmas holiday, and took the view that a decision had to be made that day. No-one required any evidence to be called. The matter was dealt with on submissions, though apparently no authorities were referred to. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the face, as Mr Powell puts it, of unity between the parties (with the exception of the local authority), the Justices made the orders sought by the guardian. They accepted the guardian&#8217;s view that the court, before making a final order, would require evidence of how A had settled in with the paternal great-grandmother and aunt, and that in the meantime the local authority should retain parental responsibility &#8211; something that could be achieved only by making a further interim care order. </p>

The child is in the care of the local authority under an interim care order pending the decision by the court whether or not to make a final care order. Under the interim care order the decision-making power as to the care, residence and general welfare of the child is vested in the local authority, not in the court. However, for the purpose of making its ultimate decision whether to grant a full care order, the court will need the help of social workers, doctors and others as to the child and his circumstances &#8230; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 38(6)</ref> deals with the interaction between the powers of the local authority entitled to make decisions as to the child&#8217;s welfare in the interim and the needs of the court to have access to the relevant information and assessments so as to be able to make the ultimate decision. </p>

		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; the dividing-line between the functions of the court on the one hand and the local authority on the other is that a child in interim care is subject to control of the local authority, the court having no power to interfere with the local authority&#8217;s decisions save in specified cases. The cases where, despite that overall control, the court is to have power to intervene are set out, inter alia, in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 38(6)</ref> and (7). The purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 38(6)</ref> is to enable the court to obtain the information necessary for its own decision, notwithstanding the control over the child which in all other respects rests with the local authority. I therefore approach the subsection on the basis that the court is to have such powers to override the views of the local authority as are necessary to enable the court to discharge properly its function of deciding whether or not to accede to the local authority&#8217;s application to take the child away from its parents by obtaining a care order. To allow the local authority to decide what evidence is to go before the court at the final hearing would be in many cases, including the present, to allow the local authority by administrative decision to pre-empt the court&#8217;s judicial decision.&#8221;</p>

The conditions under which such placement can be made are further regulated by regulations made by the Secretary of State. I do not accept this submission. Section 23 and the regulations made thereunder are concerned with placements made by local authority with foster-parents and others: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 38</ref> is not dealing with that issue at all.

An order specifying where and with whom that assessment is to take place is not &#8216;a placement&#8217; within s 23 at all.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;a programme for assessment, can encompass within it an element of therapy or treatment.

I recognise, of course, that that principle will not always be easy to apply. The antithesis between assessment on the one hand and therapy and treatment on the other is at best an imperfect one. Essentially, however, as Thorpe LJ has explained, the court will be concerned to determine what is the primary purpose of the programme proposed and whether the element of therapy treatment can properly be regarded as merely ancillary to it.&#8221;</p>

So there were very powerful arguments in favour of pressing on. Nor do I think that any injustice was inflicted on the local authority by the refusal of an adjournment. After all, its main attack is based on the proposition that in making the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> order the Justices erred in law, indeed, acted without jurisdiction.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Henke very helpfully took me through the statutory schemes regulating local authority foster carers (the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, the Fostering Services (Wales) Regulations 2003 and the Placement of Children (Wales) Regulations 2007) and residential family centres (the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" uk:canonical="2000 c. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Standards Act 2000</ref> and the Residential Family Centres (Wales) Regulations 2003). Grateful though I am to her, there is no need for me here to follow her through the exercise. It suffices to record that, as is common ground, A&#8217;s placement with the paternal great-grandmother and aunt pursuant to the order the Justices made on 16 December 2008, was not one recognised or regulated by either of these statutory schemes.</p>

So, she says, their Lordships did not consider, nor were they asked to consider, the power of the court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> to direct a child to reside at an unregulated location in the day to day care of unregulated persons who are themselves the subject of the assessment. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Addressing the first of the two questions she had posed, Ms Henke reiterates that the placement here was not a placement within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> and was thus unregulated, whether under that statutory scheme or, indeed, under any other statutory scheme. Thus, she says, there is no provision to regulate the fitness of the premises, the fitness of the persons providing A&#8217;s day to day care, or the relationship between the local authority and her carers. In short, A and her carers are left in &#8216;no man&#8217;s land&#8217;. That, she submits, cannot have been the legislative intent behind <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref>. Given that the whole purpose of Part IV of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> is to protect children from significant harm, or risk of such harm, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> cannot and should not be construed to permit a direction that a child be placed in an unregulated (and therefore potentially unsafe) location pending assessment. Such a construction would be so wide, she submits, as to go beyond the court&#8217;s powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> to override the views of the local authority. For the effect of such a direction would, in reality, be to remove from the local authority, or any other statutory body, the duty to assess and regulate the premises where children in care are placed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the second question she had posed, Ms Henke made two further submissions. First, she said that the reality of the case was that everyone agreed A should live with the paternal great-grandmother and aunt whilst the guardian assessed their application for a special guardianship order and the social worker monitored her in their care and used that information to inform her continuing assessment of the paternal great-grandmother and aunt. There was therefore, she says, no need &#8211; to use Lord Browne-Wilkinson&#8217;s word in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>, no necessity &#8211; to make a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> order at all. Second, and in any event, there was no need to make an interim care order; the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> order could have been linked with an interim supervision order and an interim residence order. An interim care order was inappropriate, she says, because it would bring into play the statutory regime under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23</ref>, and unnecessary, because an interim supervision order was sufficient to secure A&#8217;s welfare. A&#8217;s contact with her parents could be regulated by a section 8 order and if her removal from the paternal great-grandmother and aunt turned out to be necessary it could be achieved, assuming the statutory tests to be satisfied, by an application either for an emergency protection order or an interim care order. </p>

Far from the placement here being merely ancillary to the assessment, the reality, she says, is that the assessment was ancillary to the placement. A was not being placed with the paternal great-grandmother and aunt so that she could be assessed; she was being placed with them because that is what everyone, including the Justices, agreed was appropriate.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Powell&#8217;s response to all this is brisk and to the point. He says that the local authority has misunderstood the nature of the court&#8217;s powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> as explained by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>, whose analysis in the passage I have already set out clearly demonstrates, he submits, the complete propriety of the order made the Justices. He accepts, of course, that, generally speaking, the court is not entitled to dictate to a local authority where it is to place a child subject to an interim care order; but <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref>, he says, is an exception to that principle. He submits that, for the very reasons explained by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>, any court dealing with the situation which here faced the Justices on 16 December 2008 &#8211; requiring further information as to the suitability of a placement &#8211; is entitled to direct an assessment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> even though it may involve the placement of the child in a placement which would otherwise be illegal by virtue of the Placement of Children (Wales) Regulations 2007. And the plain fact, he says, is that both the guardian and the social worker, albeit for somewhat different purposes, required to be able to assess A, as it were <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span>, before they could make their final recommendations. And an interim supervision order would not have sufficed, because this was, as the Justices properly accepted, a case where, at least for the time being, the local authority needed to share parental responsibility to ensure both that the process was not disrupted by A&#8217;s parents and that A had the benefit of the additional duties attaching to a local authority which has an interim care order as contrasted with an interim supervision order.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Jonathan-Jones associates himself with Mr Powell&#8217;s submissions. He puts the point very shortly and very simply. The position on 16 December 2008 was that further assessment was required, both of A&#8217;s relationship with the paternal great-grandmother and aunt and of their ability, for example, to handle contact between A and her parents. And the best way to assess, in the circumstances, was by the immediate placement of A with the paternal great-grandmother and aunt, for what was required was an assessment of A whilst she was actually living with the paternal great-grandmother and aunt. In common with Mr Powell he says that the necessary assessment could not be undertaken &#8211; or, at the very least, not be so effectively undertaken &#8211; merely by a process of observing the paternal great-grandmother and aunt whilst they were having contact with A. Was that a proper exercise by the Justices of their powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref>? He says it was. True it is, as he accepts, that in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C </span>Lord Browne-Wilkinson was not applying his mind to such a placement, but that does not, he submits, detract from the general import of what he said; and, as he points out, Lord Browne-Wilkinson did not choose to limit what he was saying in any way, let alone in such a way as would give any credence to Ms Henke&#8217;s submissions. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Jonathan-Jones also makes the important point &#8211; which it might be thought draws much of the sting from Ms Henke&#8217;s concerns &#8211; that any court proposing to make a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> order involving a placement in a non-institutional and non-regulated setting will first have assured itself both that a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> assessment is appropriate on the facts of the particular case and, importantly, that the particular assessment envisaged is not merely appropriate but safe. It is for the court, as he says, to judge the qualities of the proposed placement and the risks involved. So, albeit a placement such as that directed here may be unregulated in the statutory sense, it is, in reality, he says, subject to effective and, no doubt, appropriately stringent vetting, regulation and supervision by the court.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before addressing Ms Henke&#8217;s submissions directly, there are two preliminary points about <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> that need to be made. In the first place, although, perhaps because they are the most protracted and expensive and most likely to cut across a local authority&#8217;s planning, and thus most likely to be controversial, we tend to think of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> assessments in terms of residential assessments in the kind of institutional settings of which the Cassell is a well-known example, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> is much wider and more general in its scope. It applies to any &#8220;examination&#8221; (medical or psychiatric) or any &#8220;assessment&#8221;, whether short or long, and in whatever setting. Secondly, subject only to the requirement that the assessment be &#8220;of the child&#8221;, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> is not expressed as imposing any restrictions at all on what can be directed by the court. The court can direct <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>&#8220;assessment of the child.&#8221; The only further restriction is that suggested by Lord Browne-Wilkinson&#8217;s reference in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C </span>to the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> as being &#8220;to enable the court to obtain the information necessary for its own decision &#8230; to enable it to reach a proper decision at the final hearing of the application for a full care order.&#8221; But those words, far from narrowing the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> merely serve, as it seems to me, to bring out and emphasise the potential breadth of its ambit.</p>

The Justices, to repeat, were in my judgment fully justified in concluding that A should be placed with the paternal great-grandmother and aunt but subject to that placement being assessed by the relevant professionals and subject also to the local authority retaining parental responsibility for A for the time being. That was a perfectly rational and sensible decision &#8211; and one, moreover, which accorded with the clearly expressed views of an experienced guardian. So the Justices cannot be criticised for the <span style="font-style:italic">substance </span>of the order they made; it was, in my judgment, plainly appropriate in the circumstances. And if they cannot be criticised for the substance of their order they are equally, in my judgment, not to be criticised for the perfectly proper and appropriate <span style="font-style:italic">form </span>of the order.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My answer is an emphatic No! If a case is otherwise proceeding appropriately in the Family Proceedings Court then there is no warrant for transferring it to the County Court merely because an application is made for an assessment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref>, nor even because the application has unusual features such as were present in this case. A Family Proceedings Court is just as capable as any other court dealing with a care case to decide interlocutory issues such as arise on an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref>. It may be that there are complexities in a particular care case which justify a transfer &#8211; and it may be that those complexities are exemplified in part by disputes in relation to a proposed <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> assessment &#8211; but the justification for the transfer in such a situation is the overall complexity of the case, not the mere fact that there is a disputed application for a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> assessment.</p>

Moreover, since the matter had been argued out before the Justices prior to their giving their reasons, no-one, he says, can have been in any doubt as to the essential basis of their reasoning. He accepts that the Justices might have dealt more fully with their reasoning but submits that their reasons, if brief, suffice for what was, after all, only an interim hearing. Their relative brevity does not, he submits, entitle me to interfere.</p>

At that hearing it was agreed between the local authority, the paternal great-grandmother and aunt and the guardian that there should be an interim residence order in favour of the paternal great-grandmother and aunt together with a supervision order, on the grounds, as set out in the Justices&#8217; written reasons, that, as A had settled well in her new placement and there were no issues arising about the placement, it was no longer necessary for the local authority to share parental responsibility and therefore an interim care order was not necessary. The mother and the father did not attend the hearing but were reported as being neutral (the father) or not objecting to the making of such orders (the mother). In the upshot the Justices made an interim residence order in favour of the paternal great-grandmother and aunt until 2 March 2009 coupled with an interim supervision order until 17 February 2009. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances the appeal had became academic, save as to costs, by the time it came before me on 6 February 2009. The local authority was nonetheless determined to press on with the appeal, albeit that the focus was now on the second ground of appeal, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> point, rather than the others. Ms Henke says that the issues surrounding <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> are important, not simply to this case but to others &#8211; I understand there have been other similar cases in Family Proceedings Courts in the area. That position is supported by Mr Jonathan-Jones, who submits that, although the appeal is now academic, the legal point upon which clarification is sought is important, that it could in future be vital in a case where, as he puts it, the proposed placement is less happy and, in particular, when the answer to the questions posed in the appeal may not be immediately available from an appellate court, and that it is of some practical importance to practitioners in this field to have what he calls clarification of what Lord Browne-Wilkinson was saying in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>.   </p>

But I am persuaded, not least because of what I understand are local concerns about the course taken by the Justices here, that there is advantage in an appellate court spelling out, for the assistance of local authorities and Family Proceedings Courts generally, that there is nothing objectionable in a court doing, in an appropriate case, what the Justices did here. So although the appeal had become academic, I was content to proceed, with the advantage of the vigorous adversarial argument which I was given and for which I am grateful to all concerned. </p>
