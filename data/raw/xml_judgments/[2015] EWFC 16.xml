The applicant, C's mother, seeks an order for her summary return to Mexico.  She says that C came to England for a short visit and that the respondent father has retained her here.  This is challenged by the father, who says that the family had emigrated from Mexico to England as part of an agreed plan.  </span></p>

This was a reconnaissance.  The parents had been discussing the possibility of moving to live in England, and it was an opportunity for the mother to form a view.</span></p>

The prospect of a permanent move was discussed, but she says that she did not respond.  However, the evidence as a whole includes a message from the father to his mother on return to Mexico in which he speaks of them coming to live in England as a matter that had been decided; there are also statements from the father's mother and sister describing conversations with the mother herself about the impending move.  I find that in consequence of the trip in September 2013, the mother and father agreed to move to live in England as soon as their affairs in Mexico could be sorted out.</span></p>

The original plan was that the family would move to England together, but the mother wanted further time.  She also had a planned holiday with friends in the United States.  It was therefore agreed that the father would go on ahead to work on the issues that needed attention.  He had been offered a job by a friend.</span></p>

Both parents agree that it was not intended that the return ticket would be used on 17 April.  The mother says that the date would be changed to coincide with her own return ticket to Mexico once that was bought.  The father says that a return ticket was cheaper and that it was always intended that he would cancel the return leg to reclaim taxes.  In the case of the mother and C, it was also desirable for them to have a return ticket to prevent immigration difficulty on entry to England.  I accept the father's account and find that the existence of return tickets is of no significance in this case.  Indeed, the father did cancel his return ticket on arrival in England.  When he came to buy tickets for the mother and C, he chose a random return date whose only significance was that it was shortly before the expiry of C's passport.</span></p>

There were practical and financial difficulties surrounding the move.  The documentation shows efforts to surrender the tenancy of the apartment and disentangle the family from utilities contracts.  The process of arranging immunisations and travel for the dogs also proved problematic.  Online messages between the parents throughout the early part of 2014 reflect these issues, a common theme being the mother's requests for money which the father said he could not meet in full. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">It is also clear that the mother was ambivalent about the plans that had been made.  Among the documents are a large number of conversations by Facebook, Whatsapp and e-mail between the parents and between the mother and her friends.  These have been pored over during the course of the hearing.  There are some points at which the mother suggests to friends that the move is not a permanent one: e.g. 28 December, when she tells one (only) of a large number of friends that her Facebook posting</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> "#goodbye Mexico #welcome UK"</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> was the equivalent of an April fool joke; 2 January, when she told friends that there were some plans but the family was just going for a limited time; 9 February, when she told a friend that her marriage was in crisis, she felt under pressure and did not want to go to England because she was scared the father might want to divorce, that she might be coming back in August or not going at all, and that moving to England was a horrible idea; 16 April, when she texted friends that she would be back in Mexico on 31 July and was extremely nervous. </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I have set out these communications in some detail, but they are substantially outweighed by the extent of the communications between the parents and between the mother and the father's family.  For example, on 2 January (the same day she told a friend that she was going for a limited time), she wrote to the father's mother that she was really looking forward to closing a difficult period in her life and living in another country.  Likewise, the communications between the parents are focused on executing the move, not debating it.  At times, the dialogue becomes fractious: e.g. 27 March, when the father complains about an incident involving the mother and C and says that the mother should either come over to England or stay in Mexico and be divorced.  Nonetheless, at no stage does the mother ever suggest to the father or his family that she will not be moving to England.  The most that she says is that she feels </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"in two parts"</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> and that it is not easy.  In response to the father's threat of divorce, the mother wrote that he should not be angry at the delay in her arrival as they were going to be in England for </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"a lifetime"</span><span style="font-size:12pt">.</span></p>

The mother's communications with others show that she had misgivings, as well she might have done, but they do not displace the solid body of evidence showing the couple making the necessary plans for the mother's departure from Mexico with C.</span></p>

The letter comes from a friend who works in the same field and has none of the indicators of a serious job offer.

Alerted by the incorrect English, counsel for the father asked for sight of the original message.  It does not contain those four words.  The mother admits that she doctored the message to support her case.  It is not the only instance of misrepresentation on her part.  I remind myself that there may be a number of reasons for lies, including misguided attempts to support a true case.  Nonetheless, this crude attempt to mislead the court shows that statements by the mother must be viewed in the light of any objective or contemporaneous material that is available.</span></p>

Unaccountably, on the evening of 8 May, the mother left the hotel at about 7:30 pm, leaving C (aged 16 months) unattended in the room.  The mother seems to have met a female friend and through her a man with whom she spent the evening.  At about 10:00 pm, the hotel staff heard C and when they realised she was alone, they called the police.  The mother returned to the hotel with the man at 2:17 am the next morning and was arrested for neglect.  C was taken into police protection and spent the night with a foster carer.  The following day, the father's identity was discovered.  C was placed with him at his parents' home, and there she has remained.</span></p>

I also reject the case contained in the mother's statement that the father told her that he would be travelling to England for 3 to 6 months for the sole purpose of work and that they had arranged to visit him here between 19 April and 31 July when C was due to return to Mexico.  I further cannot accept the submission of Ms Chokowry, which does not spring from the mother's own descriptions, that this should be regarded as a conditional plan, with the continued unity of the family being what she describes as a condition precedent.

To that end, in particular the duration, regularity, conditions and reasons for the stay on the territory of a Member State and the family&#8217;s move to that State, the child&#8217;s nationality, the place and the conditions of attendance at school, linguistic knowledge and the family and social relationships of the child in that State must be taken into consideration.

It is not a matter of intention: one does not acquire a habitual residence merely by intending to do so; nor does one fail to acquire one merely by not intending to do so. An illegal immigrant may desperately want to become habitually resident in this country, but that does not mean that he does so. A tax exile may desperately want to lose his habitual residence here, but that does not mean that he does so.

It is the child&#8217;s habitual residence which is in question. It is the child&#8217;s integration which is under consideration. Each child is an individual with his own experiences and his own perceptions. These are not necessarily determined by the decisions of his parents, although sometimes these will leave him with no choice but to buckle down and get on with it. The tiny baby whose mother took him back to her home country in Mercredi v Chaffe was in a very different situation from any of the three children with whom we are concerned. The environment of an infant or very young child is (one hopes) a family environment and so determined by reference to the person with whom he lives. But once a child leaves the family environment and goes to school, his social world widens and there are more factors to be taken into account. Furthermore, where parents are separated, there may well be two possible homes in which the children can live and the children will be well aware of this. This may well affect the degree of their integration in a new environment. </span></p>

Their state of mind was reflected in the actions that they took to bring about their relocation.

The fact that the family's plans sadly foundered so soon means that the period of habitual residence was one of days or weeks only, but the short duration does not invalidate habitual residence.

There are a number of unsatisfactory aspects to the situation that would exist if C was to be returned, but these do not reach the level where a grave risk of physical or psychological harm, or an intolerable situation, is demonstrated.  As C's future remains to be determined, I say no more about this.  There are unsatisfactory aspects of the situation in this jurisdiction as well.</span></p>

On the mother's behalf, attention is rightly drawn to her parlous position as an overstayer with no access to public funds.  The expert evidence establishes that there is a welfare-based relocation jurisdiction in Mexico.</span></p>

She has been in her current home for nine months and it is not in her interests to disrupt this.  A decision about her long-term future needs to be taken as soon as possible and on the available information it is likely to be taken significantly sooner in this jurisdiction than in Mexico.</span></p>

Had C continued to be habitually resident in Mexico after her arrival in England, I can see no reason to believe that this Article would have been engaged.  However, in view of my conclusion that this was not a wrongful retention, consideration of that issue is not necessary; had it been, an application to amend the Answer would have been required.</span></p>
