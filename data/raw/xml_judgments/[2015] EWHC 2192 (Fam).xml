I am concerned in this case with a child called M.  He was born on 5 July 2012 and will shortly celebrate his 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">rd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> birthday.  He is the only child of the applicant mother, MB (&#8220;the mother&#8221;) and GK, the respondent father (&#8220;the father&#8221;). The mother is a Mongolian national.  The father is a national of Singapore although throughout the relevant period since 2011 both have been living in London where the father was employed as a quantitative analyst by a well-known international bank.  These parents were married in Singapore in June 2011.  The father was then already living and working in London where he owned a property in Lancaster Gate, W2.  The mother lived in Mongolia until 2010 where she obtained a degree in finance and economics.  Having obtained a visa as a dependent of F, she arrived in London some four months after the marriage in order to live with the father in the London property which was to become the matrimonial home.  M was born in London in July 2012.  He has a congenital lung condition known as cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) for which he has been receiving treatment at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In circumstances to which I shall come, M is presently in the care of the paternal grandparents in Singapore.  There is ongoing litigation concerning the arrangements for his future both in this jurisdiction and in Singapore.  The English litigation commenced as long ago as January 2014 and has had a complex history.  In the context of the mother&#8217;s application in wardship under this court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction, there have been several hearings before various judges of the Family Division and the matter has travelled up to the Court of Appeal on at least two occasions.  On numerous occasions, there have been orders providing for the return of M to this jurisdiction.  None has been complied with by the father who says that he is powerless in the face of his parents&#8217; opposition to any attempt to remove the child from their care.   Before me over the course of two days on 14 and 15 May 2015 was the father&#8217;s application issued on 17 April 2015 for a stay of these English wardship proceedings.  He has been represented in that application on a direct access basis by Mr Grant Armstrong of counsel.  It is his case that all matters concerning the future welfare of M should be dealt with by the court in Singapore.  That court, he contends, is  already seised of both divorce and financial matters.  It is the forum where the paternal grandparents have launched their own freestanding applications for orders in respect of their continuing care for M, and all future decisions about his welfare can and should more appropriately be decided in that jurisdiction.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The mother is represented by Mr Edward Devereux of counsel.  She resists the father&#8217;s application for a stay of these English proceedings and contends that this court has jurisdiction as of right because of findings in relation to M&#8217;s habitual residence.  She contends that this court should exercise a discretion to retain jurisdiction in relation to M who has been a ward of this court throughout the last 18 months.  Of very significant concern is the fact that the mother has had no direct contact with M since the beginning of 2014, apart from one very brief period in August 2014.  On that occasion she travelled to Singapore in order to try to effect his return to this jurisdiction by means which, on one view, might be seen as unilateral and desperate actions of &#8216;self-help&#8217; but, on the other, as an illegal attempt to snatch M from the care of his grandparents.  That is certainly how it has been viewed by the father, his parents and the court in Singapore:  the mother was incarcerated in Singapore for 10 weeks as a result of those actions which breached local immigration law.  She was deported from Singapore at the end of her custodial sentence and returned to this jurisdiction on 22 October 2014.  </span></p>

In the context of this child&#8217;s young life to date, he has been the subject of bitterly contested litigation since he was 18 months old.  He has been separated from each of his parents (both of whom continue to live in London) since the end of January 2014.</span></p>

However, before me on 14 and 15 May was a substantial bundle which included their evidence filed in the Singapore proceedings.  To that extent, their voices have been heard in this court by me despite their unwillingness to engage in the English proceedings in any formal sense.  Whilst the father has not, as yet, issued any proceedings in Singapore concerning M, he is separately represented in his own parents&#8217; litigation and the position documents which his Singapore lawyer has prepared for the purposes of those proceedings leave me in no doubt but that he is supporting their wish to retain M in Singapore.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">One of the issues at the hearing before me in May was the mother&#8217;s ability to re-enter the Republic of Singapore for the purposes of participating in the litigation ongoing in that jurisdiction.  The evidence of her ability to do so was by no means clear when the case began.  It was still inconclusive by the time the case ended on the second day of the hearing.  Counsel made it plain that each intended to seek clarification on this issue and I agreed to adjourn handing down a judgment for a short period whilst that evidence was obtained. Whilst a prospective determination of the issue was unlikely to materialise, its relevance is both obvious and important in the context of a debate about where decisions relating to M&#8217;s future arrangements should be determined.</span></p>

I was told by counsel in an email exchange that a number of further questions were being addressed to that authority seeking further clarification.  It appears that there is now a joint approach in the form of a further letter to which, as yet, there has been no response.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">At this point, it is important to note that each of these parents advances their case on the basis that each will continue to live in this jurisdiction at least for the foreseeable future.  At the present time, despite his wish to return to Singapore, the father is not able to leave London because of a passport order made in these proceedings and bail conditions imposed by the Southwark Crown Court.  He is the subject of serious pending criminal charges which concern allegations of rape and violence perpetrated against the mother during the course of their marriage.  The charges were formally laid on 9 March this year and his trial is due to commence in October 2015.  Should he be convicted at its conclusion, he is likely to receive a significant custodial sentence.  He resigned from his employment with the bank in March last year (2014) and is currently unemployed.  He tells me that he is reliant on the financial support which he receives from his family and friends.  The mother has returned to the former matrimonial home in Lancaster Gate and intends to remain there.  The property is subject to a significant mortgage which is now in arrears since the father stopped making payments to the mortgage lender.    She is currently a student at Birkbeck College in London where she is enrolled for a two year Masters degree in accounting and financial management.  At the present time, she has permission to remain in this country until October 2016 on a student visa.  The father says that there is a very real question mark over her ability to remain beyond that date.  She, too, is dependent on the generosity of friends although she has some dwindling savings which would have been sufficient to see her through to the end of her current course.  She is now in receipt of a public funding certificate and has recently changed solicitors.  From the beginning of May this year (some two weeks before the hearing before me) she has been represented by Bindmans LLP.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">That these proceedings have taken their toll emotionally and financially on each of these parents was plain to see as they sat in court over two days of the hearing.  The mother, in particular, has been distraught (as was clear to me) by her separation from M and the apparent unwillingness of the paternal grandparents to allow her any form of indirect contact with him.  The father, it appears, does have regular Skype and telephone contact with their son.  I was told about some psychological support which the mother had been receiving which, she tells me in her written evidence, has been of some assistance in enabling her to cope with the pressure of this ongoing litigation.  I have little doubt that the father, too, is under a very heavy burden at the present time coping as he is with this litigation and the pending criminal proceedings.  Each appeared to me to be physically exhausted by the legal process to which they are currently exposed.</span></p>

I am told that the father&#8217;s family has the financial means to secure in Singapore the services of specialist family lawyers.  The father has his own representation, Mr Adrian Tan of August Law Corporation.  The mother has no such representation.</span></p>

The judge had sentenced the father to a term of imprisonment in respect of what she found to be his contempt in not taking steps to ensure the prompt return of M to England.  The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal in respect of the contempt and granted the father his immediate liberty.

It was understood and agreed that when return to Singapore where they would be reunited with M and then return with him to London.  The arrangement was intended to be a temporary one until the father decided to separate from the mother and to relocate to Singapore.  But at that point the father deceived the mother and concealed his true intentions from her in the manner I have described.  In consequence the mother and father never had a common intention that they would continue their lives together as a family in Singapore or that M should continue to live there.  In all these circumstances I believe the quality of M&#8217;s residence and the degree of his integration into a social and family environment in Singapore was such that the judge could properly conclude it was not habitual.

The judge concluded that M&#8217;s best interests required his immediate return to his mother&#8217;s care.  As the judge made clear, this did not preclude a consideration at a later stage of more general welfare issues or, indeed, of issues of forum.  But, having satisfied herself that M was habitually resident in this jurisdiction and the father having given an undertaking not to pursue the Singaporean proceedings concerning M, it seems to me the judge was perfectly entitled to conclude that M&#8217;s immediate welfare needs would be best served by restoring him forthwith to his mother&#8217;s care.  Moreover, the judge considered it important that the father should not be permitted to frustrate her order by returning to Singapore as he had made it abundantly clear it was his intention to do so.  At this stage she had every reason to believe that the father would comply with her order and that the grandparents would respect any request by their son to return M to this jurisdiction and the care of his parents.

By that stage, no proceedings had been taken in Singapore by the father to enforce the return order made by Russell J.  His case appeared to be that he was powerless to persuade his own parents to allow him to remove the child from their care.  They had on 15 April 2014 initiated their own application concerning M in the Singapore courts.  The judge was shown a letter at the hearing from the Fortis Law Corporation indicating that there was to be a further hearing in Singapore some four days hence.  The nature of that hearing remained unclear.  The judge made a raft of orders which provided, amongst other matters, for judicial liaison between the High Court of the Republic of Singapore and this Court through the Office of the Head of International Family Justice for England.  A copy of his order was to be provided to Miss Penelope Langdon, legal secretary for that Office, together with a respectful request of the judicial, administrative and law enforcement authorities in Singapore to stay the grandparents&#8217; proceedings on the basis of the prior determination of the English court that M was at all material times habitually resident in this jurisdiction.  The co-operation of those authorities was also requested in terms of facilitating his return to this jurisdiction.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">On 9 July 2014, the Singapore court had issued an interim decree of divorce in respect of the petition which the father had issued without notice to the mother in January of that year (she was not served with that petition until March 2014). Some three weeks after the hearing before Roderic Wood J and in circumstances where M had not been returned to her care, the mother decided to take matters into her own hands.  She had been put in touch with an organisation called CARI (Child Abduction Recovery International).  That organisation was run by a former mercenary called Adam Whittington.  He had agreed to assist the mother in her attempt to secure her son&#8217;s return to her care. On 18 August 2014, she &#8211; with Mr Whittington and another of his operatives - entered Singapore illegally.  The normal immigration checkpoints were avoided as a result of their arrival by private catamaran at the jetty of a well-known local hotel. Once in Singapore, a successful attempt was made to remove M from the care of his grandparents whilst they were leaving their home.  The mother&#8217;s evidence is that M ran to her joyfully when they were reunited and that they later spent time together in a local hotel bedroom.  The purported &#8220;snatch&#8221; (as it is characterised by counsel for the father) appears to have involved an unedifying scuffle during the course of which the grandparents, or at least one of them, and M received some slight injuries for which they were subsequently seen at a local hospital.  The police retrieved M from his mother&#8217;s care in fairly short order and she was arrested.  On 8 September 2014 she pleaded guilty to several immigration offences (including illegal entry) and was sentenced to 10 weeks imprisonment.</span></p>

There was little known at that stage about these recent incidents and the mother&#8217;s solicitors had been unable to contact her having been made aware of the order I made that morning.  That was a Tuesday.  The matter came back before me the following Friday, 22 August 2014. On that occasion I was informed about the recent events in Singapore and was told of the mother&#8217;s arrest and the immigration offences with which she had been charged.  She had been unable to appear as I had directed because she was incarcerated in Singapore.  Her solicitors were without instructions and had been unable to speak to her.  I directed the filing of statements before the next hearing which I listed for 28 August.  As with all other orders which were to be made by the English court subsequently, a copy of my order was sent to Ms Langdon for onward transmission to the Singapore court.</span></p>

Russell J had made a passport order which prevented him from travelling to Singapore pending the child&#8217;s return to this jurisdiction.  He was at that stage a litigant in person.  His lordship described the aim of the process as &#8216;laudable&#8217; but nevertheless noted that there was then no report from the single joint expert as to what steps could be taken in Singapore and on the avenues open to the father to secure M&#8217;s return</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

The mother was represented on that occasion by counsel, as was the father.  She no longer sought to rely on the order requiring the father to litigate in Singapore and I discharged it along with the penal notice attached to it.  By that stage, it was evident from the report that it was open to either of these parties to take steps in Singapore to seek the return of M to this jurisdiction.  The mother was then in custody in Singapore and was not due to be produced in court locally until 4 September 2014.   She was for all practical purposes incommunicado and neither counsel nor her solicitors had been able to speak to her since the events in Singapore of 19 August.  I listed a further urgent hearing in order to consider the further conduct of the English wardship proceedings and the application which was then before the court for the return of the father&#8217;s passport.  I directed the parties to file statements and gave permission for my order to be served on the British Consulate in Singapore and on the Mongolian Embassy in the Republic.</span></p>

That hearing was listed before Holman J on 29 September 2014.  The mother was due to be released from prison on 7 October.  A further hearing concerning M had been listed in the Singapore court on 2 October.  The issue of forum conveniens was live by that stage since, in addition to the arrangements for M and his status as a ward of the English court,  divorce and financial proceedings had been ongoing by then in both jurisdictions. Whilst M had issued a divorce petition in London together with financial remedy proceedings, these were overtaken by the grant of a decree on 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> July 2014 in Singapore on F&#8217;s petition.

The mother had returned to England in October 2014 following her release from custody in Singapore.  Both parties were represented by counsel.  Mr Armstrong appeared for the father, as he did before me on 14 and 15 May 2015.  Mr Edward Devereux did not appear for the mother on that occasion.  As has subsequently transpired, it does not appear to have been an entirely successful hearing in terms of the judge&#8217;s approach to satisfying himself as to the issues with which he was dealing.  The order which he made at the conclusion of that hearing contained declarations that M was habitually resident in England and Wales at all material times and that the courts of England and Wales had jurisdiction in relation to all issues of parental responsibility and welfare.  The court in Singapore was requested to stay all proceedings relating to the child and to assist in securing M&#8217;s immediate return to this jurisdiction.  A penal notice addressed to the father was attached to an order requiring him to return M to this jurisdiction by 4pm on 14 November 2014.  His application for the return of his passport was refused until M had been safely returned.  He was directed to file a statement setting out what steps he had taken in Singapore to return the child.</span></p>

That hearing was limited to issues of stay and passport orders and accordingly any issues relating to M&#8217;s welfare were to be considered in outline only but determined thereafter in detail at a subsequent hearing by the court either in Singapore or in London.  The mother was required to put before the court evidence of her current immigration status in this jurisdiction and her involvement with CARI (in relation to the attempted abduction of M in Singapore); the father was to provide information about the likely timetable for the progression and conclusion of the criminal proceedings ongoing in Southwark Crown Court in this jurisdiction.</span></p>

I was also provided with a bundle of material which had been used in the Singapore proceedings.  To bring the chronology up to date in relation to those proceedings, on 30 January 2015, District Judge Tan Peck sitting in the Family Justice Courts of the Republic of Singapore made an order after hearing from the father&#8217;s counsel but in the mother&#8217;s absence.  His order was made in the context of the financial aspects of the Singaporean decree of divorce.  Very simply, he ordered that each party should retain all assets held in their respective names and dismissed any further claims arising out of the marriage for the division of matrimonial assets.  The father was directed to pay to the mother a single lump sum of SPD2,400 (just over &#163;1,100) in respect of &#8216;maintenance&#8217;.  This sum was expressed to be &#8216;without prejudice to any application by either party for maintenance of the child after the conclusion of the proceedings in the United Kingdom in relation to the child&#8217;.

It is not necessary for me to descend to detail.  The legal structure for these issues in an international private family case is plain.  The court first determines whether or not the court in England and Wales has jurisdiction.  It does so, depending on the countries involved, with or without reference to various international provisions.  In a case such as this, which is not between Member States of the EU, the approach is straightforward.  The court decides jurisdiction and decides it with regard to the habitual residence of the child at the relevant time.  That determination in this case has been made and is not open to review or challenge and was not open to review or challenge at the hearing before Newton J.</span></p>

I have been taken to the provisions of the (Singapore) Family Justice Act 2014 and the Family Justice Rules.  These bear remarkable similarities to the statutory code embodied in our own Family Procedure Rules 2010 and the principles enshrined in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  There is provision, for example, for the appointment of a child representative if the court considers it necessary to secure the independent representation of the child&#8217;s interest: Part 4, Rule 30(4) of the Singapore code. The role of that representative is spelt out in Rule 31(2)(a) to (j) and appears to be more or less on all fours with the obligations and responsibilities imposed in English proceedings on any guardian appointed as the child&#8217;s litigation friend.  There is a clearly defined appellate route to the higher courts and a judge has to certify grounds or reasons for his judgment in much the same way as would an English judge whose decision was the subject of an appeal.  </span></p>

Whilst it remains a fact that M has not yet been returned to this jurisdiction, the Singapore court is plainly aware of these concurrent proceedings and the imminent adjudication of this court on matters relating to jurisdiction and forum conveniens.  Despite being urged by the father&#8217;s Singapore lawyers to disregard the findings made by Russell J in the English court in relation to M&#8217;s habitual residence, I am not aware of any steps which have been taken as yet in those proceedings which are inconsistent with those findings.  I know not what may have been decided in the hearing listed for 19 May 2015 on the grandparents&#8217; application.

In that case, the fact that the wife might secure an award of maintenance from the English court which she would be unlikely to recover in the French courts if she were to be found responsible for the breakdown of the marriage did not deter their lordships from remitting the case to France.</span></p>

They are elderly (his mother is 66 and his father is 68 years old).  As permanent residents of Singapore, they would find it difficult and inconvenient to have to travel to London to conduct proceedings in relation to their grandson.  In addition to the convenience factor, he tells me that he does not believe that they would wish to attend any court hearing in London even for the limited purposes of giving evidence in any future welfare enquiry conducted in this jurisdiction. He says that M is being well looked after in their condominium home with access to medical care for his congenital lung condition.  He attends a local nursery school for three hours each weekday morning.  In this context, I have been provided with a report from the Kinderland nursery dated 15 April 2015 which describes M as &#8216;a happy boy who displays a positive disposition when he comes to school&#8217; and which tells me that he is &#8216;well adjusted in his school environment and routine&#8217;.  I have also seen a brief report from the hospital to which M was taken following the mother&#8217;s attempt to remove him from his grandparents&#8217; care in August 2014.

He was admitted on 20 August 2014 and discharged 48 hours later into the care of the paternal grandparents in consultation with social workers, the police and with the consent of the local Attorney General&#8217;s office. </span></p>

He tells me that when she was produced before local Singapore magistrates following her arrest in August 2014, it was part of the mitigation she placed before the court that she regretted what she had done and would be willing to engage in child-focused proceedings in that jurisdiction in the future.  Further, she was produced by the prison authorities for the purposes of two family hearings concerning M in September and October 2014 which had been listed during the period of her incarceration and stated on each occasion that she intended to instruct lawyers in Singapore.  Once she had been released and was able to return to the former matrimonial home in London, she reneged on her willingness to participate in proceedings in Singapore.  In these circumstances, he says, she must be treated as having made a deliberate and conscious decision to press ahead in England.  However, that decision does not and should not preclude her from advancing any arguments she wishes to put before the Singapore court in the context of his parents&#8217; ongoing proceedings and/or in the context of any application she might wish to pursue in that jurisdiction.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">As to the costs of further proceedings in Singapore, the father contends that these will be many times lower than the cost of ongoing litigation in London.  He has apparently been advised that his future costs of all further hearings in Singapore will be less than &#163;10,000 with the mother&#8217;s costs likely to be less than &#163;15,000, although the Singapore court is used to conducting hearings at which parties appear as litigants in person.  He points to the fact that the single joint expert, Mr Das, has estimated the costs as being in the region of SGD 8,000 to SGD 10,000 (the equivalent of c. &#163;4,000 to &#163;5,000).  By comparison, the mother&#8217;s costs of the hearing before Russell J in relation to habitual residence were in excess of &#163;50,000, a fraction of the global costs liability of &#163;144,900 to which reference is made in her Form in the English financial proceedings.  Pausing there, it is right to record that my view, given the complexity of these proceedings, is that it would be very difficult for any expert to express a definitive or reliable view in relation to future legal costs in Singapore given the absence of any indication as to the issues and evidence which will need to be considered.  As is clear from his report, Mr Das cannot at this stage identify the time frame for any future litigation.  He says at paragraph 42 of his report that it &#8220;could range from 8 weeks to several months&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[2/B:292]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  The estimate which he has given in paragraph 52 of his report is restricted to the probable cost of a single application to the Singapore court, the filing of one affidavit from each party, the preparation of written submissions and attendance at a single contested hearing.  Experience to date shows that this is a complex piece of international litigation which has already entailed numerous hearings before several different judges both in the both in the Family Division of the High Court and at appellate level.  It seems to me to be an over-optimistic simplification to assume that this case could be disposed of in one further hearing in Singapore.</span></p>

Other than the factors which I have identified separately in the preceding paragraphs of my judgment, many of these points consist of narrative evidence, some of which is inconsistent with the findings already made by Russell J.  Many others go to the substance of the specific welfare enquiry which will flow from any decision I make in relation to the forum conveniens issue.  Whilst I accept that there is an extant order made by the Singapore court on 23 January 2014 which presently precludes the mother from removing M from the interim care of the paternal grandparents (point xiii), this order predated the significant raft of orders made in the subsequent English wardship proceedings.  There is no evidence before me that the Singapore court will refuse to recognise any decision made by the English court in relation to future jurisdiction in this case.  Indeed, as I have already remarked, all the indications to date are that the Singapore court is well aware of steps taken in these English wardship proceedings and is awaiting the outcome of this hearing before deciding on any substantive longer term relief in relation to M and his future arrangements.</span></p>

There is a dispute as to the beneficial ownership of the investment property.

By choice the father took up employment with a well-known international bank in 2010.  M was born here and, until his retention in Singapore in the circumstances found by Russell J, this had been his only home.  He had lived throughout in a home shared by his two parents in circumstances where the mother had been his primary carer.  It had always been the parties&#8217; intention whilst united as a couple to raise M in England and to provide him with an English education.  The mother is still living in the former matrimonial home and, if M is returned to her care at the conclusion of any welfare enquiry, she intends and wishes to continue living here to care for him.

As to the London investment property which the father sold, there was from that sale an equity of some &#163;350,000 which was transferred by the father to his parents in Singapore without prior reference to her.  She denies that she owns any property in Mongolia (as the father has asserted) and has no other assets which she might realise to fund representation in Singapore.  She has significant liabilities in this jurisdiction which she has incurred as a result of financial support she has received from family and friends.  Her current account is in overdraft and she has outstanding costs which remain owing to her former solicitors from the period when she was privately funding these wardship proceedings.</span></p>

They must either fund their own representation in that jurisdiction or run the case as individual litigants in person.  The father is currently represented by an experienced lawyer who has entered a number of appearances on his behalf (either personally or by means of written applications) both in the context of the father&#8217;s own divorce proceedings and (I believe) in his parents&#8217; proceedings in relation to M.  I have read a document entitled &#8216;Plaintiff&#8217;s Written Submission&#8217; dated 1 December 2014.  This was put before the Singapore court in the context of the father&#8217;s divorce proceedings but the content of the document makes it perfectly plain that the father was then proposing that he should have sole custody of M with only supervised access to the mother.  In that document which was signed by the father&#8217;s lawyer, the mother is described as &#8216;a negligent and irresponsible mother who is unable and unwilling to care for the child&#8217; (page 89 of 338 in the bundle relating to the Singapore proceedings).  The dismissal of all and any financial claims which the mother might have as the father&#8217;s wife to the former matrimonial home is justified by an assertion that she made &#8216;zero direct financial contributions&#8217; (page 105 of 338).  The father&#8217;s case is then developed on the basis that, quite apart from the absence of any financial contribution to the marriage, she made no indirect non-financial contributions (page 110 of 338) despite the finding of Russell J in the wardship proceedings some 8&#189; months earlier that she had been M&#8217;s primary carer since his birth.</span></p>

She states that she was informed by immigration police in October 2014 when she was deported after serving her prison sentence that she was banned from returning.  At the time she made her statement on 10 May 2015, she was actively pursuing enquiries about her future immigration status in Singapore.  What she had at that time was an email from the Mongolian Embassy in Singapore.  That had been written by the Mongolian Charg&#233; d&#8217;Affaires, Ms Ganbold Uyanga, on 13 May 2015.  The email records the assistance which the Embassy had attempted to provide to the mother on a pro bono basis whilst she was in Singapore and subject to criminal charges following her attempt to retrieve M from his grandparents&#8217; care.  The Embassy staff had been unsuccessful in that attempt because of issues of timing although it is not entirely clear from the email whether the pro bono assistance which was being sought related to the immigration charges or the prospects of making an application relating to M in the local family courts.  However, the email went on to record Ms Uyanga&#8217;s understanding that the mother would not be allowed to re-enter Singapore during her lifetime because of her previous conviction for immigration offences.  She could request permission if she wrote to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) but, without that approval, she would be left without a means of entering.</span></p>

It was addressed to Bindmans LLP, the mother&#8217;s solicitors who had written to enquire what their client&#8217;s status would be.  The ICA letter, written by a senior official in the department, records the fact that a visitor&#8217;s entry into Singapore is neither a right nor automatic and each application for entry is considered on its own merits.  The mother would need to seek permission from the Controller of Immigration before any determination was made as to whether or not she would be allowed re-entry.  For these purposes, she would require a local sponsor who was resident in Singapore.   That local sponsor must be an individual Singapore citizen or a permanent adult Singapore resident or Singapore registered company.  Any such application would be processed on receipt of the application form and supporting documents and the local sponsor would be informed subsequently by post of the outcome.</span></p>

Their conclusions (which are not evidence) in the light of her previous conviction for immigration offences was that the mother would require either a free pardon or a specific determination by the Controller of Immigration that she was not an undesirable immigrant.  Whilst I was told that the father&#8217;s enquiries were ongoing, I let the parties know through my clerk (as I have indicated) that I was not prepared to delay the handing down of my judgment any longer given the fact that urgent decisions will need to be taken sooner rather than later in respect of M&#8217;s future in the context of his future relationship with each of his parents from whom he has now been physically separated for many months.  On 29 June 2015 as I was about to send to counsel my written judgment, I received a further email from Mr Armstrong in which he clarified his client&#8217;s position that I should delay handing down my judgment until the position was ascertained.  With his email came a further letter to the ICA in Singapore which I am told was sent on or about 23 June 2015.  That was a full month after the letter from the ICA dated 23 May 2015 to which I have already referred.   It was quite clear, and had been since the conclusion of counsel&#8217;s closing submissions to me on 15 May 2015, that the obtaining of any further clarification on this point &#8211; if it could be secured at all &#8211; was urgent.  I take the view that it is not in M&#8217;s interests for me to delay any further the delivery of my judgment.  A month has now passed.  The conclusions which I have reached are based upon the best available evidence which I have and it is that evidence which has informed my decision, along with all the other factors to which I shall come.</span></p>

However distressed or frustrated she may have been by M&#8217;s continuing absence despite orders made in this court requiring his return, her actions last summer were completely unjustifiable.  They caused distress to the grandparents, to the father, to the mother herself and, no doubt, to M who must have been bewildered and confused by seeing his mother after many months, only to be taken from her in circumstances to which no 2 year old child should have been exposed.  That said, it seems to me that the mother&#8217;s actions lend some support to her stated desperation to be reunited with her son.  If she is in fact a negligent mother who is unconcerned with her son and cares only to exploit any financial advantage she can gain in the divorce proceedings, I ask myself why she would have gone to these lengths to secure M&#8217;s return to her care.  These will all be matters which will need to be considered in the context of the wider welfare enquiry into M&#8217;s future arrangements whether that enquiry takes place in the English court or in Singapore.</span></p>

These arrangements have never been sanctioned by his mother who, up to that point, was his primary carer (see the findings of Russell J).  It is quite clear that the status quo ante was that M was living in a family home in London and that home was occupied by each of his parents who, together, loved and cared for him.  The demands of the father&#8217;s employment meant that the burden of the day to day care fell on the mother&#8217;s shoulders but each was involved to an extent in discharging their duties to this child as parents.  It is not for me at this stage to venture into the territory of wider welfare considerations but it has been a consistent principle underpinning the jurisprudence of English (and, no doubt, Singaporean) family law over many decades that a child is entitled to be raised by either one or both of his or her biological parents unless there are reasons why that natural state of affairs cannot be sanctioned by the courts.</span></p>

I cannot make any findings about that as yet since I have no evidence from the grandparents about this issue nor have I heard oral evidence from the father.   I accept that once the committal order of Russell J was reversed by the Court of Appeal, the coercive order requiring the father to litigate in Singapore was set aside. However, the order directed to the paternal grandparents remained in full force and effect.

At the moment, there is a significant question mark over the mother&#8217;s ability to re-enter Singapore.  We know that she can make an application for permission to re-enter but that application will inevitably be seen against the background of a previous (and recent) conviction in respect of immigration offences for which she has served a custodial sentence.  We spent some time during the course of the hearing exploring the Singapore legislation which governs the position.  It is the Immigration Act (Chapter 133)(Revised Edition 2008).  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 8</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> relates to &#8220;Prohibited Immigrants&#8221;.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/8/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 8(1)</ref> provides that any person who is (i) not a Singapore citizen and (ii) a member of any of the prohibited classes in sub-section (3) or, who, in the opinion of the [Immigration] Controller, is a member of the prohibited classes, is a prohibited immigrant.  </span></p>

What I do know is that a resolution of the interim and longer term arrangements for M cannot wait.  He will be 3 years old very shortly and is currently separated from both his parents and that state of affairs has persisted for almost half of his young life to date.  In circumstances where the mother was unable to re-enter Singapore, she would be at a very significant disadvantage (and not simply a juridical disadvantage) in circumstances where she has no independent means to instruct lawyers to appear on her behalf and there is no public funding available to assist in the presentation of her case.  One might say in these circumstances her situation would be quite impossible.  This dispute has international dimensions and a complex history.  In my view, it is no answer for the father to say that, even on the assumption she secures permission to re-enter Singapore, she can appear as a litigant in person and conduct her own defence of the grandparents&#8217; proceedings and/or any proceedings he may be advised to bring in that jurisdiction.  That his interests are very closely aligned with those of his parents is obvious from the documents in the Singapore proceedings to which I have already referred.

Whilst the point is disputed,  I am told, that she was obliged to spend a night sleeping on the streets following her release from custody before she could make arrangements to return (via Mongolia) to London.  She has no practical support or back up.  She is a student with no regular source of income over and above the modest funds she has earmarked for her living expenses whilst she completes her studies at Birkbeck College.  The father, on the other hand, intends to return to his parents&#8217; home in Singapore once he is free to leave England should that prove to be where he finds himself in October or November this year.  If his trial is adjourned for any reason, it may well be a date much later than that in 2016.  He accepts that he has been the beneficiary of financial support from his parents in the past.  It appears to be accepted that they have independent financial means and have certainly been able to afford specialist representation in terms of the lawyers they have instructed to progress their own application which is ongoing in the Singapore court.  I know that because Mr Armstrong confirmed that to be the case when I asked him during the course of argument how far the grandparents&#8217; financial circumstances fell to be considered as a financial resource which was available to the father in the context of these proceedings.</span></p>

I accept that the grandparents are in Singapore and may well be unwilling to attend in person but these days the use of video conferencing facilities is commonplace in the Family Division.  It is unlikely that interpreters will be required since I am told that both the paternal grandparents speak English.  Even if they (or any other witnesses based in Singapore) required assistance from an interpreter, this resource can easily be provided.  Judges are perfectly used to conducting hearings with an international element in this way and some of the courts in the Royal Courts of Justice have been set up and equipped specifically for this purpose.</span></p>

I have already expressed my views about the likelihood of the court being assisted by a psychological evaluation of M.  I am quite prepared to accept for these purposes that he has a close and loving attachment to his grandparents who have cared for him now for many months.  For the same reasons, I accept what I read in the report from his nursery school that he appears to be a happy little boy who enjoys his mornings at the school.  It is thus unlikely that evidence would be required from those who care for him at the nursery.</span></p>

In particular, he says that the evidence relating to the prosecution of the mother and the CARI team who assisted her in August last year will be information held by the Singapore prosecuting authorities in respect of which there may be issues or sensitivities were a request for release made by the English court.  I am not persuaded that this is a significant factor to weigh in the scales.  The circumstances of the failed attempt to recover M received wide publicity in the local Singapore press.  Copies of the press reports are in the bundles which were placed before me.  Those, of course, are not evidence.  However, the mother has provided a narrative account of these events in one of her recent statements.  Whilst there may be issues remaining as to how she paid (or was intending to pay) for the services of these people, the issue goes fundamentally to her ability to prioritise M&#8217;s best interests, the level of care she is likely or able to provide were he to be returned to her care in this jurisdiction, and whether or not she poses of a further flight risk.  For my part, I do not see how access to the papers held in Singapore is likely to assist a judge in England or Singapore on these matters.  Should they become relevant, and if the proceedings remain in this jurisdiction, I have little doubt but that the Singapore Family Court would do its best and take whatever steps might be necessary to procure these documents.</span></p>

He says that the Singapore divorce proceedings are now all but concluded whereas little progress has been made in the mother&#8217;s English divorce suit.  I bear in mind that this is his application for a stay of the English </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">wardship</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> proceedings.  It seems to me that there can be little argument but that those wardship proceedings are now at an advanced stage.  There have been several hearings over the course of almost 18 months.  The mother issued her application under the inherent jurisdiction promptly on her return from Singapore on 27 January 2014.  Findings in relation to M&#8217;s habitual residence were made in March of that year and upheld by the Court of Appeal in July 2014.  I dealt with the matter during August 2014 in the immediate aftermath of the mother&#8217;s failed attempt to secure M&#8217;s return to England and the CARI d&#233;bacle. Immediately after her release from prison and return to the United Kingdom, there was a fresh hearing listed before Newton J.  That this hearing in October 2014 did not resolve once and for all the issue of forum conveniens is unfortunate, but it was not the fault of either of the parents that a resolution was not forthcoming.  Had it been, the welfare stage of this enquiry might now have been concluded.</span></p>

On behalf of the father he seeks to argue that because his client is not paying the mortgage, arrears are accruing.  Whilst it is a matter for the mortgage lenders, the risk of possession proceedings cannot be ruled out.  Further, he says that the father has mounting debts; the equity in the former family home is a resource which is available to meet those debts (at least in part); and this is simply &#8216;a house of cards waiting to fall down&#8217;.  In these circumstances, the mother&#8217;s ability to remain in that home (with or without M) must be doubtful.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Time is now of the essence for this child.  Mr Armstrong submits that, if an English court were to order the return of M to this jurisdiction and to his parents, that would have to be achieved in all likelihood by the engagement of the court in Singapore and the imposition of mirror orders which required the grandparents to return him.  That is as may be, but it seems to me that such a situation might well arise (i.e. the removal of the child) if the proceedings were to continue in Singapore.  M is not (quite) yet 3 years old.  His grandparents are elderly, although I have no evidence as to their current state of health.  If the father were to be convicted and sentenced at the conclusion of his forthcoming trial, it is probable that he will not be available to care for M for a significant period of time.  The mother puts herself forward as his primary carer until he was retained in Singapore by the actions of the father.  Russell J has confirmed that was indeed her role. She wishes to resume that role, with or without the assistance of the father, who undoubtedly has an important future role in his son&#8217;s life whatever the outcome of the criminal proceedings.  A court is going to have to resolve that issue on the basis of a thorough and wide-ranging enquiry into the course which is best likely to promote M&#8217;s physical and emotional wellbeing and happiness through the remaining years of his minority.  It is by no means clear what decision a Singapore court, at the conclusion of such an enquiry, might reach.  A judge may well conclude that M&#8217;s grandparents were not the best people to care for him on a long term basis if the current allegations which they make against the mother are proved to be without substance.  I do not know, but I would take a great deal of persuasion that a court in Singapore would not manage such a transition in a sensitive and child-focused manner if this was a conclusion which it reached.  On this basis, enforcement as against the grandparents of an English or local court order requiring M&#8217;s return to the care of his parents (or either one of them) may be a necessary step to achieving that result.  So it seems to me that Mr Armstrong&#8217;s point does not in truth tip the scales one way or the other.</span></p>

In the light of the fact that the courts in Singapore will be astute to investigate and prioritise M&#8217;s interests in any further proceedings which may be listed in those courts, I can see no particular juridical advantage for either of the mother or the father in terms of an objective assessment of the quality of justice and fairness of outcome which will no doubt be the cornerstone which informs outcome in either jurisdiction.  Mr Devereux on behalf of the mother points to her subjective perception of her vulnerability in the Singapore court and the trepidation with which she views an outcome which removes control of this case from the hands of the English court.  I am prepared to accept for these purposes that, with or without justification, there are reasons why she might hold those views in the light of all that has happened to her in Singapore following her arrest last summer.  Mr Armstrong says that I should ignore this factor since she is essentially the author of her own misfortune.  I do not agree.  No doubt the circumstances in which the mother took those drastic and unwarranted steps will be the subject of findings of fact in due course.  I cannot make those findings today because I have not heard any evidence and know only what I read in her statement.  She plainly feels that the underlying and driving dynamic of the litigation in Singapore is the united front which her former parents-in-law and the father are putting forward through a team of specialist lawyers, a resource to which she would have no access.  She believes that her conviction and period of incarceration in a Singapore prison will count heavily against her were she to be forced to litigate in that jurisdiction as a litigant in person.  From a subjective perception, I have no doubt that all these factors are matters of great concern to her.</span></p>

Their cases in that litigation appear to be running on parallel tracks. It will be clear that what concerns me is the mother&#8217;s ability to participate in those proceedings in the same manner in which she (and the father) can participate in the ongoing English proceedings.  He is publicly funded in respect of the pending criminal proceedings ongoing in Southwark Crown Court.  The absence of public funding for his participation in the wardship proceedings in circumstances where he has been able to fund his lawyers thus far through the generosity of friends and family does not, in my view, tip the balance away from those proceedings remaining in this jurisdiction to their natural conclusion. </span></p>

In these circumstances, I refuse the father&#8217;s application for a stay of the English wardship proceedings.</span></p>

His welfare will be the court&#8217;s paramount consideration and I would urge the paternal grandparents to participate in that enquiry and to place before the English court all evidence which they consider may be of relevance to a determination of any decisions in relation to M&#8217;s future.  In reaching this decision in relation to forum conveniens and the continuation of the English wardship proceedings, I wish to make it clear that I am making no final decisions in relation to M&#8217;s longer term future.  There needs to be a further hearing to determine these issues.  The paternal grandparents should know that the judge who deals with the next stage of the enquiry (whether or not that is me) will afford them every opportunity to put their case before the court, whether or not that is on the basis of their attendance with legal representation or by means of receiving their evidence by video conferencing facilities.</span></p>

If those directions cannot be agreed and a further short hearing is necessary, I would ask counsel to obtain from the Clerk of the Rules dates when such a hearing can be accommodated.</span></p>
