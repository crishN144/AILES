	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">A was born in 2004.  He is the son of Mr AF (the father) and Ms T (the mother), and both hold parental responsibility for him.  He is the father&#8217;s only child.  In May 2008, the mother abducted A from England, where he had lived since birth, to Germany.  That was three years ago, and apart from one brief meeting in December 2008, A, who is now 7, has not seen his father since.  The father has been continuously attempting to maintain his relationship with A since the date of the parents' separation in 2005, but from his point of view his son has now simply disappeared.  He does not know where he lives, or even what he looks like.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The withholding of information about a child's whereabouts by the state from a parent is a flagrant interference with the mutual right to respect for family life as between the parent and the child.  There could hardly be a more obvious departure from the positive obligation upon the state to promote contact between family members.  There will undoubtedly be cases where this measure will be necessary and proportionate, but such cases are highly exceptional, and will typically involve a risk of maximum severity, such as a risk to life or other very serious harm.  Where the risk exists, its extent must be demonstrated by evidence.  In the present case, it is at least highly doubtful whether that threshold could be established, particularly when no proper assessment of risk has ever been attempted since the child's arrival in Germany.  When the same relevant facts were assessed by the High Court in England, they fell far short of anything that might justify the total elimination of the father from A&#8217;s life and consciousness.  On the contrary, the English court considered A&#8217;s welfare to require positive orders for supervised contact, and such contact was in fact taking place at the time of the abduction.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Following A&#8217;s removal to Germany, which took place in the middle of a court hearing in England, the father immediately invoked the procedures under the Hague Convention 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction ("the Hague Convention").  In January 2009, the German court declined under Article 13 to order A&#8217;s return to England, that decision being upheld on appeal in April 2009.  </span></p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">In July 2009, the father brought these proceedings under Article 11(7) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (&#8220;Brussels II Revised&#8221; or &#8220;BIIR&#8221;).  Article 11, entitled "Return of the child", applies in cases involving Member States where a return under the Hague Convention has been refused under Article 13 of that convention.  Paragraph 11(6) of BIIR requires a court that has not ordered the return of the child under Article 13 to transmit a copy of its order to the state of the child's prior habitual residence within a month of its decision, a step duly taken by the German court in this case.  Under paragraph 11(7) the parties are then entitled to make submissions to the court within three months of the date of notification </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">"so that the court can examine the question of custody of the child".</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">  In this context, custody includes issues of return, residence and contact.  Under paragraph 11(8), an order for return to the state of habitual residence may be made and is directly enforceable under Article 42 in the state to which the child has been taken.  An order for access can also be made, and is again directly enforceable under Article 41.  In each case, enforceability arises from the issuing of a certificate in the Member State of origin.</span></p>

It is implicit in the regulation that this should take place in a timely way.  The reason why that has not happened, and why the information before the court is so limited, appears below.  </span></p>

At the end of the hearing in May 2006, Mr Justice Bennett ordered the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) to file a report and make recommendations as to how contact should resume.  The case was allocated to one of its most experienced officers, who arranged for two occasions of contact in November 2006.  He found that it was a positive experience for A and recommended that more contact should take place.  An order was made on 8 December 2006 that the father should have an occasion of contact in the presence of the CAFCASS officer in January 2007 and thereafter fortnightly supervised contact at the Coram Contact Centre for a period of four months.  The first two occasions took place, but there was then a delay while the father was placed on a waiting list.  On 16 July 2007, Mr Justice Bennett himself ordered that there should be fortnightly contact for one hour supervised by the Coram Contact Centre.  Fortnightly contact then took place until October 2007.</span></p>

If the Court decides that supervision of any sort is not required the mechanics of contact would be that much easier to facilitate whether contact be in Germany or in England.

Contact between the Applicant and A has taken place to only an absolute minimal extent over the past years and the child has no contact persons in Great Britain.  There is no attachment to the father; according to the observations of the district court, A did not even recognise his father initially at the official hearing before the presentation of numerous gifts.  In these circumstances, A&#8217;s return without his mother does not come into consideration.  Rather, the Senate shares the view of the district court that the change of environment associated with a return would represent a massive break for the child due to continuous care from the mother in the past years and taking into consideration the child's age, his specific situation in life and also the good integration he has just achieved in Germany.  This break cannot be justified by reasons of the child's well-being.</span></p>

According to the observations made by the district court, the accuracy of which there is no reason to doubt, as opposed to the Applicant&#8217;s ideas related to this, the Respondent is considerably traumatised.  In the presence of the Applicant she is not in a position to articulate herself, despite the attendance and support of other persons in the courtroom.  She evidently has an immense fear of the Applicant and weeps continually and inconsolably in his presence.  The Family Judge of the district court, known to the Senate as thoroughly experienced, particularly in [Hague Convention] proceedings, has certified the Respondent ... as having been incapable of acting with legally binding effect in the Applicant&#8217;s presence, despite the support of her lawyer and a social worker from the social services of Catholic women; the Respondent reportedly had to leave the hearing room and a renewed attempt to participate in the hearing was not possible for her.  The extraordinary psychological state of the Respondent can be explained, in the conviction of the Senate, by the physical abuse she has had to suffer, which has not been substantially disputed by the Applicant and the core truth of which he has even expressly admitted ... The Respondent's considerable and sustained traumatisation, which, in the conviction of the Senate, can be definitively traced back to the Applicant's behaviour, does not allow her to accompany A in the event of an order that he return to England.  Indeed, this is also the case even if, as the Senate presumes, the English authorities take all the necessary protective measures conceivable for the benefit of the Respondent.&#8221;</span></p>

The matter came before Mr Justice Singer prior to his retirement on five consecutive occasions between November 2009 and July 2010.  No judge had a deeper appreciation of the issues arising in international cases, or was more active and imaginative in pursuing solutions for the benefit of children, but even his interventions produced little by way of dividend.  It is now clear that the individual orders, designed to be fair to the mother and to take account of the child's situation, have collectively failed to achieve the purpose for which Article 11 BIIR was devised.    </span></p>

However, she emphasises that in the light of the inability to carry out a welfare assessment, the Guardian must remain neutral as to the order that the court should make.  In other words, the Guardian neither supported nor opposed the contact order proposed on behalf of the father, which was that there should be "at least six occasions" of supervised contact annually.  To that extent, the Guardian's final submission is at variance with the positive recommendation that this court should make no order.  </span></p>

Nonetheless, I was able to engage Ms Carew in a useful, if inevitably tentative, consideration of the welfare issues that might be said to arise in these unusual circumstances.  </span></p>

There will come a point where by virtue of the lapse of time the court in the state of origin may consider it inappropriate to make any order at all.  In this case, if there was any sign that the issues raised by this application could be reliably resolved in Germany, this court would almost certainly decline to make any order after such a lapse in time.  However, the practical reality is that the father is now faced with almost insuperable difficulties, and further significant delay, in starting proceedings in Germany to revive his prior relationship with his son.  </span></p>

On the contrary, the maintenance of such relationships in some shape or form is intrinsic to the purpose of both the Hague convention and BIIR, quite apart from the obligations arising under the European Convention on Human Rights.  </span></p>

Making no order would almost inevitably lead to the irretrievable loss of the relationship between A and his father.  If this court allowed that to happen it would not in my view be meeting its obligations under Article 8 ECHR.  </span></p>

It is not at all inappropriate for the father to have brought presents for his son, and the insinuation that A&#8217;s pleasure in seeing his father was limited to such material considerations is groundless.  A&#8217;s present wishes and feelings are likely to be that he is not missing his father because he is entirely dependent upon his mother and is not aware of what a renewed relationship with his father might mean to him.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The father's ability to meet A&#8217;s needs amounts on the present information to an ability to do so through contact rather than primary care.  The mother plainly has the ability to meet his needs as his primary carer, but her ability to meet this need for a relationship with his father is in question.  She is plainly unwilling, but it is not clear that she is unable.  Her previous opposition to any form of contact was not upheld by the English court, and it is impossible to evaluate the genuineness of her dramatic presentation to the German court in the absence of proper assessment.  The father's case is that her behaviour in December 2008 was put on and it is not possible to know whether he is right.  The evidence from England suggests that the mother was able to function as A&#8217;s carer and sustain some level of contact with the father.  There is also an unexplained discrepancy between her ability to participate in English proceedings in April 2008 and her inability to participate in German proceedings at the end of the same year, although the only intervening event was her own abduction of the child.  Nor is it possible to rely on the mother's self-report.  Mr Justice Bennett, who had, in his own words, "been able to observe closely the father and the mother give evidence", consisting also of cross-examination, did not find her to be a reliable witness in all respects, even though he preferred her evidence to that of the father on several important issues.</span></p>

The concept of harm includes harm arising from witnessing the ill-treatment of another.  The father's controlling and sporadically violent behaviour deserves the strongest condemnation, but its nature and degree did not lead to a contemporaneous conclusion that contact should not be taking place or that the mother was incapable of supporting it.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">As to future harm, there is no reliable evidence that the father represents an ongoing physical threat to the mother.  There has been no report of any such behaviour by him since the separation in November 2005.  There is certainly no indication of any risk of maximum severity, such as a risk to life or other very serious harm.  Nor is there any reliable evidence to support the idea that he might abduct A.  He has taken no improper steps in Germany to find out where the mother is living.  The suggestion that he might take A to Jordan is implausible.  He has lived a fully integrated life in England for over 30 years.  It should not be forgotten that the only unilateral removals of A from country to country have been by the mother.</span></p>

The making of an order will no doubt be unwelcome to the mother but, important though they are, her rights are not the only ones that are engaged, and there is no reason to believe that A&#8217;s situation will be seriously destabilised.  On the other hand, a contact order might conceivably bring about some beneficial progress.  I realise that this will depend upon the degree of resolution of the German authorities.  I also acknowledge that in the face of limited information the court&#8217;s prescription is bound to be approximate; accordingly, if the German authorities consider that the order would benefit from modification, they shall have liberty to apply.  </span></p>
