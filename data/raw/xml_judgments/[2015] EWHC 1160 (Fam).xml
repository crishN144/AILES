	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my judgment in the application for summary return to the United States of America of a seven year old girl, J. Until recently, it had seemed that the respondent, the mother, would seek to defend on the basis that (a) J has been habitually resident here since last September; (b) the father had consented to and also acquiesced in the removal; (c) there would be grave risk of psychological harm to the child or that she would be placed in an intolerable situation in the event of a return; and also (d) the child objected to going back. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The defence of &#8216;acquiescence&#8217; was, so I&#8217;m told, abandoned last week at the pre-trial review. The suggestion that the removal was anything other than unlawful was conceded within email correspondence between Counsel on the day before the hearing &#8211; a concession which was inevitable given the expert advice proffered by Karl Hays of the Texas Bar on 13 April 2015.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, at the beginning of the hearing yesterday, it seemed that the mother was relying upon Article 13A &#8216;consent,&#8217; Article 13B &#8216;grave risk &#8230;&#8217; and &#8216;child&#8217;s objections.&#8217; Consequent upon the oral evidence of Alicia Northcutt of the Cafcass High Court Team, Ms Clare Renton expressly conceded, as was again inevitable, that her client would not be able to sustain a &#8216;child&#8217;s objections&#8217; exception; and thus that limb of the various defences was also withdrawn from consideration.</p>

		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:0.33in;text-indent:0.17in">Consent to the removal of the child must be clear and unequivocal.&#160; <br/>(2)&#160; Consent can be given to the removal at some future but unspecified time or upon the happening of some future event.&#160; <br/>(3)&#160; Such advance consent must, however, still be operative and in force at the time of the actual removal.<br/>(4)&#160; The happening of the future event must be reasonably capable of ascertainment.&#160; The condition must not have been expressed in terms which are too vague or uncertain for both parties to know whether the condition will be fulfilled.&#160; Fulfillment of the condition must not depend on the subjective determination of one party, for example, &#8220;Whatever you may think, I have concluded that the marriage has broken down and so I am free to leave with the child.&#8221;&#160; The event must be objectively verifiable.&#160; <br/>(5)&#160; Consent, or the lack of it, must be viewed in the context of the realities of family life, or more precisely, in the context of the realities of the disintegration of family life.&#160; It is not to be viewed in the context of, nor governed by, the law of contract.<br/>(6)&#160; Consequently consent can be withdrawn at any time before actual removal.&#160; If it is, the proper course is for any dispute about removal to be resolved by the courts of the country of habitual residence before the child is removed.&#160; <br/>(7)&#160; The burden of proving the consent rests on him or her who asserts it.<br/>(8)&#160; The enquiry is inevitably fact specific and the facts and circumstances will vary infinitely from case to case.<br/>(9)&#160; The ultimate question is a simple one even if a multitude of facts bear upon the answer.&#160; It is simply this: had the other parent clearly and unequivocally consented to the removal?</p>

The risk to the child must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as &#8216;grave.&#8217; A relatively low risk of death or serious injury might properly be qualified as &#8216;grave&#8217; whereas a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm.</p>

In April 2009, a very detailed order was made appointing the parents &#8220;Joint Managing Conservators&#8221; of J.

If the mother were to fail to meet her share of the flights then J would remain with him in Texas. He further proposed that child support would cease on J&#8217;s departure but that he would send monies at his discretion for day to day expenses.

There were conditions or clauses though about J travelling back to Texas for visitation and his stipulation that the mother should pay half the air fares. If she failed to meet her side of the bargain, then the father was clearly contending that J should remain with him in Texas post visitation.</p>

Nor, so she believed, would any court or any judge. The father&#8217;s fundamental position was that he would not consent to J being exposed to poverty in England; he wanted the mother to test the water before J would travel to join her. He said in terms that J should remain in the meanwhile with him in Texas. He also said he wanted to set a date of January 2015 for them to be gone. The mother seemingly assented by saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">OK</span>.&#8221; There was no further discussion or negotiation between the parents thereafter, so far as I&#8217;m aware, about the terms of any proposed relocation. </p>

On her case, she realized she had to tell the father &#8220;within five days as per the order.&#8221; As it turned out, he was given no notice at all and was thereby denied the opportunity of taking any preventative action.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am bound to say that I can see no proper justification for proceeding in the manner suggested by Ms Renton. Judges in this jurisdiction must be entitled to accept in good faith solemn undertakings given after advice proffered by specialist Solicitors and Counsel.  I have deliberately related the detail of those matters to which the father has already given his commitment so that anyone reading this judgment will know the position. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no suggestion that J should return to the USA with anyone other than her mother. J has, as Ms Northcutt said in evidence, a very strong attachment to her mother; and the presence of her mother will be a great comfort and reassurance. The matter which has caused J most anxiety, according to Ms Northcutt, surrounded something she had overheard about her mother going to jail if she returned to Texas. When J had spoken of Texas &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">outside of that</span>&#8221; said Ms Northcutt, she had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">spoken very positively</span>.&#8221; J said she had spent time on holiday with her father and enjoyed those times. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Northcutt carried out her assessment, so it seems to me, with great sensitivity and understanding. Her written report relates that in her view J has positive experiences of living in the UK and the USA. J&#8217;s ideal situation would be to live in both countries. When J first arrived at her school, she found it difficult to settle and was missing her friends in Texas. Doubtless, to some extent, J will find it unsettling to go back to the USA but so long as the mother heeds her daughter&#8217;s need for places and people already known and familiar to her, there should be no undue difficulty.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The undertakings offered by the father will form a crucial part of the protective measures so as to avoid for J the risk of any harm. There is nothing which causes me to conclude there is any situation awaiting this child in the USA which could be described as intolerable.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I conclude there is no proper basis for claiming either that J would be at grave risk of psychological or physical harm or that she would be placed in an intolerable situation if a return order is made. She will go back with her mother, either with or without her older sister should the mother choose to leave her here. Her mother&#8217;s presence will provide J with much needed security. The father will once more play an important part in her life by spending appreciable periods of time with J.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the avoidance of doubt, and even although Ms Renton&#8217;s oral submissions did not touch upon the potential for the mother to leave her older daughter in England, I should say I reject the argument that J would be at grave risk of harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation if she returns without her sibling. The mother has a choice &#8211; either to keep the family unit together or cause it to fragment. It strikes me as singularly unattractive to suggest that J would suffer because of the potential for the mother&#8217;s own decision to separate the girls. Against the background of Ms Northcutt&#8217;s oral evidence it becomes straightforward to dispatch the claim anyway.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am impelled to the view that the mother has sought to deploy every conceivable weapon in her armoury in her bid to avoid a return. In the end result, none has succeeded. At one stage, Ms Renton described this as a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">very complex case.</span>&#8221; I do not share that assessment. J&#8217;s removal from the State of Texas was unlawful. There is no sustainable basis on the evidence for establishing either, or indeed any, of the exceptions to a mandatory return. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If it had been necessary to exercise my discretion because an exception had been established, then I should have gone on, almost certainly, to order summary return. In that scenario, there would have been significant Convention reasons for making the order as sought by the father and nothing of any substance in terms of J&#8217;s welfare to have deflected me from that course.</p>
