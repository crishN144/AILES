Secondly, the relevant evidence, action, statement or concealment (performed with conscious and deliberate dishonesty) must be &#8220;material&#8221;. &#8220;Material&#8221; means that the fresh evidence that is adduced after the first judgment has been given is such that it demonstrates that the previous relevant evidence, action, statement or concealment was an operative cause of the court&#8217;s decision to give judgment in the way that it did. Put another way, it must be shown that the fresh evidence would have entirely changed the way in which the first court approached and came to its decision. Thus, the relevant conscious and deliberate dishonesty must be causative of the impugned judgment being obtained in the terms it was. Thirdly, the question of materiality of the fresh evidence is to be assessed by reference to its impact on the evidence supporting the original decision, not by reference to its impact on what decision might be made if the claim were to be retried on honest evidence.</p>

The first condition is that the new events have occurred since the making of the order which invalidate the basis, or fundamental assumption, on which the order was made, so that if, leave to appeal out of time were to be given, the appeal would be certain or very likely to succeed. The second condition is that the new events should have occurred within a relatively short time of the order having been made. While the length of time cannot be laid down precisely, I should regard it as extremely unlikely that it could be as much as a year, and that in most cases it will be no more than a few months. The third condition is that the application [for leave to appeal out of time] should be made reasonably promptly in the circumstances of the case. To these three conditions, which can be seen from the authorities as requiring to be satisfied, I would add a fourth, which it does appear has needed to be considered so far, but which it may be necessary to consider in future cases. The fourth condition is that the grant of leave to appeal out of time should not prejudice third parties who have acquired, in good faith and for valuable consideration, interests in property which is the subject matter of the relevant order.&#8221;</p>

The target set for revenue had not been met and, as the accounts subsequently demonstrated, the company made a loss of &#163;186,509 that financial year. In June 2017, I accept that it became obvious that, due to the lack of cash reserves, the company would not be able to meet its wage bill and senior members of staff were asked to defer payment for 3 months. This cash flow crisis was not novel, having previously occurred in both 2014 and 2015 because of the cyclical nature of the company&#8217;s income in the nature of annual subscriptions and the impact of market competition, but I accept that this was a matter of genuine concern for the directors, not least in the light of their fiduciary duties as company officers.</span></p>

Mr M had already expressed an interest in ABC Ltd in 2013 when the husband, Mr E and CH2 had had a meeting with him, and NDAs had been exchanged. The husband confirms that during the meeting on 14 March 2017, Mr M expressed a continuing interest in discussions with a view to NO acquiring an interest in ABC Ltd. Following the meeting on 14 March 2017, the husband wrote to Mr M as follows: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">many thanks for your time yesterday and our open discussion. I am circling round with certain stakeholders (informally of course) and will revert&#8217;. </span><span style="font-size:12pt">It is the husband&#8217;s case that this was &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">just a cover for doing nothing whilst appearing interested&#8217; </span><span style="font-size:12pt">and that the meeting was no more than &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">the usual run of events</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;. On 16 March 2017, Mr M responded stating &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">We would be delighted to engage with you </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">when you are ready</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; (emphasis added). Mr Southgate asked the husband what this meant, specifically whether the reference &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">when you are ready&#8217; </span><span style="font-size:12pt">related to the divorce. The husband responded that this had been part of it but that it had also related to the fact that the price would have been very low at the time because of the poor state of the business. He accepted that he had not disclosed the fact of this meeting to the wife or her legal team. He accepted that had this meeting taken place before or whilst the single joint expert was preparing her report, he would have felt it necessary to tell her about it. He was challenged as to why, in the light of this, he had not informed the wife&#8217;s team. He explained his understanding was that the evidence had closed, in accordance with the order of 16 December 2016. This meant, he thought, that &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">all matters relating to the divorce were put in a box and were frozen</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; or words to that effect. In the circumstances, he had not considered that he was under any duty to make further disclosure, or that he would have considered it necessary to report such a standard conversation to the court, particularly when NO&#8217;s model was, in any event, to acquire small equity stakes. Later, on 10 April 2017, the husband sent another email to Mr M in which he confirmed that there was interest in preliminary discussions and that he would send an NDA. In his witness statement he describes this email as &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">another cover phrase which meant nothing</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; and explains that no NDA was ever sent. During cross-examination he said that he had just been &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">keeping them warm</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;. In his narrative statement, he described the email as purely a &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">courtesy email</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;.</span></p>

Instead, he stated that the question was whether Mr M, who had later said that ABC Ltd was too small, was in fact waiting to hear from him and that the context had been the possibility of a fire sale. I remind myself that the email from Mr M was sent in March 2017 and note the husband&#8217;s use of the words &#8216;fire sale&#8217; referring to such an early stage. Mr E and indeed Mr D&#8217;s references in their witness statements refer to the possibility of a fire sale arising in June 2017, not in March.</span></p>

He did not disclose this fact. Nor were the shareholders informed of the mandate with IL, although as the husband accepted, some of the shareholders knew that there had been approaches.

This had not been disclosed to the wife or referred to in the closing submissions made on 11 May 2017, or as I understand it, to the single joint expert, although it seems unlikely that this had happened before her final addendum report. I have already referred to the husband&#8217;s mention of Mr M in this email to Mr F. He also stated that he had tried to meet with XY before he had left the UK two weeks earlier but, although XY had wanted to meet, they had not been able to find a mutually convenient time. This, too, was not disclosed to the wife. This approach was significant because the husband had previously met with XY in 2013. They had expressed an interest in buying ABC Ltd and had suggested a multiplier of 4/5. The husband accepted that he had not told Jenny Nelder about this, stating that he did not agree that she needed to know what had been said in 2013.</span></p>

Mr F explains that initially the husband was not keen on him approaching interested parties immediately. On 2 July 2017, Mr F sent an email to NO to inform them that he had been appointed, but it led to nothing. There was then a hiatus until late August. On 22 August 2017, Mr F wrote to the husband &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">with plenty happening on the M&amp;A front to help us I suggest we hit the track running in September</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; and the husband replied that there had been &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">developments which impact upon timing</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;. In early September the husband was approached by GH Ltd. On 20 September Mr F &#8216;started a process&#8217; with another company. In early October 2017, GH Ltd expressed an interest to purchase ABC Ltd. On 10 October 2017, Mr F recommended dipping a toe in the water with the key parties (naming 9 including GH Ltd) &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">on the basis that you have had an approach i.e. you are not for sale as such, just responding to market forces.&#8217; </span><span style="font-size:12pt">I do not interpret this as undermining of an intention to sell, rather it was marketing strategy, just as Mr F advised (in the same email) that very little information should be released because otherwise this would show that ABC Ltd had prepared for the conversations in advance and just as he advised the husband on 17 October 2017 &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">suggest you say [to GH Ltd] you have retained Mr F at IL to complete a Review of Options&#8230;</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;. NDAs were sent to GH Ltd and the second company in January 2018. By May 2018 an offer had been made of &#163;9.5m. In June 2018, the month after CH3&#8217;s shares had been transferred, the Information Memorandum was released. This was the beginning of the formal sale process. By August 2018 there were three competing bidders and GH Ltd&#8217;s offer was accepted on 24 August. This was some thirteen months after the final order had been approved.</span></p>

Coinciding with the company&#8217;s financial difficulties, according to the husband (I frame it in this way because Ms R has not been heard in these proceedings), in the Spring of 2017, it was discovered that Ms R (on behalf of a competitor) had been meeting with ABC Ltd&#8217;s clients. On 3 May 2017, the husband wrote to Ms R on behalf of the company, confirming that her actions placed her in breach of the Shareholders&#8217; Agreement and that as a defaulting shareholder she was deemed by the company to have served a transfer notice in respect of her shares. This was denied by Ms R, who declined to sign the transfer agreement and threatened legal proceedings. The Shareholders&#8217; Agreement as drafted did not include provisions to deal with &#8216;bad leavers&#8217; or to enforce provisions against defaulting shareholders absent litigation.</span></p>

Indeed, I ask myself why they would have done, given the pecuniary benefit they stood to gain (the original purpose of the gift having been to help them pay off student debt). When Mr Southgate asked the husband about this, he responded that he could not speak for the children, and he could not speculate. He went on to do just that, saying &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">maybe they would prefer to damage their father than receive any money, look at their letter to the judge</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;. The fact is that the children did not even know about the possibility of a sale (at any stage) because they were never told. It is not difficult to assume that, had they been informed of the plans, they would have responded differently. It is of note that other shareholders </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">were </span><span style="font-size:12pt">told. On 12 October 2017, the husband wrote to Ms B , informing her that the company was &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">looking at a sale</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; and was &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">likely to be tipping toe in water via advisor in coming weeks</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;. He could as easily have told the children and I ask myself why he did not. The husband&#8217;s account, that he was worried that the children might seek to obstruct a sale, corroborates, however, the suggestion that he had a sale in mind. In early October 2017, a conference with counsel had been arranged (albeit postponed). The purpose of this was to achieve, with the benefit of legal advice, what had been unsuccessfully attempted in June.</span></p>

I do accept that he may not, at any of these snapshots of time, have formed a settled intention immediately to sell ABC Ltd, not least because he would, understandably, have wished to ensure that any sale took place at a time which assured a maximum return. I also recognise that the company&#8217;s cashflow difficulties were the cause of significant concern for the husband and his fellow board members, particularly in June 2017 (I have found no such contemporaneous evidence relating to March 2017). Whilst Mr E and Mr D may have been operating on the premise that it was necessary to ready the business to cover the eventuality of a fire sale, I find as a fact, on the balance of probabilities, that even before the judgment was handed down on 15 June 2017, the possibility of a sale was very much on the husband&#8217;s mind and that he had firmed up his resolve before the final order was sealed. I reject his assertions that his engagement in a number of meetings and conversations were just &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">part of normal good business practice</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; and that the purpose of the introductory correspondence with Mr F in March 2017 and the meeting with him in May 2017 was limited to seeking assistance about the recruitment of staff and more general advice as to the company&#8217;s options. The evidence simply does not support this, and it goes to the state of the husband&#8217;s mind.  IL&#8217;s business is mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, the husband&#8217;s email of 26 June 2017 to Mr F, effectively referring back to his dealings with Mr M (and his email to Mr M of 10 April 2017), is clear proof, in my judgement, that the husband was awaiting the judgment (and the conclusion of the proceedings) before taking further action. His assertion that his emails to Mr M were courtesy emails intended to keep Mr M &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">warm</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; was an attempt deliberately to mislead the court. I accept that board approval of the mandate to IL and its subsequent signing a) followed the judgment and the husband&#8217;s reaction to it; and b) did not mean that a sale was inevitable, but I find that the seeds were sown by the husband well before this and the judgment and the cashflow difficulties in June 2017 merely confirmed his thoughts. Thereafter, the ensuing communications with interested parties and Mr F form part, in my judgement, of a clear continuum. The process did not end when the cashflow crisis had been averted. The fact that the actual sale did not take place until October 2018 is not surprising. There were governance issues the company was dealing with (to which I shall return) and in terms of the sale of a company, I do not consider a period of 15 months (it was 13 months to the acceptance of the offer) following the sealing of the final order to be a long time. Moreover, as I have stated, I find that the sale process was held up by the husband&#8217;s desire to resolve the situation with the children&#8217;s shareholding.</span></p>

The husband&#8217;s case at final hearing had been firmly based on illiquidity because of the inability to sell the Company (now undermined by the husband&#8217;s email to Mr F of 10 July 2017 and his subsequent conversation on or about 22 August 2017). I find that likely to have been misleading. His Honour Judge Everall found that the husband had no intention to sell for the next few years. His approach to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Wells </span><span style="font-size:12pt">sharing must be seen in that context.

It is a long time ago now, but at the relevant time it had only been a few months earlier that the parties had given evidence in highly contentious proceedings, in December 2016. One of the major issues the husband will have been cross examined about was the liquidity of his shareholding in ABC Ltd and his future intentions. Later, he must have approved counsel&#8217;s closing submissions for the hearing on 11 May 2017, in which the same points about liquidity were again forcefully made. He knew, when he appeared before His Honour Judge Everall on 11 May 2017, that (i) he had been in discussion with Mr M and he had told Mr M that the divorce judgment was relevant to his ability to sell; (ii) he had been in correspondence with and had met Mr F; and (iii) in all likelihood, he had met with VW and TU. He chose to say nothing of any of this. Interestingly, no reference is made to dire cash flow issues in counsel&#8217;s note for 11 May. I do not say this to underplay what was later the case in June 2017, but to draw attention to the situation between March and May 2017 at a time when the husband was engaging with Mr F and others. Thereafter, it is inconceivable, in my judgement, that the husband did not give thought to, and conclude, that the signing of the mandate was highly material and disclosable.</span></p>

In fact, Mr D accepted in evidence that they should have been told of the mandate or at the least that it would have been wise to have done so. The husband chose to tell other shareholders. I have asked myself whether he did not tell the children simply because he was so angry and upset with them following their letter to the Judge. I am sure that played a part. The husband says that his email to Ms Z on 18 June 2017, in which he stated that their actions &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">can never be forgiven and forgotten</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; was &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">an outpouring of emotion</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;. The situation is very sad, and this may well be true, but this email was not written in the immediate aftermath of the hearing, it was 7 months later. During this period the husband was taking steps (unsuccessfully) to amend the Shareholders&#8217; Agreement. I draw the inference that one of the reasons why the husband did not tell the children of the mandate (and all later developments prior to March 2018) was because had he done so, the news would inevitably have been passed on to the wife. I find that the husband did not want this to happen. This lends further corroboration to my finding that the husband knew that he remained under a duty to disclose. Finally, in this regard, I find that, later, when the husband sought to extract a &#8216;waiver of rights&#8217; from the wife as the price for payment of the lump sum in the course of the enforcement proceedings, he did so in the knowledge that he had suppressed material information.</span></p>

Certainly, at the final hearing the husband stated that he had no intention of acquiring the children&#8217;s shares. The children&#8217;s letter had only been received at the beginning of the final hearing and so will only have been within the husband&#8217;s knowledge for a matter of days. Before then, of course, the husband was also angry with the children for disclosing Company information to the wife during the proceedings. I have considered the husband&#8217;s use of the word &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">personally&#8217; </span><span style="font-size:12pt">in his evidence, but I am not satisfied that I should attach any weight to this. To conclude that the husband was culpable of material misrepresentation in respect of the children&#8217;s shareholding, I would have to find, on the balance of probabilities, that the husband had, in December 2016, the intention to bring about the transfer of the children&#8217;s shareholding. Although very finely balanced, I find myself unable to draw the inference, even when looking at the events which followed, that the husband had made the conscious decision to acquire the children&#8217;s shareholdings by the time he gave his evidence. It was not until seven months later, in June 2017 that steps were taken to amend the Shareholders&#8217; Agreement. I have found the whole process leading to the transfer notices in March and May 2018 unedifying and unattractive, but that is not the test. I have little doubt that the children were treated by the husband differently from other shareholders, although two other shareholders lost their shares in the process (Ms Z and Ms C). An example of this occurred in December 2017, when the husband wrote to other shareholders urging them to vote and offering to update them (in person) on the &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">current and possible future position of the company</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;. I have no doubt that he was referring to a possible sale (he signs off &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">2018 ... promises to be an exciting year!</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;). I have little doubt, too, that in 2017-18, the husband&#8217;s approach was tactical, motivated to ensure that the children&#8217;s shareholdings were transferred, in part because of his anger and upset &#8211; he had been angered by the disclosure of company documents to the wife, the children&#8217;s actions had significantly threatened his presentation of illiquidity at trial and it is clear that they had &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">sided</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; with their mother &#8211; and in part because if the children were no longer shareholders they would no longer be privy to details about the sale of ABC Ltd. The strength of his feeling is demonstrated by his email to Ms Z on 18 June 2017. Mr Warshaw and Ms Max submit that the wife&#8217;s case that the husband laid a deliberate trap for the children is a case of her shoe-horning events into her own narrative. However, I am satisfied that the husband did hope to achieve the transfer of the children&#8217;s shareholding and that he was biding his time. I have already referred to his email of 12 June 2017 and I ask myself why he would be discussing a mechanism to recover their shares and why could it only be done after the divorce. The fact that various options in this regard were being considered is also clear from the Husband&#8217;s email to Mr F of 10 July 2017. I accept the submission that &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">increasing the share capital would dilute shareholdings and could change the voting power depending on into whose hands the new shares fall. This was intended to prompt the children to refuse to agree to an increase in the authorised share capital. If the children had not responded at all then the husband hoped to be able to have deemed that a refusal. And they had only 48 hours to consider this</span><span style="font-size:12pt">.&#8217;</span></p>

The children have not pursued litigation themselves in the Chancery Division. In making findings in respect of the husband&#8217;s state of mind, I wish to make clear that I do not impugn the actions of other board members. It is not necessary for me to find that they shared the husband&#8217;s intentions and, in any event, much of their information about the children is likely to have come from the husband.</span></p>

I have since received a request for clarification from Ms Max (to confirm that the net proceeds of sale of ABC Ltd attributable to the children&#8217;s shareholding acquired by the husband should be excluded from any lump sum payable) and subsequently a response from Mr Southgate, both giving me cause to reflect further on the issue.

As Mr Southgate reminds me, I have found (at paragraph 115 above) that &#8216;by 12 June 2017 at the latest, the husband had a settled desire to take steps to &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">recover&#8217; </span><span style="font-size:12pt">the children&#8217;s shareholding and was biding his time until the financial proceedings had concluded&#8217;. I had rejected this distinct limb of the wife&#8217;s claim purely on the basis that the success or otherwise of the husband&#8217;s &#8216;plan&#8217; was &#8216;an unknown&#8217;. Having determined that the final order should be set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosure in respect of the sale of ABC Ltd, on reflection I consider it was not necessary then separately to determine each pleaded element of the wife&#8217;s case. However, for the avoidance of doubt, the fact that the husband&#8217;s &#8216;plan&#8217; had not yet come to fruition when the final order was sealed does not mean that the profit which he ultimately achieved should be disregarded. I remind myself of his email dated 12 June 2017: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">There is a mechanism to recover their shares (which will be good for other shareholders), but it can&#8217;t be done until the divorce is over</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; and ask myself whether, had it been disclosed that the husband had formulated and embarked on a plan to recover the children&#8217;s shares, that fact would have been considered material to the wife and the court. Having reconsidered the issue, I find that it would. It would be unjust, in my judgement, to exclude the sum received by the husband by virtue of his acquisition of some part of the children&#8217;s shareholding simply because as at 12 June 2017 it was not clear whether the plan would succeed, particularly in circumstances where the husband was plainly confident that it would and, indeed, it did.</span></p>

She enjoys a very close relationship with the children, and it is inherently unlikely that they would not have told her. Equally, it was entirely foreseeable that some of those shares would have been allocated to the husband once they had transferred, thereby increasing his interest in the company. I accept Mr Warshaw and Ms Max&#8217;s submission that the wife did not act with reasonable promptitude in making an application to set aside. In the draft judgment I had found that the wife&#8217;s claim under this head failed because of this lack of promptitude in bringing the application. Following the clarification sought on behalf of the husband, I have given further thought to this issue too. Had this been the only limb of the wife&#8217;s case, the answer would have been straightforward. However, given that the wife has succeeded in her application to set aside the final order, it would, in my judgement be artificial and unjust to separate out the benefit the husband has received from his acquisition of some of the children&#8217;s shareholding.</span></p>

It might be said that I am conflating the issues, but I find myself unable to divorce the two and they lead to the same result. It was a fundamental assumption of the order of His Honour Judge Everall, when rejecting a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Wells </span><span style="font-size:12pt">approach, that the Company was not going to be put up for sale until the husband&#8217;s retirement in about five years&#8217; time, although of course I accept that it would have been open to the husband to change his mind in the intervening period five- year period. I have found, however, that this was not a case of the husband simply changing his mind but, instead, that he actively entertained the prospect of a sale whilst the proceedings were ongoing (for all the reasons I have already stated). Indeed, I find it likely that his reliance on illiquidity at final hearing was, of itself, misleading. By October 2017, only 3 months after the final order, the prospect of sale (if not the formal process) was gathering significant momentum, particularly following the meeting between the husband and Ms R of GH Ltd in early October. By January 2018, the picture was looking promising. By May, an offer of &#163;9.5m had been received. By June, it was clear that there would be competing bids. The fact that the offer was only accepted the following August and the deal was only signed the following October, is not, in my judgement, determinative. I am conscious of the observations of Lord Brandon as to the timing of a new event, but the length of time between the making of a final order and the occurrence of a new event must surely be specific to the event itself. 15 months between the making of a final order and the sale of a Company is not, of itself, inordinately long given all that it entails (including due diligence). In any event, I consider it necessary to consider what was happening within the period building up to the sale and not just the sale itself and included within that must be the ongoing process of amendment to the Articles of Association.</span></p>

The husband&#8217;s response was dilatory and unhelpful. He failed to attend the enforcement hearing in January 2019.

For the purposes of this exercise, I accept it at face value. The CEO resigned and on 1 October 2017 the husband took her place. He committed to working at ABC Ltd full time. Over the following 12 months, the husband oversaw the finalisation and release of new products and supported and supervised the sales force. The single joint expert had already recorded the Board&#8217;s optimism with regard to the potential for the extension of products. In June 2017, the Company began a roll out of a new product, and, over time, undertook a re-development of its software. By the time of the Initial Information Document in June 2018, the forecast for turnover had almost doubled. Mr E explains that the Company prospered with the husband at the helm.</span></p>

Although it was H&#8217;s case at final hearing that there was a potential liability in excess of &#163;800,000, no further APNs have been raised despite the passage of 4 years since the 2017 hearing. H has paid the APNs which were known about at that hearing but has not provided documentary evidence</span></p>

The HMRC challenge has not yet been determined and it is obvious that this will not happen within the foreseeable future. I can see no reason to go behind His Honour Judge Everall QC&#8217;s finding, at paragraph 101, that H was confident the challenge would succeed. I have given careful thought as to whether any part of W&#8217;s balancing lump sum should be paid into an escrow account to cover the eventuality that the challenge fails. On balance, however, in my judgement it is overwhelmingly clear that the parties&#8217; financial ties should be entirely severed without further delay. Nor do I have confidence that H will be transparent in this regard in the future.</p>

His Honour Judge Everall QC found H&#8217;s earning capacity to be &#163;350,000 per annum in private practice. It is argued that from October 2017, H devoted himself to ABC Ltd for a consultancy fee of &#163;120,000. This reduction in H&#8217;s income, it is argued, supports the earlier cessation of maintenance, particularly in circumstances where his endeavours contributed significantly to the enhanced value of the company on sale. I recognise that there is an arguable case that H will effectively have been paying maintenance from capital since October 2018 when ABC Ltd was sold at the latest (and probably earlier).</span></p>

However, H is, I consider, the author of his own misfortune. He did not apply for a reduction in maintenance after he had committed himself to ABC Ltd or indeed in the ensuing 12 months and the most likely reason for that, I find, is because he was at all material times seeking to hide from W the intended sale of the company. Moreover, it has been open to him, throughout the period since W began enforcement proceedings, to rectify the position by acceding to the principle of W&#8217;s claim and engaging in negotiations as to the appropriate balancing lump sum. He has chosen not to do so. In these circumstances it would be inequitable to allow H to benefit from his dishonesty.</span></p>
