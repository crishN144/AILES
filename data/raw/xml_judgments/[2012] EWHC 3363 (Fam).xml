The first point is that the expression &#8216;habitually resident&#8217;, as used in Art. 3 of the Convention, is nowhere defined. It follows, I think, that the expression is not to be treated as a term of art with some special meaning, but is rather to be understood according to the ordinary and natural meaning of the two words which it contains. The second point is that </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">the question whether a person is or is not habitually resident in a specified country is a question of fact to be decided by reference to all the circumstances of any particular case</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">. The third point is that there is a significant difference between a person ceasing to be habitually resident in country A, and his subsequently becoming habitually resident in country B. </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">A person may cease to be habitually resident in country A in a single day if he or she leaves it with a settled intention not to return to it but to take up long-term residence in country B instead.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt"> Such a person cannot, however, become habitually resident in country B in a single day. An appreciable period of time and a settled intention will be necessary to enable him or her to become so. During that appreciable period of time the person will have ceased to be habitually resident in country A but not yet have become habitually resident in country B. The fourth point is that, </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">where a child of J&#8217;s age is in the sole lawful custody of the mother, his situation with regard to habitual residence will necessarily be the same as hers.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt"> (emphasis supplied)</span></p>

That would be inconsistent with his second point that habitual residence is a question of fact. All he was saying was that where a young child is in the physical care of a mother who alone has parental responsibility for the child, then normally the child&#8217;s habitual residence will be the same as hers, since it is her will that determines the element of volition involved in the concept of habitual residence.</span></p>

In cases involving a wrongful removal from one Member State to another, Art. 10 BIIR provides that habitual residence in the first state is not lost until it is acquired in the second, along with other conditions including residence in the second state for at least a year.

The assessment must survey facts of all kinds.  Some will consist of events, some will arise from less tangible things such as feelings, relationships and intentions, and others will concern legal rights and wrongs.  As to the last, whether something is legal or not is a fact.  But unless there is a specific mandate for doing so, the overall assessment does not give automatic precedence to one kind of fact over another.  In particular, there may be circumstances in which habitual residence can be lost following an unlawful removal (for example, with the passage of time), and circumstances in which it will not be lost following a removal that is technically lawful (for example, removal by a parent with sole parental responsibility who has no actual relationship with the child).</span></p>
