	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The husband&#8217;s notice of appeal was issued on 16 April 2019. This being an appeal from a Deputy District Judge at the Central Family Court, it was to be heard by a circuit judge, unless a Designated Family Judge or a judge of High Court level allocated it to a judge of High Court level considering that the appeal would raise an important point of principle or practice: see the table in FPR PD 30A para 2.1, at row 2. For reasons which are not known to me the notice of appeal was placed before Mr Justice Moor rather than a circuit judge. In an order wrongly headed &#8220;In the High Court of Justice, Family Division&#8221;, made on 30 April 2019 he directed that the application for permission be listed before a judge of the High Court with the appeal to follow if permission were granted. I can only assume that Mr Justice Moor departed from the normal route of appeal (i.e. to a circuit judge) because he considered that this case raised an important point of principle or practice. However, what is clear is that, notwithstanding the misleading heading of his order, this appeal is to be disposed of by a High Court judge sitting in the Family Court and not in the High Court: <span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span>. </p>

	    <num>4.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The significance of this is that the provisions of FPR 30.12A and PD 30B, which stipulate that certain appeals are to be held in public, do not apply to this appeal. These provisions only apply to appeals which are heard in the High Court: see FPR PD 30B para 1.2. For appeals heard in the Family Court, whether by a circuit judge, or a High Court judge, the normal provision in FPR 27.10 for the hearing to be in private applies. On 20 June 2019 Mr Justice Williams directed in this case (in an order again wrongly headed &#8220;In the High Court of Justice, Family Division&#8221;) that &#8220;unless the judge conducting the hearing orders otherwise, the hearing shall be open court, subject to any reporting restrictions that the judge shall impose.&#8221; However, I could see no good reason why the normal rule should not apply in this case. Had this appeal been heard by a circuit judge there is no question but that it would have been heard in private and I could see no good reason to depart from that position simply because I, sitting in the Family Court, was to hear it. I therefore directed that the matter be heard in private. This judgment will be published in anonymous terms, and revelation of the identities of the parties or the child of the family will be a contempt of court. </p>

Each parent accused the other of being the sole perpetrator. The judge gave an oral judgment, later transcribed under the heading &#8220;Preliminary outline judgment&#8221;, which concluded that the father was the perpetrator and an order was drawn up to that effect. Before that order was formally sealed the judge gave a second &#8220;perfected judgment&#8221; holding that after further consideration of the evidence she was unable to find to the requisite standard which of the parents had injured the child and that it could have been either of them.&#8221; </p>

In my respectful opinion to make the binary choice whether or not to accede to an application to revisit the judgment is not really an exercise of discretion in the sense of making a choice from a range of options none of which can be said to be wrong. Rather, as I have argued before, it is the formation of a value judgment. Put shortly, an evaluation has to be made as to whether there is good reason to depart from the principle of finality which is inherent in the delivery of any judgment.  </p>

A third example is <span style="font-style:italic">In re Harrison&#8217;s Share under a Settlement</span>, cited above: ten days after the judge had approved proposed variations of trusts the House of Lords held in other proceedings that a judge had no jurisdiction to do so in such circumstances.

This case is not one in which I am being invited to change my mind about a point I have decided based only on what I heard at the time. Nevertheless, it seems to me that this difference does not mean that the general principle articulated by the Supreme Court is inapplicable. By that I mean that the overall guiding principle here is the overriding objective to deal with cases justly, or, in terms of the CPR Part 1 as it is today, to deal with cases justly and at proportionate cost. It must be applied in different factual circumstances and the fact that this application involves amended pleadings and new evidence is an element, no doubt an important one, in the relevant circumstances.&#8221;  </p>

The court has a jurisdiction, at least before the order is drawn up, to entertain an application of this kind as in here. The principle to be applied generally is the overriding objective to deal with cases justly and at proportionate cost. This involves dealing with cases expeditiously and fairly and allocating an appropriate share of the court's resources to a dispute. In a case like this one, in which the application is to amend the statement of case, call fresh evidence and then have a further trial, the principles relevant to amending pleadings have a role to play but the <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v.

To allow litigants to treat the trial as a dress rehearsal and to seek a further performance on the basis of new evidence which could, with due diligence, have been supplied first time round sends a terrible message to prospective litigants. The spectre of an appeal is bad enough, but at least that is the subject of the rigorous permission filter. The idea that there could be a re-run of the case at the suit of a disappointed litigant on the basis of evidence, yet to be obtained, but which could have been obtained, is appalling. Therefore, in my judgment there would need to be a very good reason before the value judgment was formed to allow a re-visitation of the judgment on this basis. </p>

This sum, she asserted, was what was necessary to rehouse her and the child reasonably, she maintaining that she needed &#163;525,000 for this purpose. In addition, she would retain her pension of &#163;66,000, giving her overall funds of &#163;603,000 or 66% of the assets. Her claim was certainly ambitious. </p>

Obviously, a process of inferential judgment based on the available material properly led the judge to conclude that the wife could properly rehouse herself with a housing fund of &#163;410,000 in, or not far from, the area in which she wished to live. </p>

So the decision I make on this is that I am not going to seal the decision which I have made today and in fact will not say that that is now my final decision and I will allow further evidence, submissions on this matter which I agree with Mr Richardson has really been the crux of the matter for a very long period of time, but sympathetic as I am to the husband and I well understand what we now think is ostensibly more than frustration apart from anything else, I do have an overwhelming duty to do justice and in this case that means looking at this wife, this husband and this child&#8221;  </p>

Although the 21 day time limit for the wife to appeal strictly speaking began upon the delivery of the original judgment on 8 April 2019 (see FPR 30.4(2)(b)), it would, in my judgment, be unjust to treat the wife as being out of time in circumstances where the judge plainly did not intend her original judgment to be treated as final and never incorporated it into an order. Therefore, the 21-day appeal period will commence on the date that this judgment of mine is handed down, 27 September 2019.
