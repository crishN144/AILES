	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.48in">For almost her entire life, T has been the subject of legal proceedings between her parents. The proceedings have been about T&#8217;s relationship with her Father. For 5 years the Court, Social workers and psychologists have been grappling with the problem of why that relationship has been so difficult to establish and maintain. The Children Act proceedings have been before the Magistrates, the District Bench and the High Court. T is now a Ward of Court and I am trying this case as a Section 9 judge with the authority of the Presiding Judge of the SE Circuit, Moor J.  </p>

Until the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10.5pt">rd</span>   day of the trial (17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10.5pt">th</span> December) this application was opposed by the Mother although supported by the child&#8217;s Guardian. On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10.5pt">th</span> December, having heard the oral evidence of the child psychologist and the social worker, the Mother&#8217;s position changed.  She no longer actively opposes the Father&#8217;s application.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.48in">It is agreed by all parties that it is necessary and sensible for me to give a written judgment, to record the evidence before the Court and to make findings of fact. Not only will it be important for the parents to read it, but it will form the basis of any future decision making if the matter comes back to Court. In addition, T may want to see it when she is older, wider family members will need to be aware of my findings, and the professionals working with the family will benefit from understanding the background.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.48in">In the light of the fact that the matter does not remain fully contested, the Judgment is in a somewhat shorter form than would normally be expected.  I am also conscious that the judgment is needed urgently by the social work team so that they can start assessing the maternal family with a view to seeing if contact can safely take place over Christmas. I hope that the parties will forgive me for relying heavily on the opening position statements, particularly the very detailed document provided by Mr Jones.  </p>

The father relies on the expert view of Dr Shbero, Dr Tizzard and the Social worker (as well as the child&#8217;s Guardian) that T is suffering harm by being denied a relationship with him and by the Mother portraying him in a negative light.

When distress levels rise individuals with the histrionic prototype tend to fragment giving rise to very significant outbursts [4.91]&#8230;I am of the opinion that BR is a somewhat vulnerable individual whose anxiety is overlaid by the development of three very specific traits that have the potential to cause a large degree of difficulty in personal relationships and particularly so when these relationships become challenging [4.93]. </span></p>

BR&#8217;s general countenance and body language when discussing NP are indicative of hostility and anxiety. In fact, it is difficult to extrapolate exactly which is the greatest difficulty. It is quite certain that T having witnessed her mother in an emotionally histrionic and heightened state, would naturally begin to express some fear of her father while wondering what she was frightened of. It is therefore appropriate to state that T would be displaying significant anxiety at one level which may account for the ambivalence towards NP that she is displaying. Unless this is addressed there is a likely probability of T developing an ambivalent attachment to her Father and suffering irretrievable emotional harm.  </span></p>

The Mother could not give Dr Shbero any reason why contact would be in T&#8217;s interests and it would not be prioritised or promoted.

I am also aware of the right to a family life set out in Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention. I must consider the no order principle (not appropriate here) and the need to avoid delay. It is a matter of huge regret to me that NP has had to battle through the Courts since 2016 in order to reach the position that we now find ourselves in. It is an indictment on the court system.  I also remind myself of the presumption (at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>) that the involvement of both parents in the life of the child will further the welfare of that child.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">(a)the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in the light of her age and understanding); T is too young to have these wishes and feelings sought in respect of the matters in issue in this case. The Guardian has been sensitively conscious of the number of professionals involved in T&#8217;s world and has not sought to build a specific relationship with her. He notes the loving and close and warm interaction between the Mother and daughter. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">(b)her physical, emotional and educational needs; There is no doubt that her physical needs are currently being met. Her emotional needs are not being met by her Mother. I am concerned at the evidence (summarised by the Guardian at section 8 of his report) about T&#8217;s non engagement at school, her unusual interaction and her behaviour at separating from her Mother. I note Dr Shbero&#8217;s opinion that this is more likely to be due to her attachment issues than to a possible diagnosis of autism.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">(c)the likely effect on her of any change in her circumstances; I do not underestimate the difficulty for a 5 year old child of having to leave the Mother who has been her primary carer all her life, to move to a home with a parent whom she knows far less well and who is probably less attuned to her needs. In the short term, I do not doubt that T will struggle and will be confused and upset by the change. However, I agree with the view of the professionals that she will not find this traumatising if it is handled sensitively: the Mother&#8217;s change of position not to oppose the move is important because I believe she will now be better able to support the new situation.  I have read a great deal about the Father: he has 3 older children and has complied with all that has been asked of him by professionals. He has displayed patience and sensitivity in this case. I have no doubt that he will be able to support T at this difficult time and that her upset will be short lived.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">(d)her age, sex, background and any characteristics of hers which the court considers relevant; These have been discussed elsewhere.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">(e)any harm which she has suffered or is at risk of suffering; T has suffered emotional harm in the care of her Mother and has continued to suffer up to the date of trial. I accept the evidence that she would to suffer such harm in the future if the current situation was allowed to continue. The harm in this case is T being denied a relationship with her Father and the denigration of the Father in T&#8217;s eyes.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">There is a risk of trauma if the change of primary carer is not handled sensitively.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">There is a risk of harm to T if she is not able to maintain a relationship with her Mother: BR must persist in meaningful therapy to address the issues outlined by Dr Tizzard in particular.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">(f)how capable each of her parents, and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting her needs; I have considered this elsewhere. Both parents love their daughter. Both are able to meet her physical needs. Both have loving homes  and a wide, supportive family.  Sadly, the Mother is unable to meet T&#8217;s emotional needs at present. All the evidence points to the Father being able to meet all her needs, physical and emotional.  </p>

The Guardian has carried out this exercise in paragraphs 13 and 14 of his report (C583 et seq). He has considered the advantages and disadvantages of a shared care arrangement; whilst noting the advantage to T if such an arrangement could be facilitated, he  has noted the professional view that BR would be unlikely to be able to promote or maintain a relationship between T and her Father, to the detriment of T&#8217;s well-being.  </p>

The current situation of T suffering from emotional harm cannot continue, it is very dangerous for T in the long term. Although it is to be hoped that BR will undergo meaningful therapy and that there can be a move towards generous contact or shared care, it is not realistic for T to wait longer for that to occur. BR has been aware, since 2016 that NP was not going to abandon T, and it is a huge shame that it is only fairly recently that BR has engaged in further therapy.  </p>

Whilst conscious of all the facts put forward by the Guardian, and accepting that in the normal run of things a child will do better if change is introduced gradually (especially where, as here, there are other important changes to contend with), this case has particular facts. I accept the evidence of the father of the pressure on his work of a long commute. I accept that 2 hours a day commute for T is not ideal. I accept that T&#8217;s relationships with staff and peers at her current school do not appear to be deep and lasting (save for one friend); I am of the view that the change of school will send a clear signal to T that things are different now &#8211; a new home, new school, new beginnings. In the light of the history of this case and T&#8217;s issues at her current school, I consider that an immediate move will be beneficial to her welfare. I think that it will be healthy for her to be at a school without all the history and emotional &#8216;baggage&#8217; that she has left behind. I am heartened that the new school is aware of some of the behaviours that T has displayed and of the sensitive situation for T,  and is offering the help of a counsellor  to assist.  </p>

It is important to note that the welfare provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref> are precisely the same provisions as those applying in public law children cases where a local authority may seek the court's authorisation to remove a child from parental care either to place them with another relative or in alternative care arrangements. Where, in private law proceedings, the choice, as here, is between care by one parent and care by another parent against whom there are no significant findings, one might anticipate that the threshold triggering a change of residence would, if anything, be lower than that justifying the permanent removal of a child from a family into foster care. Use of phrases such as "last resort" or "draconian" cannot and should not indicate a different or enhanced welfare test. What is required is for the judge to consider all the circumstances in the case that are relevant to the issue of welfare, consider those elements in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(3)</ref> welfare check list which apply on the facts of the case and then, taking all those matters into account, determine which of the various options best meets the child's welfare needs.&#8221; </span></p>

Where there is more than one proposal before the court, a welfare analysis of each proposal will be necessary.  That is neither a new approach nor is it an option.  A welfare analysis is a requirement in any decision about a child's upbringing.  The sophistication of that analysis will depend on the facts of the case.  Each realistic option for the welfare of a child should be validly considered on its own internal merits (i.e. an analysis of the welfare factors relating to each option should be undertaken).  That  prevents one option (often in a relocation case the proposals from the absent or 'left behind' parent) from being sidelined in a linear analysis.  Not only is it necessary to consider both parents' proposals on their own merits and by reference to what the child has to say but it is also necessary to consider the options side by side in a comparative evaluation.  A proposal that may have some but no particular merit on its own may still be better than the only other alternative which is worse.   </span></p>
