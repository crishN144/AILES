K has a complex diagnosis of severe learning disability and autism. She has been assessed to lack capacity to make decisions regarding her care and support. K lives with her parents, Mr and Mrs A and currently accesses a day centre, namely X Placement. At the present time, staff at X Placement use a wheelchair during elements of her time there. There is disagreement between the parties as to the extent to which her wheelchair should be used and the reasons why it is used. There is also disagreement between the parties as to whether X Placement as a facility meets K&#8217;s needs.  The local authority seeks orders pursuant to section 16 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 that it is in K&#8217;s best interests that firstly she does attend X Placement, and secondly that it is in her best interests at this stage to use her wheelchair at certain times. Further, it is the local authority&#8217;s position that the nature of K&#8217;s care arrangements are such that urgent consideration needs to be given to her being introduced to a respite service in the event that Mr and Mrs A find themselves unable to care for her at home. I am asked to determine that it is in K&#8217;s best interests to be introduced to Z Placement, being a local facility close to K&#8217;s home. The local authority in this hearing have been represented by Miss Kirkbride, of Counsel.</span></p>

They specifically oppose the use of the wheelchair for K, arguing that this was not necessary in her previous educational setting at H School. It is their belief that this is used to control K, and that staff at X Placement are unable to manage her. At the time the final hearing began, Mr and Mrs A had not attended Z Placement but had reservations in respect of its location in Stoke-on-Trent, near what they understand to be a busy road. Following their visit, they now oppose this respite provision for K. Mr and Mrs A have been represented by Mr Rylatt, of Counsel.</span></p>

Ultimately, Mr and Mrs A applied for a further hearing to adduce oral evidence in order to address particular issues arising from the responses later received.

This necessitated the other parties being given an opportunity to respond. As a consequence of the response received by the local authority, Mr and Mrs A sought for there to be a further hearing and an opportunity to further cross examine K&#8217;s social worker (Mr Kelly) and K&#8217;s epilepsy nurse. This arose from Mr and Mrs A asserting that K was showing further unsettled behaviour at X Placement and the local authority offering the potential explanation that K had changed her medication and health issues could precipitate such behaviour. Within their application, Mr and Mrs A suggest that K had not seen the epilepsy nurse referred to by the local authority and wished to assert that the local authority and X Placement were not involving them in discussions with medical professionals. They further disputed that the change in medication would make K more unsettled and instead asserted that the only reason she shows such behaviour was because she was unhappy at X Placement, and her self-injurious behaviour was escalating. They have attached a letter from K&#8217;s doctor with respect to some of this.</span></p>

I was directed to relevant case law with respect to fact finding within the Court of Protection, which I have kept in mind. It was the position of the Official Solicitor that the local authority and X Placement engaging with K&#8217;s doctors was not of relevance to the issues of substance within the case. With respect to the cause of K&#8217;s self-injurious behaviour, it was noted that the local authority did not seek a specific finding that K&#8217;s medication was the definitive cause of her unsettled behaviour. The issues had not changed from those originally litigated and any new areas of factual dispute did not have a bearing on the ultimate welfare decision for K.</span></p>

I accept the submission that the new issues are of a similar character to the matters already explored. Further oral evidence would result in further delay and I do not find that it is proportionate.

There was a tribunal decision in October 2020 which concluded that K should continue to attend and receive her educational provision at X Placement. Mr A had sought alternative provision for K. It was the tribunal&#8217;s decision that K should not transition to another provision based on the difficulty K has in transitioning to new environments.

It was Mr Kelly&#8217;s assessment that K&#8217;s needs were such that she had always struggled with transitions and the absence of such support at X Placement meant that her initial attendance was traumatic. It was Mr Kelly&#8217;s analysis that when the use of the wheelchair was reintroduced for K in August 2019, it had an immediate and noticeable improvement for her and the challenging behaviour towards staff. However, it has also been his experience that this has led to Mr A becoming more confrontational towards X Placement in the light of his view that it was not offering the same care as H School.</span></p>

Mr Kelly acknowledges within his statement that COVID-19 had an impact on settling K and progressing the care plan to reduce the use of her wheelchair in the communal areas at X Placement.

I do remind myself that this took place within a different jurisdiction and whilst it is informative, it is not binding on this court. He records within his statement the views of the parents, essentially that they wish to care for K at home with them for as long as they are able, but that X Placement is not meeting K&#8217;s needs. Mr Kelly reports that Mr A&#8217;s view is that staff at X Placement are scared of K and this leads to the use of restrictions including the wheelchair. He felt that, in terms of Mrs A, she did not share the same strength of view around K&#8217;s day provision but she felt that the constant conflict was having an impact on her relationship with Mr A. It is not reported that Mrs A shows the same challenging behaviour as Mr A in dealing with professionals. Both Mr and Mrs A have reported that K is far less willing to be out of her wheelchair in their care than before its use at X Placement. In his conclusion, Mr Kelly acknowledges differences between X Placement and K&#8217;s previous educational provision and invites the court to endorse the current arrangements for K.</span></p>

The only independent day service identified at that stage was U Placement, which was out of area. Later in that third statement, Mr Kelly sets out a balance sheet of options. There were a number of positives to her existing day placement, including that K would not then face the disruption of settling in a further provision. Vulnerabilities included Mr A&#8217;s approach to professionals. With respect to an alternative day setting, whilst there were identified benefits, there were risks around placement breakdown and distress to K in terms of the transition. This statement also dealt with safeguarding referrals and the use of the Motability car by Mr and Mrs A. It is noted that Mr A has been barred from the Motability scheme after a confrontation. The statement also made allegations of undermining behaviour by Mr A. Mr Kelly expresses concern that K is not being encouraged at home towards independence and a lack of engagement with professionals by her parents was contributing to the concern. Mr Kelly at that stage could not advocate for a change in placement particularly as, at that time, it would have had an impact on her educational support through R College. Mr Kelly attaches details of a referral made in respect K which I have read and considered, along with details of the support needs of Mr and Mrs A. Within this documentation, it is recorded that the opportunity for K to experience accessing the community was explored but declined by Mr and Mrs A on the basis that K was likely to feel, if she was leaving X Placement, that she would be going home and this would be confusing for her.</span></p>

That statement is broadly supportive of those recommendations. It identifies Mr and Mrs A&#8217;s reluctance to engage as being a barrier to forming an agreed plan for K&#8217;s long-term future. Mr Kelly questions whether the rural placement supported by Mr and Mrs A existed for adults with K&#8217;s needs. He identified a conflict between the local authority and the independent occupational therapist instructed in these proceedings (Ms Dodwell), clarifying that the local authority&#8217;s position was not that K </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">must</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> remain in the wheelchair, but that it is necessary </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">for now</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> to meet her needs. Mr Kelly underscores the need to make only incremental changes to K&#8217;s care, supported by a multidisciplinary team. The occupational therapist recommended that K accesses the community in a wheelchair but does not identify that the use of the wheelchair for K at X Placement is a means of restraint. Mr Kelly exhibits to his statement an updated EHC Plan for K. This document draws upon a number of sources to recognise the strengths and vulnerabilities for K at X Placement, and makes a number of recommendations around her care that are broadly consistent with what she is said by the local authority to be receiving.</span></p>

The referral for occupational therapy at the time of that statement was closed due to a lack of engagement. Mr Kelly also provided an update in respect of alternative placements and again it was noted that no additional provisions had been identified. Mr Kelly reiterated his understanding that the independent social worker was supportive of the care that K had received at X Placement despite her poor attendance record. Again, the role of Mr and Mrs A in engaging with professionals to promote K&#8217;s development was underscored. In the exhibits to that statement, Ms S (the manager at X Placement) has provided an update in which she recorded that K was presenting positively. I have also read the accounts of K&#8217;s attendance attached to Mr Kelly&#8217;s statement. I have read the exhibits and logs attached to that statement from Mr Kelly. This has included allegations about Mr A&#8217;s behaviour towards staff which has not been the subject of findings during the course of this final hearing. These notes relate also to an incident on 3 March where it is said that Mr A unbuckled K&#8217;s harness from the wheelchair and K ran to the car and injured her mother. It was said that Mr A had entered the main building to do so, against the wishes of the manager of X Placement.</span></p>

He confirmed that there were no placements that immediately presented themselves. Whilst there was potentially space at a centre locally, there was insufficient staffing for that to be an option for K at that time. Mr Kelly also confirmed that Z Placement was the only realistic respite provision for K. Whilst there was a setting out of area for respite, staffing issues again meant that K would not at this stage be accepted. Mr Kelly goes on to note that K is not using all of her allocated hours and it was felt that this was a barrier to K settling further at X Placement. It was set out that K had suffered a period of ill health which had not assisted her. Mr Kelly explained the changing landscape of care for young adults, which had moved from day centres which individuals could attend, to individuals purchasing their own support. This had limited the availability of placements open to K and Mr Kelly aligned himself with the recommendation of Mr McKinstrie (the independent social worker instructed in these proceedings) that X Placement was broadly meeting her needs. Mr Kelly attaches to his statement the speech and language therapy referral which notes her need for soft food and records that staff at X Placement were seen to offer her drinks.</span></p>

This related to K self-harming at X Placement. K had become agitated while staff attended for her personal care. The report at C557 indicated that she had become vocal while being transported for personal care and bit her hand after she was unclipped from her chair and was standing at the bed. She had also banged her head on the changing bed. From the statements that followed, there appeared to be a breach of K&#8217;s care plan in that she had been taken for her personal care at a time she was distressed. K had also accessed the garden, which was not a usual activity for her. K had self-regulated after this incident. It was noted that K is not tolerant of touch and this had an impact on the level of intervention staff had felt able to provide. At C570, the investigation into the incident had identified that K had been due to menstruate, that her continence aid had been very wet, she had presented as agitated on arrival, and there had been a change in her afternoon routine. The Section 42 investigation produced recommendations that K&#8217;s daytime plan should not be deviated from without discussions with senior staff. There had been work with the wider team around K&#8217;s needs. There were a number of different contributing factors identified in relation to this incident. There was some concern that taking K outside had triggered her anxiety, but this was not confirmed. There was to be further work around K&#8217;s communication with support from R College. The safeguarding inquiry was ultimately closed. At C595, the local authority records that K has frequent incidents of low-level self-injurious behaviour when she becomes anxious, but it was rare for K to experience a serious episode at X Placement and this was attributed to K being supported by staff who know her well, and K being familiar with her team and her environment and routine. It was the local authority&#8217;s analysis that an underlying physical health issue can be a contributing factor to any significant incident. This document also records that K had later developed a chest infection although it was not clear whether this illness was a factor in her significant incident. I have also read the behaviour support plan prepared for K exhibited to this statement and noted what is described as positive and anxious behaviour from K. This makes it clear that, if K has shown signs of anxiety for more than 30 minutes, then a member of staff is to contact Mr A.</span></p>

In his evidence-in-chief, he was clear in his experience, K had struggled with the transition from one service to another and it had taken a long time for her to settle in each placement. He identified that it had taken up to 12 months for K to settle most recently and he expressed the concern that, if K were to require respite, then that would similarly need to be built up over a length of time to avoid her being traumatised by the transition. In exploring the prospect of a second day provision for K, Mr Kelly was not able to be definitive, but he felt R College would be unlikely to work with her in another setting. He was able to confirm that R College were willing to continue to work with K in her current provision.</span></p>

He recalled that there had been a period from late 2018 until May 2019 where K was without services and at the start of attending a day centre in the May, K had found it extremely difficult to settle. Mr Kelly was concerned about the risk of her placement at home breaking down due to the demands on Mr and Mrs A in meeting her complex needs.

He felt it would take K a long time to adjust to respite. She would need a slow and steady introduction and he had identified Z Placement as a potential respite setting.

In terms of the use of her wheelchair, it was his evidence-in-chief that he had not seen K distressed when using it. Whilst there had been an intention for K to access the outside space, this had been slowed in part due to the heat wave. He also felt K was not used to going out in the garden from her experiences at home. He was not aware of K choosing to access the garden when the door was open, and she had the opportunity to do so. It was clear from Mr Kelly&#8217;s evidence that the prospect of supporting K to access X Placement on foot would require at least, in the interim, a number of changes and the continued use of the wheelchair so as not to overload her. Even the transition to using a back door that K could ultimately walk through to access X Placement would require the use of the wheelchair in the short term. In terms of K accessing aspects of the centre using the wheelchair, his evidence was that K did require the wheelchair in order to make the transition manageable. In principle, he was not opposed to K accessing areas of the centre without the wheelchair, but it was managing K safely in the public areas of X Placement that was a particularly important factor.</span></p>

In terms of the difference between X Placement and H School, it was his evidence that K had a separate entrance at her previous provision and this meant the wheelchair was not needed as there were no communal areas that she would be required to navigate.</span></p>

This was on the basis that Mr A struggled to regulate his emotions and they wished to ensure that staff were able to continue to work with K. Whilst there was a willingness to work towards engaging further with Mr A, it was felt to be too early to commit to this. Mr Kelly was clear that a protocol had been put in place if K was unsettled. His experience was that she is normally able to self-regulate within 30 minutes but if she does not, then her family would be contacted. The opportunity for K to engage with others socially was explored, however the current layout of the centre meant that these opportunities were limited. In terms of K accessing the wheelchair, at this stage this was in order to enter the centre, to use the sensory room, and to access personal care.</span></p>

When challenged about his account of K&#8217;s use of the wheelchair to enter X Placement, Mr Kelly maintained that there were differences between the circumstances at X Placement and what had been necessary at her placement and H School. He remained clear that K had her own entrance to that previous facility, and this had negated the use of the wheelchair when K was old enough to not require one. In terms of K being settled or otherwise at X Placement, Mr Kelly confirmed that in his view K had begun to settle at X Placement and this had led to fewer incidents of self-harm. He felt that K had become more settled since the work with R College in September 2021 and there had been a gradual improvement since that time. He conceded that K was using her wheelchair around 15% of the time.</span></p>

In terms of K accessing the garden, this had not happened very often due to her more limited attendance at the centre, a recent heatwave and K&#8217;s own temperament at the time. It was noted by Mr Kelly that K did not access the garden in her own home.

He was clear that K enjoyed her time in the sensory room and this added a great deal to her day. Again, he confirmed that the local authority had not stopped working towards K using the wheelchair but had to be guided by how K was and also had to be mindful that previous assessments suggested that K had benefited from using her wheelchair to transition within X Placement. Mr Kelly rejected any suggestion that the wheelchair was used as a mechanism to manage K by staff who did not really understand her needs. It was simply the position that things needed to be done incrementally for her and progress had been hampered to an extent by the lockdown and K&#8217;s intermittent attendance. He was clear that the wheelchair was not a form of control but a proportionate way to manage risk. The alternative would be to physically handle K using MAPA techniques but this was disproportionate when the wheelchair was an acceptable option. Whilst steps could be worked towards in terms of reducing K&#8217;s use of the wheelchair, it would require the support of Mr and Mrs A.

His view was that the parents needed to work in partnership in the interests of K. Whilst he acknowledged that the current arrangements for professionals to liaise predominantly with Mrs A placed her in a more difficult position, this was not the choice of the local authority but rather the reality of Mr A&#8217;s approach to professionals.

In terms of the placement identified out of area, this would not be practical firstly because of the more limited time that K could spend there (only an hour or so during the day) but also the very specific support that would have to be bought in for K. The out of area placement is not a day centre in the same meaning as X Placement and could not offer the same level of service: it is not a five-day-a-week placement. This had to be balanced against all of the advantages of X Placement identified by professionals including the independent social worker. This was not simply a resource issue, it was based upon a global view of K&#8217;s needs. There were equal difficulties with the second out of area placement, where staff are not presently in place and would also need to be recruited. But it was felt firstly that it would be wrong for K to have to undertake a further transition and that the difficulties experienced with, particularly Mr A, were likely to replicate themselves there. This placement is in a housing estate. Mr Kelly&#8217;s written evidence is that it has no private garden for K (a section of the garden would need to be enclosed), and is near an even busier road compared to the road near X Placement (and so is not in line with Mr and Mrs A&#8217;s preference for a more rural placement). Even if there was a placement of equal quality for K, the impact on her of having to make a further change would not be in her best interests. </span></p>

They want a service that will listen to them as her parents and they are clear that whilst the use of the wheelchair was part of the issue, there were other aspects of K&#8217;s care that they felt were not in her best interests. Within that statement, they speak highly of H School and the things that they achieved for K, and the way staff had worked with them. There were critical of the placement at D School because of the use of the wheelchair for K, and critical of X Placement for the same. They allege within that statement that K spent all her time in the wheelchair when she moved to X Placement and describe the use of a wheelchair as a prison for K. They express the belief that the staff were scared of K and did not know how to deal with her behaviour. They described K&#8217;s use of the wheelchair as having an impact on their ability to take her out in the community. They find the decision to use a wheelchair for K hard to understand and hard to forgive. It is their evidence that whilst X Placement had acted on plans to encourage K out of the wheelchair some of the time, they felt this was not enough and they had lost faith in them.

It was challenging for her to predict a timescale for K to feel comfortable to get out of her wheelchair and walk in the new setting.

He did not accept that X Placement was the right place for her. Whilst there was evidence that there had been a reduction in K&#8217;s incidents of self-harm, he still felt that this was not the right setting for her. He was clear that he would contemplate an out of area placement for K. In terms of any reduction in K&#8217;s self-harm, he felt that she was still having incidents each week. He was clear in his evidence that he felt K was unhappy and he felt that the staff were not being honest about her presentation. He felt that K would cope with the change of routine if she were to go to a more suitable place. He felt that the local authority did not want to pay for the care necessary for K at an alternative centre and did not want to fund her care outside of Stoke-on-Trent. It was his view that the care plan for K had not been followed in terms of endeavouring to limit the use of her wheelchair. Mr A was clear that he felt that K was placed in that chair to make it easier to manage. He did not agree that any change of placement would be unhelpful for K because it was likely to remove the support from R College. Mr A explained that R College were not to be involved in the longer term in any event, and this would be outweighed by K&#8217;s need for a fresh start.</span></p>

He could see the benefit to K in having an opportunity to socialise and to further her education and he accepted that K enjoyed the use of the sensory room. At the same time, he worried very much about K attending X Placement and he felt there had been very poor communication from them. He did confirm that he would comply with any court order. Mr A did not see any connection between the time it had taken K to settle at X Placement and the more irregular attendance that she had shown over the last months. He felt it was better to determine for K on a day-to-day basis whether she was able to attend and her lack of fluid intake at X Placement was also a factor. It was also clear from Mr A&#8217;s evidence that there was a dispute between himself and the day centre around the stabilisers that were to travel with K&#8217;s wheelchair.</span></p>

Mr A was able to acknowledge some of the features of Z Placement that in principle would be a good fit for K. At the same time, he was deeply anxious about Z Placement being near a main road and he referred to a road traffic accident that he had witnessed in the vicinity of Z Placement. He also was critical of the fact that Z Placement would not accept K without her wheelchair. Whilst Mr A considered that options for alternative day centres should be explored more by the local authority, he did not appear to contest that the local authority had been unable to find other options for respite.

He was deeply unhappy that X Placement were not engaging with him and he maintained that K would adapt to any new setting. He maintained his view that H School had been able to manage K&#8217;s care without a wheelchair, and this included giving her access to outside space, and it was a reflection on the ability of staff at X Placement that this had not been achieved for her there. Mr A felt that it was unhelpful to K that he had been excluded from assisting at X Placement. He did not necessarily agree that any changes for K needed to happen gradually and at her pace. His own reflection on K&#8217;s time at X Placement was that no progress had been made, whereas staff at H School had stopped using the buggy for K within eight months to a year. He felt that the local authority&#8217;s plan was to control K with the wheelchair for as long as possible. He did not want to be excluded by X Placement.

It was not something K used at home, and nor was it something she had been shown. K at home would take people to what she wants, and this was not something she did at X Placement. As with Mr A, Mrs A could identify very little that was positive at X Placement for K. She felt that the centre was not used to people with K&#8217;s needs. She firmly denied that K blew kisses to staff. This was a movement K frequently made and it did not mean what the staff believed it did. Mrs A was extremely resistant to attending X Placement and being involved in X Placement without Mr A. Whilst she could see a benefit to K if she were to attend and see how she was cared for, Mrs A was adamant that she should not be put in the middle of things, and that the local authority and staff needed to engage with her husband too.</span></p>

She takes K to the doctors twice a week as a result of K&#8217;s health issues at X Placement, and had an appointment that day over her heavy breathing and hair pulling. Mrs A maintained this view, despite it being put that this was not wholly reflected in the professional recordings and nor did she accept incidents had reduced.

It was her account that the reason K had not been noted to have done this at X Placement was because K had not opened her bowels there. When it was put to Mrs A that K spent 85% of her time not using the wheelchair, it was still the tone of Mrs A&#8217;s evidence that its use was entirely negative and had an impact on her behaviour at home.

Her evidence was that her chair was never intended for indoor use. She was not willing to assist K in trying to walk her through the back entrance because K was used to male staff, as she pulls hair. Mrs A denied refusing to assist due to a fear of being assaulted by K. She reiterated that this is not what K was used to and she also refused on the basis that this was an example of her partner being pushed out by X Placement.

Mrs A felt that she and Mr A took K out appropriately with safe use of her chair. Mrs A was resistant to X Placement taking K out to a park, partly as it did involve her being in the community in her wheelchair but also because she felt that K would believe that she was being taken home and this would be distressing for her.

She felt that the others attending the centre were not of similar needs to her daughter. As with Mr A, I find there were times in her evidence that she did not directly answer a question, but instead simply reiterated particular points about her view of K&#8217;s needs.

She had agreed to visit Z Placement but her concerns around the main entrance remained. In terms of whether she felt it was an advantage that staff at X Placement could help settle K at Z Placement, Mrs A felt that that would depend on whether it would take four years for them to do so as she believed it had taken them to get K to this point at X Placement.

Miss Dodwell was not required to give oral evidence. She assessed K at home, at X Placement and whilst travelling to X Placement. In terms of her assessment, she did not observe any difficulties in K being transported to X Placement. It was a recommendation of Ms Dodwell that any changes for K in her support and care should be introduced tentatively and in a graded manner. She recommended that establishing a means of communication with K should continue to be a priority. She was also careful to observe that any progress in K&#8217;s care would not be at a predictable rate and it would be counter-productive to introduce too many changes at once. In terms of K&#8217;s use of a wheelchair, Ms Dodwell felt that it should only be for the purpose of managing risk to K, her family, staff, members of the public, treating professionals, and other service users. Ms Dodwell recommended a regularly reviewed risk assessment with a long-term goal that K does not use the wheelchair within the day centre for accessing what for K were predictable and routine facilities. She did not think it was realistic for K to be accessing the wider community without her wheelchair because of the unpredictability of the public. Miss Dodwell had not seen any evidence that the wheelchair was used as a means of restraint. Her recommendation was for a co-ordinated multidisciplinary approach to facilitate changes for K. A multidisciplinary approach was particularly important to assist K in reducing the use of the wheelchair and she felt it was reasonable for K ultimately to achieve walking to her space in the day centre, accessing her toilet space, and to leave and enter the family car, all on foot. Ms Dodwell was positive about K&#8217;s previous positive behaviour support plan implemented by H School.</span></p>

He has provided a number of reports within the proceedings. In his first report, he set out the background and the methodology for undertaking his assessment. This included interviews with a number of key individuals involved in K&#8217;s care. At this point, Mr and Mrs A had acknowledged to Mr McKinstrie that K did require a wheelchair in accessing the community for her own safety but were against the use of the wheelchair within X Placement. They were able to speak in detail about K&#8217;s care needs, and they had felt her presentation had changed since her attendance at X Placement. They reiterated their wish for K to attend a day setting that was attached to a residential unit because this would effectively assist their ability to care for K into the future in the event of an emergency. They did not want that centre to be within a built-up area. They were sceptical of the ability of Z Placement to meet K&#8217;s needs in respite due to a lack of experience with autism and its location on a busy road.</span></p>

Mr McKinstrie was aware of allegations during that interview of Mr A being aggressive with X Placement staff at the time of the interview. Her recollection was that K had been brought into X Placement using a wheelchair by her parents. She felt that the parents had been negative about X Placement from their first visit. She described K&#8217;s routine and confirmed at that time that Mr A was not allowed to access the building due to his previous behaviour towards staff. K has a staffing ratio of up to three support staff during personal care and two staff at all other times. At the time of her interview in January 2022 with Mr McKinstrie, Ms S felt the number of incidents of significant distress for K had reduced. She felt that there was a gradual process of settling K and the use of the wheelchair had been part of the process. Ms S did not report to Mr McKinstrie that K had been reluctant to use her wheelchair. She was able to explain that K&#8217;s wheelchair was not in her room all of the time now and that K had accepted this. Ms S had explained to Mr McKinstrie about the plans to support K in accessing the building on foot to the rear entrance and other areas where she felt that opposition from the parents had prevented progress being made. Ms S was able to speak about the qualifications and experience of staff caring for K. She felt in interview that in the early days of K&#8217;s attendance, she had had a positive relationship with Mr A. However, this had deteriorated, and she described him as complex and challenging to deal with. It was clear that, in her interview with Mr McKinstrie, Ms S had felt there was at times conflict between managing Mr A&#8217;s expectations, and what staff wished to achieve for K.</span></p>

Mr Kelly had expressed his view that K&#8217;s presentation had improved following involvement from R College to assist in her communication. Again, Mr Kelly spoke about his view that the lack of engagement by Mr and Mrs A may ultimately lead them to choose not to bring K to the day centre. This would be difficult because a day setting was central in his view to supporting Mr and Mrs A, and he identified a risk of carer fatigue. Mr McKinstrie also spoke to Ian Mountford (specialist learning disability nurse) who confirmed that there appeared to be a gradual movement away from K&#8217;s use of the wheelchair during her time at X Placement.</span></p>

His view was that the arrangements for K at X Placement were appropriate, met her needs and were in her best interests at that time. He felt that the approach of the parents had inhibited the ability of X Placement to explore initiatives for supporting K that would progress her care. Mr McKinstrie supported in the short to medium-term K&#8217;s care remaining at home whilst also accessing X Placement and also the involvement of R College. He supported K being introduced to Z Placement both as a means of respite but also as a potential future setting should K&#8217;s parents be unable to care for her. Mr McKinstrie did agree that in principle identifying a setting with an attached day service would offer positives for K in the longer term. He did not consider however that it would be in K&#8217;s best interests to move to an alternative day provision unless it was in the context of preparing her for a move towards a change of living in a supported living tenancy or residential placement. Mr McKinstrie recommended that whilst K was being introduced to Z Placement, the local authority needed to plan for the future for K and identify potentially longer-term placements.</span></p>

His observations included K being regularly offered sips of drink and using the traffic light system to communicate. From his observations, he felt that staff working with K were able to identify and respond to her cues. He witnessed K becoming distressed at one stage and being given time to self-regulate. I found this report to be very detailed. Mr McKinstrie was very positive about the environment and care afforded to K in this particular setting. He felt that the use of the wheelchair was proportionate and in her best interests and, on the day he had attended, K had spent the longest period in her wheelchair whilst in the sensory room. He felt that this had enabled support workers to engage positively with her. On this occasion, K was in the centre for 240 minutes and had spent a little over 25 minutes in her wheelchair.</span></p>

He gave a detailed account of the behaviour that he had seen K present and the actions of the staff. His observed account was that the staff were efficient in recognising K&#8217;s triggers and they were in tune with what K was trying to communicate. He did not recall any particular discussion as to what needed to happen, simply that the staff recognised that K needed space and they all withdrew for that to happen. He felt that the staff at X Placement had in place an effective strategy because it allowed K to self-regulate in an environment that was safe. It was his account that K had not been left unobserved. For Mr McKinstrie, the alternative to this technique was for K to be the subject of physical intervention to prevent her self-harm and he felt that this would be detrimental to K. It was more proportionate and in her best interests for there to be, instead, a planned and safe period of time in which K could settle herself. He went on to give examples during his visit of the times that the staff were in tune with what K had wanted and he felt that they read her cues extremely well.

He spoke very positively about what X Placement could offer K and described it as an exceptional facility. He felt that it was to the credit of X Placement that they offered her appropriate and attuned care. He described K enjoying music to express herself physically and the staff recognising when K had wanted that to stop. He raised no criticism of the staff training for K and he recognised that, if K had to move to a new setting with new staff, this would be unsettling.

He acknowledged that H School did not manage K in the same way, but again he recognised that the physical environment in that setting was different and did not require her to pass through any communal spaces on arrival or for personal care. His own observations were that K was entirely happy when in her wheelchair and expressed delight when it was brought into the room for her during his visit. He noted that she had elected to sit in it both to go for personal care but also to move to the sensory room. He did not witness K being coerced to use it.</span></p>

He did see it as a means of control because K was not free to get up. However, it was used as an alternative to K being handled by perhaps two or three people to travel to communal areas. It was a safe and appropriate means of ensuring that K could move around her setting, but he felt that it was not disproportionate. He had been aware that K had been in her chair in a setting within X Placement around other service users. He felt that this had the potential to develop her ability to socialise. He noted that there were limitations to what the staff had been able to achieve due to their anxiety around the reaction of Mr and Mrs A to K being in a communal area in her wheelchair. It was clearly the view of Mr McKinstrie that K should be allowed to develop that skill and socialise further.</span></p>

He did feel that it would be in K&#8217;s best interests for that incremental approach to be taken. Likewise, in terms of K accessing the garden, this is again something that would be of benefit but needed to take place gradually. Whilst the interior of X Placement was a controlled and safe environment, there were other risks within the garden that needed consideration and an appropriate means of safety for K.

His concerns were exacerbated by noting within the bundle that there was a period of time when Mr A had been out of the house and Mrs A had needed to manage K on her own and this had had an impact on what Mrs A had been able to do with K. He felt that K&#8217;s care would be a huge responsibility for a single person, and it was necessary to consider carefully an approach to respite that could be put in place over a period of time. He did recognise the significant benefits that Z Placement presented in terms of its location, proximity to K&#8217;s home and the ability of staff at X Placement to effectively manage her transition and be present. He felt that this was a huge advantage. He described K as a complex young person who did not fall within particular diagnostic criteria and had to be supported in an individual way. He felt that assumptions should not be made about K and he felt that it took a familiarisation of staff with her needs in order to manage her care as well as possible.

He recognised that K had been without consistent services since concluding her placement at H School for a significant period of time and this was unlikely to have assisted her in settling in her placement. He felt that K had settled over time at X Placement as the staff caring for her became more familiar with her particular needs. He recognised the importance of the intervention of R College and other strategies to achieve a position where K had settled and he believed that she had.

His own experience of X Placement was that individuals may access the communal entrance space at any given time and the risks could not be appropriately mitigated for K in any other way. He was not able to identify whether K&#8217;s improved presentation at X Placement over time was sufficiently robust to suggest that she could cope with an individual entering the space at the same time as her. His view was that the risks of K reacting to that situation as opposed to continuing the use of the wheelchair was such that the wheelchair remained appropriate. He reiterated that K was a complex individual and capable of moving very quickly. He was more supportive of K entering X Placement from a back entrance. He recognised that this requires managing in a particular way with the involvement of Mr and Mrs A and he felt it would be unfortunate for K if they could not engage with those measures.</span></p>

Whilst desensitising K to others being in a communal space was a way forward he felt that, in terms of K&#8217;s movements within X Placement, the big issue had been the number of doors. This had been observed to be something that caused K to respond. Again, he felt that the use of the wheelchair in that setting was appropriate and in her best interests. Mr McKinstrie felt that K would benefit from regular reviews of the progress made, including around her hydration. He felt it was important as part of those reviews that the views of all parties were considered. He again spoke positively about K having been able to spend time in a space with another peer during Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II&#8217;s Platinum Jubilee celebrations.</span></p>

He felt that the use of the wheelchair in those circumstances was about her accessing the space in a safe way. With respect to K travelling to the sensory room, he believed K wanted to use the chair in those circumstances. He had observed her choosing the chair and being happy for doing so. He did not consider there was any safety in the least restrictive option of K walking into those rooms and he felt the wheelchair was again better for K than the use of MAPA techniques. He did not feel that there had been complacency around the use of the wheelchair in X Placement. Instead, reflecting on the evidence, he felt that there had been progress. He felt that the wheelchair was an appropriate tool for managing K&#8217;s needs and one that he recognised that the parents themselves still used. He did not share the view of Mr and Mrs A that it was a means of controlling K employed by staff who did not understand her. He did recognise that there were strategies that could limit the use of the wheelchair including reconfiguring X Placement to mean that K had personal care in a space she did not have to pass through a communal space to reach. He was not able to say whether the use of the wheelchair at X Placement had lessened K&#8217;s wish to be out of the wheelchair at home. He felt that K was a complex character, and this was difficult to judge. He also agreed that simply because K presented as happy in the wheelchair did not mean that it was in her best interests. However, he considered the evidence did not suggest that she was at risk of deskilling in terms of her mobility. He did not view K as necessarily being dependent upon the wheelchair at X Placement, but simply that it was a tool that she used when she needed it. Mr McKinstrie did not recognise an inappropriate risk to K if she were to have a seizure whilst seated in her chair. He felt the time that she spent in the chair was very limited and it meant that the risk of a seizure at that point was highly unlikely.</span></p>

In terms of the strategy of leaving K to self-regulate if she became dysregulated, he felt that the current procedure of giving her time to do so in her own space was appropriate. He recognised that there was a time limit for this to be safe and he was clear that, on the instances he observed, staff were able to intervene if necessary. He did not feel that an alternative for K would be the immediate application of physical restraint because he felt that that would be distressing and disproportionate. He felt that K benefited from staff that knew her and who had worked with her and understood her cues.</span></p>

There were issues for X Placement around which wheelchair had been provided for K. Ms S described to the solicitor instructed by the Official Solicitor on behalf of KA that she was open to bring K through the back entrance, but the parents had refused to engage with this.

To some extent, those logs reiterated existing concerns, but it was suggested that the more recent logs showed a deterioration in the time that K would spend outside of her wheelchair. They were relied upon by Mr and Mrs A really to underscore their existing concerns. It is conceded that the logs were not exhibited to a further statement but I was asked to consider the contents of those documents, and I note in doing so that there were some sessions where K had declined to get out of her wheelchair and self-injurious behaviour was observed but at the same time, there were also positives within the recordings. Not every log demonstrated a substantial period where K was in her wheelchair. Mrs A also raised some points that had arisen from the evidence that she did not agree with. I was further provided with monitoring forms to indicate that K had bitten her hand on some occasions during the month of November. I will reflect on this within my judgment. </span></p>

First, the weight of the professional evidence supported a finding that X Placement was able to meet K&#8217;s needs. Particular weight was placed on Mr McKinstrie&#8217;s evidence in this respect. It was further submitted that K enjoyed attending X Placement and this was evident from her observed behaviours. It was noted that Mr and Mrs A had not observed her in this setting. In addition, the plan for staff to withdraw from K when distressed was evidence-led and more proportionate than immediate physical intervention. It was further submitted that the evidence supported a conclusion that this practice was safe for K. K&#8217;s social isolation and fluid intake were the subject of further plans to move forward and I was invited to look at K&#8217;s holistic fluid intake across the day. In terms of K&#8217;s routines, it was submitted that the professional evidence, and Mr McKinstrie in particular, supported incremental change to those routines in order to achieve change.</span></p>

There was a risk that the same conflict in relationships could be transferred to a different setting and therefore a real risk of placement breakdown. It was also the firm position of the Official Solicitor that there were in any event no other available options. Specific reasons for each considered alternatives were given. It was further submitted that to delay further for more evidence as to the local authority&#8217;s commissioning decisions was not in the best interests of K, particularly in light of the evidence establishing that X Placement does meet K&#8217;s needs. It was further submitted that I should not impose changes to K&#8217;s care plan without first confirming that X Placement would engage with the amendments sought by Mr and Mrs A.</span></p>

Further, the Official Solicitor noted that the care plans in any event sought to achieve that which Mr and Mrs A wanted for K, namely a reduction in its use.

For the Official Solicitor, this was reflected in the observations of Mr McKinstrie and Mr Kelly and the fact that K had exhibited behaviours to indicate she enjoyed herself there. That Mr and Mrs A had not observed this was because they had not been inside for long enough to see this themselves. The Official Solicitor noted that Mr A was not permitted in X Placement, but Mrs A had actively refused an opportunity to do so. With respect to the practice of staff withdrawing from K to permit her to self-regulate, the Official Solicitor noted that this was consistent with advice from both Mr McKinstire and Mr Mountford (specialist learning disability nurse) and this was far less distressing for K than initiating physical intervention in the first instance given her needs.</span></p>

With respect to K&#8217;s fluid intake, again, the Official Solicitor urged a broad view of her intake throughout the day and in the context of K having very specific routines.

It is also important that I set out that, whilst Mr and Mrs A do not come to this case as social work professionals, nonetheless they do have an important insight into K&#8217;s needs and interests having raised their daughter and offered her care throughout her life. That is an important contribution that cannot be underestimated. At the same time, it is also right to keep in mind that, for different reasons, neither Mr nor Mrs A have observed the care given to K at X Placement first hand. Whilst they do have experience of observing K at handover and have drawn conclusions from her behaviour following her time at X Placement, I have to assess their evidence in the context of what they have seen. It is also right to note that, whilst this is a case where there is a significant disagreement between the parties in respect of K&#8217;s care needs, I find that each party holds the firm belief that each is advocating for K&#8217;s best interests.</span></p>

I acknowledge at the outset that there is very little common ground between Mr and Mrs A and the professionals in this case. I fully accept that Mr and Mrs A have very specific wishes for K&#8217;s future support and care, and they do not believe that X Placement is the appropriate placement. I must however emphasise that it is essential to K&#8217;s welfare that any such disagreement is expressed appropriately, and that there is appropriate and constructive reflection when it comes to her care arrangements.</span></p>

I find these are factors noted by professionals as having had an impact on the length of time it has taken for K to have settled to the extent she has. Whilst there is disagreement as to the reasons, it is the case that K has not been using her full provision of hours at X Placement and again, whilst Mr and Mrs A have asserted that this is not necessary, it is appropriate that&#8212;when considering K&#8217;s presentation at the service&#8212;I look not only at the number of months she has been attending, but at the pattern and extent of those attendances.</span></p>

It is also significant that it was not a substantial part of Mr and Mrs A&#8217;s case that those specific identified alternatives represented an appropriate provision for K.

It is particularly the experience of the professionals that K is a young woman who takes time to get used to changes in her environment and the disruption and distress to her would simply not be in her best interests. I am asked to assess X Placement as a provision and consider the quality of the care offered and the extent to which attendance there is in K&#8217;s best interests.

Whilst I do accept that Mr and Mrs A will have had experiences where K has shown self-injuring behaviour and has been unsettled at X Placement, I accept the evidence that K is a complex individual and there is not necessarily a clear explanation for that behaviour. I found Mr McKinstrie to be a balanced and fair witness and I am satisfied that he reported the care that he saw being given to K during the course of his visit. I find his evidence is of particular significance being an independent professional instructed to report within these proceedings. I further find that Mr Kelly gave clear and consistent evidence around his own observations of X Placement and the support given to K there. Whilst I do not diminish the experience of Mr and Mrs A, I have already noted that they themselves have no substantial first-hand observation of the care given to K within that setting, despite an invitation being extended to Mrs A to observe the same. Whilst I accept that Mrs A may find herself in a difficult position when asked to deal with X Placement at times in the absence of Mr A, I do find it unfortunate that she did not take the opportunity offered to be able to form a first-hand view of K&#8217;s care.

I understand their genuine worry that this is an unacceptable risk of harm and doesn&#8217;t offer immediate physical intervention to prevent K from doing something that would cause the self-injury. Reflecting on the evidence with respect to this practice, it is acknowledged by the professionals within their written evidence that this does appear on the face of it counterintuitive. At the same time, I find that Mr Kelly, in his written and oral evidence, was able to be very clear as to the basis of the practice, and the benefits as well as the risks to K. I am satisfied on what I have read and heard that it is not the case that K is left unobserved at these times. This has not been a feature of reports from X Placement, and nor was it the spontaneous observed experience of Mr McKinstrie during his visit to K for the purposes of his report. Whilst I accept that Mr and Mrs A may say that Mr McKinstrie did not see a significant part of K&#8217;s life at X Placement, it was certainly his observation on that day that what took place was an entirely appropriate strategy for dealing with K&#8217;s behaviour and further intervention from the staff had not been necessary. Accordingly, whilst respecting the concerns of Mr and Mrs A for their daughter, and noting the evidence that I have heard and read with respect to this practice, I find it is firstly evidence-led with respect to K&#8217;s needs, and secondly a practice that K does respond well to. I do not find that there are incidents of K regularly being left alone without intervention in circumstances where she sustains very significant harm. In terms of what is known and understood about K&#8217;s particular needs, I accept that she is a young woman who finds touch intrusive and I find there has to be a careful balance between the impact on K of allowing her to become regulated again, and offering physical intervention which may distress her more.</span></p>

I find that the broad evidence of the daily logs supports the use of the wheelchair being in place for K in the key parts of her day addressed in evidence and submissions; namely, entering the centre, moving within the centre for personal care, and moving within the centre to access the sensory room. I find again that the broad evidence shows that this is not a substantial part of K&#8217;s day at X Placement and I find that the evidence does not establish the use of the wheelchair as a dominant feature of K&#8217;s support arrangements. I also find no evidence that the use of the wheelchair distresses her.</span></p>

I find that they have expressed a genuine anxiety about its use and have done so with respect to a number of issues, including K&#8217;s diagnosis of epilepsy. I can easily imagine the anxiety of Mr and Mrs A in believing that a feature of their daughter&#8217;s life, when supported by carers outside the home, is in their view to be confined to a wheelchair as a means of managing her behaviour.</span></p>

I do not find on the evidence that it would be more proportionate for K to be supported in communal areas through the use of physical intervention. I found, when directly questioned about this, that Mr and Mrs A only spoke in terms of K requiring effectively a gentle steer through communal areas. I find that this is not supported by the weight of the professional evidence which I find establishes very clearly that K would require a greater level of intervention than this, and this I find would be distressing for her based upon the evidence that we have of K&#8217;s particular needs and diagnosis.</span></p>

I accept firstly that the evidence firmly establishes to the requisite standard that K is only in the wheelchair primarily to transition between public areas of X Placement and to enter the premises. I accept K has also shown a wish to use the wheelchair while in the sensory room. I do acknowledge the point made by Mr and Mrs A that there is a difference between that which K would wish to happen, and that which is in her best interests and I have taken that into account as part of my consideration. I do find that the local authority has produced considered plans around K&#8217;s care and support that would lead to steps being taken to reduce her use of the wheelchair over time. I accept that these are genuine plans, and whilst Mr and Mrs A have expressed concern as to the extent to which they have been able to be implemented, I find there is no evidence that these plans have been put together in a cynical way without any intention of carrying them into effect. I accept from the evidence that K will require incremental changes, and I further accept the analysis that K attending for more limited periods of time at X Placement has not assisted in the implementation of those plans.</span></p>

This has included stalling the implementation of the plan for K to begin to access X Placement using the back entrance. I am concerned that there is a real risk that the relationship between Mr and Mrs A and X Placement, and in particular Mr and Mrs A&#8217;s ability to acknowledge professional advice that is different from their view, may have a detrimental impact on K&#8217;s ability to progress. I do balance that with the position that K&#8217;s attendance at X Placement has been disrupted by a number of factors, including the pandemic. Therefore, whilst Mr and Mrs A were able to describe very quick progress at H School, I do not find that a potentially slower pace of change at X Placement is wholly down to a different approach of staff.</span></p>

Within closing submissions, a number of proposals are made with respect to that way forward on behalf of Mr and Mrs A and I am invited to effectively endorse the same. In assessing this, I accept the position of the Official Solicitor that the court is limited in prescribing an approach without firstly an understanding of what X Placement would be in a position to facilitate. I do find that, at this stage, the evidence suggests that any changes to K&#8217;s use of the wheelchair would need to be incremental. I find that this is entirely based upon the evidence and Mr and Mrs A need to have an understanding that this is the case. At the same time, all parties agree that there should be progress, regular reviews and work towards a goal that K spends less time in her wheelchair.</span></p>

These are particularly bitter proceedings, and there is no real common ground on key issues between Mr and Mrs A. This is further complicated by disagreements over Mr A&#8217;s presentation and therefore the extent of involvement he may have directly with staff at the centre. The observations I will make at this time in the best interests of K are firstly that all parties must approach each other with mutual respect. However emotive the issues, it is not fair or constructive for there to be raised voices and heightened feelings. I would expect that Mr and Mrs A would comply with the court&#8217;s view, as they indicated in their oral evidence that they would. I would also expect that, as time passes, the involvement of Mr A directly in the development of K&#8217;s care plans will be kept under careful review and for there to be a sharing of information and clear discussion about matters relating to K&#8217;s welfare.</span></p>

I find there is evidence that she has made progress at X Placement, albeit the pace of this may have been limited by the circumstances I have already outlined. I accept the evidence that tells me on the balance of probabilities that K would find any change in her current arrangements stressful. This is consistent with all that is known about K&#8217;s response to changes in her routine. In those circumstances, I do not find that any further disruption to her arrangements would be in her best interests when her needs are being met at X Placement. I find any such fresh start would act more in the interests of Mr and Mrs A rather than K herself. I also identify the risk that any further placement would probably again be disrupted if that setting used techniques to support and care for K with which Mr and Mrs A do not agree.</span></p>

It is concerning that at this stage, should she no longer be able to be cared for at home, K would likely need to transition to a residential setting. This is also something which Mr and Mrs A have firmly in mind. It is unfortunate that Mr and Mrs A have not engaged in visits to Z Placement prior to this hearing. I have acknowledged the concern that they have raised with respect to its location, and their fear for K near a busy road.</span></p>
