The conception was a joint effort, with Ms L inseminating Ms C by syringe with the donor sperm.  Plans for the child&#8217;s arrival were jointly made.  Ms L was present when G was born in England on 16 October and played a full and equal part in looking after her while she remained here.  Ms C unfortunately suffered from some ill health after the birth, and Ms L was on hand throughout.  She even took steps to enable herself to suckle and breastfeed G.  On the two occasions that Ms C returned to Ireland (for four days in November and six days at New Year) G remained in the sole care of Ms L.</span></p>

Thus, argues Ms Guha, any litigation regarding the child must take place in Ireland.  The English court should not seek to adjudicate over any application regarding a child (including the existence or non-existence of Article 8 rights) if it does not have jurisdiction to make substantive orders concerning the child.  It would, she says, be perverse for the court to dismiss Ms L&#8217;s applications for Children Act orders for want of jurisdiction, but then to seek to determine issues relating to Article 8 rights.  The English court would in effect be trespassing upon the territorial competence of the Irish court.</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Verdana;font-size:18pt;color:#000000"/><span style="font-size:12pt">The fact that Ms L is a British national is irrelevant, given that the issue of Art. 8 rights cannot, she says, be divorced from consideration of the child&#8217;s present position.

As to the existence of an alternative forum, I entirely accept that this court should not trespass upon matters that would fall within the territorial jurisdiction of the Irish court.  For example it would, as I have already held, be improper for this court to make orders about future arrangements for the child.  But I do not accept that the declaration that is being sought would encroach upon the Irish court&#8217;s territorial jurisdiction.  In fact there is as yet no indication that there will be proceedings in Ireland, that jurisdiction not having been invoked by either party at this point.  And even if proceedings were taken in Ireland, their central focus would be on the child&#8217;s actual situation and not upon declarations as to past events.  Nor do I accept that the issue of Art. 8 rights can only be determined by a court considering substantive remedies relating to the child.  As discussed below, I would hold the question of whether such rights existed to be independently justiciable.  </span></p>

This is that the court cannot make a free-standing declaration of human rights in the absence of substantive proceedings.  The argument is based upon s.7(1) of the Human Rights Act, which provides that a person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes to act) unlawfully may bring proceedings against the authority under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> in the appropriate court or tribunal, or rely on the Convention right in any legal proceedings, but only if he is (or would be) a victim of the unlawful act.  It is argued that Ms L&#8217;s application falls outside the ambit of s.7 because she is not claiming unlawfulness by a public authority, nor relying on her Convention rights in any substantive proceedings.</span></p>

In my view, recourse to the inherent jurisdiction would not add anything of substance.

As to that, it is to be noted that there is no precise definition of &#8216;family life&#8217; in Convention case law.  It is a question of fact and one of substance, not form.  There need to be close personal ties but these need not yet be fully developed provided there is potential for them to develop.  There is no pre-determined model and family life must be interpreted in the light of modern trends.

Ms Guha argues that such a declaration would be meaningless in isolation from substantive proceedings in respect of the child.

I am not influenced by this argument.  There is in my view no such gap in the law.  Had the matter come before the court at a time when G remained in England, there are a number of legal remedies that might have been available to Ms L, whether or not she had the support of Ms C.  Nor can it persuasively be said that the law is failing in its treatment of the non-biological partner (male or female) of a biological parent who conceives as a result of informal arrangements.

The limited nature of the declaration in question would not trespass on any potential Irish proceedings, and might even assist if there were any.  It is said on Ms C&#8217;s behalf that an alternative legal remedy is available to Ms L in the Irish courts, but this rests on the doubtful assumption that she has the emotional and financial resources to pursue that course in practice.</span></p>
