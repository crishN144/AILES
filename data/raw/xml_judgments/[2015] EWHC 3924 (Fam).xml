The mother was made the subject of a previous s.91(14) order at the conclusion of proceedings before Mrs. Justice Macur, as she then was.  After that order had been made, the mother sought permission from Mrs. Justice Macur to make an application in respect of X.   In support of that application, she filed what purported to be a report from a psychologist.  When it was checked, it was discovered that that document was a forgery and the psychologist named denied any knowledge of ever writing any such report.  Criminal proceedings were instituted against the mother for perverting the course of justice, during the course of which she was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of nine months.  That was in or about October 2012.  The mother was still serving that sentence when the matter came before me in May&#160;2013.  </span></p>

That was because I was satisfied  that the mother had lied to me throughout the course of the hearing in 2013 and that she had and would, if permitted to have unsupervised contact, cause emotional and psychological damage to her son.  </span></p>

Thereafter the mother unfortunately suffered an accident in which she suffered head injuries and she was, she tells me, unable to attend contact.  That persisted throughout the remainder of 2014.  However, she was well enough by December of 2014 to attend a contact centre to have contact with X.  In fact, it is agreed between the parties, that from December 2014 there has been no contact at a contact centre when the mother has seen X.  That is not, I am satisfied, because the father was unwilling to arrange it.  It was because the mother no longer wished to see X at a contact centre and it is from that date in December 2014 that she began to see X, in breach of my order of May 2013. </span></p>

She put to X that she had not met him at the school gate but had met with him somewhere between him leaving school and arriving at home.  </span></p>

X is more mature and he is older and he is old enough to make decisions for himself.  That may be the case, but the fact that this mother chose to tell this child about this hearing and talked in detail about the evidence, in my judgment amply demonstrates that the circumstances that I found in my judgment in 2013 have changed not one jot.  </span></p>

In addition, she did not at any time, despite regular email communication with the father, either (a) tell him that she was meeting X; or (b) ask his permission to see X.  At no time, the mother concedes, did the father in fact agree to change the contact arrangements as set out in the order of 3 May.  In her evidence, the mother tells me that she could not remember the terms of the order made in May 2013; that she did not know that by seeing X as she did in the street that she was acting in breach of my order.  I, without any hesitation, entirely reject that account from the mother.  I am satisfied so that I am sure that she knew full well what I had ordered and what were the restrictions on her contact, but she has chosen, in my judgment, deliberately once more to flout the court's order and to ignore it.  </span></p>

Well, she is wrong.  She, by taking the actions that she has, has put X in an immensely difficult position.  The father tells me, and I accept that X has said to him that he loves his mother and he would like to see his mother, but he would like to see her in the supervised contact centre.  The mother tells me that when she sees X he is pleased to see her.  I have no doubt being a loving child that he would do that.  But the father tells me that by the time he gets home, it is plain that X feels uncomfortable, worried and concerned about these chance meetings, knowing that they are not taking place as the court has ordered; knowing that they have not taken place as he would wish.  The mother, in my judgment, has put X in an extremely difficult position.  She has quite deliberately chosen not to tell Mr. Y about these meetings, nor to seek his permission.  All of those facts demonstrate to me that the mother knew precisely what it was that she could and could not do by the court order, but she chose to breach it. </span></p>

I accept that evidence.  I am also concerned to hear it because it demonstrates very eloquently the conflict that this young man feels about the circumstances that his mother has caused him to be in.  </span></p>

In respect of those matters, where the mother was either not sure whether she had seen X on a particular date, or said that it was in fact her partner, Mr. Z, for example, who went to the father&#8217;s home on Wednesday, 15 April, I unhesitatingly reject those explanations and I find as a fact that the mother has met with X as set out in that schedule.  </span></p>
