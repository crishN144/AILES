	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This case concerns an application by A City Council (&#8216;LA&#8217;) for a final care order in respect of X. There is also before me an application by the Mother for an injunction preventing the LA from consulting with the Father about any issues concerning X. The LA had applied for a declaration that it was not required to consult the Father, but they now seek leave to withdraw that application. The making of the final care order is not contested. However, the LA do contest the making of the injunction sought by the Mother. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The LA was represented before me by Mr Cleary, the Mother by Mr Clulee and the Guardian by Ms Mulrennan. The Father, as is explained below, has not been notified of these proceedings and therefore was neither present nor represented. The Father is named on the birth certificate and therefore has parental responsibility. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">X is now 13 years old. She has been diagnosed as having a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230;disordered avoidant attachment pattern co-morbid with ASD/ADHD exhibiting hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli and sleep problems&#8217;</span> (per the psychologist instructed, Dr Jacqueline Lynch). This has manifested itself in a series of dangerous and highly risky behaviours and it is accepted by all parties that she is beyond the control of her Mother. All those represented agree that it is in her welfare interests for a care order to be made. There is evidence that X puts herself in highly dangerous situations and is at considerable risk of child sexual exploitation.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">When X was 4 weeks old the Father committed a serious assault upon the Mother leaving her unconscious. He has not seen X since this assault 13 years ago. He was convicted of assault and received a custodial sentence. There was then a further custodial sentence of 3&#189; years. The Mother subsequently obtained a non-molestation order and a Residence Order against the Father. In 2010 the Police served the Mother with an &#8220;Osman Warning&#8221; referring to intelligence they had received suggesting that the Father posed a high risk to the Mother of serious physical harm, which could result in her death. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In around 2012 the Father did seek contact with X. Although I have not seen any court order, Mr Clulee told me that the Father had been ordered to attend a domestic abuse course before any contact would be ordered and that he failed to do so. It was around this time that the Mother obtained a Prohibited Steps Order against the Father. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is against those background facts that the Mother says that she is in very great fear of the Father. It is quite obvious from her witness statement, the submissions made on her behalf and, very briefly, her demeanour in the (remote) hearing, that her fear is genuine. No party has suggested otherwise. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Care proceedings were issued on 23 March 2021, at which point X had been residing in LA care under s.20 of the Children Act for 4 months. An Interim Care Order was made on 30 March. As the Father had parental responsibility, he automatically became a party. On 30 March the Mother applied for the Father to be discharged as a party on the grounds of the risk he posed to the Mother and the fact that he had played no part in X&#8217;s life since she was 4 weeks old. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 22 April Judge Afzal determined that the Father should remain a party but should not be given notice of the proceedings or sent any documents. The LA agreed to do life story work with X, in part regarding her parent&#8217;s relationship, and Dr Lynch, a psychologist, was instructed. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The LA&#8217;s final evidence stated that it would be seeking an order under s.34(4) and an order under s.22 to allow them to dispense with the duty of keeping the Father informed as to matters relevant to X&#8217;s care. The evidence said that the LA were seeking the s.34(4) order <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;in recognition of the fact that it would inappropriate and potentially dangerous to promote contact between X and her birth father&#8221;.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Mother&#8217;s evidence supported the making of a Care Order and set out the grounds for her fear of the Father, both in respect of herself and X. The Guardian supported the making of a Care Order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 9 August the LA made an application for a declaration that they be discharged from duties to inform the Father under s.22. The matter was listed for a final hearing on 15 September 2021. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">However, on 18 August the LA indicated that it had changed its position on s.22 and wished to withdraw its application.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Mother then filed a Position Statement seeking to persuade the court not to give the LA leave to withdraw their application and seeking a declaration under the inherent jurisdiction that the LA was absolved of its duties under s.22 and s.26 of the Children Act, and seeking to include that members of the paternal family should also not be consulted. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Guardian in effect supported the Mother&#8217;s application but suggested that there should be no consultation with the Father without the Mother&#8217;s consent and that if that consent was not forthcoming the LA could apply back to the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">However, in my view, relatively little weight should be given to the Father&#8217;s Article 8 rights on the facts of this case. Firstly, he has not seen X since she was 4 weeks old, some 13 years ago, and has made very little effort to be involved in her life. As I understand it, he made one application for contact but then failed to undertake the domestic abuse work which the judge required. Therefore, his real-life involvement in X&#8217;s life has been virtually non-existent. Although this may not entirely extinguish Article 8 rights, depending on the facts of the case, it must significantly diminish the weight that any court would give to them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, when X was a very young age, the Father carried out a very serious assault on the Mother. This, together with his subsequent violence to another woman, has put the Mother in real and wholly justified fear of him. Those actions have themselves further undermined any reliance he could place upon his &#8220;family life&#8221; rights. Although the violence was exercised upon the Mother, rather than directly on X, it is by now generally accepted that domestic abuse between parents has a very serious impact on children within the family. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It follows from this that, in the words of Coleridge J, the Father has largely if not wholly forfeited his right to be involved in X&#8217;s life and therefore his Article 8 rights in respect of her. Article 6 adds nothing at this stage as the decision was made by Judge Afzal, rightly in my view, that the Father should not be served with the documentation, which meant he could not make any submissions during the court process. The removal of his Article 6 rights in the present case is justified by the impact on the Mother&#8217;s rights. The child&#8217;s Article 6 rights were fully protected by the involvement of the Guardian. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is however another aspect to this case which the LA appear to have left out of account, namely the Mother&#8217;s Article 2 and Article 3 rights. The evidence shows beyond any doubt that the Father is a seriously dangerous man to those he wishes to harm. The police in 2010 were sufficiently concerned about the safety of the Mother as to serve her with an &#8220;Osman warning&#8221;, not a step that the police undertake lightly. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Cleary argues that the evidence of risk to the Mother arose some years ago, and that there is no evidence that the Father poses a direct threat to X. However, in my view that rather misses the point. It is obviously not possible to test the risk to the Mother, and it may be that the Father had no reason to threaten or commit violence to the Mother in the years between 2010 and when he was sentenced to life imprisonment. However, given his history, I wholly accept the Mother&#8217;s genuine fear that if the Father became aware of the allegations of child sexual exploitation, he might blame the Mother or, for whatever reason, feel motivated to encourage violence against her. The likelihood of the risk is simply unquantifiable, but the harm if it were to manifest itself is potentially very great. The Osman warning and the 2015 assault and its aftermath show what the Father is capable of.</p>

In carrying out the balancing exercise, I am not limited to considering direct impacts to the child but can also take into account the impact on the child of her mother being in fear of serious assault.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">For the reasons I have explained, I would give the Father&#8217;s Article 8 rights little weight on the facts of this case. I am more concerned about X&#8217;s stated desire to have contact with her Father. It is the view of Dr Lynch, and I believe the social worker, that X is not <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competent in respect of decisions about her Father. That is highly likely to be the case. X is only 13, but also has mental health diagnoses that mean that she functions at a significantly younger age. She is most unlikely to be able to understand the emotional and psychological implications of making contact with her Father, quite apart from the potential consequences to her mother. I am therefore satisfied that at the present time X should not have contact with her Father, even on an indirect and highly managed basis. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">For all these reasons it is appropriate at the present time, and in accordance with the balance of rights under the Human Rights Act, for an order to be made that the LA must not consult or inform the Father about any matters concerning X. If that position changes in their view in future years, then they must apply back to the court for a variation of the order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I also make the Care Order. There is no dispute that threshold is crossed. I do not need to rehearse the various matters under the welfare checklist given the agreed position. X is at the present time beyond her Mother&#8217;s control and in need of very considerable care and support that her Mother is not at the moment able to give her. The Guardian supports the making of the order and I find it is in her welfare interests to do so. </p>
