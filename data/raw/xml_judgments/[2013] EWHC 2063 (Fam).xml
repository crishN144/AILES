The evidence suggests he has had little contact with the Child. According to the mother he left when the Child was born and she has only seen him once since then. On 21 February 2012 the father applied to reduce his maintenance payments, that application is still outstanding.</span></p>

They had met on the internet in early 2012. They married in a Muslim ceremony in the United Kingdom on 6 June 2012 (some 10 days after the mother&#8217;s arrival), followed by a civil ceremony on 29 August 2012.  They lived, together with the Child, at an address in east London. The Child started attending school and he and the mother were registered with a GP and the Child with a dentist. The evidence points to the mother coming here with the Child with the intention of settling in the UK and as I found at the earlier hearing they were both habitually resident here when these proceedings commenced.</span></p>

Interference with the right to respect for family life, protected by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, can only be justified by a pressing social need. Yet it is also a serious thing for the state to fail to safeguard its children from the neglect and ill-treatment which they may suffer in their own homes. This may even amount to a violation of their right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, protected by article 3 of the Convention. How then is the law to protect the family from unwarranted intrusion while at the same time protecting children from harm?</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic">2.&#160;In England and Wales, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> tries to balance these two objectives by setting a threshold which must be crossed before a court can consider what order, if any, should be made to enable the authorities to protect a child. The threshold is designed to restrict compulsory intervention to cases which genuinely warrant it, while enabling the court to make the order which will best promote the child's welfare once the threshold has been crossed.

Following telephone calls made during this hearing the court was further updated about the practical arrangements if there was a transfer. The named professional foster carers are still available and the Child could be placed with them within two days of his arrival in Slovakia. He would be placed in an institution pending that placement. Further enquiries are going to be made by the parties through the Central Authority and via the network judge as to whether it is possible for there to be a seamless transfer for the Child from his foster carer here to a foster carer in Slovakia. Whilst the Guardian sets out this concern, she accepts there is no compelling factor preventing a transfer.</span></p>

She gave two accounts at the school, a different account in her statement and her oral evidence as to what she did see or not of the incident. I do not accept the mother&#8217;s explanation that the different explanations were down to her language difficulties. Whilst the mother gave her oral evidence via an interpreter the evidence points to her knowledge and understanding of English being far greater than she suggests. This was demonstrated through very effective cross examination by Mr Williams Q.C. for the Guardian when he established that the mother could only communicate with the step father in English, initially via the internet and following her arrival here in May 2012. That remains their only common language. I pause to note that it is not disputed that she married the step father in a religious ceremony days after her arrival here, which is hardly consistent with someone who can&#8217;t speak or understand the language the step father speaks. In addition the mother&#8217;s first statement filed in these proceedings dated 18 March 2013 she accepted did not require an interpreter. She also accepted she completed the application to transfer the Child&#8217;s school without assistance. I also noted in the questions I asked her during her oral evidence regarding the step father&#8217;s immigration position she was able to answer before my question was translated to her. Whilst understanding the need to have interpreters to enable her to give her oral evidence with confidence I am satisfied that in fact her understanding of English and her ability to speak it is good and that is it unlikely that she misunderstood what she was being asked about or the explanation she was giving. </span></p>

In addition his somewhat idealised account of the parties relationship and the Child&#8217;s behaviour as having no difficulties which may be somewhat unrealistic bearing in mind the parties married 10 days after the mother&#8217;s arrival in this country, they had different languages and backgrounds, they lived in somewhat cramped conditions, and there were some difficulties with the Child at school.

Whilst at the earlier hearing the balance of the relevant considerations tipped in favour of the proceedings remaining here, that was heavily influenced by the availability of factual witnesses here and the benefits of this court, with substantive jurisdiction, determining the factual foundation of the proceedings without delay. Now that has been done and with the additional information that has helpfully been provided by the Slovakian Central Authority I am satisfied that the balance now tips in favour of the Article 15 request being made. I have reached that conclusion for the following reasons:</span></p>

This is understood to be irrespective of the step father&#8217;s immigration position. He said in evidence that he had been brought up in Pakistan and had come here in 2010 on a student visa. That was extended until 30 August 2012. The mother and step father had a religious marriage on 6 June followed by a civil ceremony on 29 August 2012. The step father has applied for a spousal visa, he said he has informed his immigration solicitor that the mother has returned to Slovakia but did not know whether they, in turn, had informed the Home Office. He has been advised that whilst his application for a spousal visa is pending he should not leave this jurisdiction as such a step would be treated as he having withdrawn his application. He said he applied for the spousal visa in January 2013 and thought it should take about six months to process;</span></p>

The Central Authority has set out the arrangements in the event of the Child returning to Slovakia. They consent to the Child being placed with professional foster carers, and state the competent court is the District Court Trnava. They confirm the social welfare offices will support and control the realisation of contact between the Child and members of his biological family. They also describe the assessments that will be undertaken before any decisions are made about where the Child will live.</span></p>

The Child&#8217;s foster carers here go away for four weeks next Thursday 18 July. This was known at the hearing on 21 June 2013. I flagged up then that if the court was going to make an Article 15 transfer request at this hearing I wanted to ensure that it could be implemented in such a way to enable a smooth transfer for the Child from foster carers in this jurisdiction to foster carers in Slovakia. The information give to the court today by the parties, via the Central Authority, is that no steps can be taken until the Child has arrived in Slovakia, an application can then be made to the relevant court in Trnava for placement with the professional foster carers who have already been identified, but that could take about two days. The Child would be placed in an institution (children&#8217;s home) pending that decision. I hope with assistance through the IHNJ that will be avoided, and arrangements can be put in place to enable the Child to be placed with foster carers straight away following his arrival in Slovakia.</span></p>

If the court is required to determine any outstanding issue I will hear the matter later on that day.
