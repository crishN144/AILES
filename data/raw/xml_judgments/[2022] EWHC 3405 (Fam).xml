The parents disputed the court&#8217;s jurisdiction on the basis that they said the children were habitually resident in Spain. The parents were ordered to produce statements and the matter was listed before HHJ Williscroft on 18 October 2022. She determined that the children were habitually resident in Spain, and directions were made for a case summary to be drawn up to be transmitted to the Spanish Courts. The Judge continued the ICO on the basis of Article 11 of the 1996 Hague Convention on the Protection of Children (&#8220;the Hague Convention&#8221;). The Mother sought permission to appeal the ICO. The Judge refused permission to appeal. On 11 November Moylan LJ also refused permission to appeal. </p>

Where the change of habitual residence of the child from one State to another occurs at a time when the authorities of the first habitual residence are seised of a request for a measure of protection, the question arises as to whether these authorities retain their competence to take this measure (perpetuatio fori) or whether the change of habitual residence deprives them ipso facto of this jurisdiction and obliges them to decline its exercise. The Commission rejected by a strong majority a proposal by the Australian, Irish, British and United States delegations favourable to the perpetuatio fori. Certain delegations explained their negative vote by their hostility to the very principle of perpetuatio fori in this field and wanted jurisdiction to change automatically in case of a change of habitual residence, while other delegations thought that it would be more simple for the Convention not to say anything on this subject thereby abandoning to the procedural law the decision on perpetuatio fori. The first opinion appeared to be the more exact in the case of a change of habitual residence from one Contracting State to another Contracting State. Indeed it is not acceptable that in such a situation, which is located entirely within the interior of the scope of application of the Convention, the determination of jurisdiction be left to the law of each of the Contracting States. Moreover this solution is one which currently prevails for the interpretation of the Convention of 5 October 1961. On the other hand, in the case of a change of habitual residence from a Contracting State to a non-Contracting State, Article 5 ceases to be applicable from the time of the change of residence and nothing stands in the way of retention of jurisdiction, under the national law of procedure, by the authority of the Contracting State of the first habitual residence which has been seised of the matter, although the other Contracting States are not bound by the Convention to recognise the measures which may be taken by this authority."</span></p>

In particular, a Contracting State is not authorised to exercise jurisdiction over one of these children if such jurisdiction is not provided for in the Convention. The same solution prevails in the situations described in Article 6, where the child has his or her residence in a Contracting State. In the other situations the mere presence of the child gives rise to the application of Articles 11 and 12, but these articles do not exclude the broader bases for jurisdiction that the Contracting States might attribute to their authorities in application of their national law; only, in this case, the other Contracting States are not at all bound to recognise these broadened bases for jurisdiction which fall outside of the scope of the Convention. The same thing is true, for even stronger reasons, for the children who do not have their habitual residence in a Contracting State, and who are not even present in one. The Commission refused to insert in the text of the Convention a proposal by the Drafting Committee which, inspired by Article 4 of the Brussels and Lugano Conventions, would have provided that, where the child does not have his or her habitual residence in a Contracting State, jurisdiction is, in each Contracting State, governed by the law of that State. This proposal was considered as expressing the correct interpretation of Chapter II of the Convention, but it was not retained for fear that it might itself be interpreted, following the example of the corresponding text of the Brussels and Lugano Conventions, as obligating the other Contracting States to recognise the measures so taken in application of the rules of national jurisdiction &#8211; sometimes exorbitant rules &#8211; of the Contracting States."&#8221;</span></p>

Within this context, two matters fall to be noted at the outset. First, the purpose of the connecting factor of habitual residence in Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention, which article determines which Contracting State has substantive jurisdiction to pursue the objects and purpose of the Convention, is to ensure that the jurisdiction with the closest factual connection to the child's family and social life, and the jurisdiction thereby best placed to take substantive decisions regarding the welfare of that child, is the jurisdiction that takes decisions concerning the child's welfare. Second, the Convention contains no principle of perpetuatio fori, by which a Contracting State seised of proceedings in respect of a child habitually resident in that Contracting State will retain jurisdiction for the duration of those proceedings, even if the child loses habitual residence there and becomes habitually resident in another Contracting State.</span></p>

The consequence of this position is that a Contracting State cannot proceed on the basis that, once it is seised of proceedings on the date of issue (or such other relevant date), it will retain jurisdiction under Art 5(1) of the 1996 Convention until the conclusion of those proceedings. Further, and in these circumstances, in the absence of the principle of perpetuatio fori, it will be the factual situation during the course of proceedings, and whether that situation continues to amount to habitual residence as a matter of fact, that determines whether substantive jurisdiction subsists under Art 5(1). In the absence of the principle of perpetuatio fori, it is further axiomatic that habitual residence will fall to be assessed at the current hearing, and not by looking back to an earlier hearing in the proceedings. Indeed, the logical consequence of the foregoing position is that the question of habitual residence will fall to be confirmed at each hearing, albeit that that exercise is unlikely to be an onerous one in the vast majority of cases. Within this context, where the proceedings reach a final hearing the question of whether the court has substantive jurisdiction pursuant to Art 5(1) of the 1996 Convention will still be a potentially live one. This is a fundamental change from the position that pertained under Art 8 of Brussels IIa prior to the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.</span></p>

In cases concerning children who arrive in this jurisdiction, that risk is particularly acute where the court determines upon the issue of proceedings that it has only jurisdiction to take urgent measures under Art 11 of the 1996 Hague Convention. Within this context, as this court observed in Warrington CC v T, it is vital that the question of whether, and on what basis, the court has jurisdiction is determined at the outset of the proceedings and that thereafter the proceedings are resolved in a timely manner based on that determination. It also further emphasises the need for robust case management generally in order to avoid a situation where substantive jurisdiction is ultimately determined by procedural default.</span></p>

However, in contradistinction to this case and the case of Warrington CC v T, in H v R the children had been taken from the jurisdiction of England and Wales to a non-Contracting State. This case, and the case of Warrington CC v T, concern the opposite situation to that which arose in H v R. In a case in which the subject child is already in England and Wales, the extent to which the fact that national law takes over following a loss by the Contracting State of jurisdiction under Art 5(1) may act to mitigate the risk of delay attendant on the relevant date under the 1996 Hague Convention, if at all, will depend on the facts of the case. In the circumstances, and where the point does not arise on the facts of this case, I propose to say nothing further in this regard.&#8221;</span></p>

They will have become settled in English schools and with friends and networks here. The likelihood of habitual residence shifting this way is increased by the caselaw now emphasising the child&#8217;s integration as the critical factor over the intentions of the parents. If the test depended primarily on the parents&#8217; intentions, then habitual residence would be slow to change. But if the court focuses on the child&#8217;s integration in the second country, then particularly with children such as these, with extensive familial ties in England, habitual residence may shift relatively quickly. It is inevitable that with the passage of time, a child&#8217;s factual integration into the country s/he is living in will increase. Therefore, the possibility of habitual residence as a matter of fact moving between the date the Court is seised and the date of a final hearing will itself increase. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, delay is endemic in the system. An interpretation of the Hague Convention that leaves the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction at the mercy of such delay, whether being deliberately encouraged by a party or not, is an interpretation which does not advance the protection of the child. The jurisdiction of the Court becomes inherently uncertain, and therefore the way the child&#8217;s future is to be decided itself becomes potentially unclear. An example of this is a case that has proceeded on the basis of habitual residence being in the first country, but then when it comes to the final hearing a finding that habitual residence has shifted, meaning that welfare decisions are now to be made in the second country. It is also potentially wasteful of judicial and administrative resources because the procedures for transfer and liaison under the Hague Convention will be rendered pointless because by the final hearing the child has become habitually resident in England. Therefore, allowing habitual residence to shift in this way creates uncertainty with the process that cannot be beneficial to the welfare of the child. </p>

The evidence in this case is set out in witness statements by the Mother and the Father. The Mother&#8217;s family had had a house in Spain for many years. During the pandemic, the parents had decided to move to Spain, albeit the Father&#8217;s work remained in the UK. There was considerable planning for the move, including a lengthy process to obtain visas to allow the Mother and children (including an older sister who is still in Spain) to remain in Spain beyond the period of a three month tourist visa. The post-Brexit position in Spain is that for people seeking long-term residence, they may be granted a five year visa and can then apply for permanent residence. The Mother and children have been given five year visas. </p>

The children were integrated into the community in Spain by having attended school/nursery for a school year and having doubtless made the friends and connections that went with that. The evidence that the parents intended this to be a permanent, or at least long-term move, and had made all the practical arrangements that went with that intention, is clear from the visa applications. This was an ex-pat family so the nature of the roots and integration in Spain are rather different than would be the case with a Spanish family. However, within the context of that lifestyle, the children were integrated in Spain. </p>

What will be its immediate consequences? What impact will it have on the choices available to the court deciding upon the eventual outcome? This is not the same as deciding what outcome will be in the child&#8217;s best interests.
