Furthermore, the donor was legally represented at the time and Ray provided all the funds required for the purchase. The court has no power to investigate the purchase or to set it aside and, while a deputy could investigate and bring proceedings in another court, they would be expected to seek legal advice on the prospects of success. Since there are insufficient funds to bear the costs of a panel deputy, unless they were willing to act on a pro bono basis, the prospect of a successful challenge to the purchase of the property seems remote.</p>

The vast majority of decisions about incapacitated adults are taken by carers and others without any formal general authority. That was the position prior to the passing of the MCA under the principle of necessity: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation)</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> [1990] 2 AC1, and in particular the speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley. In passing the MCA, Parliament ultimately rejected the Law Commission&#8217;s proposal of a statutory general authority and opted for the same approach as under the previous law by creating in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> a statutory defence to protect all persons who carry out acts in connection with the care or treatment of an incapacitated adult, provided they reasonably believe that it will be in that person&#8217;s best interests for the act to be done. Crucially, however, all persons who provide such care and treatment are expected to look to the Code. Certain categories of person are required by the statute, under section 42(4), to have regard to the Code (for example, anybody acting in relation to the incapacitated person in a professional capacity). In addition, however, as the Code itself makes clear, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> applies more generally to everyone who looks after incapacitated persons, including family carers.

That does not, however, justify the appointment of family members as deputies simply because they are able and willing to serve in that capacity. The words of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(4)</ref> are clear. They do not permit the court to appoint deputies simply because &#8220;it feels confident it can&#8221; but only when satisfied that the circumstances and the decisions which will fall to be taken will be more appropriately taken by a deputy or deputies rather than by a court, bearing in mind the principle that decisions by the courts are to be preferred to decisions by deputies. Even then, the appointment must be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. It would be a misreading of the structure and policy of the statute, and a misunderstanding of the concept and role of deputies, to think it necessary to appoint family members to that position in order to enable them better to fulfil their role as carers for P.&#8221; </span></p>
