Given the importance of transparency in the family courts and the level of public interest in cases such as this, I considered that the case should be heard in open court in part, subject to an appropriate RRO, but in private when DV and his parents gave evidence. The parties agreed, and I have made a RRO prohibiting publication of information which would identify the name and address of the Trust, the hospital, the names of the treating clinicians (to be referred to as Dr A, B, C and D only), and DV&#8217;s name and the names of his family.  </p>

First, DV is 17 years and 4 months old, and soon to be 18.  Secondly, the risk of an adverse event, a risk he has chosen to take, is very small, only1%. Those I accept are powerful points. The third is that the nature of DV&#8217;s treatment may only be life extending rather than curative. I do not think that last point is a point of weight. It seems to me not to go to the issues that I have to determine and, in any event, might be based on a false assumption.  </p>

It is not for the court to make the decision for DV. And finally, says Mr Brady, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> Family Law Act 1969, DV has the power to consent to treatment himself, and having given his consent the treatment is lawful without the need for further authorisation from the court.  </p>

The clinicians find it a finely balanced decision in circumstances where, firstly, they are acting against their training and instinct by determining in advance that they will not avail themselves of what might be a lifepreserving form of treatment, and secondly, they wish the court to make the decision. Thirdly, this is not in any sense a trivial decision, and to see the difficulty, look what happened on 1 March 2021 where the procedure was planned, but did not take place for the reasons given. Fourthly, the court has the power to make the decision about medical treatment which may or may not have the consent of the young person, and even a 17 year old does not have the absolute right to determine what his or her treatment should be, and to provide that, even in these relatively non-contentious circumstances, a minor has the right to decide his treatment overthrows decades of legal authority.  </p>
