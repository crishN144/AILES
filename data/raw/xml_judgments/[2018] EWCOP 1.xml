	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">JM, </span>I concluded that applications made for welfare orders to authorise a deprivation of their liberty on the basis that they are not contentious should be stayed when no family member or friend is available for appointment as P&#8217;s Rule 3A representative.  I also concluded that the Crown should be joined as a Respondent.  This was because I concluded that central government, and in particular the Ministry of Justice (the MoJ), is primarily responsible for providing the resources needed to enable the Court of Protection (the COP) to adopt an Article 5 compliant and fair procedure.  Also, that joinder enabled the MoJ (and the Department of Health - the DoH) to &#8220;put their money where their mouth was&#8221; by identifying professionals ready willing and able to act as Rule 3A representatives in the stayed cases and thereby establish the solution they had maintained local authority (and other) applicants could provide, but I had concluded was not practically available.</p>

Over a year later, in letters sent in late March and early April 2017 to applicants in stayed cases the Government Legal Department (the GLD) indicated that Ministers had agreed to provide funding to HMCTS to enable greater use of visitors by the COP.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In those earlier cases, I have also discussed the advantage of having a Rule 3A representative who can keep P&#8217;s placement and needs under review and if necessary trigger a return to court, and whether a professional Rule 3A representative would be able to do this independently and so not as a part of his role in the provision of the care package (see paragraph 150 of <span style="font-style:italic">JM </span>and paragraph 252 of <span style="font-style:italic">NRA</span>). I have also recognised that if P was joined as a party this level and type of review would be outside the role of a litigation friend (and probably an accredited legal representative) and that properly informed and sufficiently frequent periodic reviews by the court may be sufficient (see paragraph 252 and 261 of <span style="font-style:italic">NRA </span>and paragraph 150 of <span style="font-style:italic">JM</span>).  Such periodic reviews would form part of the procedure advanced by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X </span>(i.e. joining P as a party) and I accept that they would accord with Baroness Hale&#8217;s description of &#8220;a periodic independent check&#8221; in paragraph 57 of her judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West.</span></p>

In comparison to the appointment of a family member or friend as a Rule 3A representative it can be said to have advantages because of the independence and expertise of the visitor but disadvantages because of the absence of a more regular review on the ground by someone who knows P and wants to promote their best interests.</p>

It leaves open whether challenges to decisions made under that scheme will be to the COP or a tribunal.  But, by definition, such challenges will involve a dispute.  So, if and when this proposal is implemented the existing problems for the COP in uncontested cases will no longer exist.  However, in my view this does warrant an approach that seeks to avoid the existing problems relating to how these cases are dealt with by the COP.  Firstly, because the problems exist, the recommendation may not be accepted and enacted and, if it is, it will be some time before it is implemented.  Secondly, the success of that recommendation will inevitably be influenced by the resources provided to implement it and so the response to Recommendation 33 relating to the need to review the adequacy of representation which mirrors the constructive discussions I urged in <span style="font-style:italic">JM.  </span>It follows that such constructive discussions aimed at providing a professional resource to assist P would inform any proper implementation of Recommendation 33.  </p>

He is now well settled there.  He has a 24/7 package of care.  He is mobile but needs support with all daily tasks including personal care, eating, medication and accessing the community, although he has accessed the local shop on his own on the basis that if he did not return in 30 minutes staff would look for him.  If this support was not provided there would be a risk he would be at risk of harm from self-neglect and from others in and away from his placement and that he may abscond.  He was removed from the family home in May 2011 on the basis of alleged physical and emotional abuse from his mother.</p>

The issues that founded the orders for supervised contact and the history of contact mean that his parents should not be appointed as his Rule 3A representative and no other family member has been identified (e.g. sister) who could be.</p>
