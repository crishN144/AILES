He was visibly upset during the Hearing and told me that he would like to seek a compromise and find a constructive way forward to bring these lengthy proceedings to an end, which he recognised are emotionally damaging to all concerned, including L.  He would withdraw his application for direct contact if the Mother would agree to continuing indirect contact via phone calls and messages.  He opposes further disclosure of the fact finding Judgment to third parties.  He says that his work does not bring him into contact with children or vulnerable adults, and that his new military role involves him managing a platoon of soldiers.  He points out that he has been subject to, and cooperated with a protracted police investigation of the Mother&#8217;s criminal allegations of rape.</span></p>

I forwarded it to the solicitor for the Guardian shortly after receipt, but not to the Father who is in person.  In it the Mother raises a host of matters without notice to the Court or parties.   She seeks to reduce L&#8217;s interim indirect contact with his Father, seeks to adduce an evidential statement from an ISVA, and seeks a new finding of post-separation abuse by the Father resulting from the Father&#8217;s recent expressions of conflict about whether to continue his application for direct contact.   As she did before the High Court, the Mother strongly opposes the Guardian&#8217;s suggestion that the Court should direct Part 25 expert assessment of her current PTSD symptoms in order to inform its assessment pursuant to PD12J paragraph 36(2)(b), 36(3) and paragraph 37.  However, in apparent conflict with that opposition, she now raises an intention to seek intermediary assessment.</span></p>

Disclosure to a regulatory body will trigger a process which is very likely to have well-established protections for the individual whose fitness to practise is under investigation and where the court can be confident that its disclosure will be carefully safeguarded.  The same protections and process are, in reality, unlikely to be replicated for each and every employer. Additionally, disclosure to a regulatory body will also impose on the individual an obligation to inform his or her employer and will also trigger an investigation in which contact will be made very quickly with an employer. Thus, employers are likely to be informed as part of a process which, as it should, protects the rights of those whose fitness to practise their profession is under scrutiny</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">.&#8221;</span></p>
