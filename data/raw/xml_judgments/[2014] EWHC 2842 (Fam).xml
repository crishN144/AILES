Her mother, C F, had gone to work early on the morning of 29th June, leaving N in the care of the First Respondent, M B and her partner, the Second Respondent, M K.

The Local Authority, the City and County of Swansea, instituted care proceedings in relation to V on 3rd July 2013, alleging that V was at risk of significant harm because of the non-accidental injuries that they allege had been caused to N by the Mother or the Father.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Initially, the Local Authority included N&#8217;s mother, C F as a possible perpetrator of the injuries to N.  Following expert medical evidence that ruled her out from having any involvement in the injuries to her daughter, I gave the Local Authority permission to withdraw the care proceedings in relation to N on 20th January 2014.  It follows that I have been solely concerned with the care proceedings relating to V.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority&#8217;s case is that the injuries to N were caused by a shaking injury inflicted by one or other of the parents of V.  In final submissions, it suggested that, on the balance of probabilities, it was more likely to have been the Father.  Moreover, it was argued that, if I am able to identify the perpetrator, the other parent failed to protect in that he or she was immediately aware that N had been caused serious injury but failed to inform medical staff of what he or she knew and then acted in concert with the other parent to put forward a false story to the court.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The parents&#8217; case is that I should find that N collapsed as a result of an ALTE (Apparent Life Threatening Event), possibly as a result of a coryzal (cold) virus that she was suffering.  They argue that I should find, in accordance with the evidence of Professor Wyatt that the very serious injuries she suffered were, in all probability, caused by a resuscitative shake that the Mother may have administered to N in panic and confusion following N&#8217;s collapse.  If I find that this was not the case, they each say that they did not shake N and did not see the other do so either.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I should make it clear that I accept that, if I was to find that this was a resuscitative shake, the threshold criteria pursuant to the Children Act would not have been made out.  The issue, however, is whether it was an abusive shake prior to collapse or a resuscitative shake post collapse that went wrong.</p>

She says she has struggled to make sense of any motive or reason which may have led to an abusive shake.  She does say that I should give particular consideration to whether or not N was roughly picked up from her pram, perhaps in circumstances where her head was unsupported.</p>

To establish the threshold criteria, I need to be satisfied that V is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm and that the harm or likelihood of harm is attributable to the care given to the child, or likely to be given if the order is not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give [<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref>].

If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof.  If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened.  If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened.&#8221;</span></p>

Sometimes the burden of proof will come to his rescue: the party with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied him that it did.

She changed N and took her downstairs.  She put her in her pram and says she was sound asleep when C left in a taxi just after 7 am.  </p>

The Mother says that all of a sudden she could hear N screaming and crying.  It was a very strange cry which was very difficult to describe.  She was gasping for breath, making a strange noise.  The Mother went to her and N looked as if she was about to choke. She then stopped breathing.  The Mother says she put her hand on her stomach and it was still.  N&#8217;s face was a very deep red colour and she then went very pale within a matter of seconds.  The baby was not moving and she could see white stuff in her nostrils.  She thought it might have been milk from her previous feed, although she later realised it was not milk as it was like what she had seen coming from her father&#8217;s nose when he had a brain tumour.  </p>

It is right that the Mother initially used her palm to perform the resuscitation but Mr D advised her to use three fingers instead.  I am satisfied that the initial use of the palm was not material to the injuries suffered by N.

His response to threshold dated 13th September 2013 says that the Mother was caring for N on the morning of 29th June but his statement and his Police interviews do not say that.  In his statement to this court, he accepts he went to the Polish shop to get some bread but says he was home by about 9.30 am.  He says he began to watch Toy Story in the living room with V.  Up until 10 am, N was asleep in her pram.  He says she woke at about 10 am with a scream.  He rocked her pushchair to try to soothe her but it did not do so.  It actually made her worse.  He picked her up to hold her and walked around the room with her, dancing or bouncing or singing to her.  He says her head was very red, which he thought was due to her screaming.  After about ten minutes, she stopped crying and he put her back in the pram.  He says the Mother prepared some milk for her and held N as she fed her.  She took some milk although he was not sure how much.  The Mother winded her and put her back in the pram.</p>

He asked the Mother if she wanted to take N instead but she then started to settle.  He put her down but she then started screaming again.  The Mother picked her up and he said he was going for a shower but as he did so, N made a noise like she was sucking in air or coughing and then stopped crying.  The Mother called him and said that N was not breathing.  He returned and N was no longer red but looked very pale.  The Mother put her on the sofa.  She was panicking and he was panicking.  He ran to the neighbours and the Mother came with him.  While the Mother and the neighbour were administering CPR, a white discharge came out of her nose.  </p>

Professor Lloyd considered that these were most likely to have been caused by shaking and this occurred at the same time as the collapse.  He does say that most experts consider it highly unlikely to have been caused by attempts to revive an unconscious child.  Mr Newman considered these extensive retinal haemorrhages were consistent with a shaking injury.  He also considered that any actions to rouse N when she was unwell would not result in retinal haemorrhages as identified and that it was very unlikely resuscitation alone would cause them either.  It may well be that both these experts are referring to general resuscitation techniques.

The first was that suggested by Dr Cartlidge, namely excessive and inappropriate shaking in an attempt to pacify N.  His second was an unexplained life-threatening collapse followed by a shake in an attempt to resuscitate.  He referred to Dutch research that indicated that a significant proportion of parents of babies admitted to hospital following an ALTE admitted shaking the baby in an attempt to resuscitate.  None of these children had suffered life changing brain injuries, although they did not have MRI scans.  I consider that this research does not therefore assist me, particularly as I do not know the level of force used.   </p>

He confirmed that the mechanism was a sharp move back and forward of the unsupported head with sudden acceleration and deceleration.  He conceded that it might only be one such movement although, the more times it happened, the greater was the opportunity for injury to be sustained.  He accepted that mainstream thinking is now that less force is required than was previously thought although he made the valid point that it cannot be normal force as otherwise such injury would be far more commonplace.  He said that it is not possible to be sure how much force is required as it has not been possible for researchers to do any tests on live babies.  He said that confession evidence in the USA suggested that such shaking may be done in an attempt to pacify and that it could succeed by inducing semi-consciousness until it went too far and caused serious injury or death.   </p>

I accept that ALTE incidents do occur and that, although they are extremely rare, they actually happen more often than a shaking injury.  Nevertheless, the Dutch study gave symptoms for what had occurred prior to the ALTE incident, namely excessive vomiting (25.5%); common cold (28.2%); feeding problems (19.1%); drowsy/in-alert (7.3%); fever (7.3%); recent vaccination (5.4%); apnea (5.5%); diminished growth (3.6%); excessive crying (2.7%); various illness (4.5%); diverse (14.5%).  Professor Wyatt placed significant emphasis on the symptoms of the Coryzal virus that N had been suffering.  Yet, the Mother&#8217;s evidence was that N had no significant symptoms that morning at all.  N seemed to have been getting over the virus and had been contented on the morning of 29th June.  Although the Father did refer to excessive crying, none of the other symptoms applied other than her having a common cold.  The apnea only took place at the time of the collapse itself. </p>

Ms M said she heard screaming and shouting in Polish from both partners.  Ms M said it stopped only after the Police arrived but the Police appear to have said that it was quiet by the time they got there.  There was disagreement between Ms M and Mr D as to whether or not Mr D was outside the back of the houses when the incident started or Ms M had to summon him.  All this does show the need for caution when considering evidence remembered from an incident that took place over 18 months ago.

They say that she would have used English words such as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">help</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">please</span>&#8221; to request this assistance.  An interpreter was called who told me that it was common for Polish people to use English words in speaking to each other.  I accept that this is the case with words such as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">football</span>&#8221; but I do not consider it likely with &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">help</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">please</span>&#8221; particularly given that the Mother&#8217;s grasp of English was not great in the summer of 2012.</p>

It is, however, relevant that the parents were prepared to lie to me about this.

These were concerned with things such as whether or not he put N in a swing that day and whether or not she started to have breathing problems on the sofa or in the pram.  He said in the first interview that he could not remember who had picked up N when they realised something was wrong.  He corrected this in his second interview to say it was the Mother.

She described to me the resuscitation techniques she used clearly and without any difficulty as to her recall of what had occurred.  She said she pressed five times on her chest and blew into her mouth five times.

I consider it is inconceivable that this would have been before she had picked the baby up.  She then added that he had gone by the time she was resuscitating N but this was not her case in her written evidence where she makes it pretty clear that the Father ran to the neighbour after she took N in her arms and started to resuscitate her on the sofa by breathing into her mouth.  The Father had said in his first Police interview that they had had a conversation after N collapsed.  At first, she told me she did not remember this conversation. She then said it definitely had not taken place.

He did accept that, prior to the incident, he tried to take N as little as possible as, he said, she had two mothers (C and the Mother) and that was enough.

I simply do not accept that this could account for the injuries in an accidental way.  If so, numerous children would be injured.

I accept that the Father has had less experience of handling an infant but I am struck by the fact that he has been more honest to me than the Mother about the difficulties faced that morning.  In short, I cannot choose between them.  One of them has caused these injuries and the other knows which one.

These parents were ostensibly good parents and one would not have had any cause to prevent the other from handling either V or N, even taking into account the Father&#8217;s earlier nervousness.  There is a failure to protect, however, in the refusal to tell the truth either to the medical professionals at the time or to this court.  The failure to tell the medical professionals could have harmed N further, although it did not do so as a matter of fact.  The failure to tell me and pretend that nothing untoward happened protects a carer who has done something very wrong and makes it less likely that the court will find the truth and be able to protect V or any future baby of these parents.</p>
