	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">Some eighteen years ago, Ms Behbehani (the second respondent in these proceedings) issued financial claims against her former husband in the context of ongoing divorce proceedings in this jurisdiction. Those claims were resolved as the result of a judgment delivered by Parker J in November 2008 in the Family Division of the High Court following a contested hearing.  The judge found that Mr Behbehani (who has taken no part in these proceedings) had failed to make full and frank disclosure of his financial resources.  His assets were found to be in the order of &#163;44 million including a 99.14% holding through ownership of two Irish companies in a Spanish company called Setubal 97 SL (&#8220;Setubal&#8221;).  That company owned a valuable property portfolio including a golf course which was known as the Santa Clara Development. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">By her order at the conclusion of the financial proceedings, Parker J awarded Ms Behbehani a sum of &#163;20 million together with interim periodical payments pending payment in full and her costs.  She made a freezing order over up to &#163;20 million of Mr Behbehani&#8217;s assets to assist in enforcement.  Nine years later, in July 2017, and in the absence of any payments and/or compliance with the order by Mr Behbehani, Parker J made further orders which were designed to assist Ms Behbehani in her attempts to enforce payment.  One of those orders was a receivership order with a view to realising value in the Setubal shares which Ms Behbehani claimed then to be worth some &#8364;70 million.  The matter was not without complication since one of the judge&#8217;s original findings had been that Mr Behbehani&#8217;s interest in Setubal lay in his beneficial ownership of the shares but not the underlying assets.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">The applicants are professional receivers who were appointed by the court in July 2017 under the terms of a receivership order in relation to the shares in Setubal.  Following their appointment they immediately secured registration and recognition of the receivership order in Ireland in respect of a sum of up to &#163;6.219 million.  For a period of about eighteen months in 2018/2019, the receivership order was discharged pending a challenge in the Court of Appeal by an individual who claimed that it was he, and not Mr Behbehani, who was the ultimate beneficial owner of the Setubal shares.  That challenge was unsuccessful.  The appeal was dismissed and the receivership order reinstated in December 2019.  However, the issue and resolution of the appeal created a significant hiatus in the receivership.  For a period of over a year, the professional role of the applicants was put &#8216;on ice&#8217;; the receivership was effectively discharged whilst a decision was awaited from the Court of Appeal.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">The uncontradicted evidence of Mr Short, one of the Former Receivers, is that the appointment was accepted by the applicants on the clear basis that the potentially significant costs and disbursements which were likely to be incurred in several jurisdictions during the period of the receivership would be underwritten in full as ongoing disbursements by Mrs Bebehani and/or Mr Barroso, the partner with whom she was then living.  Whilst it is not accepted to be a &#8220;family office&#8221; as such, it is acknowledged within these proceedings that Mr Barroso, whilst not a practising lawyer himself, owns or operates HA Law, the firm through which Ms Behbehani has been pursuing her enforcement proceedings against her former husband and, as a consequence, the current proceedings involving the applicants.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">Mr Short has filed a number of witness statements in these proceedings explaining that, despite protracted correspondence passing between them, neither Mr Barroso nor Ms Behbehani provided the promised funds to discharge, or reimburse, the costs which were incurred in the early stages of the receivership.  As a result, the applicants faced what was described as a real threat of debt recovery actions against them in their personal capacities. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">During the early part of 2020, at a time when the original receivership order had been discharged to await the outcome of the decision in the Court of Appeal, it appears that six of the offshore properties were sold for c. &#8364;5.569 million.  They were heavily mortgaged to a local bank and produced just under &#8364;786,000 in terms of available equity.  It appears to have been agreed at the time that this had no effect on the underlying value of the shares in Setubal as the equity reflected in the company&#8217;s balance sheet was converted into cash.  Since then Ms Behbehani has filed a sworn witness statement in these proceedings in which she claims to have acquired property formerly belonging to Mr Behbehani which is worth in the order of &#163;10 million.  There is no reliable up-to-date evidence before this court in relation to (i) the extent of her recovery through the enforcement mechanisms available to her in various jurisdictions, and/or (ii) the extent of her own financial position save that, as I shall explain, she claims to be in a position of substantial illiquidity at the present time.  She has not provided any evidence as to how she has applied funds already recovered in partial satisfaction of the 2008 order.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">With the receivership order reinstated by the Court of Appeal in December 2019 and with the process of realising Setubal&#8217;s assets apparently underway, on 11 December 2020 Ms Behbehani issued a claim against the applicants by which she sought an order that the Former Receivers transfer to her the Setubal shares for nil consideration.  By this time, the costs incurred by the applicants in relation to their time in office were estimated to be approaching &#163;400,000.  It appears to be accepted without challenge that, subject only to the assessment of the quantum of those costs, nothing had been paid on account in what the Former Receivers allege to be a clear breach of the terms of their appointment and retainer.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">That application came before me on 20 May 2021.  By that stage Ms Behbehani had advertised an intention to sue the applicants in respect of their alleged professional negligence.  The claim was then unparticularised.  She was represented on that occasion by experienced counsel, Mr Charles, instructed by HA Law.  Following discussion between the parties, I was told by Mr Charles that his client no longer intended to pursue her application for a formal transfer of the Setubal shares.  That position was reflected by a formal recital in the order which I approved at the conclusion of that hearing.  With no clear formulation of how the advertised claim in negligence was being formulated, I acceded to the request advanced by Mr Chichester-Clark on behalf of the applicants that I should make an &#8216;unless&#8217; order so as to crystallise all outstanding matters and issues between them.  I provided in my order that the Former Receivers would be released from all liability regarding their conduct of the Receivership unless Ms Behbehani filed and served particulars or points of claim against them within three months, i.e. by 20 August 2021.  At the same time I granted Ms Behbehani&#8217;s application to appoint a new Receiver, Mr Darren Edwards, in place of the applicants since it was clear that the professional relationship between the parties had become unworkable.  Since it was agreed that the Former Receivers should be entitled to exercise a formal lien over the Setubal shares in respect of their outstanding costs and expenses, I ordered that, prior to any formal transfer of the shares, Mr Edwards in his capacity as the New Receiver must provide his professional predecessors with a charge over the shares up to a maximum value of &#163;400,000.  He was also required to give 28 days&#8217; formal notice of any intention on his part, or instruction from Ms Behbehani, to transfer the shares.  On that occasion I accepted Ms Behbehani&#8217;s undertaking to the court to pay forthwith a sum equivalent to the value of any assets she received or derived from the transfer of the shares up to a value of &#163;400,000.</p>

After correspondence between the solicitors, that application was compromised on the basis of a formal undertaking given by Mr Edwards that he would not transfer the shares to Ms Behbehani without a further order from the court.  On the basis of that undertaking, I adjourned the injunction application with liberty to restore.</p>

In that notice she claimed to have suffered losses of between &#163;5 million and &#163;10 million as a result of action, or inaction, on the part of the Former Receivers in their conduct of the Receivership.  On the same day she issued a further application seeking an extension of time for filing any points or particulars of claim against them so as to avoid the operation of the &#8216;unless&#8217; order which I had made on 20 May 2021.  She claimed in an accompanying witness statement that she required formal control of Setubal in order to further investigate its financial status in order to discover whether there had been a dissipation of assets so as to enable her to &#8216;contemplate [a] proper claim against [the Former Receivers] in order to prove their negligence and liability to me for allowing the dissipation of the assets from Setubal 97 SL during their appointment&#8217;.</p>

Following further legal argument on 28 July, I was told by Ms Behbehani&#8217;s counsel that, having made enquiries, his client would require a further &#8220;two or three months&#8221; properly to plead her claim in relation to quantum.  This was apparently on the basis that matters were being actively pursued in Spain and advice sought in that jurisdiction as to the potential merits of any claim.  </p>

It was submitted on her behalf that the court could not fairly dispose of the renewed application without expert evidence from a Spanish lawyer.  Because I was conscious, as I have been throughout, that these issues arise in the context of this former wife&#8217;s endeavours to enforce an English matrimonial order which remains extant, I ordered that she should have permission to file and serve expert evidence in relation to Spanish law and the adequacy of the charge as sufficient security for the Former Receivers&#8217; outstanding claim. In order to hold the balance in terms of fairness to both parties, I allowed her a short extension to the original three-month period of the &#8216;unless&#8217; order until the next hearing which was listed on 25 November 2021.</p>

Whilst Mr Chichester-Clark told me that this development was welcome, albeit very late in the day, there remained an issue about the adequacy of the security which was being offered.  That was to take the form of a formal charge over a particular Spanish property which had been identified by Ms Behbehani.  There was then no formal evidence before the court of the value of that property and it was not clear whether she was the registered owner of the property, it being her case that registration of ownership should have been completed by December 2021.  Further, it appeared that this would be a second charge ranking behind a first charge in favour of a Spanish bank.  As Mr Chichester-Clark made clear in his oral submissions on that occasion, the Former Receivers had always accepted that they would &#8216;drop out&#8217; of the picture once proper security was provided in respect of the outstanding costs of their Receivership.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">It is important at this juncture to note that the position adopted in these proceedings by the Former Receivers is not simply one of seeking security for an unpaid debt.  Their role as court-appointed Receivers brought with it certain legal duties and obligations not only in relation to Ms Behbehani but to other third parties as well.  The two Irish companies have rights in relation to the Setubal shares.  In principle, it is those corporate entities which are entitled to any proceeds of sale following satisfaction of whatever debt is found to be due to the Former Receivers.  As matters stand, the Former Receivers have a lien over those shares to protect their position.  Ms Behbehani is now the beneficial owner of the Irish companies and it is she who will be entitled to those surplus proceeds once the debt is paid.  But that entitlement will be quantified once the debts and expenses of the consequent liquidations and any claims of their respective creditors have been ascertained.</p>

On behalf of the Former Receivers, Mr Chichester-Clark submits that this process was significantly hindered by the fact that there was a wholesale change of personnel at HA Law with four separate fee-earners leaving the employ of that firm during 2021.  I accept that the lack of continuity in Ms Behbehani&#8217;s representation has not helped the smooth transition of this litigation.  Not only have there been frequent changes in terms of the individual solicitor(s) dealing with the matter internally at various stages of the litigation; there have also been frequent changes of counsel instructed at the previous hearings.  None of this has helped matters.  There have been instances when it has been plain to me that counsel instructed on Ms Behbehani&#8217;s behalf has not had full and complete instructions about what has transpired on a previous occasion.  These inconsistencies have been remedied both by the written transcripts of the hearings which have been made available for subsequent hearings and by reference to my own judicial notes.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">By this stage, Mr Edwards appeared to have relinquished his role as Receiver of the Setubal shares.  I had been told at a previous hearing that he had left the jurisdiction to take up residence in Brazil.  Mr Gary Thompson, the Third Respondent, was appointed in his place. The scheme envisaged by the draft order which was before the court on 7 March 2022 was that the newly appointed Third Receiver would adopt his predecessor&#8217;s undertaking to the effect that the Setubal shares, and their underlying value, would be preserved until further order of the court.  There would be no transfer of those shares to Ms Behbehani at this stage.  For her part, Ms Behbehani agreed to pay the costs, remuneration and expenses of the Former Receivers once the quantum of those costs had been agreed or determined pursuant to CPR Part 69.  In the meantime she agreed to provide sufficient security to protect their interest through a charge, or charges, on properties which she owned in Spain, or by some other agreed means, up to a limit of &#163;400,000.  On that basis, I was invited to make an injunction preventing either Ms Behbehani and/or Mr Thompson from transferring or otherwise dealing with the shares.  The share transfer application was to be adjourned on this basis with liberty to apply.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">Thereafter, and prior to any application to lift the injunction, Ms Behbehani was to ensure that reasonable security remained in place for so long as the debt to the Former Receivers, or any part of it, remained unpaid.  There was provision for evidence to be provided to the Former Receivers in relation to the value, prior encumbrances and title to any real property offered as alternative security for the debt.  Once the debt had been discharged, the Former Receivers would be required to sign a certificate confirming that the costs of the receivership had been paid in full (the Schedule 2 certificate).  Once lodged with the court, Ms Behbehani was to be entitled to apply on the papers for the discharge of the injunction preventing any dealings with the shares.  A draft order was to be appended to the order (the Schedule 1 order).  She would thereafter be entitled to require the Receiver to transfer to her the Setubal shares.</p>

The formal concession that the Former Receivers should have security for their professional costs may have come very late in the day (on the eve of the hearing on 25 November 2021) but it has come nonetheless, and no doubt on good advice.  For my part, I would not have left the Former Receivers exposed in terms of their outstanding costs whilst quantum was either agreed or adjudicated.  It is right to note that Ms Behbehani said as long ago as December 2020 when she issued her first application for the transfer of the shares that she was willing to consider providing security subject to assessment of those costs.  That position did not find reflection in any clear open proposals until 24 November 2021 on the eve of the November hearing when there was plainly insufficient time to identify the sufficiency or nature of the security offered.  It was nevertheless progress.</p>

It relates to how the Former Receivers&#8217; costs (up to &#163;400,000, subject to formal assessment) are to be paid.  It is Ms Behbehani&#8217;s case that payment must be deferred until she is in a position to liquidate the shares or, alternatively, declare a substantial dividend or similar payment from Setubal.  Mr Chichester-Clark has drafted the order on the basis that the costs of the Receivership shall be paid to the Former Receivers within14 days after the conclusion of the CPR r 69.7(5) assessment or, if later, within 14 days after the date on which they are able to certify that all outstanding costs have been paid and thus Ms Behbehani is entitled, under the scheme of the order, to apply to the court on paper for the lifting of the injunction preventing transfer to her of the Setubal shares.</p>

As I shall explain, the evidence which she has filed to date in these proceedings has been wholly unsatisfactory and I can only repeat that I have placed no reliance upon it.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">Ms Behbehani first raised the existence of a potential claim against the Former Receivers almost two years ago in July 2020.  She quantified that claim at between &#163;5 million and &#163;10 million.  In terms of developing that claim, little progress was made despite the fact that the Former Receivers were obliged to put their indemnity insurers on notice of its existence. The basis of the claim was initially put in this way:-</p>

Had Ms Behbehani not defaulted on her own obligations to fund the expenses and other disbursements incurred by the Former Receivers (relied on as a clear term of their Receivership), Mr Short expressed his belief that the shares could, and would, have been realised.  Further, for a significant period of time between 2017 and 2019, there had been a hiatus in their status as Receivers because of the appeal from the order of Parker J in July 2017.  The application to set aside the Receivership order was made in September 2017, their appointment was discharged, and it was not reinstated by the Court of Appeal until 20 December 2019.</p>

Further, whilst the completion of those sales took place as scheduled in February 2020, there was no evidence that the company had suffered any loss or that the sales had any impact on the company&#8217;s balance sheet.

That was the position when the matter returned to court at the hearing before me on 20 May 2021.  She was represented by counsel at that hearing.  He conveyed to the court Ms Behbehani&#8217;s instructions that, at that point in time, she did not intend to pursue a claim against the Former Receivers.  That position was reflected in the recital to the order which I made on that date.  Nevertheless, despite what was in effect a concession that she was not intending to proceed with a formal claim at that point in time, her counsel sought a final extension in order to allow his client further time to make her enquiries and take advice on the position.</p>

On 9 July 2021 HA Law sent to Summit Law a preliminary notice of claim pursuant to the pre-action protocol together with a copy of Mr Donald&#8217;s report.  On the same date she issued a further application for a second extension of time to prepare her pleaded case.  With a hearing already listed to consider Ms Behbehani&#8217;s second Share Transfer application on 28 July 2021, I indicated through my clerk that I would list the application for further time to be considered at that hearing but that my provisional view was that any challenge to the earlier three month limit which I imposed was more properly the subject of an appeal rather than a second application for more time.</p>

I accept entirely that the hearing on 7 March this year was the first occasion on which he had appeared on her behalf.  By her own account, she has recovered at least &#163;10 million worth of property in Spain as well as shares in two offshore companies.  Her financial disclosure in terms of an ability to meet the order which the court has made is limited to a single sheet of paper with 12 lines presented as bullet points without any narrative explanation.  There is no accompanying statement of truth as to the contents.  It has not been signed.  She gives no explanation whatsoever about her current domestic arrangements or how she is funding her domestic economy given that she claims to have no income and cash of less than &#163;500<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

She does not provide any information about attempts which she might have made to raise a sum of &#163;40,000 against a property portfolio with a gross value of c. &#163;10 million.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">In the context of the <span style="font-style:italic">Denton </span>test, I regard the failure to make that payment on account of costs as a significant consideration.  I am also conscious of the fact that she is also arguably in breach of the time limit I stipulated as the very final concession for the filing and service of her pleaded case.  Whilst it might be argued on her behalf that she had taken all steps necessary to file her document with the court at the eleventh hour and that the default is merely technical, that has to be seen in the context of the successive indulgences which she has already been granted by the court.  My order from 20 May last year was quite clear:  she knew what had to be done and we are now more than a year further down the road in this litigation.  The Former Receivers are still without the contribution to their increasing costs which I directed they should have received many months ago. Far from this being a case where unreasonable deadlines have been imposed, Ms Behbehani has been extended a very significant degree of latitude in terms of her compliance with court orders and deadlines.  It is unfortunate that there has been a lack of consistency in terms of her legal representation and what appears to have been a revolving door in terms of the lawyers employed by HA Law to deal with her case.  But that is not something which should operate to prejudice the legitimate interests of the Former Receivers.   It is a curious feature of this case that I have no information as to how Ms Behbehani is funding her own legal costs at the present time given her current financial presentation.  It seems to me not unreasonable to infer that her legal costs are being defrayed one way or another by her current partner, Mr Barosso, who appears to be playing a significant role in pursuing, or assisting in the pursuance of, the enforcement of her matrimonial award.</p>

Ms Behbehani&#8217;s own witness statement prepared at about the same time confirmed that she had all the information she needed to formulate her claims. In addition, her failure to meet a costs order in respect of which default has now been ongoing for over a year in circumstances where the applicants are already owed up to &#163;400,000 and the absence of any proper or reliable explanation for her failure to comply with her obligations leads me to a clear conclusion that the applicants are entitled to the relief which they seek.</p>

However, the fact remains that there was no offer forthcoming in relation to the provision of alternative security until the evening before the hearing on 25 November last year.  This was a crucial element of her application.  It could and should have been the subject of careful thought and the formulation of an offer which would have allowed time in advance of that hearing for detailed consideration of the form and adequacy of the proposed security.  The Former Receivers were not afforded that opportunity.  The costs of the hearing were incurred.  I understand that matters have not moved on significantly, if at all, in the intervening months save for the proposals which are now reflected in the draft order submitted to the court (see paras 24 and 25).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">However, whatever the alleged shortcomings in Ms Behbehani&#8217;s approach to the conduct of this litigation, I see no proper basis on which to order indemnity costs in relation to the Share Transfer Application. I am satisfied that there was a proper basis for her application although it was unfortunate that its progress was not managed more efficiently by HA Law.  The fact is that a proposal has now been made to secure the interests of the Former Receivers.  Ms Behbehani must pay the costs but I am not going to penalise her further by requiring her to pay those costs on an indemnity basis. Ms Behbehani will pay the Former Receiver&#8217;s costs of these applications to be assessed on a standard basis, if not agreed.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">On 9 May 2022 Mr Kelmanson of Summit Law wrote to the court in relation to the ongoing assessment of the costs which were ordered to be paid pursuant to the order I made on 20 May 2021.  Ms Behbehani has failed to date to pay those costs and is thereby in ongoing default of my order.  In the circumstances, I am asked to consider making what would in effect be a free-standing debarring order preventing her from participating in that costs assessment process.  The concern in relation to her apparent disengagement arises also in relation to the further substantial payment on account which is included in the order which I have now approved.  Whilst she has apparently indicated through her counsel that she does not seek to resist such a further payment on account in principle, there is concern on the part of those acting for the Former Receivers that there may be further default on her part.  In these circumstances I am asked to consider the inclusion in my order of two further provisions:-</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">I have considered carefully whether to accede to that request.  If included, these provisions would necessarily need to be qualified by a liberty to apply.  These are essentially &#8216;without notice&#8217; debarring applications although Mr Kelmanson quite properly included HA Law in the distribution of his email of 9 May 2022.  Whilst I am keenly aware of the overriding objective and the need to limit appropriately and proportionately the time which the court can allocate to this case, I suspect that the inclusion of these additional orders would prompt just such an application by Ms Behbehani.  It could take many weeks to list a hearing and we would simply build further delay and expense into the litigation which now requires a swift resolution.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.29in">What I am prepared to say is this.  Court orders and time limits must be complied with.  The court&#8217;s decisions as reflected in its orders are not &#8216;invitations to treat&#8217;.  I expect Ms Behbehani to comply with the precise terms of my order.  I expect her to engage in a timely way with the ongoing process of the costs assessment in accordance with the requirements of CPR.  If she fails to do so, I will entertain a further application on the papers and, in these circumstances, she should expect the court to consider granting costs on an indemnity basis.</p>
