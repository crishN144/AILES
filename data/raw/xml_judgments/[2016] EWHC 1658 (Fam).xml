I am principally concerned with JA.  The boys are the adopted children of Mr. and Mrs. M, who I shall call the parents.  In dramatic circumstances, both the boys left the care of their parents on 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> May 2014 after JA arrived at school with a bleeding nose saying that he had been hit by his mother.

There was a s.47 investigation, during which both children complained </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">inter alia</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> that they had been regularly hit or smacked either by their mother or father, and that their mother had put soap into or onto their mouths.  JA described both boys being put under a cold shower, as he described it, as a punishment, and JK said that he was regularly physically restrained, told that he had had demons inside him.  Both boys expressed anger towards their parents.  JK said that he did not want to return home, as he did not feel safe.  The local authority accordingly convened a child protection conference in June 2014 and subsequently issued care proceedings.  The first interim care order was granted on 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August 2014 after, I believe, a contested hearing.</span></p>

That too was unsuccessful.  So, by 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September, they too also asked for him to be removed to a new foster home.  That too broke down, following a serious incident on  30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September.  JK said that he wanted to return home and, in consultation with the parents out of hours, he did so that evening.  That conduct replicated very closely the very sad and tragic circumstances which the boys had suffered whilst having been removed from their biological parents before they lived with the parents in this case.  </span></p>

Her advices were central to the planning, indeed the stance of the local authority.  I shall turn in more detail to her assessment and advices later.  But, in summary, she was strongly of the view that the unique combination of the extreme needs of both these boys and their behaviours and attitudes meant that neither could, nor indeed should, be returned to their parents.  She recommended that they should be placed separately, something which had arisen previously before they had been placed with their parents.  She recommended that JK be placed in a residential setting with therapeutic support, and JA with skilled, responsive and nurturing foster carers.</span></p>

The threshold triggers were agreed at the court door.  The short threshold document was apparently handed to the judge just before the hearing commenced, it is worth reflecting on what it says.  It is unusual, inasmuch as it sets out both parents&#8217; contentions, but, in a short form, it was perceived as a way of being able to move forward.  I insert p.A44 into this judgment and which is attached as Appendix 1.  </span></p>

A critical issue, therefore, was whether the relationship between JA and his parents could be rebuilt with appropriate support and interventions.  That necessarily involved the court determining whether there was any causal link between the deterioration in the boys&#8217; behaviour, post-adoption, and the parenting style and attitudes, as it was said to be and in set out indeed in the agreed threshold triggers.</span></p>

In fact, as the mother told me very poignantly, they were desperately upset that, in any sense, it could even be thought that they had caused harm, let alone significant harm, to either of these boys.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The local authority, supported by Dr. Horrocks, the social worker and the guardian, took the view that the parents had been determined to manage things in their own way, which whilst possibly, in part, was because of the desperate circumstances of the boys&#8217; early lives, was more because of the inappropriate, damaging, and punitive extent of the discipline meted out.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Essentially, before the County Court hearing, now nearly 18 months ago, Judge Yelton understandably proceeded from the agreed threshold statement and indeed the stated position of the parents.  He relied on the advices of Dr. Horrocks and concluded, having regard to the behaviour of both boys, that neither could be returned to the care of their parents.  He made a care order in respect of each of them.  The judgment did not seek to evaluate further the issues in the threshold statement. However good the intentions behind the agreed statement, having regard to the evidence which the court then heard, it seems to me clearly that it had to reconsider the factual foundation, in order to reach conclusions on a sound factual basis.</span></p>

It was, in fact, a kind judgment, from a very experienced judge.  However, at the root of this case concerning these two very damaged and vulnerable boys is not the parents&#8217; commitment, but whether there have been occasions, not just of occasional chastisement or over-chastisement, when JK&#8217;s behaviour was extreme and the parents were unsupported (which might therefore be explained as an understandable, if regrettable, response), but whether or not that behaviour was, in fact, something rather different, whether the parents had, in fact, implemented; a rigid, controlling, blinkered environment which they had created for these children.  The exact opposite to what these boys so obviously needed.</span></p>

It is said that they had responded to the very great challenges presented by the boys with a rigid and punitive regime, which went far beyond what could be considered strict and was, of itself, abusive conduct.  Further, it is argued (an expression used many times before me) that their conduct re-traumatised the boys.  The local authority, as a result, now invite the court to consider additional findings, these are contained in counsel&#8217;s closing submissions.</span></p>

It is said now that, if JA was provided with support, he could return to their care.  Indeed, the obvious corollary of that is that, had they had they had proper and effective support, the situation which arose now some time ago could and should have been avoided.  </span></p>

JK had a history of severely challenging behaviour towards female carers and figures, in particular.

Each new foster home disrupted, as successive carers were unable to cope with the boys&#8217; sustained and disturbed conduct.</span></p>

The mother and father are highly respectable professional people in their fifties.  They have a grownup family and felt drawn to the plight of the boys, feeling strongly that they could help them.  It is entirely easy, not just on an emotional level, but on a practical level, to understand why they should have thought so.</span></p>

It is recorded at that time that they received exemplary care from the parents.  Recent enquiry has exposed that, in fact, all was not as it had been thought to have been, all was far from well.  There were in fact great difficulties in relation to the boys&#8217; behaviour, JK in particular, and, as the mother described to me, some of her style of discipline, which I will come to later, was of a nature and to a degree that indeed, had the local authority been aware of it, it is probable that the continued placement, let alone adoption, may not, in fact, ultimately have been approved.</span></p>

A significant plank of his case in relation to support has, in fact, fallen away, in the sense that the evidence clearly shows that no report or request was ever made to the local authority, either Cambridgeshire or the originating authority, for assistance, help or support, other than a request to the general practitioner in April 2014, but was not, for one reason or another, pursued, and in any event, as counsel now accepts, is not part of the parents&#8217; case.  </span></p>

The court, therefore, does not have to consider s.4 of the Adoption and Children Act.  Nor does it have to consider the major plank of the argument which was placed before the Court of Appeal and which led substantially to the order for a rehearing.  It is not something that was pursued in final argument before me, or indeed was pursued by the parents during the case.  Their stance was an entirely different one.

They have sought to put their case at the centre of political campaigning by the Christian Legal Centre and an associated body, asserting that they were treated with suspicion and prejudice because of their Christian faith, that they were treated as if they were not the real parents, and that the secretive nature of the family courts means that these injustices are covered up.</span></p>

She concluded that he was confused, equating violence or a sense of fear, at least, with love.

They were highly motivated to help, and they felt, in a way which I completely understand, in a position to be able to do so.  </span></p>

Was there some link between the behaviour or the boys, as it transpired, and the parenting style?  Does the evidence demonstrate that that is something which has caused or contributed to their behaviours?  The clear, unequivocal and overwhelming answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;.  The extreme nature and extent of the behaviours of the parents is such that it is obvious that the parents&#8217; conduct has created this schism.  I have no doubt that the parents had the best intentions.  I have no doubt that, concentrating on the future, they endeavoured very much to try and provide a good home for them.  </span></p>

That seems to me to be the crucial question.  Before I consider that, I need to finally examine the parents&#8217; current attitudes.  As I have already said, this is the third occasion that there has been a judicial adjudication, but the views of the parents remain firm, un-eroded.  They provided a strict, rigid, harsh structure.  They indulged in behaviours and conduct, which the boys found uncomfortable, distressing, frightening and ultimately completely undermining and overwhelming.  I doubt any child in the modern world would have ultimately reacted very differently.</span></p>

It was what Dr. Horrocks described as a coercive imbalance, and it is that total lack of real sensitivity which ultimately really troubles me and is decisive.  It is what most people would call empathy, and it was that harshness, that lack of empathy which led to the breakdown.
