That case concerned an application for a care order under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, but the principles plainly apply to proceedings under the Mental Capacity Act in general and the assessment of the functional test under s.2 in particular.  In other words, when assessing the ability of P to (a) understand the information relevant to the decision (b) retain that information, and (c) use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision, the court must consider all the evidence, not merely the views of the independent expert.  In many cases, perhaps most cases, the opinion of the expert will be confirmed by the other evidence, but inevitably there will be cases where the court reaches a different conclusion.  When taking evidence from P herself, the court must plainly be careful about assessing the capacity to understand, retain and use and weigh up information, but, whilst acknowledging the important role for expert evidence, the assessment is ultimately a matter for the court.&#8221;</span></p>

She identified a number of factors present which point to such a diagnosis including a pre-occupation with conspiratorial explanations, a sense of personal rights out of keeping with his actual situation and a tendency to excessive self-importance.  She acknowledges, however, that there are some difficulties in making a clear diagnosis because (i) there are cultural and regional variations in the manifestations of personality, (ii) there is little or no evidence of his pre-morbid personality and (iii) it is possible that some of his personality traits may be attributable either to the effects of starvation itself or to another condition such as delusional disorder.  </span></p>

The psychological symptoms are often very subtle and may be difficult to detect if the patient avoids talking about the matters which suggest that he has the disorder.  In this case, once he had realised that he had expressed beliefs which had raised concerns, Dr. A. became reluctant to talk about them.  Dr. WJ acknowledged that there are difficulties in making a diagnosis of delusional disorder in the context of the widespread suspicion and accusations about the activities of the Iranian Government.

Dr JW conducted an exhaustive review of the medical records and interviewed Dr. A. with the assistance of an interpreter.  He found evidence of rigid thinking, persecutory delusions and a possible abnormality of mood.  As these abnormal mental processes and behaviours were present during the period of profound weight loss, he accepted that it was therefore difficult to attribute them unequivocally to a condition unrelated to that loss.  He noted, however, that Dr. A&#8217;s thinking became more flexible and his fixed beliefs abated when he was treated with olanzapine and returned when this treatment ceased.  On a balance of probabilities, therefore, he concluded that Dr. A. was suffering from a delusional disorder and as a result there was an impairment of and/or a disturbance in the function of his mind or brain within the meaning of the MCA.  </span></p>

Dr. WJ drew attention, in particular, to the account in that document of a theft of money whilst he was in Malaysia which he said had been attributed to the Iranian Intelligence Services by the Malaysian Police; an assertion that, while in Cambridge, he had come under pressure to go to Iran to speak to the Supreme Religious Leader; and his assertion that he had been &#8220;subjected to major intentional food poisoning&#8221; on two occasions designed &#8220;to scare me and drive me toward Khamene&#8217;i&#8217;s mercenaries.&#8221;  Having read this document and discussed it with Dr. A., Dr. WJ felt that it was consistent with a delusional disorder.

When asked about the Will, he said that &#8220;in Farsi we tend to exaggerate&#8221;.  Had he known that people would take the statements in the Will so seriously, he would not have written them.  In response to detailed questions about the contents of that document, however, he substantially reiterated his assertions about the events in Malaysia, the actions of Iranian Intelligence Services, the pressure put on him by people in Cambridge to return to Iran and the incidents of food poisoning, and in some respects elaborated upon them.  </span></p>

I accept that the Will provides particularly pertinent evidence of the disorder dating, as it does, from a period when he was not on hunger strike.  I also accept that, as a result of his delusional disorder, Dr. A. lacks the capacity both to litigate and to make decisions about nutrition and hydration and associated treatment.  In reaching that conclusion I have of course considered carefully whether his actions are indeed attributable to his mental disorder or merely an extremely unwise action based on a genuine, but misguided, misunderstanding as to the way in which the British authorities and in particular the UKBA operate.  It is not uncommon for people to go on hunger strike in the hope that the Government will be forced to change its policy.  Hunger strikes are a legitimate form of political protest.  Not all hunger strikers are suffering from a mental disorder.  In this case, however, I am satisfied that Dr. A. is suffering from a delusional disorder and that this impairs the functioning of his brain by affecting his ability to use or weigh up information relevant to his decision whether or not to accept nourishment.  </span></p>

In this case, there is no dispute that subjecting Dr. A. to forcible feeding amounts to a deprivation of liberty.  In order to feed him he will be physically restrained by NHS staff against his will while a nasogastric tube is inserted.  The restraint continues to prevent him removing the tube.  On occasions, in this process, he is sedated.  He is not allowed to leave the hospital.  The staff are effecting complete control over his care, treatment and movements, and, as a result, he loses a very significant degree of personal autonomy.  </span></p>

If clinicians are in a position where a physical problem only incidentally connected to the mental health disorder could be treated under that section, there is, says Miss Paterson, a perceived risk that the number of patients under section may increase.  Such a development would be therapeutically undesirable as doctors prefer, wherever possible, to treat patients informally rather than under section in the hope that a patient will engage with treatment if acting voluntary.  Generally, Miss Paterson told me, there is anxiety about the absence of clarity in this area because it is something with which doctors have to grapple every day.  In addition Miss Paterson reminds me that the remedies for a patient detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of the MHA are either to challenge the section or to seek a judicial review of the proposed treatment.

That decision is, of course, flawed in part because his mental disorder deprives him of the capacity to use and weigh information relevant to the decision.  The physical disorder is thus in part a consequence of his mental disorder, but, in my judgement, it is not obviously either a manifestation or a symptom of the mental disorder.

I recognise the need for identifying, where possible, a clear dividing line between what is and what is not treatment for a mental disorder within the meaning of the MHA; but I venture to suggest that in medicine, as in the law, it is not always possible to discern clear dividing lines.  In case of uncertainty, where there is doubt as to whether the treatment falls within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/12/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>, the appropriate course is for an application to be made to the court to approve the treatment.

It would help to ensure that patients with mental disorders are, so far as possible, treated informally rather than under section.  Finally, it ensures compliance with Article 8 and provides the patient with a more effective remedy than would otherwise be available, namely a forensic process to determine whether the treatment is in his best interests.  </span></p>

Despite the great efforts of counsel, I am far from satisfied that all the consequences of their proposed reading in of words into section 16A have been fully identified.  It may be that, with further thought, an alternative reading or reinterpretation may seem prevalent.
