The Deceased died intestate and domiciled in England and Wales.  By an order dated 11 July 2023 a District Probate Registrar in the Newcastle District Probate Registry ordered that letters of administration in the Deceased&#8217;s estate should issue to one of his sons Stephen King (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">Stephen</span>&#8221;). Pursuant to that order a grant of letters of administration in the Deceased&#8217;s estate was issued to Stephen on 7 August 2023.</p>

Conflicts may arise in a number of different ways.  <span style="font-style:italic">Tristram &amp; Coote </span>at [14.21] makes reference to the ancient case of <span style="font-style:italic">Budd v Silver </span> (1813) 2 Phillimore 115 where the court refused a grant in circumstances where the deceased&#8217;s estate had a claim against the son of the applicant.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Where circumstances exist that plainly demonstrate that an applicant is unsuitable to carry out the role of administrator, or is under a significant conflict of interest, then the task of the Court may be relatively straightforward.  However, where the position is more finely balanced it may be difficult to choose between the competing claims of two applicants.  In my judgment, in such circumstances, the court has two effective options before it:</p>

Such discretion is at large and although the factors identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Tristram &amp; Coote</span> may provide some assistance in some cases; in other cases they may not.  Factors such as the views of a majority of the beneficiaries may carry weight on the facts of one case, but may be less important in another.  The selection of the administrator is ultimately a matter for the registrar or judge taking into account the totality of the evidence before them;</p>

Administration by an independent professional administrator will inevitably prove more expensive than administration by a lay administrator and this will need to be taken into account.  Not every dispute between rival applicants requires the court to appoint an independent administrator.  Equally though, the imposition by the court of an independent professional to administer the estate may remove a source of contention and enable a more objective approach to be brought to bear.</p>

My view (had I been required to decide this point) is that the decision of the Registrar to accept this statement (and to take further steps to ensure that Stephen did confirm its contents with a statement of truth) was well within the ambit of her broad case management discretion and is not open to criticism.</p>

Stephen placed a value for probate on this property of &#163;320,000 despite having received a written valuation for the property from an estate agent of between &#163;280,000 and &#163;290,000.  He was asked about this in his oral evidence and his explanation is that he received a further oral valuation placing a value of &#163;320,000 on the property.  I accept that valuation is an art rather than a science, and there is likely to be a range of acceptable values for a particular property at any given time. However, I was not wholly convinced by Stephen&#8217;s explanation as to why a higher value than the written one provided by an estate agent was substituted in the IHT 400.  I am told that the property is now under offer for a price of &#163;300,000, so it seems that the value of &#163;320,000 included in the IHT 400 was likely to have been an overestimate.</p>

The applicable nil rate band in this case is &#163;500,000, so IHT at a rate of 40% will be payable on the balance of the Deceased&#8217;s estate over that amount.  On Stephen&#8217;s calculations the Deceased&#8217;s net estate amounted to &#163;528,366.55 leading to an IHT bill of &#163;11,346.  </p>

However, in his oral evidence Stephen accepted that he has been living in the property and had not been paying any occupation rent.   He explained this contradiction in his evidence on the basis that in his statement he had meant that he had no intention of &#8220;residing permanently&#8221;.    This indeed was the thrust of the allegation made by Philip in his statement of 26 September to which Stephen was responding  &#8211; that Stephen&#8217;s occupation would prevent a sale of the property from taking place.  However, Stephen&#8217;s written statement was at best incomplete, and potentially misleading.  Nonetheless, I am satisfied by Stephen&#8217;s actions in placing the property on the market that does not intend to live in the property permanently and will ensure that vacant possession is provided on a sale.  I am not in a position to determine whether the estate is likely to have a claim for an occupation rent against Stephen, or what the quantum of such a claim might be. </p>

The claim is denied; the sum involved is small (the costs of establishing liability would be significantly more than the sum in issue) and the claim appears stale as this son has emigrated and been living in Australia for the last seven years.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Extraordinarily, there is even dispute over the whereabouts of Philip&#8217;s old school reports.  These were in the Deceased&#8217;s property and at some point, after the Deceased&#8217;s death Stephen told Philip that he had had a bonfire.  Stephen&#8217;s explanation (which was before the Registrar) was that he had told Philip that he was welcome to collect these documents, but after repeated requests by Philip that he send them to him, Stephen &#8220;joked&#8221; that he had had a bonfire.  I am not convinced that this was in fact intended as humour on Stephen&#8217;s part.  In my view the comment was in fact a symptom of the difficulties that plainly exist between these two brothers.  However, Stephen confirmed to both me and to the Registrar that these documents are safe and remain in the Deceased&#8217;s property.</p>

Philip has made an unparticularised allegation that Stephen stole cash from the Deceased&#8217;s house (vehemently denied by Stephen).  He has contended that Stephen has caused complete distrust by acting unilaterally and has made &#8220;deeply offensive comments, demonstrated overt animosity and intransigence&#8221;.    For his part Stephen alleges that Philip had been estranged from the Deceased for many years.  His version of events is that Philip has kept demanding Stephen to do exactly as he was told and that Philip is the one who had been unreasonable and difficult through the entire process.  Philip insists upon communication through e-mail and Mr Thorpe (for Stephen) indicated that Philip sends several emails a day in relation to the administration of the estate.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are three options open to me in this case.  I could appoint either Philip or Steven as administrator, or I can pass over the claims of both of them and appoint an independent professional administrator.  That latter course has obvious attraction and at the conclusion of the hearing I asked both parties to provide me with the name of an independent administrator that they would propose for appointment should I decide on that course.  Stephen provided me with the names of two firms of solicitors.  Philip has not provided me with any proposed candidate.</p>

I do not consider that he is capable of undertaking the task in a proportionate or constructive manner.  The role of personal representative is fiduciary in its nature and requires the individual appointed to act for the benefit of the estate as a whole.  Having regard to the manner in which Philip has conducted these proceedings (both before the Registrar and before me) I have no confidence that Philip would be able to take on this role.  The number and nature of the complaints raised by Philip (both in relation to the substantive issue of Stephen&#8217;s appointment and the manner in which the Registrar took her decision) have demonstrated to me that Philip, although no doubt a clever man, has no ability to discriminate between the important and the unimportant, the relevant and the irrelevant, or between the good point and the bad.  Put bluntly, I do not consider that Philip would be able to separate the wood from the trees and I do not consider it advisable to place him control of the administration of the estate.</p>

Yet the alleged quantum of the claim is sufficiently small (no more than &#163;5,000 in the context of an estate worth approximately &#163;500,000) that any litigation over this sum would be entirely disproportionate.</p>

He has complained that the fact that Stephen has instructed a different firm of solicitors, Meridian Private Client LLP, to represent him within this litigation is a breach of that order.  It is not.  I am told that Dixon Alderton remain instructed in the administration of the estate.  It seems to me entirely unobjectionable that Stephen in his personal capacity is represented by a different firm of solicitors in this contentious litigation, and the fact that Philip seeks to take such a point merely illustrates his lack of any sense of proportion to this litigation.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The principal advantage of leaving Stephen in place is that this is a relatively modest estate which may yet need to be divided among a relatively large number of beneficiaries.   The assets in the estate are limited (consisting of money in a UK bank, a property in Luton and a further property in St Vincent) and the steps required to realise and collect in the estate are relatively straightforward.    Since obtaining the grant, the UK property has been placed for sale and is now under offer, subject to contract.  Steps are also being taken to obtain a grant in St Vincent.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thus Mr Thorpe, for Stephen, makes the points that the appointment of an independent professional will slow down the administration of the estate and will incur substantial professional costs.  I recognise that there is significant force in this argument.  If I appoint an independent professional, then that person will have to familiarise themselves with the estate and duplicate some of the work that has been carried out by Stephen and Dixon Alderton.  The sale of the UK property that has been lined up may be delayed.  Their costs will be likely to exceed those of Dixon Alderton, as they will be acting as personal representative and administering the estate, and I recognise that those costs may be increased by the queries and comments that Philip is likely to continue to raise.  I note also that Stephen&#8217;s appointment has the apparent support of Eric&#8217;s children, although as their title to share in the estate has been questioned, I do not place weight on that point.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The advantage, however, of a professional administrator is that it takes the administration of the estate out of the hands of any one branch of the family.  That the class of beneficiaries potentially entitled to a share of the Deceased&#8217;s estate is not confined to Philip and Stephen, but may also extend to those individuals claiming to be children of Eric or of the Deceased is in my view a relevant factor.  The role of administrator encompasses not just the collecting in of the estate, but also its distribution, an issue which in the present case may be prove contentious.  I consider that the involvement of an independent professional who can objectively assess the claims of the various individuals whose entitlement to share in the Deceased&#8217;s estate may be in dispute is likely to reduce the need for contentious litigation on this issue in the Chancery Division (or at least will assist in focusing the scope of that dispute). It may also reduce the likelihood of other aspects of the administration being challenged in the future, thus avoiding further litigation. The appointment of an independent administrator may provide an opportunity for the value placed by Stephen on the UK property to be reconsidered and it means that independent consideration can be given as to (a) whether the estate has any claim against Stephen in respect of his occupation of the property since the Deceased&#8217;s death or (b) the value of any such claim. I make clear though, that in making this point I have not reached any view as to the merits (or otherwise) of these alleged claims.  </p>

Following receipt of the draft of this judgment Stephen has provided a further witness statement from his solicitor confirming that he would wish the grant to issue to Mr Adam Draper of Rothley Law Ltd.

I note that the NCPR 1987 do not provide for any further appeal to the Court of Appeal from a decision of a judge.  My view therefore is such an appeal lies wholly outside the scope of the NCPR 1987 and the retained parts of the RSC 1965 and is instead governed by Part 52 of the CPR 1998.  As my decision has itself been made on an appeal, an appeal to the Court of Appeal would be a second appeal.  Under CPR 1998 Part 52.7 permission for a second appeal can only be granted by the Court of Appeal.  Therefore, should either party wish to appeal this decision they will need to seek permission directly from the Court of Appeal.  It should be noted that under CPR 1998 r.52.7 permission will only be granted where (a) the appeal (i) would have real prospects of success and (ii) raise an important point of principle or practice; or (b) there is some other compelling reason for the Court of Appeal to hear it. </p>
