	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">I have listened carefully to the evidence and submissions made on behalf of the parents. As I set out at the end of this judgment I feel their pain in being separated from their Children and I acknowledge there are no good outcomes for the Children. I also acknowledge the likelihood that if they could the parents would go back in time and act quite differently.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">This is a case where there is huge uncertainty for the Children under either option; the decision that has to be made is set against great suffering for the family and CE in particular. I find the balance falls in favour of making Care Orders. What tips the balance is that while there are no guarantees for an improving situation in foster care the risks of harm are lower than in the Father&#8217;s care in light of the assessment of his ability to meet their needs set against findings he perpetrated harm yet does not fully accept the harm inflicted by him or the Mother. </p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">The parents will be devastated by this decision especially when coupled with the Mother&#8217;s recent incarceration but I hope in time they can come to accept the situation, make the best of it and work with the Local Authority to ensure the Children can have the best possible relationship with them.</p>

They have applied to the Home Office for visas for both Children. In oral evidence they indicated that the current foster carer has given notice on the placement, there is a possibility that CD may be able to remain in placement but they are searching for alternative joint or separate placements. Although the notice is due to expire at the end of the proceedings they consider it will likely be extended pending finding an alternative placement(s).</p>

CE would like to have telephone contact (although she told the Guardian she would like to see Mother face to face). If in fact CE&#8217;s view is that she would like to see the Mother face to face the Local Authority would adopt the same course as for CD.</p>

They will also prepare a written agreement to underpin contact with the adult siblings.</p>

However, I cannot and do not lose sight of the fact that the origin of this pain is in their actions and the consequence of that, without reparative work that has not begun, is an inability to safely care for the Children meeting their current needs. I am therefore drawn to the conclusion that it is both necessary and proportionate to make final Care Orders and approve the care plans now presented by the Local Authority.</p>
