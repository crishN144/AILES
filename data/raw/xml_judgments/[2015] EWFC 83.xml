The application is by JK, X&#8217;s biological father, but not her legal father.  The respondents to the application are HS and KS, who are civil partners and X&#8217;s legal parents.  I am giving this </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">ex tempore</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> judgment this afternoon because I am anxious that the parties in this case have a determination today. As a consequence this judgment may not be as full as I would have wished. If it becomes necessary I am able to expand on the detail, if requested to do so.</span></p>

In his application he also seeks to have his name placed on X&#8217;s birth certificate.  He is not legally represented in these proceedings.  He was expecting to have a McKenzie Friend attend to assist him today.  She has not been able to attend for family related reasons, but he has been able, and was content to continue today.   I have extensive documentation in this case to be able to understand the points that he wishes to make. He has helpfully been able to outline his position by way of a prepared statement and in answer to the structure I have set out as to how he should make his submissions.  Miss Matthews-Stroud has represented the respondents.  They have provided skeleton arguments, which have been extremely helpful.</span></p>

At the outset, in the light of the legal position set out in the respondents&#8217; skeleton argument, JK agreed this court has no jurisdiction to (i) make a freestanding order for parental responsibility in relation to X within these proceedings, and (ii) to amend the birth certificate.  As a result the focus of today&#8217;s application has been his application for leave, to make an application for a child arrangements order, in effect seeking contact with X.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I am going to set out a brief summary of the background.  X was conceived following artificial insemination at the respondents&#8217; home with HS using JK&#8217;s sperm.  The parties had met three&#160;years previously through a website.  The respondents state that they were looking for a known donor.  JK disputes this and says they were looking for a co-parent.  There is an issue on the papers about that, in particular as to precisely what was on the respondents&#8217; profile on the website.  There are two pages of that profile in the papers:  one that was printed, on the face of it, in December 2014 by the respondents, which indicates their status as looking for a known donor; whereas JK has produced what he says is a picture of the position as at January 2015, which indicates that in fact they were looking for a co-parent; which was what JK says he was looking for when he signed up to this website.</span></p>

A copy is in the papers.  It is, on the face of it, a standard form document, which one of the respondents indicated they had downloaded from the internet in circumstances, they say, to deal with JK&#8217;s concerns in relation to any financial responsibility that he may have regarding any future child, in particular with the Child Support Agency.  That is disputed by JK.  He says it was done and prepared in order to set out in written form the arrangements that had been reached between the parties, in particular his role as a co-parent.  In fact, within the document, at paragraph&#160;11, it deals with the question in relation to financial responsibility for JK, and indicates that he would have no financial responsibility towards X.  As to  the future arrangements for any contact that JK would have with any child that resulted from the arrangement, paragraph 30 sets out extensive contact and  involvement between JK and the child, looking at alternate weekend contact, holiday contact and also that his name would appear on the birth certificate.</span></p>

JK sets out in his submissions to the court that in fact it was varied as a result of discussions between them, and the typed terms were capable of variation.  The respondents say that there was no adjustment or changes in relation to the typed terms; the only parts that were added in by them, apart from their names, were details in relation to location and signing, all of which appear in manuscript form on the agreement.</span></p>

This, amongst other factors, led to the relationship ending.  There is a dispute between the parties as to who ended their relationship in relation to this arrangement, and what the precise circumstances were. There was then a gap of about eighteen months to two years before they met again, by chance, at a social event, in early 2013.  This meeting led to further discussions and an agreement by them to try again to conceive a child.  This led, in turn, to X being conceived.</span></p>

Extensive statements have been filed by all the parties, including third party witnesses.  HS and KS state they viewed JK as having known donor status, with what they describe as &#8220;minimal&#8221; involvement.  In their skeleton argument they expressed it as follows:  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">&#8220;Limited peripheral involvement, a positive role model&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> was how they expected him to be</span></p>

JK also relies on text messages which were exchanged between the parties, he submits the court has a lever arch file of  copies of these messages saying, in effect, that he would be treated as the father of X and have unlimited contact.</span></p>

There are a number of disputes around the circumstances in which the contact took place.  There was dispute as to JK&#8217;s reliability, as to whether he was late on occasions and  on one occasion did not attend at all. There is some evidence to suggest that some contact went well.  There was an occasion when they went out for a meal with JK&#8217;s wider family, and also when X was taken in to the office where JK and HS had worked; the response and texts about that from HS indicated that it had gone very well and she was describing him as a happy father figure.</span></p>

There is a detailed text within the papers setting out their reasons for doing that.  That was caused, in part, because of what they say was his unreliability in   attending contact, his unrealistic expectations regarding his role and also the distress and difficult circumstances that were being experienced by the respondents in being able to manage his attempts to have contact with X.</span></p>

He issued his application in December 2014.  The matter was initially dealt with by His Honour Judge Polden on 9th January 2015, when he made directions listing the matter before me. That resulted in this hearing being listed to determine the application for leave.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I will turn briefly now to consider the position regarding the legal framework.  There is no dispute between the parties as to the legal framework.  It is set out very clearly in the skeleton argument filed on behalf of the respondents.  X was conceived through artificial insemination using JK&#8217;s sperm and with the consent of HS and KS, who are, and were at the time, civil partners.  HS and KS are X&#8217;s legal parents, with shared parental responsibility.  HS is her birth, biological and legal mother and, as a result, has parental responsibility for her by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Turning to the third consideration, which is the likelihood of the application disrupting X&#8217;s life such as to cause her harm, JK submits that there will be limited disruption.  He had contact in the four months after X was born with very little difficulty and in the context of some extremely positive texts exchanged between the parties as to steps he had taken in terms of buying things and gestures that he had made in relation to X and the respondents.  The difficult ones that were exchanged between the parties, he says, have to be seen in the context of the difficult circumstances of him informing his family regarding his sexuality and in relation to the difficulties about contact when he was detained at work and  unable to attend contact.  He always, other than when delayed through work, attended contact.  There may have been occasions once or twice when he was late, but overall he has been reliable and that has not caused significant disruption to X&#8217;s life such as to cause her harm.</span></p>

They are her main carers and are entirely responsible for her nurture, the stability she enjoys and her security.  They are concerned that by allowing the application to proceed there will be significant disruption, in part because of the unrealistic expectations in JK&#8217;s application and also because of the uncertainty that will be created by the fact that there will be ongoing proceedings.  They say there has already been considerable disruption which they have had to endure.  The detailed descriptions  they give in their statements of the impact on them of the difficulties they say there have been in contact illustrates the position as  to the disruption, and risk of disruption,  there will be to X that is likely to cause her harm.  They say, even after the filing of extensive statements by them of the impact of this application on them, JK has shown no reconsideration of his unrealistic aims.  If anything, they say, it has made him more determined, irrespective of the distress and uncertainty that he is causing to HS and KS, which inevitably, they say, will have an adverse impact on X.</span></p>

They submit that its purpose is to give security, certainty and clarity to parents conceiving in these circumstances and that a notable part of this framework is that it expressly eliminates the legal status of the biological father in such circumstances.  It is submitted the law therefore extends the existing judicial approach of protecting the primary nuclear family, which they say gives that unit legal recognition and protection.

The agreement was signed in 2010, which gave JK, on the face of the terms of that agreement, a very considerable role, even though there is a dispute as to the circumstances of it being signed and the significance which each of them attached to it. When the parties embarked on their attempts at conception again in 2013, it is clear from the texts, certainly the texts between HS and JK that he was going to have a future role in X&#8217;s life. The texts referring to X&#8217;s name, in early May 2014, the texts around the time of X&#8217;s birth and the text after the visit to work support that position.  Whilst it is right that there were difficulties around timekeeping in relation to contact arrangements and JK not discussing his sexuality with his parents, those need to be seen in the wider context of the positive exchange of texts at around that time period.</span></p>

That is a positive and significant step.  If the court grants leave and he changes his position, that is unlikely to assist his position as it is likely to result in him being unable to have any role at all in X&#8217;s future.  If he is given leave, his application will only be considered in the context of the reality of X&#8217;s position.  Since birth she has been in the full-time care of her legal parents.  It is they who provide her day-to-day care, nurture and security and they are the only people with parental responsibility.  The structure that they have built round her in terms of her day-to-day care is entirely supported by the legal framework brought about by the changes in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It is right, according to the respondents, the difficulties they experienced over contact arrangements of course caused them some distress.  HS&#8217;s statement gives a graphic account.  Her distress needs to be viewed in the context of her own personal circumstances and what is said in the papers to be the difficulties she experienced when her own parents separated.  However, the texts at the time of the birth and up until the end of July, even after the difficulties that had been experienced between them in June, display a warmth and understanding between the parties.  Whilst I recognise that if the court does grant leave there will be some distress experienced by the respondents, I do not consider it to be at such a level as to cause X harm.  The application and the timetable for it will be managed by the court.</span></p>

In relation to the public policy position, it is right that the statutory framework of itself is a consideration the court can take into account, but in the circumstances of this case it is not sufficient of its own to say that the application for leave should be refused.</span></p>

On both parties&#8217; cases it was expected that JK should have some role in X&#8217;s life.  That was the position up to birth and in the weeks that followed.  Miss Matthews-Stroud submits that both the respondents have parental responsibility and that it is a matter for them to determine how and when that should take place.  I disagree.  In my judgment, X&#8217;s welfare would be served by this issue being determined sooner rather than later.  The parties all live in the same locality.  JK still works at the same place as one of the respondents.  X&#8217;s welfare interests would not be served by this issue being left unresolved.  If leave was given, there would be a framework from which the parties will be able to move forward.</span></p>
