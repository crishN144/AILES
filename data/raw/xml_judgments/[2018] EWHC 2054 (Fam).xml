	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties to the proceedings are the mother who is represented by leading and junior counsel and the child through counsel, acting on the instructions of her guardian. The father is presently in detention in another jurisdiction where criminal proceedings are ongoing. He has legal representation in those proceedings and there has been ongoing consular monitoring of that process. The local authority has made extensive efforts to engage the father with these proceedings which have met with a very limited response. The father appeared in court recently and I understand from the local authority that the proceedings against him were further adjourned until April 2018.</p>

I agree. The timescale for the determination of the criminal proceedings against the father is unknown and, if those proceedings result in a conviction, he may serve a sentence of imprisonment. The child&#8217;s life cannot be put on hold to await her father&#8217;s participation in these proceedings. In his absence, I must do the best I can to resolve the factual matters which I am required to determine.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The facts which give rise to these proceedings can be simply put and are not in dispute. The mother and the father married in early 2015 and shortly thereafter travelled to Turkey via a third country. From Turkey, they made their way to Syria. Thereafter they spent time in Syria and also in Iraq before presenting with their child at the Turkish border 2 years after leaving the UK. The child was born whilst the parents were resident in Syria. Both parents were arrested and the mother and child spent time in a detention centre in Turkey before returning to this jurisdiction in late 2017. </p>

	    <num>8.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Relatively few public law proceedings to date have considered the position of families who have returned from Syria. What renders this case even more unique is that this family spent a significant part of the time in Syria living in territory controlled by the jihadist group, Islamic State, also known as ISIL [Islamic State in the Levant]. Further, as is accepted by the parties, it was the father&#8217;s intention to travel to territory controlled by ISIL in order both to fight with ISIL and to live within its self-proclaimed caliphate. What is in issue in this case is precisely what the mother&#8217;s intentions were in leaving the UK and whether she too shared the father&#8217;s extremist and radicalised mindset.</p>

Those rights have long been recognised in our society and are enshrined in our law (Articles 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the European Convention of Human Rights and enacted in the Human Rights Act of 1998). This case, in common with other similar ones, confronts not just behaviours but, as I recorded earlier, whether and in what circumstances the religiously motivated views of parents are so harmful to their children that the state should intervene to protect the child. All families are free to bring up their children as they see fit, provided of course, that within a wide ambit they do not cause them harm. But the question in this and in other cases is under what circumstances might the parents&#8217; religious views and activities result in harm to the children&#8217;s physical and emotional health and well-being.</span></p>

It goes to the very roots of democratic and jealously guarded freedoms. Self-evidently the State cannot place limitations on beliefs that are held by a private individual. It can, however, place limitations on the manifestation of those beliefs if that limitation is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, which in these circumstances would be protecting public order, health, morals, freedoms or rights of others, generally or individually.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s case was that the mother and the father, inspired by a shared extremist ideology, jointly and knowingly travelled to territory controlled by ISIL to further that ideology through, if necessary, engaging in terrorism-related activity. If that submission was correct, the local authority asserted that the child remained at continuing risk of significant harm from the mother&#8217;s extremist ideology.</p>

However, she denied either that she had been aware of the father&#8217;s extremist and radicalised beliefs before leaving the UK or thereafter or that she had ever sought to further her own beliefs through participation in or encouragement of any terrorist activity. It was on that basis that the mother maintained that the child was not at any continuing risk of significant harm.</p>

From Turkey, the parents then crossed into Syria by road and entered territory controlled by ISIL.  Shortly after their arrival the parents travelled to Mosul in Iraq where they spent several months. In about July 2015 the parents travelled to Raqqa, living there for about eight months. At the time the parents lived in Mosul and Raqqa, this was territory in the control of ISIL. Thereafter they moved to a town close to the Turkish border. Whilst the parents were living there, the child was born. </p>

The parents were arrested and detained by the Turkish authorities, the child remaining with her mother at all times. The father was charged with terrorism related offences and remains subject to an ongoing criminal process. Relatively shortly after her arrest, the mother attended a court hearing. It appears that during the hearing it was determined that the mother was not a member of ISIL and the legal proceedings against her were discontinued. She was, however, detained along with the child pending deportation to this jurisdiction.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Grief QC has quite properly drawn my attention to the limitations of the police investigation. I summarise these as follows: (a) the initial focus was that of a missing persons&#8217; enquiry; (b) thereafter, the focus of the enquiry was whether X&#8217;s report of the parents&#8217; location was correct; (c) the key investigative focus was on breaches or potential breaches of TACT; (d) the mindset of both parents was of relative insignificance and the mother&#8217;s family circumstances were not considered in any depth; (e) the police struggled to specifically attribute to an individual either the mother&#8217;s Twitter account or some of the physical evidence discovered in the mother&#8217;s former home; (f) searches were undertaken on public and open source social media sites without steps also being taken to obtain either private messages or call or phone messaging data; (g) the mother gave a no comment interview; and (h) following very limited further investigation, it was decided that no further action would be taken in respect of the mother.</p>

X&#8217;s error in that regard was made in the context of the father having communicated a desire to return to this jurisdiction to his family, to [<span style="font-weight:bold">redacted</span>] and to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In numerous other respects, X&#8217;s assertions had been corroborated. It was also evident that a number of communication devices belonging to the father and mother had not been subject to any analysis as they were never available to the police - I note, for example, that the mother told me that she took her mobile phone abroad with her. Communication between the father and the mother took place by phone and was not available either to the police or to the court. Though nothing on the mother&#8217;s Twitter feed breached TACT, DC G considered that objectively there were a number of matters relevant to establishing an extreme mindset.</p>

It was apparent from the social work evidence that the mother had chosen to give a very limited account of the period in which she was in Iraq/Syria.

That evidence was consistent with his police statement and with what he had said during all the assessments carried out by the local authority. However, after the luncheon adjournment, the maternal grandfather told me that he had indeed met the father on one occasion prior to the couple&#8217;s marriage. The father had come alone to the family home at the mother&#8217;s request and he had met with him for about 30 to 45 minutes. They had conversed about the couple&#8217;s desire to get married and the maternal grandfather told me he had said to the father that he would take some time to make his decision about whether he approved of the marriage. He had not enquired how the couple had come to meet. He described the father as having shoulder-length light-coloured hair but was otherwise unable to give an accurate description of the father&#8217;s build, facial hair or clothing. He was unable to explain why it was that he now said that he had met father having given no inkling of this before the luncheon adjournment.</p>

His description of the father lacked detail and was significantly inaccurate in its description of the father&#8217;s hair. From the photographic evidence available to me, it is clear that the father had short dark hair rather than longish light coloured hair. I have thus come to the conclusion that I must approach the maternal grandfather&#8217;s evidence as a whole with a considerable degree of caution. However, I am satisfied that the maternal grandfather never met the father and that his near contemporaneous statement to the police should be preferred to the oral evidence which he gave to me in court. </p>

Sometimes the linkage will be obvious, as where the facts proved establish physical harm. But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect. In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority&#8217;s case was that the father &#8220;lacks honesty with professionals&#8221;, &#8220;minimises matters of importance&#8221; and &#8220;is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance&#8221;. May be. But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect? The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise. The local authority&#8217;s evidence and submissions must set out the argument and explain explicitly why it is said that, in the particular case, the conclusion indeed follows from the facts.&#8221;</span></p>

I too accept that the court will always want to analyse the cogency and the weight of hearsay evidence. That analysis will depend upon matters such as the reliability of the hearsay evidence; the practicability of testing and assessing its reliability within the hearing; the material available which can help to test the hearsay evidence; the interests of justice in determining whether hearsay evidence should be admitted; the strength and weakness of the evidence overall; the importance of the hearsay evidence to the case as a whole; and fairness in the context of an overall appraisal of the case.  Given the investigative and non-adversarial philosophy which guides the court&#8217;s approach to public law proceedings and the court&#8217;s obligation to regard the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration, the court will instinctively permit a broad range of evidence in order ultimately to weigh and assess its quality and worth in the context of the evidence as a whole [see Hayden J at paragraph 23].</p>

Calling the makers of statements or indeed the primary sources for some of the matters on which the local authority relies may be either practically impossible or undesirable for a variety of other reasons. Those factors do not, however, absolve the court from its duty to scrutinise all of the evidence carefully and to have at the forefront of its mind the considerations I have outlined with respect to hearsay evidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Based on the analysis of a computer which belonged to the father and of which he was the only user, I find, from my perusal of a significant bundle of images and documents, that the father had accessed ISIL propaganda which featured dead bodies and ISIL-described &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">martyrs</span>&#8221; and which glorified armed combat. The aim of that material was to encourage people to join ISIL. Numerous images found on the father&#8217;s computer contained the ISIL flag. One of the images of the ISIL flag was a screen grab from an ISIL propaganda video and the father chose to use this image as his Skype picture. The father&#8217;s computer also contained numerous images depicting fighters and weaponry and glorifying violence. The father had also visited sites for and had shared ISIL propaganda videos with his friend X, these depicting extreme acts of violence, including executions, and encouraging terrorism. One of the videos shared with X depicted ISIS insurgents executing Iraqi soldiers with graphic images of a male lying on the ground with devastating head wounds. Another video sent to X showed a picture of what appeared to be a male being beheaded by pro-ISIS supporters/fighters. The paternal grandmother had observed an image on the father&#8217;s computer of Muslim men dressed in robes with a caption saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">ISIS</span>&#8221;. On seeing that image, the paternal grandmother had questioned the father about why he was looking at this material and he said to her that he needed to be well informed for when others questioned him about such images.  The paternal grandmother did not believe what he had said to her and, after the father went missing, she contacted the police due to her concern that the father may have travelled to Syria.</p>

There were regular conversations between the father and other on-line gamers via Skype messaging during which it was apparent that they were also playing online games together. However, the father developed a particular friendship with X and they used to Skype message on an almost daily basis &#8211; there were about 21,210 such messages found on the father&#8217;s computer. The father and X also used to telephone each other on Skype.

I have been able to view this material with the assistance of the police and have come to the following conclusions about this material. The document was written to inspire mujahiddeen [also referred to as resistance fighters] who are those taking an active part in jihad on behalf of the Prophet. Jihad is described as the most important religious duty of a Muslim. The document contains about 70 separate exhortations to inspire, guide and enlighten with each exhortation being described in more or less detail as the case may be. The exhortations include: suffering, hardships, fasting, trust, resolve, loneliness, love, preparation, martyrs, purity and perseverance. It is, bluntly, a manual for an Islamist fighter and its crucial message is that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the joy of life is in battle</span>&#8221; with no deviation from the chosen path.</p>

I have thought carefully about whether I can rely on the information given by X given that he has not made a statement or been cross-examined. In this instance, I am able to rely on the contents of the email which was sent by X in circumstances where he was responding to the paternal family&#8217;s desperate request for information about the father.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s own evidence highlighted a significant change in her ambitions and her behaviour a year or so prior to 2015. She confirmed that, when she was in high school, she had been a member of sports clubs and had gone out with her friends to the cinema and bowling. She had left school at 16 and had gone to college to study business administration, a course that she told me she thought she had completed. In 2013 she had worked in a clothing store and also as a receptionist. Her ambition had been to study but she found this difficult in the overcrowded environment of the maternal family home. In 2014 she told me that she volunteered to care for her paternal grandmother who was elderly and had some significant health problems. She would help her to wash and dress, to move around, would keep her company and would generally attend to her health needs and to her medical appointments. She claimed Carer&#8217;s Allowance on account of her responsibilities towards her grandmother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s assumption of care for her paternal grandmother appears to have coincided with her increasing religious devotion. Her eldest sister first started wearing a veil outside the house and the mother followed suit. She also began to practice segregation within the family home, this being the separation of males and females whenever anyone outside the immediate family was present. I note that the mother would not be present in the same room as her brother-in-law, Z who was her elder sister&#8217;s husband. He too practised segregation in the same way. The mother confirmed that she had no friends outside the family home at this time and that she had not been interested in maintaining the friendships she had made at school. The lack of contact outside the family home was, I find, part and parcel of the mother&#8217;s adoption of strict behaviours/practices to demonstrate her faith.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was struck by the mother&#8217;s detached manner when speaking of her family. She told me that she respected her parents and that her father was a hard-working man who had done nothing to lose her respect. She accepted she had lied to him and deceived him about her marriage to the father but said this had not been her intention. During this part of her evidence I observed the mother to smile and I formed the impression that her respect for her parents was something she claimed rather than something to which she adhered in practice. Given her own account as to how her marriage came about, her behaviour towards her parents was profoundly disrespectful in both a cultural and religious context. </p>

Her adoption of clothing different to that habitually worn in the family home was but one aspect of this determined streak. That determination was also allied to a demonstrable intelligence as evidenced by the contents of her Twitter account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the many troubling aspect of this case was the mother&#8217;s view about her future relationship with the father. They remained in a relationship throughout their time in Syria and were only separated by the father&#8217;s arrest in Turkey. The mother told the child&#8217;s Guardian at a meeting early in the proceedings that she did not regret meeting with the father and that he was a good person. She said she had forgiven him for his bad decisions and still loved him. In her first statement the mother said that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">at the moment</span>&#8221; she was not planning to live with the father should he return to this jurisdiction. To me, the mother said that the father deserved a chance to explain himself and that may be there was a reason for what he had done. She told me that the father had risked his life each day in Raqqa to provide for her. I detected no criticism at all of his behaviour but only the assertion that she alone had made a mistake.</p>

This was wholly new information which had not been foreshadowed in any of the evidence before the court. Additionally, the mother told me that the father had been sent significant sums of money by the paternal grandfather during the latter part of their time in Raqqa and that they had used this money to pay people smugglers to get them out of Raqqa into territory which was not controlled by ISIL. </p>

All were in agreement that no further enquiry was necessary for two main reasons. First, the enquiries made of the Secretary of State for the Home Department at an earlier stage in the proceedings were precisely drafted so as to capture the holding of information by the Secretary of State about both any intelligence activities by the father and the transfer of monies to the father by the intelligence services. Had any such information been held by the Secretary of State, it was more likely than not that (a) its disclosure into the proceedings would have been resisted and (b) this court would have needed to engage in a closed material procedure not dissimilar to that undertaken in care proceedings before Cobb J, reported as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R (Closed Material Procedure: Special Advocates: Funding)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/1793" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 1793 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 1793 (Fam)</ref>.

Enquiries of the paternal grandfather&#8217;s legal representatives had met with resistance and the matter was not pursued. Even though this left the matter unresolved, all agreed that the focus of the fact-finding hearing was properly the circumstances of the parents&#8217; marriage, their travel to Syria, and the purpose and mindset of each parent in entering Syria. Whatever may have happened in Syria was secondary to those matters. I agree with that formulation. At this late stage of the hearing, adjournment to clarify issues which were of peripheral importance to the issues in this case would have been (a) productive of significant delay and (b) wholly disproportionate.</p>

She told me she had no idea that the flag being carried by some of these women was associated with ISIL. I observe that there was nothing in the mother&#8217;s banner picture that would demarcate it as related to Somalia in any way whatsoever. Given her interest particularly about matters relating to Islam, I find it inconceivable that she would not have known this was the ISIL flag.

Taken together, both tweets showed an interest in ISIL and, with respect to the Nutella tweet, mocked what ISIL itself said was a false story and, with respect to the Begg tweet, showed support for those belonging to extremist groups. </p>

The same day she also liked a tweet saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Surely Allah has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them a burning fire</span>&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her first statement the mother told me that she and the father had decided to marry because they loved each other and enjoyed each other&#8217;s company. The father had met the maternal grandfather on one occasion but the maternal grandfather was unhappy about the mother marrying the father straightaway as he thought the father needed to be more settled and have his own apartment. The mother and father decided that they would marry without informing either of their families and had an Islamic wedding in March 2015. The mother&#8217;s intention was to tell her parents that she had got married once she and the father had found a place to stay. After the wedding she had returned to live at her parents&#8217; home but at times she stayed for a few nights at friends&#8217; and relatives&#8217; homes.</p>

Both were clear that they wished to get married. The mother asked the maternal grandfather to meet with the father but he kept putting this off because he was too busy. The mother then asked her elder sister to ask Z to speak with the father to sound him out about the seriousness of his intention to marry. Several days later the mother&#8217;s elder sister said that Z had refused to speak with the father as he was busy with work. The mother then went back to the maternal grandfather and insisted that he spoke with the father and met him. The father came to the house and met with the maternal grandfather. During the course of that visit the father and the mother met briefly in the hallway. Following the meeting, the maternal grandfather told the mother that he did not rule the father out as a suitable match and he did not forbid her to talk with him but said that he wanted the father to have a job and a place of his own before the couple married. The mother claimed that the pressure of wanting to be with each other made the couple decide to marry without the consent of their parents and a marriage ceremony took place on 5 March 2015. The marriage was arranged by the father and took place in an ordinary looking house. The mother travelled to the wedding venue alone and when she arrived she was taken into a room on the ground floor separate from the room in which the father and the imam were. She answered questions from the imam by text, confirming her agreement to marry, and was then told that the marriage had taken place. She and the father left the property and walked for a while towards the train station following which the mother went back home. After the wedding, the mother and the father saw each other on a couple of occasions and continued to speak on the telephone each day.</p>

She denied meeting the father face-to-face until after the marriage ceremony apart from glimpsing him in the hallway when he came to see the maternal grandfather.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There were discrepancies between the accounts given by the mother of couple&#8217;s courtship and marriage and also discrepancies between her accounts and those she gave to others. I have already indicated that I preferred the maternal grandfather&#8217;s account given to the police that he had never met the father. What was striking about the mother&#8217;s account, in my view, was the speed with which the decision to marry had been taken &#8211; within about a week or so - at a time when this young couple barely knew each other. What was also hard to understand was why the mother, this devout and pious young woman, had married in defiance of her father&#8217;s wishes; had done so in secret; and had gone alone to an unknown destination to do so with no idea of who or what might await her there. The impression given by the father&#8217;s Skype messages was that this marriage was brokered in a business-like way by the mother&#8217;s brother-in-law, Z, and the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">sheikhs</span>&#8221;, one of whom had discussed &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the state</span>&#8221; with the father and appears to have encouraged his aim of travelling to Syria.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Was this a marriage for a purpose as the local authority asserted? It is hard to avoid the conclusion that it was. The father wanted to marry and marriage was part and parcel of his plan to travel to Syria to fight for ISIL and live in the caliphate. The speed with which the marriage took place and the manner in which it was brokered with the aid of, amongst others, Z, a known supporter of extremist Islam, gave credence to the local authority&#8217;s case. Leaving aside the deficiencies of her account to the court, there was no doubt that the mother herself was a willing participant in this hasty union. She shared the father&#8217;s extremist mindset and I find she knew, on marrying the father, what his beliefs and plans for the immediate future were.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s clothing at the airport was, in my view a matter of significance. She was no longer wearing modest clothing which she told me had brought her closer to God. She was asked to explain why she had discarded such clothing in keeping with both her beliefs and her status as a married woman. She was simply unable to do so &#8211; the suggestion in her statement that this was because she was going on honeymoon was not something that she relied on in her oral evidence. Given that the father&#8217;s intention in travelling to Syria was clear on the evidence before me, I infer that the mother must have been either persuaded to do so by the father or did so of her own accord. Why? Travelling in western style clothing was less likely to attract attention from security staff so that the couple could proceed unhindered to their destination. Given what I have learned about this young woman, I am satisfied that she would only have discarded her modest dress for a very good reason indeed, namely one allied to her faith and beliefs. Wearing western style dress would be justifiable if this was done in the service of a higher cause, namely travel to live in the caliphate and I find that this was the reason she travelled dressed as she did.</p>

It was clear from his Skype messages and other sources that his aim was to live in the caliphate. Indeed as I have found, his aim was also to fight for ISIL. In her statements and oral evidence the mother did not question his alleged proposal nor provide any information about how two young people with little money and no affiliation with any aid organisation would provide aid. The lack of detail was telling. If the parents were travelling to Syria for benign reasons, the mother&#8217;s failure to explain this at the first available opportunity when she was interviewed by the police was mystifying.</p>

If she were ignorant, this ran the risk that she would refuse or create serious problems for him. Either her absolute docility could be assured or she already knew the ultimate destination of travel.  I do not accept that, if she were ignorant of what was planned, the mother went along with the father because she was either a dutiful wife and/or felt herself to be compromised by the circumstances of their marriage. She accepted that, at the time of her departure, she knew ISIL was an extremely dangerous terrorist organisation operating in Syria and that it would be dangerous to be where ISIL was. In those circumstances, her decision to go along with the father&#8217;s plan to travel towards Syria and known danger even out of duty made no sense whatsoever for this determined and intelligent young woman.</p>

Her own movements whilst the couple were in Mosul were circumscribed in that she was resident in a house with other women, some of whose husbands were fighting for ISIL. She did not leave this property at any time. She was moved by ISIL from Mosul to Raqqa by minibus and by people who did not appear to be armed. Once reunited with the father in Raqqa, the father was free to move around that city with a signed paper indicative of an acceptance by ISIL of the couple&#8217;s presence in that city. On one occasion the mother was able to tweet on her Twitter account from an internet caf&#233;.  Essentially, the mother agreed that, from the moment she entered Syria, she was accommodated and transported from location to location by ISIL.</p>

Her evidence about this developed during the course of the proceedings and during her oral evidence to me. For example, her account of the father working for &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">British Intelligence</span>&#8221; came at the conclusion of her evidence in response to my question and had never been raised by her prior to that moment.

The lack of clarity about the mother&#8217;s relationship with the father is a matter which requires further assessment but, nevertheless, it pointed towards the child being at risk of significant harm in consequence of both that relationship and the mother&#8217;s extremist beliefs.
