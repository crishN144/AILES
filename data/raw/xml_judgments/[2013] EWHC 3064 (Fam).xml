	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At about 10:55 on 5 October 2012 N, who had been born 3&#189; months earlier on 20 June 2012, suffered a serious head injury at her home. At 11:04 her mother, R, dialled 999. The ambulance arrived at 11:18 and very shortly after took N and her parents to the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, arriving at 11:37. On examination N was observed to have a linear abrasion or scratch to the right angle of her right eye and a linear abrasion under her chin to the left side. A CT head scan was undertaken which revealed subdural bleeding. N was transferred to the neurosurgical team at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital arriving that evening at 23:19. There a MRI scan was undertaken as well as ophthalmological testing. These investigations revealed that N had sustained a right side acute (i.e. recent) subdural bleed; a possible chronic (i.e. not recent) bleed at the frontal lobe of the brain and a plenitude of bilateral intra-retinal haemorrhages. No further injuries to the body or brain were noted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 23 October 2012 the local authority, Lancashire County Council, commenced care proceedings. In the circumstances it would have been a grave dereliction of their duties had they not done so, for which they could have been rightly criticised. This is my judgment on the preliminary fact finding hearing which the court ordered on 27 June 2013 to take place on 2 October 2013 before me with a time estimate of eight days. It is not clear to me why it took eight months for the fact finding hearing to be ordered but I am satisfied that responsibility for this delay does not fall on any of the parties in the proceedings.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The single question I have to resolve is whether N's injuries were the result of an accident when her father, W, tripped and fell when holding her; or whether they were the result of a serious abusive assault by him on her which involved not only violent shaking<span style="font-weight:bold"/>but impact on a hard surface also. The father utterly denies the allegation of abusive assault. He says that he was and is a devoted, caring, hands-on father who absolutely adored N. In this regard he is supported by the mother and by both sets of parents. The health visitor had observed his appropriate conduct in relation to N.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the other hand, some of the medical evidence suggests that this was an assault, although it is fair to say that the experts do not speak with one voice. The expert consultant paediatric ophthalmologist, Mr Newman, believes it is very much more likely than not that these retinal haemorrhages, both in their type and plenitude, are indicative of non-accidental injury. The expert neonatologist, Professor Wyatt, believes it is more likely than not that this was a non-accidental injury, although his degree of certitude is far less firm. However each of these experts accepts that it is possible that the father's explanation furnishes the true reason for the injuries. The expert paediatrician, Dr Samuels, and the expert paediatric neurosurgeon, Mr Richards, are more equivocal and each believes that the competing scenarios are equally likely.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority, who through Miss Heaton QC has conducted its case professionally, coolly, and responsibly, argues also that this was not a case of an assault coming out of a clear blue sky perpetrated by a man of unblemished character. Rather, they say that this father is a man with criminal convictions for unprovoked assaults who had at least once prior to the incident assaulted the mother by placing his hands around her throat. Since the incident he has done the same thing again. He had recently lost his job and they were all living in inadequate cramped accommodation. There were plenty of stressors here, it says, which in combination with the father's aggressive and impulsive personality should lead me to disbelieve him and to conclude in conformity with Mr Newman (in particular) that this was indeed a case of abusive assault.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is not one of those cases where I am going to conclude that I do not know what happened and that therefore the burden of proof should come to my rescue. That was the conclusion I reached in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">A County Council v M and F</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 939" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 939</ref>, where all of the competing theories for the death of the child in question I found to be highly improbable. Therefore the burden of proof taken in combination with the reasoning of the House of Lords in the famous case of <span style="font-style:italic">Rhesa Shipping Co SA v Edmond and Another: The Popi M  </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] 1 WLR 948" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] 1 WLR 948</ref> led me to acquit the parents of the murder of the child. Here, I am perfectly able to make up my mind. It is agreed that the case really boils down to the question of whether I believe the father or not. If I believe his story that this was an accident where he tripped and fell when holding N then that is the end of it. That story is not incompatible with the expert evidence. Mr Newman, while believing it to be highly unlikely does not rule it out. The other experts, more or less, believe that it is about as likely as the assault theory.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important for me to note at this early stage that the local authority makes no allegations against the mother of either being a participant in the alleged assault or of having failed to protect N. Nothing is said against her as a mother and I record on an uncontested basis my findings that the mother is completely innocent of any such thing.</p>

I do not believe that she has before been in a cohabitative relationship. She comes from a stable family and indeed N has been placed with her parents by the local authority where both she and the father have been afforded regular contact. She met the father in June 2011 and they started living together two or three months later. Although a baby was not planned she and the father were pleased when she fell pregnant in September 2011. For nobody does the course of love run true and there were arguments about little things, often concerning her untidiness. When she was 3 to 5 months pregnant, that is to say at some point between December 2011 and March 2012, there was a particularly spirited argument when they were in each other's faces and he got her by the throat and pushed her away. There was no incident like that before or afterwards up to the point where N sustained her injuries. However in March 2013 the parents had an argument about an aspect of this case, which is perhaps not very surprising as they both must have been under a very considerable pressure. In the course of that argument the father put his hand on the mother's throat and pushed her away.</p>

He was in a previous long-term cohabitative relationship which on any view was highly tumultuous and where his partner regularly called the police making complaints. The father describes these as being provocations and falsehoods and in the absence of any convictions or even formal police warnings I do not consider that any relevant conclusion can be drawn from these events. The father's parents are separated. His mother is a radiographer. He has two paternal half brothers with whom he has little contact. He works as a carpet fitter but as I have said at the time of the incident had quite recently lost his job. He has a number of criminal convictions stretching back to 1998 (arson). In more recent times he was convicted in April 2007 of assault where he had in an unprovoked attack head butted the victim; in January 2008 he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm &#8211; here the victim had been subjected to an unprovoked punch in the face knocking out his two front teeth; in October 2009 he was convicted for obstructing a constable; and in October 2010 he was convicted for using threatening behaviour in circumstances where he had been brawling in the street. It is an unedifying catalogue, but it is relevant to observe that his offences relate to adult males and that he has not been convicted of any crime since he began his relationship with the mother.</p>

He recognises his many flaws and as regards his lamentable history is ashamed and embarrassed. I am not sure that I even agree with Mr Rowley QC&#8217;s description of him as &#8220;clearly an awkward man&#8221;. The local authority does not and cannot challenge the uncontested evidence that he was a devoted and committed father who played a full practical role in the upbringing of N. Further, the local authority accepts that none of those traditional stress indicators that feature in so many of these cases is present here. There was no abuse of drink or drugs. There was no separation of the parents. There was no prior involvement of social services.</p>

I was still holding N at this point, in the same position to my left hand side.

On top of the dog cage was a magazine and baby travel chair. The force of my body weight hit the sofa and dog cage before I hit the floor and N was thrown from my arms. She flicked round as she was thrown from my grasp as I impacted on the furniture. She went from facing me where I had been holding her, during the fall to landed (sic) facedown, facing away from me with both arms close to her side. She landing (sic) close to the dog cage and corner of the porch wall. Her body had turned almost 180&#176; sideways during the fall. The travel chair on top of the cage obstructed my view as I impacted with the cage so I cannot say whether N hit anything as she fell nor did I see her impact with the floor&#8221;</p>

Again Miss Heaton QC places some emphasis on this embellishment (as she would have it) but I place no significance on that &#8211;  if anything it is an admission contrary to the father's interests for if this clenching was effective it would have reduced the force of the impact suffered by N. </p>

As described the forces would have been horizontal, vertical and rotational. Strong rotational force, or torque, can be generated by the human body. One only needs to consider how a punch can kill someone or how hard, fast and far a sportsman can hit a cricket, tennis or golf ball.</p>

She jumped out of bed and went downstairs and found the father holding N at the bottom of the stairs. N was pale and the father started to cry. She ran upstairs to get her telephone and first rang the doctor, then the health visitor. She told police that she also tried to ring to put credit on the father's telephone although her reason for doing so is completely obscure given that you do not need credit in order to dial 999.

Later she corrected this, the father having spoken up, to say that he had dropped her onto the floor. Later in the call the father again spoke up to say "instead of letting her go I kept her close to me". During the call the mother asked the father to stop shaking N. In court the father demonstrated how he was shaking N to provoke a response from her. The mother agreed with his demonstration and all the experts agree that that kind of shaking while cradling her could not have caused the haemorrhages suffered by N.

Yet the mother was not awakened by any such crying, and one might have thought that in this very small house her maternal alarm system to such distress would have been functioning when asleep. After all it was a cry and not a crash that woke her up. The theory goes on to postulate that the assault in question must have involved not only violent shaking followed by a throw against a hard surface, or perhaps gripping to the face. Only in this way are the wounds to the face explained (but the wounds are not really consistent with gripping &#8211; they are abrasive in appearance). So the alleged actions are in two parts or phases and are extremely brutal. </p>

However I was not given evidence as to how many of these cases were proven as a result of the presence of these features, as opposed to those which were proven to be abusive by reference to other evidence, such as confessions. If many were in the former class then of course the process of logical proof may be said to be circular, as Mr Richards pointed out. Further, it is a fact that very many children who present with head injuries arising from an indisputable accident such as a fall are neither scanned nor subjected to ophthalmological testing. They are just patched up and sent home. This is because a CT scan by definition irradiates the brain, which is something to be avoided wherever possible. For a child of more than three months of age a MRI scan requires general anaesthesia &#8211; again a procedure not be undertaken unless unavoidable. Ophthalmological testing requires awkward and unpleasant dilation of the pupils. These tests are only likely to be commissioned where there is either a suspicion of abuse or where there are clear symptoms of head injury, such as persistent vomiting. Therefore the data is compiled from a class which has a high prevalence of suspected abusers. Accordingly it might be said, and Mr Richards agreed, that the sample on which the empirical analysis is based is a false or skewed sample.</p>

Not so very long ago the presence of a subdural haemorrhage in a recently born child was taken to be strongly indicative of abuse unless the birth was especially traumatic. On the basis of this supposition very many children will have been permanently separated from their parents. Yet, authoritative research over the last decade has demonstrated that this supposition is false. The Rooks paper in 2008 was the last of three important pieces of research and showed that no fewer than 46% of normal births caused subdural bleeding. We now know that many appalling miscarriages of justice must have been perpetrated in reliance on the old, now discredited, orthodoxy. Further, current medical and clinical thinking is now prepared to accept that short falls can in many cases cause subdural bleeds; the view that this could only happen exceptionally is now regarded as outdated. As Mr Richards said to me (and this chimes with the judicial opinions cited by me at para 8(ix) above as well as with Secretary Rumsfeld&#8217;s famous apothegm about unknowns) "the more you know the more you know you don't know".</p>

Here the view remains that multitudinous bilateral retinal haemorrhages are strongly indicative of abuse and that it will only be exceptionally that they will be the result of an accident. But this is not a unanimous view. Mr Richards told me of the work of Dr Gillian Adams at the Great Ormond Street Hospital who is apparently collating a body of material which she intends to publish which challenges this orthodoxy. Further he referred me to the work of an American pathologist called Dr Lantz who (among other pieces of similar work) has  published an article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences in November 2011 entitled "Fatal Acute Intracranial Injury, Subdural Haematoma, and Retinal Haemorrhages Caused by Stairway Fall". This was a case study concerning a 7&#190; month old child who fell down a flight of six stairs through a vertical height of 1.42m at a pitch of 37&#176;. Sadly he died. An autopsy established that he had not only suffered from subdural bleeding but also from extensive bilateral retinal haemorrhages. This led Dr Lantz to conclude:</p>

Most childhood stairway and low-level falls do not cause serious head injuries. Nevertheless, not all seemingly minor falls are minor. This case report refutes a pervasive belief that childhood low height falls are invariably trivial events and cannot cause subdural bleeding, fatal intracranial injuries, and extensive multi-layered retinal haemorrhages. The harmful and potentially devastating consequences for a caregiver or family facing a false allegation of child abuse obligate physicians to thoroughly investigate and accurately classify paediatric accidental head injuries&#8221;</p>

He is certainly not a campaigner or advocate for wrongly accused parents. In his report he stated that while abusive head injury is statistically the most likely mechanism for the combined findings of retinal and subdural haemorrhages he could not exclude the possibility that the account given by the father led to those injuries. He did not think that the medical findings can provide a definite answer as to whether his story is correct or instead has been used to provide a more plausible explanation for an assault. In his oral testimony he stated that the haemorrhages would have had to have been caused by a very violent shaking and that if that had happened you would have expected additional injury within the brain and spinal column and N would have ended up clinically much more unwell at presentation. But there were no such additional injuries and N did not present as particularly unwell. Further there would have to have been an additional impact before or after shaking to account for the facial injuries. He accepted that in principle short falls do not usually cause retinal haemorrhages; that was based on data where the falls in question were simply vertical drops but here the story involves a fall with propulsion and where at impact rotational forces are generated within the skull. In his opinion this would cause a more serious level of injury than a short vertical drop. He stated under cross-examination that the absence of other injuries was significant. He further stated that the triad of itself was not enough to secure a finding of abuse and here we did not even have the triad. In a written addendum produced after his oral evidence he stated:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"If the injuries sustained by N were non-accidental, i.e. abusive, the injuries on her skin are actually more difficult to explain. Abusive head injury is not as commonly accompanied by a surface injury (or skull fracture for that matter) as accidental injury is. Where there is surface injury, abusive injury will usually have finger markings, hand slaps or punches (e.g. on the scalp or ear), or petechial (pinpoint), or sub-conjuctivical (surface of the eye) haemorrhages. In N's case, abusive head injury might have been accompanied by impact to the side of the eye causing an abrasion. The chin is more difficult to explain as part of an abusive injury, but would also involve some impact or graze. As these are in two different planes, it implies that there were two impacts or that the abuse might have involved rotation too. For abuse to have caused rotation and two injuries, this would have been very violent, with an expectation that more severe cerebral injury would have occurred."</p>

In his report he stated that the father's account of an accidental fall was an unlikely (but nevertheless possible) cause of the observed subdural haemorrhages. However he accepted that it is not known precisely what degree of force is required to generate subdural bleeding in young infants. In his oral evidence there was some discussion about the elementary laws of physics which state that the ending speed of an object depends, obviously, on its starting speed (v<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> = u<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2 </span>+ 2as; v = u + at). He accepted that most research on haemorrhages caused by short falls were in cases where u = 0, but here u &#8800; 0 as on the father's description N had been falling under gravity for about a metre by the time that she escaped his grasp and began her own short twisting journey to its impacting conclusion. Further, he pointed out that unlike more mature children and adults a baby will have no protective reflexes and will not have put its arms out to break the fall. He also accepted that many cases are not as extensively investigated as this one for the reasons I have given above. Therefore there were in this case issues of probability and logic. He accepted under cross-examination that the profession was now aware that relatively low falls can cause subdural haemorrhages. As an inevitable corollary he accepted that a single movement can cause such haemorrhages. In answer to a question from me he stated </p>

However, he referred to a review in this year 2013 by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists which concluded that "short falls are unlikely to cause retinal haemorrhages if the injury is not severe. In rare cases accidental falls, especially those with subdural haematoma may be associated with retinal haemorrhages, but these tend to be unilateral, localised and superficial." Further he referred to the 2013 Cardiff Child Protection Systematic Review Group Report which concluded that "retinal haemorrhages on rare in accidental trauma and, when present, are predominantly unilateral, few in number and in the posterior pole" Both of these 2013 reports were published after he had written his principal report but neither altered his opinion &#8211; plainly they fortified his opinion.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final expert witness was Mr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neurosurgeon at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. In his written report he stated that it is generally considered by most paediatric specialists who deal with infant head injury that low level falls described here do not cause acute subdural haemorrhages, and that a similar thinking applied in the ophthalmological world to retinal haemorrhages. Tellingly he stated that 12 months ago he would have agreed with this view but now he has had cause to doubt it. Only a very small percentage of children who suffer low level falls undergo specialist neuro-radiological investigation. Therefore it is possible that the incidence of low level falls causing subdural bleeding has been underestimated. Indeed in his own practice he had a child who fell off a sofa and who was perfectly well but because that child had a shunt in place it was felt prudent to have a CT scan to make sure that the shunt was working properly. To everyone's surprise the CT scan showed a subdural haemorrhage. This case, and other cases encountered by him in his medico-legal practice, have led him to question the view that low level falls of the type described here does not lead to subdural bleeding. While he defers to an ophthalmologist in relation to retinal haemorrhages he drew my attention to the work of Gillian Adams to which I have referred which apparently will show that low level falls may cause significant retinal haemorrhaging. In the circumstances from a medical standpoint he could not determine whether the history as given is true or false on the basis of the medical features alone.</p>

If Mr Newman had not made his contribution I doubt whether this case would have been pursued after the subdural reports were in. So my overall assessment of the medical evidence looked at in isolation is that it does not provide me with a sure or firm basis on which to conclude that it was more likely than not that these injuries were caused abusively. </p>

Further, in order for the empirical work to be sufficiently persuasive to lead to the very serious findings that are sought here there surely has to be a discrimination between short falls from a standing start and the sort of fall described here which must have involved considerable horizontal, vertical and rotational forces.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If this was a case of abuse then it was a very bad case indeed because it would not only have involved a violent shaking but then the hurling of N, or the bashing of her face, against a hard surface. It would have been an assault in two parts. This takes the theory beyond a momentary loss of self-control into the territory of sheer malignity. I consider this to be unlikely. On the other hand the father's account is perfectly consistent with both the haemorrhages and the facial wounds. Mr Rowley QC submitted, that when looking at this aspect the process of logical reasoning known as Occam's Razor favours the father's case. I agree. Further, there are aspects to the local authority&#8217;s theory that are problematic. If N was crying loudly and incessantly, so much so that the father snapped and brutally assaulted her in the manner alleged, then why did these cries not wake the mother up? If N was crying loudly and incessantly why did the father not simply take her upstairs to her mother? No satisfactory answers to these questions were given to me.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father gave his account very early on and since then, allowing for Lord Pearce&#8217;s observation about the fading of memory with the passage of time and its replacement with imagination, he has been highly consistent in its many repetitions. That his account is very detailed is not, in my judgment, an indicator of fabrication. On the contrary, had he been vague in his account this would have been used against him &#8211; &#8220;surely you can remember the details of such an important event?&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In all the circumstances, weighing all the evidence both expert and lay, and having regard to the need for evidential cogency given the seriousness of the allegations, I conclude that it is more likely than not that the father injured N by accident in the way he has described. This is not a borderline decision but then neither is it a decision beyond a reasonable doubt. There remains a possibility, perhaps even a real possibility, that the father has taken us all in with a web of lies. But on Lord Hoffmann's technique the balance of probability favours the father and he is entitled to the return of the value of 0 and to be treated as if he has not committed the alleged assault. For the subdural experts this is an unexceptional finding. In the opthamalogical anthologies it will be noted as one of those rare, outlying, exceptional cases where retinal haemorrhages have been caused by a single impact low level fall attended by strong linear and rotational forces.</p>
