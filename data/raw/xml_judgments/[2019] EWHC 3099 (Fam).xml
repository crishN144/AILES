A three-day hearing is listed in the High Court in London.  At this hearing the court is dealing with an application under Article 11(7) of Brussels II Revised.  This court may make an order requiring J&#8217;s return to this jurisdiction.  Such an order would be enforceable and unappealable by a court in Poland under Article 11(8) of Brussels II Revised.  The court will hear submissions and evidence from 10.30am on Thursday 4 July 2019.  A Polish professional interpreter has been provided by the court to assist you so that you have the opportunity to engage in these proceedings.  Please note, the court is giving active and anxious consideration to this application under Article 11(7) Brussels II Revised.  You are invited to contact the court via email to participate in the hearing by telephone using the following email address.  In the alternative, please contact us and we will be happy to assist you with this&#8217;. </p>

They have said on numerous occasions that they do not represent her in these proceedings but they have taken the pains to provide numerous documents and correspondence to the court to provide the court with as much information as it can have, about what the mother&#8217;s case is concerning the application that the father is making to this court. </p>

I point out at this stage that there has been no issue concerning the service of the proceedings but rather the service of the trial bundle.  The mother, of course, had service of the application which is why she wrote to Holman J on 15 April.  There has been no issue about service of or the issuing of the proceedings but rather of service receipt of the trial bundle in hard copy form, which I find  the mother has actively avoided. </p>

In my assessment, J is a child who has suffered significant trauma in the form of sexual abuse, &#8230; inappropriate familial relationships, the separation of her parents and parental conflict.  She has also experienced a high level of fear and anxiety due to the alleged threats her grandfather made should she disclose the abuse to anyone.  As such, her physical and emotional presentation over the last year has indicated that this is a child who has experienced distress and trauma. J has expressed reluctance to have contact with her father and has expressed fears that he will try to convince her to have further contact with her paternal family.  J is  also aware [that her] father has continued to have contact with his father, despite her allegations and I believe this has been very confusing for her to understand.  This also may lead to J being concerned about the extent to which her father could keep her safe, should she ever be in his care.  There are some concerns that the father may have attempted to influence J and persuade her to retract allegations which have concerned the mother but was alluded to by J when she was interviewed by the Polish prosecutor on 5 July 2017&#8217;. </p>

However, obviously, this Rule is not really relevant because the mother knew the judgment for non-return from the Polish court in the first instance, she was involved in those proceedings and, of course, the Children Act proceedings were already underway and this application flows from within those very proceedings.  It may have a different case number, but it is still part of these proceedings and I understand and endorse what the father did through his lawyers in any event, which is to ensure that there was a swift Article 11(7) hearing and that the matter did not fall between two stools while he waited for the courts. </p>

When, on whatever basis, it refuses an application under the Convention for return to a non-EU state, a court in England and Wales will conventionally embark (or make clear to the unsuccessful applicant that it would be willing to embark) on a merits-based inquiry into the arrangements which will best serve the welfare of the child; and it will reasonably anticipate, particularly in the light of the presence of the child here, that its decision will be fully enforceable.  But when, by reference to article 13 of the Convention, it refuses an application for a child's return to an EU state, it is aware that an order for return, immune from challenge, may nevertheless be forthcoming from that state; and that therefore the order for non-return may well provide no more than a breathing-space.  Prior to making the provision in article 11(8) of BIIR, the Council will no doubt have considered the extra difficulty which faces the court of habitual residence in conducting a satisfactory merits-based inquiry in circumstances in which the child is held abroad and the abducting parent, being also abroad, may decide not to participate or may be unable to fund participation.  Practical concerns of this character were presumably overridden by the importance attached to the principle of the primacy of the court of habitual residence (recital 12), to the principle of mutual trust between the courts of member states (recital 21) and to the availability of a power in the court of habitual residence, in specified circumstances of fair width, to request another member state to assume jurisdiction if it considers such to be in the best interests of the child (Article 15)&#8217;. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">&#8216;The crucial factor, in my view, is that this is a Texan child who is currently being denied a proper opportunity to develop a relationship with his father and with his country of birth.  For as long as the Texan order remains in force, his mother is most unlikely to allow, let alone to encourage, him to spend his vacations in America with his father.  Whilst conflicting orders remain in force, he is effectively denied access to his country of origin. Nor has his mother been exactly enthusiastic about contact here.  The best chance that K has of developing a proper relationship with both his parents, and with the country whose nationality he holds, is for the Texas court to consider where his best interests lie in the long term.  It is necessary to restore the synthesis between the two jurisdictions, which the mother&#8217;s actions have distorted.  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">Despite the passage of time, there is not the slightest reason to consider that K would suffer any significant harm by returning to Texas on the basis proposed by the father.  Indeed, the mother did not defend the Convention proceedings on the basis either of his objections or of a risk of harm should he be returned (although she did suggest that he had been settled here so long that to return would place him in an intolerable situation).  Had it not been for our decision on habitual residence &#8211; which I accept that courts in some jurisdictions might consider debatable, it would have been our duty to return K to Texas under the Convention&#8217;. </p>

My position is that the mother has alienated me from J&#8217;s life from August 2016 to date.  J is entitled to a proper and meaningful relationship with both her parents and unless a return order is made, I will have no relationship with J at all.  I spent time with J on 15 January 2018 for almost five hours during the course of the 1980 Convention proceedings in Poland.  This contact took place in front of a team of court-appointed psychologists.  The contact was positive as set out in the OZSS psychologist&#8217;s report dated 29 January 2018.  I believe that the mother has continued to alienate J since this contact.  The court directs that I should spend supervised time with J on alternate weeks started on 8 January 2018.  The mother did not facilitate the court-directed contact.  In addition, the mother sought directions for the preparation of further psychology reports.

The Guardian ended her evidence by saying that if a child is brought up saying that one parent is bad and one parent is good,  it is not right,  as that affects one&#8217;s feelings about one&#8217;s self and then that can lead, of course, to poor self-esteem in later life. </p>

With no contact with the paternal side of the family, it is not clear what narrative J has been given in relation to her move to Poland or her father&#8217;s absence from her life.  It is most unfortunate that this case has not progressed to any degree within the past two years since J was abducted.

Rather, for the legal process of that decision over long-term welfare, which was commenced before the child went on holiday a couple of years ago with her mother, to continue and to reach finality.  That process would include a decision in this Family Court about whether not the parents cross-allegations are true to the civil standard,  there having been no decision one way or the other in a civil or criminal court in England or Poland to date. </p>

As to ascertaining J&#8217;s wishes, I assume  she would make a plea at this present moment in time that she does not want to return to this jurisdiction and I assume there is going to be a big disruption to her school life.  However, all that the Guardian has said and the harm (emotional and developmental) that she is suffering and the ability for her mother to meet her long-term needs concern me greatly.  </p>

I find that all the provisions of article 41(2) have been met and re-reading all the documents that the mother has sent and going back through the allegations and the documents that we have had translated from the Polish courts, I have to say that I have no alternative but to order the summary return of this child to the jurisdiction. </p>

I ask that those that represent the father and the child ensure this draft order is firstly, filed and sealed as soon as possible and secondly, translated as soon as possible and an expedited transcript of this judgment is obtained so that I can tweak any unsolicited language and make any stylistic amendments and additions that I need to do. </p>
