He was born female but in September 2014 he told his adoptive parents he wanted to change his identity to be male.

Although there were concerns about his mental well being and general welfare, P settled in to this accommodation. He was and is a vulnerable young person with a history of repeated episodes of self harm, taking overdoses and extremely poor mental health. </p>

Detention by the State is, on any view, a very bad business. The award of damages &#8212; although they are customarily modest &#8212; should reflect the fact that it is only in Article 5 (5) of the Convention that compensation is mentioned. However I do not accept that awards of damages for State detention pursuant to the Convention are a class apart from all other types of damages. I do not accept that because they are awarded to Mr Faulkner as a victim of human rights violation that they should be subjected to a process of immunisation in the way that perhaps damages for personal injury or an award of damages for, say, the loss of an eye or a leg would not. Naturally, State detention is a bad business but the consequences of many personal injuries are far more long-enduring than temporary State detention as happened in this case by virtue of delay in convening a Parole Board hearing.</span></p>

The issue as to whether the statutory charge should apply was only raised at a later stage. On the information available, on 8 February 2016 the scope of the existing certificate was extended to cover an application for a declaration for breach of an injunction regarding disclosure of information. By letter dated 9 June 2016 funding to bring a claim for HRA breaches in the wardship proceedings was refused. The determination also stated that the conditions relating to waiver had not been satisfied because no specific individuals or group of individuals had been identified who would benefit from the proceedings and no clear indication of the number who might potentially benefit had been given, accordingly the case was determined not to meet the significant wider public interest test. No appeal has been received against his determination.</p>

The LAA confirms that nevertheless, should P recover damages for breach of his Human Rights within the wardship proceedings, then <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of LAPSO will mean that the statutory charge (calculated by reference to the costs incurred under the certificate) would attach to those damages as a matter of law. In the absence of a waiver, that would mean that the only practical way of ensuring P receives any money would be for the court to order that the Local Authority pay the costs of the wardship proceedings (or for P&#8217;s lawyers to make a claim under his certificate for their costs for those proceedings). </p>

That decision has not been appealed and in the circumstances the discretion to waive the charge cannot apply on the facts of P&#8217;s case.</p>

I understand their reasons for doing so but this court is not an alternative forum to hear an appeal against the LAA&#8217;s decision on funding. In those circumstances and with all due respect to counsel&#8217;s helpful written submissions of this issue, I limit myself to three observations. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, in its letter of 9 June 2016 refusing funding the LAA said &#8220;It does not appear to me from the information provided that [the disclosure of details about P&#8217;s personal life] was deliberate and cannot be considered a serious abuse of power.&#8221; I confess I do not understand that sentence. I cannot conceive how it could be considered that this disclosure was other than intentional if that is what the word &#8216;deliberate&#8217; was intended to convey. Moreover, (a) I do not understand why a test of a &#8216;serious abuse of power&#8217; was applied to this funding application and (b) this was evidently a serious breach of P&#8217;s Article 8 rights which had very significant adverse consequences for P. In my judgment this reason for refusing funding was plainly wrong.   </p>

If that bill had been resolved expeditiously, a new certificate would have been issued in respect of funding for an HRA claim rather than, as happened, extending the cover of the certificate originally issued in May 2015. On the LAA&#8217;s case, however, the issue of a new certificate would not have made any material difference to its submissions on the applicability of the statutory charge.</p>

Accordingly, there is at present no clearly identifiable class of individuals for whom this case would realise benefits and no clear indication of the number, who might potentially benefit. This is a damages claim, which is to be determined on its own, presently isolated, facts. For those reasons, I am not satisfied that this case is of significant wider public interest.&#8221;</p>

The HRA Claim arose, as the LAA understands it, as a result of conduct by the LCC that was not consistent with the way in which that issue was resolved, with the Court&#8217;s assistance, in these proceedings. It was therefore reliant on matters determined in RA&#8217;s favour in the wardship proceedings, for which funding for civil legal services was provided.</span></p>

Such a device would be inappropriate and would not result in the disapplication of the statutory charge because, as asserted above, the damages would be recovered in (unfunded) proceedings which were &#8220;in connection with&#8221; the (funded) wardship proceedings.</p>

First, the court is neither bound nor fettered in its determination of the legal issues or the factual matrix of a case by the submission of counsel. In any event counsel were afforded the opportunity to agree or disagree with the alternative analysis proposed by the court and to make submissions. P and the local authority have decided to agree with my propositions and questions. The LAA have had a full opportunity to respond and I can discern no procedural or substantive unfairness in the course I have adopted. </p>

I did not make an injunction or other order prohibiting the local authority from disclosing personal or private details about P to other persons, save against the local authority disclosing information to P&#8217;s adoptive parents: see paragraph 8 above. I made a declaratory order that the local authority was relieved of its statutory duty to give information about P to or to consult with P&#8217;s adoptive parents about P or his welfare. The LAA has proceeded and proceeds on the following assumptions:</p>

The claim had nothing to do with the declaratory relief granted to P in the wardship proceedings. This court was not notified of that alleged breach (now admitted) by an employee of the local authority which it should have been because P is a ward of this court and because of the adverse consequences of the wrongful disclosure on P. Furthermore the wrongful disclosure, insofar as it is relevant, was made to third parties and not to P&#8217;s adoptive parents. The local authority asserts that the third parties did not, in fact, pass on the disclosed information to P&#8217;s adoptive parents. </p>

No claim form was issued. The HRA claim and the quantum of damages were settled before a claim was issued. As referred to in paragraphs 58 and 59 above, rr. 21.10 and 8 of the CPR set out the appropriate procedure when a settlement is reached concerning a child or young person prior to the issue of proceedings. </p>

The approval of damages can be submitted by email and be dealt on the papers without the need for a hearing.

The preconditions set out in regulation 9 of the CLA(SC)R 2013 must be satisfied at the time the determination of funding is made and a decision to waive the statutory charge must be made at the same time.

Further I am wholly satisfied that any damages awarded to P in Part 8 proceedings were not recovered &#8220;in proceedings in connection with which [civil legal] services were provided.&#8221; Accordingly, however erroneous or muddled the LAA&#8217;s decision making was on this issue, in my view, for the reasons I have given above the statutory charge is not and cannot be applicable to P&#8217;s award of damages. </p>
