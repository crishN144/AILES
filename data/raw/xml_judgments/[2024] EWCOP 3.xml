	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This is an application concerning EUP, a woman in her late eighties. Later in this judgment, I will consider what EUP&#8217;s views may have been regarding her medical treatment. To try to evaluate this it is necessary for me to consider something of her life and the code by which she has lived it. EUP has plainly experienced a full and interesting life. Like all her generation, she was a child of the Second World War. The partitioning of India led ultimately to her and her husband settling in the United Kingdom. The couple was obviously happy and there were five children. They are a Hindu family and the traditions and customs of that religion and culture percolate, in varying degrees, and to different effect, throughout the entire family, as one would expect. One of EUP&#8217;s sons has suffered from significant mental health problems and has lived all his life in the family home. He is now, as I understand it, in his sixties. Until latterly, EUP was his primary carer. The application has been brought by GUP, her youngest son. The family have plainly agreed that he should bring the application, which they all support, though with differing degrees of emphasis. EUP&#8217;s life has not been without sadness or disappointment. In his early 70&#8217;s, her husband developed dementia. EUP cared for him personally for as long as she could and even at the very end of his life took an active role in managing his condition. That illness and decline had a significant emotional impact on EUP and her son and, I strongly suspect, the whole family. From seeing their father as a strong and independent man, they saw him transform into somebody they did not recognise and who did not recognise them. By the end, he lost his ability to swallow. This is something I will return to because it highlights something of EUP&#8217;s approach to death and terminal illness.</span></p>

GUP told me in his evidence that though she rarely left the house, in recent years, she remained active, engaged and interested in the world. She enjoyed cooking. She managed the housework and had been an active gardener, sometimes taking on tasks which GUP worried were too much for her. He once discovered her moving a number of quite large bricks around the garden. As he told me this, he communicated to me, not only his concern for his mother&#8217;s welfare, but an underlying delight with her energy and commitment. The recollection struck me as soothing to him. Happily, EUP lived at home with her eldest son and daughter throughout the pandemic. </span></p>

I sensed that with five children, she considered there to be a reasonable prospect of her becoming a grandmother. In her mid-eighties, however, EUP received the news that her daughter gave birth to a son. EUP&#8217;s delight was unconfined and, despite her present parlous condition, communicates itself, almost palpably, through GUP&#8217;s evidence. I am told that there is some confusion about EUP&#8217;s date of birth and that the birth certificate might be inaccurate. Accordingly, I am simply going to refer to her as being in her eighties. </span></p>

This was explained to be a procedure that carried significant risk and to be associated with further strokes. </span></p>

I have not been able to identify a clear or consistent approach to EUP&#8217;s care since that date. There has been increasing divergence between the growing hope of the family for some meaningful recovery and the view of the clinicians that comfort and dignity ought to be the focus of EUP&#8217;s care, at what they assess to be the end of her life. Whilst these two perspectives of EUP&#8217;s medical needs have diverged, I am concerned that the treatment she has received reflects a convergence between the two. In other words, the treatment plan has an air of compromise about it, a negotiation between the family and the medical team. There may, sometimes, be a place for that, but not if the person at the centre of it becomes marginalised. P (the protected party) must always be afforded care, which is identifiably in her own best interests. The family&#8217;s views are relevant only insofar as they provide a conduit for P&#8217;s own wishes and feelings. Families, however loving and well-meaning gain no dominion over their dying and incapacitous relatives. The family&#8217;s role, which is crucial, is to promote and not subvert P&#8217;s autonomy. </span></p>

She was, however, provided with hydration. It has been difficult to tease out the reasoning behind this approach. Ultimately, I have been unable to identify a cogent rationale. It reflects a compromise between the two different approaches identified above. Moreover, I do not consider it has been in the best interests of EUP. It is important, therefore, that I consider EUP&#8217;s clinical history. In doing so, I can draw heavily from the statement filed in this application by Dr Robert Simister, a Consultant/Neurologist and Clinical Director for Stroke and Acute Neurology at the National Hospital. It is important that I identify from the outset that I have found Dr Simister to be an extremely impressive witness. He has engaged with all the questions put to him, whether supportive or challenging. He has displayed, in my judgement, both kindness and empathy towards his patient and her family. Where he has, occasionally, advanced views expressed by a collection of other professionals and found those conclusions wanting, he has unhesitatingly withdrawn from them. I have been greatly impressed by his integrity, in circumstances where others perhaps might have been inclined to obfuscate.</span></p>

This was a higher risk intervention which required a complex decision- making process. The family were, by Dr Simister&#8217;s recollection, informed that the stenting procedure itself carried a risk of stroke. This was estimated at a likelihood of approximately 15% for poor clinical outcome and an additional 3% for mortality. GUP&#8217;s recognition of these statistics differs slightly but not in any significant way. On the ICU the managing team recognised that EUP was not awakening following the procedure and accordingly, further brain imaging was requested and undertaken. This showed that there had unfortunately been further stroke events in both cerebral hemispheres following the stenting.</span></p>

Further meetings between the ICU team and Dr Humphries, resulted in the family agreeing to extubation and transfer to the ward. There was no other option.

It was in this meeting, that the medical team explained, in clear terms, why it would not be possible for surgical treatments to be performed on EUP to introduce feeding via a tube through the abdominal wall or to insert tubes into the large veins. In consequence, focus returned to whether NGT insertion should be tried yet again. I am bound to say, I cannot see how, having regard to the history, this was thought to be in EUP&#8217;s interests.

It was further explained that they could not secure a safe and reliable feeding route. Since that point, EUP has been based on the ward. She has received, what is manifestly, a very high level of nursing care. It is testimony to that care that there has been no ward based significant infections and no skin injury due to immobility. The team and the family are in agreement that there is no obvious distress in day-to-day nursing. Intravenous fluids have continued. These have led to some fluid overload, which has become manifest as swelling and oedema of the arms and legs.</span></p>

There has been no observed episode of any directed limb movement. Prior to the stenting procedure, it was agreed that EUP was aphasic. This limited her ability to understand or verbally communicate her wishes on any question relating to her care. The bedside assessment, since the stenting, demonstrates that EUP has little or no interaction with her environment and is unable to non-verbally communicate her wishes. </span></p>

He too, thought it appeared as though she is nearing end of life. Dr Webber expressed the view that there is a high risk of her being in pain, discomfort and suffering. All the surrounding evidence that I have referred to, supports and corroborates that opinion. In view of that, the main motivation of any medical interventions should be directed at symptom support. He was clear that it would not be appropriate, in his opinion, to pursue enteral feeding either PEG, RIG or surgical gastrostomy, nor TPN. This, he was clear, would only serve to generate burdensome side effects without changing her prognosis. It is this that has been the central issue for the family.

I have been taken by all, to Dr Young&#8217;s observations. Dr Young&#8217;s review of EUP took place in the presence of the family and spoke at length with the family following this assessment. However, what is striking about his report is that he was alarmed that the intravenous fluids were beginning to cause potential distress with respect to the limb swelling. He confirmed that feeding was not possible and recommended that care is to be focussed, palliatively, at the final stage of life. In the statement that he provided at short notice, Dr Simister emphasised Dr Young&#8217;s observations on this occasion. Dr Simister is emphasising that Dr Young, at the very least, was flagging up that the intraveneous fluids were likely to be of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;dubious benefit&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.

In my survey of this clinical picture, I must, for completeness, incorporate two further views. First from the nutrition team. </span></p>

His report sets out, in some detail, the explanation the unacceptable risks that would be associated with gastrostomy tube insertion. He also explained that parenteral nutrition (known as TPN) would be particularly hazardous generating, as it does, elevated risks for sepsis and vessel clotting. The statistical possibilities of this strike me as irrelevant to the evaluation as to whether this course should even be tried, given that it would not alter EUP&#8217;s prognosis. In simple terms, there would be burden without benefit and risk of a painful and difficult death. Due to the challenges of placing a central line and because of the expectation that EUP would need to move back to a high dependency environment for daily and sometimes multiple daily blood testing. Dr Magee noted that the typical indications for TPN in patients with limited life expectancy are covered by national guidelines and require either excellent performance status or expected life expectancy greater than 3 months, neither of which is the case for EUP. All feedback from these assessments has been shared on several occasions with the family. </span></p>

The intravenous fluids are likely to be prolonging life but will not change final outcome. In his oral evidence, Dr Simister told me that having communicated more widely with his colleagues overnight, the only identifiable &#8216;benefit&#8217; of the hydration is to maintain a level of alertness. It has no impact on symptom control, indeed, this can be done more effectively by alternative strategies such as moistening of the mouth and tongue. The swelling has caused stretching of the tissues, as well as tearing. It is difficult to insert the cannula which requires to be replaced regularly. GUP agrees that this is, at best, every two or three days, but sometimes more frequently. Resiting has become difficult and uncomfortable. One of the clinical team has noted crepitations in EUP&#8217;s chest, bilaterally. This, he suspected, to be caused by a leakage of fluid into the lungs, consequent upon the hydration related oedema. This was causing EUP to struggle and cough. Based on his working hypothesis, the doctor treated this with a diuretic. At risk of stating the obvious, the diuretic was intended to dispel the fluid, that is its job. It was successful. The fluid was expelled. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the leakage into the lungs is related to the artificial hydration. In my judgement, GUP, who is an articulate and intelligent man, who has navigated these proceedings and the range of views within his family, regarding his mother&#8217;s treatment with skill and sensitivity, also recognises the force of this analysis. He told me that if driven to choose between the provision of nutrition or hydration, he would choose nutrition. He reasoned that the concomitant hydration involved in the provision of nutrition might reduce the risk of swelling and oedema. This struck me as an intelligent hypothesis and Dr Simister, when it was put to him, did not discount it. It is perhaps convenient to say at this point, that I have been enormously impressed with GUP&#8217;s integrity. I think his evidence on this point illustrates it. I heard from his twin sister, HUP. It was clear that she loves her mother greatly but I found her to be oppositional and angry towards the clinical team in a way that is unproductive for all concerned. Anger is a recognised facet of grief and sadly, the onset of grief does not await death itself. I emphasise that I do not condemn or criticise her, but I do strongly encourage her to make what I am satisfied are the last days or weeks of her mother&#8217;s life as comfortable as possible and free from conflict. I have no doubt that she has the capacity to do so. </span></p>

I accept what GUP says about the changes in his mother&#8217;s eye movements. He has questioned himself, properly, as to whether these can bear the significance that he wishes to attribute to them. This, he tells me, is why he has solicited the observations of friends. Dr Simister and the treating clinicians have not observed this change. Inevitably, they do not spend anything like the time that GUP and HUP do with their mother. Both stay with her regularly overnight at the hospital. Indeed, as I understand it, for the last two weeks, they have both stayed there every night. The nursing staff do not appear to have seen these changes either. They, of course, spend far more time with EUP than the Consultants do and so I attribute some significance to the fact that they have not seen these changes. Nonetheless, I am prepared to accept what GUP says but I do so on the basis that EUP&#8217;s opening of her eyes must be infrequent (otherwise, the nurses would have noticed it).

In accord with all the provided opinions all options for repeated NGT insertion have been exhausted. In accord with the recent specialist opinions I recognise that the ongoing intravenous fluid administration may potentially cause problems with skin break down, limb pain due to swelling and painful cannula insertion. In accord with all provided opinion I judge that if there becomes a situation where the team or the family are noted active distress then the management of the cause of this should take precedence. In accord with all provided opinion I judge that EUP is in the last days of life&#8221;.</span></p>

In view of this, the main motivation of any medical interventions should be directed at symptom support. It would not be appropriate, in my opinion, to pursue enteral feeding either PEG, RIG or surgical gastronomy, nor TPN, which would all cause unacceptable side-effects without altering her prognosis. Whilst it is difficult to predict the exact prognosis in terms of life expectancy, it seems as though she is in the final stage of life and we should therefore concentrate on ensuring comfort and dignity rather than any interventions which would prolong her suffering and the dying phase (which would not prolong life of meaningful quality).&#8221;</span></p>

The forensic approach is 'subjective', in the sense that it requires all involved, family members, treating clinicians, the Courts to conduct an intense focus on the individual at the centre of the process. Frequently, it will involve drilling down into the person's life, considering what he or she may have said or written and a more general evaluation of the code and values by which they have lived their life.</span></p>

It is not difficult to see how they might react in that way. She was, for them, a dutiful and devoted mother. She was plainly strong minded. She was uncompromising on her daughter&#8217;s divorce, which she volubly disapproved of. Her approach, I suspect, was probably wrong, but undoubtedly well-meaning. She provided an upbringing for her family, which manifestly allowed their potential to flourish and find expression in their interesting and varied careers. GUP told me that he was a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;fussy eater&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">and his mother would prepare dishes for him which were </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;lamb and chicken based&#8221;,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> as he preferred.

GUP, though himself traumatised, took another view. Insofar as this casts light on what EUP would have wanted, in her present predicament, it points to her being prepared to go to any length to hold on to life. However, GUP has also told me that if her present circumstances were all that was open to her, or something very like them, he did not think that his mother would want such a situation. GUP identified nothing in anything his mother had said to support this. I have more than a suspicion that it reflects his objective view of her circumstances and is not, strictly speaking, a reflection of his mother&#8217;s views. I recognise the strain he faces. Ultimately, the evidence does not provide any clear indication of what EUP would have wanted other than every opportunity to see more of her children and grandchild. However, the providing of nutrition is not a medically ethical option nor, in my judgement of the available evidence, has it been for some time. It cannot be achieved without further burden and there is no prospect of it changing the prognosis. In any event, even if I were unpersuaded by the medical evidence, I certainly could not compel the doctors to undertake treatment contrary to their own medical ethics: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">R (Burke) v GMC</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/1003" uk:canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 1003" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ 1003</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] QB 273" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] QB 273</ref>.</span></p>

The provision of IV fluid is of itself apparently causing harm by oedema.  When asked for the rationale for its continued provision Dr Simister relied on the effect of it hydrating the mouth and avoiding that particular discomfort. However the evidence is that moistening of the mouth is achievable through other care.  The Official Solicitor&#8217;s position is that in [EUP] case giving IV fluid/glucose in the absence of providing nutrition can be properly construed as prolonging her death rather than preserving life.  There are no other discernible benefits of IV fluid that cannot be achieved by other external means.  To preserve her life in the hope of neurological recovery is unrealistic.  The Official Solicitor&#8217;s view is therefore of the view that continuation of IV fluid is not in EUP&#8217;s best interests. </span></p>

In his evidence, Dr Simister was at pains to draw a distinction between artificial provision of nutrition and consuming food by eating. He told me that patients sometimes get to a stage when the desire for nutrition goes altogether. It is not experienced any longer as pain or starvation. He considers this likely to be EUP&#8217;s situation and does not think that this will cause her pain. Furthermore, he points to the availability of an experienced palliative care team who will be able to ensure her comfort. </span></p>

Though I do not wish to protract it unnecessarily, it is important that I say something relating to the issues concerning the procedure that has been pursued in this case. The Official Solicitor expressly deprecates the fact that GUP was required to bring this application before the court himself. The consequence has been some procedural confusion which has generated delay and led to this case being listed in the urgent applications list.  Inevitably, as a litigant in person, GUP had not identified in advance or in clear terms the relief he sought. The Trust had also failed to give sufficient thought to their obligations to their patient in relation to the hydration that she was receiving and which had been identified as delivering burden without benefit. The hearing, therefore, has been to some degree dynamic, however, as is clear from the above, GUP has advanced his case clearly and cogently and made it perfectly plain what he would wish to happen. I have found many of his questions to be insightful and well-constructed, as I have commented upon during the evidence. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In this case, the hospital had put in place a regime focused on palliative care. As I have identified above, this is undoubtedly in EUP&#8217;s best interests, at least at the stage at which I am hearing the case. However, it was also clear that GUP and his family were never fully on board with that plan. It is certainly the case that there was a broadly co-operative relationship with GUP but I think it was equally clear that he had not accepted the medical consensus. The same applies to his sister, HUP. Who has expressed strenuous resistance to the hospital&#8217;s plans at this hearing. GUP has told me that the hospital had indicated to him that they were to make an application to court to seek endorsement of their approach. I do not think this is in dispute. However, on 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> January 2024, the Trust confirmed to the family that they had been advised by their lawyers that it was not necessary for them to issue an application. The likely reasoning behind this is that the Trust considered that there was no ethical route to provide nutrition to EUP. The family disagreed and saw this as passivity, with profound consequences. They perceived an important decision having been taken, even though the decision was to take no action. They considered that the Court ought to be able to review that decision making process and identify its own evaluation of where EUP&#8217;s best interests lay. I agree with the family. A decision not to provide nutrition is every bit as serious as a decision to withdraw nutrition. Where there is conflict, these cases must be resolved by the court. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Ms Dolan submits that the practice guidance, which I issued in January 2020, then as Vice President of the Court of Protection, indicates that the Trust, in circumstances such as these, should bring the case to court promptly. Whilst that document is expressly stated to be by way of guidance only, it is rarely departed from in cases of this gravity. Had the Trust followed it, and at an earlier stage, it would have greatly alleviated the stress to the family. Ms Dolan goes further in her written submissions but I do not. Neither can I imagine that the lawyers advising this Trust were unfamiliar with the guidance. It has been widely promulgated, see also </span><a class="Hyperlink" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCOP/2020/2.html" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2020/2" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCOP 2" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCOP 2</ref></a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Where there is conflict in these serious medical treatment cases, it is in everybody&#8217;s best interests, but most importantly P&#8217;s, to bring an application to court. That will be most efficiently achieved where it is driven by the Trust&#8217;s application. There are many and obvious reasons why it is also to the Trust&#8217;s advantage to have their treatment plans, in cases such as this, scrutinised by the court. </span></p>
