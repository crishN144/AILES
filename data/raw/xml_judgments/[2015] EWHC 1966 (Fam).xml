The orders I made late on the evening of 23 June and my reasons for making those orders are set out in detail in my judgment of 24 June 2015 (see <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/1920" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 1920 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 1920 (Fam)</ref>).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, the report of Professor Bush makes clear that whilst Y&#8217;s medical condition, Spinal Muscular Atrophy type 1, results in extensive muscle weakness which impacts adversely on the functions of breathing, coughing and swallowing, it does not affect intelligence.   Within this context, Professor Bush makes clear that, prior to the medical difficulties that commenced in March of this year, Y was an alert, interactive, happy and smiling child who had a good quality of life despite her extensive muscle weakness.</p>

It should further be noted that the inestimable contribution that Y&#8217;s parents have made to her welfare has been achieved in the context of the parents having a number of children and Y having a sibling who is also very ill.  Professor Bush describes the position thus:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.27in">&#8220;I should like to give context to this report by paying unqualified tribute to the care, love, devotion and expertise which Y&#8217;s family lavished on her in supporting her through these technically demanding treatments for many years.  Without their loving care and attention, Y would undoubtedly have died many years ago.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As set out in my first judgment in this case, since March 2015 Y&#8217;s condition has deteriorated in an acute manner, culminating in two out of hospital episodes of cardio-respiratory arrest in late March and early April.   EEGs performed on Y following her resuscitation from these episodes indicated that Y had developed a severe encephalopathy with no eleptiform activity.  CT and MRI scans confirmed hypoxic ischaemic change in Y&#8217;s brain.  It was the assessment of Y&#8217;s treating doctors that Y&#8217;s neurological condition had deteriorated very significantly following her out of hospital cardio-respiratory arrests.  Y&#8217;s treating consultant paediatric intensivist, Dr E, was of the view that the severe hypoxic ischaemic injury that has resulted in Y&#8217;s severely altered neurological state is irreversible.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In particular, whilst Y had previously been verbally communicative and had made use of an iPad, Dr E noted that as a consequence of the insults to her brain Y now made no attempt at communication and showed no evidence of cognitive activity.  He considered that she no longer made any purposeful movement, that she was unable to communicate and that she was unable to fix and follow.  It was also the case that Y had no independent cough reflex and therefore was unable to clear her own secretions.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By reason of her stark neurological deterioration Y remained in the paediatric high dependency unit and dependent on bi-level positive airway pressure, regular suctioning, chest physio and cough assist.  Y had input from the respiratory, palliative care and critical care teams.  </p>

	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst consideration was being given to whether a plan could be implemented to discharge Y home, on 23 June Y&#8217;s condition deteriorated significantly to the point where Y required constant non-invasive ventilation. On the evening of 23 June Dr E considered that Y would likely die at any time if not given invasive ventilation in the form of intubation and artificial ventilation.  He was very firmly of the view that such invasive ventilation would not be in Y&#8217;s best interests in circumstances where she would derive no benefit from it beyond her life being prolonged artificially in her irreversible neurological state. Dr E was further very strongly of the view that any attempt at CPR should Y suffer cardio-respiratory arrest would not be in her best interests.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents disagreed with this evaluation and considered that Y should be intubated and receive invasive ventilation, and should receive CPR if necessary, believing that this treatment would enable Y to recover to the position she was in prior to her cardio-respiratory arrest at the beginning of April and to return home. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father however contended that Y should, albeit now for a defined and limited period, be intubated and invasively ventilated in order to determine whether such treatment would be effective.  Within this context the father contended that before deciding whether to make the declaration as to endoctrachael intubation and invasive ventilation &#8216;final&#8217; (the effect of which would be to authorise the treating doctors not to pursue the time limited course of treatment sought by the father) the court should secure updated second opinions from both Dr Jungbluth and Professor Bush.</p>

The Children&#8217;s Guardian was however concerned to ensure that an updating second opinion was obtained from Professor Bush confirming Y&#8217;s current respiratory position.</p>

Dr Jungbluth concludes that this damage has further affected her already markedly compromised ability to move, to swallow, to clear secretions and to protect her own airway.   Dr Jungbluth notes that the hypoxic ischaemic damage to Y&#8217;s brain has also severely affected her ability to communicate, which ability had, up until recently, been well preserved.</p>

Examples include children in Persistent Vegetative State (PVS), Minimally Conscious State, or those with such severe cognitive impairment that they lack demonstrable or recorded awareness of themselves or their surroundings and have no meaningful interaction with them, as determined by rigorous and prolonged observations. Even in the absence of demonstrable pain or suffering, continuation of LST may not be in their best interests because it cannot provide overall benefit to them. Individuals and families may differ in their perception of benefit to the child and some may view even severely limited awareness in a child as sufficient grounds to continue LST. It is important, here as elsewhere, that due account of parental views wishes and preferences is taken and due regard given to the acute clinical situation in the context of the child&#8217;s overall situation. Although it is possible to distinguish these different groups of decisions to limit LSTs that are based on quality-of-life considerations, in practice combinations may be present. For example, a child or infant in intensive care may have sustained such significant brain injury that future life may provide little benefit, while both intensive treatment and future life are likely to cause the child substantial pain and distress.&#8221;</p>

The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit&#8230; Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counterbalancing dis-benefits to the applicant. An obvious instance in this case would be the apprehension, the risk and discomfort inherent in the operation. Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of certain and possible losses. Obviously, only if the account is in relatively significant credit will the judge conclude that the application is likely to advance the best interests of the claimant.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having regard to the evidence of Dr Jungbluth and Professor Bush that re-intubation and invasive ventilation would prolong Y&#8217;s suffering and the act of dying and would risk keeping Y in a permanent vegetative state, I am reinforced in my conclusion that the course favoured by Y&#8217;s doctors is the one most likely to ensure that Y enjoys the greatest level of dignity in death.  I remind myself once again of Dr E&#8217;s evidence that such a course would allow the parents to be and to remain physically much closer to Y than if she was intubated and invasively ventilated at this point in time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I recognised during the course of my first judgment in this matter, the strong presumption in favour of a course of action that will prolong life is not an irrebuttable one.  This position reflects the fact that life, as precious as it is, cannot be, and indeed should not be preserved at all costs in the face of its natural conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In concluding his report Professor Bush encapsulated the intensely human dilemma that lies at the centre of cases in which the wishes of a loving and devoted family differ from the carefully considered medical opinion of treating doctors as to a gravely ill child&#8217;s best interests.  Professor Bush said this:</p>

I acknowledge also their grief at Y&#8217;s present situation and their indubitable wish to do the best for their child.  It is a source of great distress to me that I find that my views are in opposition to those of a family for whom I have the most profound respect.  However, I believe that my duty to Y herself is paramount.&#8221;</p>
