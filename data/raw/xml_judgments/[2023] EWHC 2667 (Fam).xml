	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">This case is about a young girl who only recently turned 15.  This judgment is a culmination of a number of hearings. However, these hearings have taken place over a relatively short period of time. One on 21 September, at Preston in which the local authority was represented by Mr. Buchan and the guardian by Ms Bowcock, K.C. Then, on 26 September, when the Local Authority was represented by Ms. Woods, and the guardian by Ms Butterfield. Then on 3 October at Blackpool where the Local Authority was represented by Ms Gane and the guardian by Ms Bowcock, K.C. The last of these hearings was on 19 October 2023, and Mrs Griffin represented the LA and Mr Donnelly the Guardian. I am grateful to all those named, their instructing solicitors, the guardian, and the social workers. They have all worked very hard and I know they have all been affected by the plight of this young woman.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">This case is extremely disturbing.  At an earlier hearing, two very experienced counsel, an equally experienced guardian and two experienced social workers said that the level of restrictions that had been placed upon this child were the most intense they had seen in their cumulatively long careers, but that they were entirely at a loss to think that any lesser restrictions could safely be imposed upon her.</span></p>

Initially, that was in a placement which had been found after a long period of searching, but by 26 September that placement had broken down somewhat dramatically with another act of extreme self-harm on her part.  At that stage I thought it was time for the court to give a judgment. I delivered an ex tempore judgment and I ordered a transcript be obtained. Whilst I was waiting for that transcript the hearing on 3 October took place. I need to update my earlier judgment, so what follows is a combined original and updated judgment. I hope this places the case in its proper perspective.</span></p>

Her mother had mental health difficulties, engaged in substance abuse and was a victim of domestic violence.  Claire has had little contact with her father, and he has played no part either in the care proceedings or this separate inherent jurisdiction application.  That disturbed upbringing came to a terrible climax in January 2022 when Claire&#8217;s mother died and she then had to be cared for by her older sister, JX.  Despite JX&#8217;s best efforts, it proved impossible for her keep her sister safe.  Care proceedings were issued in relation to Claire, and I made a final care order on 7 August 2023. Claire is now in the care of the local authority, Lancashire County Council (LCC).</span></p>

She is troubled, traumatised and, I would add, completely unable to cope with her feelings.  She could not return to her sister&#8217;s care, because her sister simply would not be able to cope with her. So started the search for a placement to get her out of hospital and in to somewhere safe.  That is a search that has been renewed on numerous occasions by the local authority, who have tried their best to help.</span></p>

She was moved to a place called Buchie Care at Liverpool in May where her behaviour was described by the local authority as becoming slightly &#8220;less extreme&#8221;.  I pause there to emphasise that the behaviour was still &#8220;extreme&#8221;, just a little less so.  However, she absconded from there in July and was found by the police on a bridge from which she was threatening to throw herself.</span></p>

At that point she was assessed by Dr. A, who is a psychiatrist, in order to determine whether she was eligible for Tier 4 in-patient assessment.  She was assessed as not eligible for Tier 4 and a quote from the assessment is that her presentation was: &#8220;Emotional dysregulation secondary to historic trauma and adverse social history with attachment difficulties, loss and grief&#8221;.  The doctor identified that Claire had a diagnosis of ADHD, that she was impulsive and had little sense of danger and that this fell within the category of &#8220;Neurodiversity&#8221; rather than mental illness.  Although the criteria for admission under the MHA is the somewhat general category &#8220;mental disorder&#8221; rather than the more specific &#8220;mental illness&#8221;.</span></p>

As a result, she ended up remaining at Alder Hey in a cubicle off a ward.  Of course, being in a cubicle off a ward at Alder Hey poses enormous difficulties for a hospital that deals with the most seriously chronically sick children and whose parents want to be with them. Having someone like Claire with behavioural problems living in a cubicle just off the ward is troubling both for those visiting and for the hospital staff and administration.  However, most importantly, Claire did not benefit from living in a cubicle off a ward because all she had there was &#8220;containment and safety&#8221;.  There was no real opportunity for her to be treated for her underlying psychological problems, to be educated or to have anything like the normal life that a 14 or 15-year-old girl would want.</span></p>

Initially, there were some positive signs that there her needs could be met in the longer term and she, initially anyway, appeared to take to the place in a way that she had not done before.  It is worth remembering that Claire wants to be normal.  She wants to have a normal life, to be educated in a school, and to have positive relationships with her peer group.  In any event, she had something of a normal life for a short period of time in July 2023 when she was living at Red Brick House, including meeting her family to celebrate her sister&#8217;s birthday.  However, there were also events involving self-harm, cutting herself with glass, and swallowing pieces of glass.  She absconded.  She was seen taking Stanley knife blades from a shop and there was obviously great concern that she was going to use those to harm herself.  She did, when challenged, hand over shards of glass and screws, but the blades were not found.  She repeatedly said that she just wanted to die.</span></p>

She absconded whilst continuing to cut herself.  The police found her, but she continued the self-harm.  She was taken to hospital and was admitted overnight.  She was assessed by CAMHS, a multiagency meeting took place and then she was discharged.  After that she handed over more blades that she had concealed in her bra.  </span></p>

At the same time, she showed staff at the Hospital that her self-inflicted wounds were healing, and she was sad that they were healing because missed the sensation of being able to pick at the scabs. Later that day, she absconded from the Hospital and swallowed glass. She was returned to her placement the next day and was promptly readmitted to Hospital having broken glass at her placement and swallowed it. This followed an attempt to abscond during which she was restrained by staff.</span></p>

It must be difficult for somebody who is in good mental health to have four people with them all the time, but for somebody with the terrible difficulties that Claire has it must be awful.  However, what else can be done when a person is trying to harm themselves as determinedly and seriously as Claire is?  The most recent example I was given at that hearing was that she smashed a door down at the placement in the West Midlands, not so she could escape but so she could get access to the screws which she could then ingest.</span></p>

Her ability to regulate the emotions that will follow from that are well-documented and non-existent.

It appears it is of a nature and a degree that needs treatment of some sort and in a place of security. It means that she is an enormous risk to her own health and safety but also, potentially anyway, to others. In the absence of any other suitable placement, it seems necessary for her to receive at very least assessment and probably further treatment in a psychiatric facility to address that disorder.

I am grateful to HZ for her expertise and candour. HZ explained to me why Claire was not detainable within a Tier 4 CAMHS facility under the MHA. That conclusion was reached after a lengthy period of assessment during which Claire engaged with those assessing her. The assessors were aware of the detailed history I have summarised above. They were also aware of the CAMHS assessment carried out whilst Claire was placed in Salford. Claire&#8217;s presentation in Salford was summarised in a letter from Greater Manchester NHS Foundation Trust dated 18 August 2023. During the assessment at Salford &#8220;there was no evidence of an acute mental disorder that would likely respond to treatment in an acute mental health inpatient setting. There was no objective evidence of mood disorder, acute anxiety or psychotic features&#8221;. The self-harm Claire had inflicted &#8220;was in the context of emotional dysregulation linked to social stressors, namely&#8230;&#8230;attachment difficulties and feelings of destabilisation due to multiple placement moves, and removal from family and usual social support networks&#8221;.</span></p>

In relation to her family and usual support networks, it will also be noted that Claire&#8217;s removal from her family and those networks came about because of the crisis I have described in which her family and those networks were incapable of keeping her safe. In short, I did not find the Salford assessment very compelling.  HZ and her colleagues concluded that there were no obvious signs of a diagnosable mental health condition that would warrant Tier 4 admission. Her behaviour appeared to be &#8220;due to her traumatic and adverse childhood experiences&#8221; and (emphasis added) &#8220;she would warrant </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">longer term therapeutic work</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> in collaboration </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">with a contained and varying environment</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">&#8221;.</span></p>

Until that is available the treatment will not be offered.

In order for treatment to take place it would be preferable for there to be a stable and safe placement in which Claire will reside for some time. At present, the Hospital setting is sub-optimal. She is medically (i.e. physically) fit for discharge, and will leave as soon as a suitable place can be found. The continuing involvement of the Sandwell CAMHS Crisis Team, and the other longer term CAMHS teams will depend on where she is discharged.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The issue of discharge is, however, extremely problematic. It seems probable that the best option, perhaps the only entirely suitable option is for Claire to be placed in secure accommodation. However, as of 11 October 2023 there were only 7 beds available nationally, one of those is male only, with 48 live referrals pending (including Claire&#8217;s). I was told that it is within the knowledge of one of the social workers for one child referred for secure accommodation to be waiting for 12 months for a secure bed. I say this not to re-emphasise yet again the lack of secure places nationally; that is accepted as being a national crisis, and many Courts have &#8220;shouted&#8221; about that. Rather, it seems to me to be directly relevant to what is in Claire&#8217;s best interests at this stage. Even if it is accepted that she is not detainable in a Tier 4 provision, there is no doubt she requires therapeutic input in order to address whatever it is that causes her dysregulated behaviour. She is a young person who is still developing both mentally and physically. Time is of the essence because any delay in that input could have longer term effects on how she develops. </span></p>

This recognises two aspects of this case that seem clear. First, that Claire needs therapeutic input to address the underlying mental health condition, whatever that may be. Although she ideally needs that in a place where she is secure and stable, the fact is that level of security and stability simply is not available at the moment. Finding an alternative placement is likely to prove difficult and may involve a protracted search period, and that is the second aspect. Certainly, if the experience of previous searches is an indicator, finding a satisfactory placement rather than one that is barely adequate will take a while. In the meantime, Claire needs the treatment and other input.</span></p>

She is an extreme example of a child who is dysregulated and whose behaviour is out of control.  The risks she poses to herself are quite simply catastrophic.  I appreciate that the local authority social worker has made that case and it has been accepted at the highest level. The Local Authority find themselves once again at the brick wall against which they have been banging their heads consistently for some months, because of the lack of adequate provision of secure accommodation. All they can do is try to create security in an inadequate provision.  However, that is proving to be disastrous, because even if Claire does not succeed in killing herself and does reach maturity, the events of the last seven or eight months and the events that will no doubt follow will have caused such a disruption to her childhood that the damage may be long-lasting and probably permanent.</span></p>

However, there is nothing this Court can do to require the use of the MHA. The guardian is pondering whether judicial review of the sectioning decision is a feasible option. I consider in the meantime that it is necessary for an expert to be instructed to consider Claire&#8217;s overall mental health care and the direction of that care. This appears not to be taking place in a coordinated way as it is. What I cannot do is compel anyone to detain Claire under the MHA. This was made clear, albeit under slightly different circumstances by Mr Justice McDonald in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">Blackpool BC v HT</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> (etc) [2022] EWHC 1480. What His Lordship said at [51] is also highly relevant to this case:</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">This matter represents another example, amongst many examples, of a case in which the acute lack of appropriate resources, for children assessed as not meeting the relevant criteria for detention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 2</ref> or 3 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>) but requiring therapeutic care within a restrictive environment for acute behavioural and emotional issues arising from past trauma, creates tension between a local authorities and the NHS. As a result, the matter comes before the court with the local authority asserting that the NHS should be making provision for the child and the NHS arguing that the child does not meet the criteria for such provision.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I am troubled however, that those involved in CAMHS provision and Tier 4 decision making have to recognise this resource crisis and have to take the lack of adequate social provision into account when making decisions under the MHA. Of course, a 14- or 15-year-old child should not be detained in a secure psychiatric facility if there is a less restrictive option that can achieve appropriate care for her. Or, put another way, treatment in Hospital is not necessary if (but only if) there is suitable care available outside Hospital. If that placement is not available within a reasonable timescale, then treatment in Hospital is surely necessary.
