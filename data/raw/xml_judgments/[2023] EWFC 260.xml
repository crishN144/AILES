At that time the concerns which have led to the local authority issuing proceedings on 17&#160;May&#160;2022, were set out in a threshold document prepared by Miss&#160;Benson, dated 26&#160;October 2022.  I&#160;do not intend on reading out the contents of that document verbatim for the purposes of this <span style="font-style:italic">ex&#160;tempore</span> judgment. Suffice it to say that those concerns were focused around previous proceedings where M had been found by the court to have caused injuries to C&#8217;s older half sibling in November 2019, leading to the removal of that child from the mother&#8217;s care and permanent placement outside of her care at the end of the proceedings.</p>

In particular in respect of the previous proceedings, the local authority was concerned that M had not accepted any responsibility for the physical harm that the court had found that she had caused to the older sibling and, as such, the risks around that physical harm associated with C simply could not be managed.  </p>

They had undertaken assessments which had concluded that it would not be safe for C to remain in the long-term care of this mother and this father; and so then at that stage the plan, which was supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, was one of placement outside of the family by way of adoption.</p>

It is right to say that during the social worker&#8217;s evidence the social worker confirmed that there were in fact many good things to say &#8211; not just about this mother but also about this father.  I&#160;focus on the mother, because it became clear during the social worker&#8217;s evidence that many of the issues that surrounded the mother within the previous proceedings, revolving around previous relationship, had now changed for the better.  It seemed that her circumstances had improved since the last set of proceedings.  However, the focus of the local authority had remained during the currency of these proceedings on the physical risk that the mother posed and how that risk could be managed if the mother did not accept the previous findings made by the court.</p>

As a result, the final hearing was suspended and I&#160;made a number of case management directions, including a direction that there be an independent social work assessment undertaken by Debbie Gaskin.  That independent social worker assessment unfortunately, for reasons which I&#160;do not need to delve into as part of this <span style="font-style:italic">ex&#160;tempore</span> judgment, took far longer than expected.  </p>

It can only be justified if it is necessary and proportionate to the risk of harm to the child.  If such an order is made, there will be a real prospect of further litigation in the future because the responsible local authority should regularly review whether the care of the child is such that the order is no longer necessary and, if so, an application to discharge the order should be made.

There should be exceptional reasons for a court to make a care order on the basis of such a plan.  The making of a care order as intended to be used as a vehicle for provision of support and services, that is wrong.  A&#160;means route should be devised to provide these necessary support and services without the need to make a care order.  Consideration should be given to the making of a supervision order which may be an appropriate order to support the reunification of a family.  The risks of significant harm to the child are either judged to be such that the child should be removed from the care of the parents and carers, or some lesser legal order and regime is required.  Any placement with parents under an interim or final order should be evidenced to comply with the statutory regulations for placement at home.</p>

A care order represents a serious intervention by the state in the life of the child and in the lives of the parents in terms of the respective ECHR Article&#160;8 rights.

My decision, then, is not about using the final Order as a vehicle for the services that might be made available to this family in any event, but ensuring that the vehicle which provides the necessary oversight, support, review and hands-on local authority involvement, does not run out of gas to the detriment of this child.</p>
