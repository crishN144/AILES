Within days of her birth she had seemingly been abandoned and was placed in a children&#8217;s home from which plight, as they saw it, she was &#8216;rescued&#8217; by a white British couple, Mr Y and Ms Z. They brought her to this country on 23 July 2006, using a false Kenyan birth certificate and a false Kenyan passport for her and concealing her presence from the local authority. </p>

		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is important to be precise as to what, in this context, I mean by illegality. It is clear that X&#8217;s removal from Kenya and introduction into this country involved breaches both of Kenyan law &#8211; Kenyan adoption law and Kenyan criminal law (the obtaining of false documents) &#8211; and of English law &#8211; English immigration law and English adoption law. It is also clear, in my judgment, and I so find, that both Mr Y and Ms Z were aware &#8211; knew &#8211; that the scheme which they jointly planned and implemented involved (i) the obtaining by deception of false Kenyan documents, (ii) the introduction of X into this country by deception of the United Kingdom immigration authorities and (iii) breaches of English adoption law (at least insofar as they knowingly omitted to notify the local authority of X&#8217;s presence, either before or after her arrival in this country, and deliberately decided to side-step the necessary process of assessment). </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">What is not so clear is whether, and if so to what extent, they were aware that what they were doing involved breaches of Kenyan adoption law. I have my suspicions. After all, it is clear that they obtained at least some advice on this topic from [Mr M, a lawyer in Kenya], and it might be thought unlikely that he would not have told them enough for them to appreciate that what they were doing was contrary to Kenyan adoption law. But, not least because of their continuing coyness &#8211; in plain words, their continuing refusal to give a frank account of their dealings with Mr [M] &#8211; I am unable to find as a fact that they were aware that what they were doing involved breaches of Kenyan adoption law.&#8221;</p>

It has been a tragedy for X and has become, and, I fear will long remain, a tragic nightmare for Mr Y and Ms Z. It is all too easy to say that they have only themselves to blame, that they have brought it on themselves. But the truth &#8211; and the tragedy &#8211; is that they did it all, I am quite satisfied, with the best of motives and impelled by nothing other than care and love for X. Having in March 2006 made a fatal decision to utilise what they initially thought was a loophole but which almost immediately snared them in what they well knew was illegality, they then found themselves trapped in a nightmare from which they could see no escape.&#8221;</p>

The fact that, despite his elevated status in Kenya, he had involved himself personally in this case and, with [one of his social workers], had travelled to this country and attended court throughout the first week of the hearing (for which I am exceedingly grateful), testified compellingly to his commitment and the commitment of the GRK generally to X&#8217;s welfare. His thoughtful, nuanced, reflective and child-centred evidence similarly testified to both his understanding of the issues in this very difficult case and to the welcome openness of mind and flexibility of thinking he was so very willing to bring to bear. Obviously I was not privy to what were plainly the very fruitful discussions he had out of court with both the local authority and the guardian, but I am not at all surprised to hear how positively they reacted to their discussions with him. It accorded entirely with the impression I had gained seeing him in court and hearing him give evidence.</p>

The commitment it has demonstrated to one of its children is, if I may be allowed to say so, very impressive. It contrasts very favourably indeed with the lack of interest which in too many such cases is exhibited by foreign states which find themselves in similar circumstances.&#8221;</p>

As he put it, the GRK submits that disclosure to those of its limbs investigating the crimes that it suspects Mr Y and Ms Z have committed is fully warranted having regard to the factors set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re EC</span>. Further, Mr Gray submits, on any proper application of the &#8216;balancing exercise&#8217; as I described it in the two <span style="font-style:italic">Re X </span>cases &#8211; an approach which, at least in its current form, is a creature of the Convention and thus post-dates the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re EC</span> &#8211; the balance comes down clearly, indeed heavily, in favour of the disclosure being sought.</p>

The problem has been addressed in many international Treaties and Conventions. For present purposes it suffices to refer to the provisions of the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 1990 African Union Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child which I have already set out, though there are many others that bear on the problem.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The problem takes many forms of very varying gravity. At the comparatively benign end of the spectrum there is the parent who removes their own child across an international boundary without the agreement of the child&#8217;s other parent &#8211; the problem of child abduction as it is addressed, for example, in the 1980 Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. At the other, and most vicious, end of the spectrum there are the children and young people trafficked &#8211; bought and sold almost as chattels, tricked, coerced or forced &#8211; across international boundaries by criminals for appalling sexual exploitation in circumstances of depravity and virtual slavery or worse. In between there are many gradations. There are the people-traffickers who assist the young people who &#8211; or whose parents &#8211; are desperate to better themselves by moving to so-called advanced countries even if this means manipulating or evading border controls. There is the kind of problem exemplified (as it happens also in a Kenyan context) by the so-called &#8216;Miracle Baby&#8217; case: see <span style="font-style:italic">Haringey London Borough Council v C, E and another intervening</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2580" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2580 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2580 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 47" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 47</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Haringey London Borough Council v C, E and another intervening</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/1620" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 1620 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 1620 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 1035" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 1035</ref>.

Sadly, as judicial experience in the Family Division sometimes illustrates, the ingenious manage to cloak their criminality in a deceptive veneer of seeming legality and even, on occasions, a cloak of legality made all the more convincing &#8211; for instance in the eyes of border and immigration officials &#8211; because seemingly clothed with the judicial sanction of an order of some foreign family court. I once had to deal with a case where a depraved sexual pervert had bought a baby girl from a prostitute mother in a third world country for use by him in this country as what can only be described as a living &#8211; a human &#8211; sexual toy. But this unspeakably sordid commercial transaction was, with considerable cunning, dressed up with such a convincing veneer of seeming legality (including genuine orders of the foreign court, itself utterly deceived) as to deceive Her Majesty&#8217;s Government into granting the child a British passport in the belief that she was the man&#8217;s daughter, when in fact she was no such thing &#8211; he had simply bought her. This was a particularly revolting and wicked case but analogous methods are often used in less egregious circumstances, for example in the cases of commercially driven international adoption of which every judge of the Family Division is unhappily all too likely to have had experience.</p>

And in addition to the driving imperatives of judicial comity, there is the wider comity between nations &#8211; comity with the judicial and other public authorities of a friendly State &#8211; to which a judge must have appropriate regard. As I observed in my previous judgment, Kenya is a friendly State, a nation with a similar welfare system and similar principles to our own and, indeed, a member of the Commonwealth. So the demands of comity rank high. After all, if the tables were turned, if the boot had been on the other foot, if it was one of our children who had been taken from the United Kingdom to Kenya as X was brought from Kenya to the United Kingdom, would we not be making the same request of the Kenyan judge as the GRK is today making of me? And would we not be disappointed, to put it no higher, if in those circumstances our request was refused?</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Y and Ms Z ask how any of this is going to benefit X. The plain answer is that it is not going to be of any benefit to X but that, with respect, is largely beside the point. Disclosure of the kind being sought here is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>confined to those situations where it is for the benefit of the child who was the subject of the proceedings. That is clear enough from <span style="font-style:italic">Re EC </span>itself. There are many public policy reasons why disclosure may be appropriate, many of which may hardly impact on, let alone benefit, the child whose case has been before the court. And there is no plausible case for suggesting that the disclosure being sought here will in any way be damaging to X. It will not. So, even taking into account that in this case, unlike in some superficially similar cases, there is no suggested benefit to the particular child involved, the balance, as I have said, comes down plainly in favour of disclosure.</p>

I can understand why they say that, but it misunderstands the proper role of the family court in this situation. It is not for me to decide whether there is a case against Mr Y and Ms Z fit to go before a jury, let alone to decide whether or not they should be prosecuted. That is a matter exclusively for the relevant authorities &#8211; the police and the CPS &#8211; to consider. Indeed, it would not be right for me to refuse to direct disclosure otherwise appropriate merely because it seemed to me that there should not be a prosecution &#8211; that is not my function, and were I to arrogate it to myself I would be acting in an entirely inappropriate and, indeed, unprincipled manner. </p>

My task is to decide whether there should be disclosure so that the proper authorities can consider whether or not to prosecute; my task is not to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution. The criminal justice system must take its course. If Mr Y or Ms Z wish to assert that there is no case against them, or that there should in any event be no prosecution &#8211; matters on which, I emphasise, I express no views whatsoever &#8211; then that is something for which they must look to the procedures of the criminal justice system (including those procedures which protect a defendant against an inappropriate, unfair or oppressive prosecution) not to the processes of the family court. </p>

There must, at the very least, be a legitimate need to have access for some proper purpose &#8211; and even that, I should observe, will not necessarily suffice to permit disclosure without prior judicial sanction. And the same, I am inclined to think, must go for any other corporate litigant, including a foreign government. Whether that means that the GRK should first have sought permission in this case is not a topic which it is profitable to consider. It is enough that I make quite clear that the GRK, as I am satisfied, acted at all times responsibly, in good faith and with complete propriety.</p>

The &#8216;lesson&#8217; which perhaps we should all take away from this experience is the need in future such cases for the court to spell out precisely &#8211; as I failed to do here &#8211; the limitations and conditions attached to the use by a corporate litigant of the documents generated in family proceedings to which it is a party. This is perhaps particularly important if the relevant party is a foreign government, which may not be as familiar with the minutiae of English family law as a domestic litigant.</p>

Again, the balance in my judgment comes down plainly in favour of such disclosure. Through Mr Gray the GRK has articulated precisely why it seeks disclosure. Its reasons are compelling and, in my judgment, they fall comfortably within the principles spelt out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re EC</span> and the other case-law. The fact that the disclosure sought is by a foreign government is no reason for refusing to make the order. On the contrary, given the context in which the application is made &#8211; an illicit and, indeed, illegal international adoption &#8211; there is every reason why such disclosure should, in particular, be made to the relevant foreign government. And Kenya, to repeat, is a friendly State, a nation with a similar welfare system and similar principles to our own and, indeed, a member of the Commonwealth. So, as I have said, the demands of comity rank high. And only by international cooperation at all levels &#8211; including international judicial cooperation &#8211; will the evils which too often attend even seemingly benign international adoptions be stamped out.</p>

The order should be expressed to be subject to conditions similar to those which Mr Stonor accepts should be attached to the order in favour of the local authority. The conditions which I have in mind are completely consistent with the stated reasons for which the GRK seeks disclosure and will not in any way fetter its ability to use the disclosed materials for those purposes. On the other hand, such conditions are, as it seems to me, desirable as a matter of principle and will give Mr Y and Mr Z appropriate protection against the kind of media attention which they fear. If it turns out that these conditions are unduly onerous the GRK will be able to apply to this court for their relaxation under the liberty to apply which I propose to include in the order. </p>
