	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question that arises in these Hague proceedings is whether the power, which has been accepted to exist in civil and in financial proceedings, for a court to set aside an order made by equivalent jurisdiction extends to proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention.  Proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention are quintessentially -- this is to state the obvious -- proceedings about children.  They may be sui generis in the field of children law in the sense that they are dealt with summarily and in the sense that the welfare of the child in question is not the paramount consideration, but they are about children none the less and, as the Supreme Court has emphasised in a number of cases, the welfare of the child in those proceedings is a primary consideration, as indeed it must be under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This leads me to consider the case of <span style="font-style:italic">re L and B</span>.  In that case the decision in question recorded findings of fact made in care proceedings concerning two small children.  A fact-finding hearing in proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 38</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> had been held by Judge Penna in Manchester and she had made findings of fact.  The question arose whether, in the light of a change of judicial mind, the judge had power to revisit her factual findings.  The Supreme Court concluded that in circumstances where the order had not been sealed she plainly had.  However, in a section of her judgment commencing at paragraph 32 and headed &#8220;What if the order had been sealed&#8221;, Lady Hale considered at some length whether there was power to discharge or revoke an order containing findings of fact in such proceedings.  In paragraph 37 she said this:  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Both the Civil Procedure Rules and the Family Procedure Rules make it clear that the court's wide case management powers include the power to vary or revoke their previous case management orders: See CPR r 3.1(7) and rule 4.1(6) of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (SI 20 10/2955). This may be done either on application or of the court's own motion: CPR r 3.3(1), rule 4.3(1).  It was the absence of any power in the judge to vary his own (or anyone else's) orders which led to the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic">In re St Nazaire</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="12 Ch D 88" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">12 Ch D 88</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">In re Suffield and Watts</span>, Ex p Brown <ref href="#" uk:canonical="20 QBD 693" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">20 QBD 693</ref>.

It must be exercised &#8220;judicially and not capriciously&#8221;. It must be exercised in accordance with the over-riding objective. In family proceedings, the overriding objective is &#8220;enabling the court to deal with cases justly, having regard to any welfare issues involved&#8221;: Rule 1.1(1) of the Family Procedure Rules. It would, for the reasons indicated earlier, be inconsistent with that objective if the court could not revisit factual findings in the light of later developments. The facts of in <span style="font-style:italic">In</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">re M and MC</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 461" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 461</ref> are a good example. At the fact finding hearing, the judge had found that Mr C, and not the mother, had inflicted the child's injuries. But after that, the mother told a social worker, whether accurately or otherwise, that she had inflicted some of them. The Court of Appeal ruled that, at the next hearing, the judge should subject the mother's apparent confession to rigorous scrutiny but that, if he concluded that it was true, he should alter his findings.</p>
