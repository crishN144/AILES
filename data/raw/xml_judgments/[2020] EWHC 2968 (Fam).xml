Paragraph 3 of the order requires the mother to make the children available to the father for the holiday and a penal (rather than the usual warning) notice against the Appellant is attached.   In the terminology of orders relating to children it is an order permitting the temporary removal of the children from the jurisdiction. Such orders may take effect as a specific issue orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> or under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/13/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(1)</ref>(b) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.   </p>

He supplemented his criticism of the late service of the order, submitting that the mother was in breach of the August 2018 order and should be disbarred from pursuing an appeal and noted that the matter did not warrant being before a High Court Judge. I&#8217;m quite satisfied that the father has had an adequate opportunity to respond to the appeal; his written response is detailed and lengthy. I&#8217;m also quite satisfied that the mother is entitled to bring this appeal; not only is it unclear what order remains in force determining the child arrangements but in any event no order has been made determining that the mother is in contempt of court and should be debarred from making any applications. She is therefore entitled to appeal. An appeal from a Circuit Judge in the Family Court applies to a High Court Judge. The appeal is therefore been dealt with at the proper tier.  </p>

This order is not in the bundle but is attached to the Respondent&#8217;s skeleton argument. It ordered limited mid-week spending time and fortnightly Sunday contact. Starting with one overnight in March 2019 and two overnights from March 2020. Holidays were to be dealt with by agreement between the parties but by Summer 2020 the order recited that it was intended that the children should be spending 50% of the holidays with the father. Rather unusually the girls were to have contact separately [E17 para 6]. The mother applied for a variation in 2019. On an interim basis on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2020 the CAO was varied pending an urgent section 7 report and the commencement of staying contact was suspended.

The Judge rejects the Respondent&#8217;s request for a trip to Ukraine because &#8220;I do not think you are going to get the children to the airport at the moment&#8230;. She is not going to because she actually cannot forget about 8 March and she is so upset the police are not prosecuting and therefore all the other things you [the Respondent] have done&#8221; [C14 line 2]. It is clear that the position at that time was that the children were highly resistant to spending time with the father. The Judge declined to order any holiday with the father whether in the Ukraine or Italy. The order which emerged from that hearing is not in the bundle, but it appears that apart from discharging local authority involvement the arrangements for the children to spend time with the father were left to the parents. The transcript of the hearing makes clear that the mother is supportive of undertaking work whilst the father is highly sceptical of the mother&#8217;s motivation or the likely assistance that would be gained. The absence of an order is unfortunate for it led to uncertainty later, persisting to this day as to whether the August 2018 order had been varied or reinstated.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.08in">It appears that there was little direct contact thereafter [C37]. The matter came before Recorder Cooper on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019 because HHJ Hughes QC was not available. The father sought the resumption of the arrangements set out in the order of August 2018 including overnight staying contact whilst the mother agreed visiting contact. Recorder Cooper provided for weekly visiting contact in the community [C38] and a further hearing was listed for 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019. The matter came before District Judge Duddridge on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019 [C44]. This recorded that the child arrangements order of 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2018 had broken down and that the children were unwilling to meet the father. The mother&#8217;s case was that this was because of the father&#8217;s past behaviour whilst the father said it was because of the mother&#8217;s hostility towards him and his family generated by parental alienation by the mother. The District Judge recorded that the evidence showed the children&#8217;s unwillingness to spend time with the father including D running away and showing signs of severe stress when visiting the father. The order also recorded that the parties had not returned to the Tavistock to enquire about family therapy; the father&#8217;s position is that they had seen a doctor at the Tavistock in 2018 without success and that further therapy would not work. The order made was; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.08in">It is clear from the papers that the parties did not attend further therapy at the Tavistock (it is unclear if any was undertaken) and the main reason appears to be the resistance of the Respondent [C43]. It is also clear from the papers that the relationship between the mother and father is highly conflicted and there are allegations recorded in the papers both of domestic abuse, referrals to the police and of the father handling the children roughly (at a minimum) or being physically abusive (at a maximum). During a s47 report D alleged that the Respondent had forcibly pushed her into a car and hit her with his fist [E6] and hung her upside down [E10]. She attended A&amp;E on one occasion. The Respondent gives a description of the children refusing to see him in a chronology consistent with the date of the allegation of hitting [E10].  D is said to be clear and consistent in her account although the observed injuries were not consistent [E10].  The Respondent has admitted to pushing the children&#8217;s faces into their food but explained it as a joke [E7]. The s47 report in the bundle references other C&amp;F assessments where it is said the Respondent admitted to inappropriate chastisement [E9]. The Respondent did admit to punching the MGM in the stomach but says this was because she attempted to push him into moving traffic [E10]. The Respondent accepts throwing the salt but says he aimed it past the Appellant rather than had at her [E11].  On 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2019 the police were called by a member of the public who reported seeing the Respondent pick up D by her backpack, turn her upside down and suspend her in the air and seeing the Respondent pulling both children aggressive down the road [E19].  </p>

Nor does it appear that the order of August 2018 arose from a judgment which made any findings in relation to parental alienation or domestic abuse. The papers do not suggest that there has ever been a fact-finding hearing.  The Appellant mother says she supportive of there being direct contact. The respondent father maintains that the mother is undermining his relationship with the children and alienating them from him. It appears agreed between the parties that the children become very distressed during direct contact, particularly D.  </p>

At that time only visiting contact was taking place. No application was before the court for an order of providing for the temporary removal of the children from the jurisdiction and no evidence had been filed in relation to that or any report from Cafcass filed. Whilst that issue had been canvassed before HH J Hughes QC the year before at no point was the issue ever identified as being listed for determination on 10 March or indeed even identified as an ongoing issue. The impression given by the orders in 2019 was that contact had become stuck and that a means needed to be identified to make progress. </p>

The mother supported the appointment of the Guardian, the continuation of visiting contact for S and the identification of some way to deal with D<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0078D4"/>and her contact. The father&#8217;s position was to return to the structure of the August 2018 order although as he was no longer living in the U.K. his actual proposal was to have Skype contact four times a week and the children spend the entire summer holidays with him in the Ukraine and thereafter half of the school holidays. For reasons which are not entirely clear to me the Cafcass officer did not recommend the appointment of a 16.4 Guardian and did not consider there was any work Cafcass could do to try to rebuild the relationship; no mention is made of child contact interventions. The Cafcass Officer and Camden Social Workers were sworn and give evidence. During one Social Worker&#8217;s evidence the Judge asks whether we go from here? In answer to that the social worker says that one thing which has not been tried is the fact of allowing the children to go to the Ukraine to spend time with the grandparents against whom no complaint was made. Somewhat surprisingly the social worker said that if it didn&#8217;t work and if it gets very traumatic, they could always come back. [B27/31]. In response to this development the mother said that she might be able to discuss it with S but with D she would be very worried. The mothers concerns of whether the children would be returned were answered by the social worker saying that she was sure the paternal grandmother would not tolerate the children being abused or harmed and that the court had to have faith in her. In the course of the hearing the judge says the only way to find out what would happen would be to send them and see how they got on. </p>

The mothers concerns whether the children would be returned, their well-being in the paternal grandparents household (the mother maintains that the paternal grandmother is not considered an equal) , their wishes and whether this was a fair process are all overridden in a momentum that built in favour of this solution to breaking the apparent log-jam. The mother suggested that the grandparents come to London to see the children for a week and if that went well that the children might then go to the Ukraine. The judge dismisses this on the basis that the mother would then raise an objection. The judge says that a decision will be made today and focuses on the unlikelihood of the possibility of the grandmother physically harming the children. She dismisses the possibility of emotional harm in inferring that there is no reason why the grandparents would do something which would emotionally harm the children. She does not consider the issue of the children having to do something so dramatically different from what they are used to, their unfamiliarity with the grandparents, their separation from the mother or the anxiety relating to that or the possibility of the children not being returned. </p>

I have also considered it would be in their best interests of the grandmother could come for a period of time in May or June to London and spend time with them; that would be in their best interests as well.&#8221; However, she also concludes that if the grandmother doesn&#8217;t come the mother was still to send them to Ukraine. It emerges quite late on that the father might be living with the paternal grandparents and that it would be left to the paternal grandparents to decide how much time the children spent with the father whilst they were there. </p>

In relation to Hague Child Abduction Convention countries there will always be a remedy of summary return pursuant to article 12 of the Convention. Those countries who are also signatories to the 1996 Hague Child Protection  Convention might also provide further safeguards through the advance registration of an order or at worst the ability to apply to enforce an order. Thus in relation to Hague Convention countries the safeguards aspect of the three points is often easily answered and indeed the magnitude of the risk and the magnitude of the consequences may be substantially reduced as a result of the presence in the landscape of those remedies. However, that does not absolve the court of the responsibility to consider the evidence of whether there is a risk of nonreturn and the consequences of nonreturn alongside the security. </p>

Inevitably a litigant in person will be unfamiliar with the precise nature of an appeal but it would have assisted had the father sought in reply to the mother&#8217;s grounds of appeal. I do not think this was any product of late service but rather the father is preoccupied with his dissatisfaction with the current state of play.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.08in">The hearing was listed to consider whether a guardian should be appointed, the question of a holiday to the paternal grandparents in the Ukraine arose out of the social workers evidence. Whilst it had been raised a year before by the father, contact had deteriorated over that period and thus one would have assumed that the prospect of contact in the Ukraine whether with the paternal grandparents or the father or both was even less of an issue in March 2020. It was certainly not something that either the father or the mother had prepared for. They had to respond on the hoof to the suggestion made by the social worker and taken up by the judge. In the usual course of such applications not only would the nature and extent of the trip be articulated in an application, that evidence would be filed by the father in support and the mother would have responded. In a case such as this given the ages of the children and the background it is likely that a Cafcass report would have been ordered. None of this took place. The mother had no notice and had to respond in court in the suggestion. There was thus no evidence before the court as to where the holiday would occur and the circumstances. There was no evidence before the court is to safeguard to ensure that the children were returned or that would have enabled the court to consider the risk of them not being returned. During the appeal hearing the father seemed to say that the holiday would not have taken place in Lvov but rather the grandparents would have taken the children away to the Carpathian Mountains. It also emerged that the father was living with the grandparents and so the holiday would in fact be not with the paternal grandparents but rather with the father and the paternal grandparents; unless the paternal grandparents took them elsewhere. No consideration was given as to whether an order might be registered with the local court to ensure that if the children were not returned it could be enforced under the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention. Whilst the mother was able to deploy a number of points in argument, she clearly did not have an opportunity to put together a coherent case in relation to the issue.  </p>

The nature of the hearing was plainly not an appropriate forum to determine such issues but given the difficulties which have dogged the development of the children&#8217;s relationship with the father since the parties separated it seems probable that some baseline needs to be established against which the court can judge the children&#8217;s welfare. I do not consider that this ground adds anything to the other grounds. </p>

It is true that no express reference is made to this and nothing can be implied either. There is no specific evidence about a special risk of non-return in this case. However, these are highly acrimonious proceedings (the financial proceedings are described also as very acrimonious though I do not know their current status). Further, the Respondent has relocated to Ukraine for the foreseeable future. The Respondent has also made reference to a desire to have custody of the children albeit on a 50:50 basis; this is significantly different from what has ever been envisioned previously. It is plain that the issue of risk needed to be very carefully considered. The possibility of the father having become frustrated by the deteriorating contact in England combined with his relocation to the Ukraine would provide sufficient foundation for a careful evaluation of the issue of whether a risk existed of the children not being returned and if so it&#8217;s magnitude. </p>

Whilst that conclusion might be found to be correct it can only properly be reached after an evaluation of the evidence relating to it. Given there was no evidence from the mother or father as to their then situations it was incapable of proper adjudication. The decision was therefore wrong in that it failed to properly address this issue.</p>

It appears likely that much of this would be capable of evidencing and if this were the only ground, I&#8217;m not sure that the appeal would have succeeded. The UK government does currently advice against travel to southern parts of Ukraine due to the political instability and there are areas without consular support (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0563C1">https://www.gov.uk/foreign</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine"/><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0563C1">travel</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0563C1">-</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0563C1">advice/ukraine</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine">)</a>.

In the context of this case and its background the children&#8217;s wishes and the impact on them of making such an order was also very important. There is no consideration in the judgment of the likely effect upon the children were they not to be returned because the judge assumed that they would be. There appears to be an assumption that the children&#8217;s views should not be obtained on this issue because they had had much involvement with social services or Cafcass before. Indeed, both the Cafcass officer and the social worker appeared to consider that there was further that could be done with the children although the Cafcass officer did meet the possibility of a family assistance order.  </p>

In particular there was evidence before the court that D was in a highly conflicted position and found contact very distressing. The idea of travelling to the Ukraine to have contact with her father and her grandparents was, one would have thought, likely to be very difficult for her. These concerns were brushed aside on the basis that if she were distressed, she could be returned or that it would only be for a short period.  </p>

She does not apply the welfare checklist or give any explanation of her conclusions on the three principal issues of magnitude of risk, magnitude of harm or safeguards. She also finds that it would be in the children&#8217;s best interests for the PGM to come to London beforehand if she &#8220;could&#8221; come [B49 line 30]. This reads as quite confusing. Either it is in their best interests and should happen or it is unnecessary. It is unclear why their best interests are determined by reference to the PGM&#8217;s availability.  </p>

Should I kill myself?&#8221; [B30 line 4]. The social worker opines that this is something D says to evoke anxiety in the Appellant [B31 line 4]. It then transpires that it has also been said to the senior practitioner [B31 line 7]. It is evident that the social worker has had a strained engagement with D [B33 line 6; B32 line 30]. It is perhaps regrettable that such a stark comment from a child had not been previously shared with the parents and the court especially in the context of the Appellant reporting that D is very resistant of her own volition to seeing the Respondent and the submission that D is being pushed too far. It really goes to the crux of the issue: whether the children are being alienated or whether they have justified reasons for their resistance.  This is perhaps simply illustrative of the failure to get to grips with the underlying issues relating to the children&#8217;s difficulties with seeing their father. On its own I do not consider this ground would demonstrate that the decision was wrong but it does lend further support to the mother&#8217;s case that inadequate attention was paid to the welfare checklist and in particular how the proposed order would impact on the children. </p>

The general tenor of his case is that the difficulty with the relationship is that the mother is undermining it and that only by insisting that the children spend time with him, whilst they should realise that they have nothing to fear from him. None of this goes to the heart of this appeal which is whether the process that was adopted was a fair one and whether the court had the material available to it to reach an appropriate decision on the evidence. Whilst there may have been much evidence before the court in August 2018, by the time this decision was made in March 2020 the children were both older and the situation on the ground had changed. The father&#8217;s opening position during the appeal was that the August 2018 order remained in force and should be upheld. When I pointed out that this was not possible given, he was now living in the Ukraine he seemed somewhat at a loss albeit seemed then to accept that some further order was necessary. </p>
