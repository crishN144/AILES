Thereafter, the Mother went to stay at Father B&#8217;s shared home.  She was there for about a month before returning to her home.

He held a corkscrew against the Mother&#8217;s throat and threatened to cut her up.  He threatened to kill her.  He pinned her on the sofa by her throat and then placed a pair of scissors to her throat.  He grabbed her hair violently and there was an unpleasant struggle.  The Mother did not report this to the authorities but used it as a weapon against Father B to control his worst excesses.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In February 2015, the Police informed the Local Authority that Child A might have been the victim of sexual abuse.  It later transpired that the alleged perpetrator was Aaron Hughes.  He is a predatory paedophile who was found guilty of serious sexual offences against children in both 2000 (when he was sentenced to five years in prison) and 2014 when he was given a life sentence with a minimum term of twelve years.  He had written a book in prison called &#8220;Monsters Do Exist&#8221; in which he alleged that he had sexually abused Child A.  The allegations were that he had drugged and raped Child A with the consent and knowledge of the Mother and Father B.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Nothing that I say in this judgment as to the book is intended to influence the Police in their continuing investigations as to the activities of Mr Hughes.  It is Mr Hughes&#8217; position that the book is entirely fabricated.  It does appear that there is, at the very least, a significant element of extremely dark and unpleasant fantasy in the book.  The Local Authority does not seek to prove that the central allegation that Mr Hughes sexually abused Child A is true.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The law in this regard is clear.  I make it absolutely plain that I proceed on the basis that Child A was not drugged and abused by Mr Hughes.  It follows that the Mother and Father B could not have consented or known about such abuse.  Nevertheless, there had to be a thorough investigation by both the Police and the Local Authority.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Arrangements were made for the children to be looked after at home overnight by the Maternal Grandmother, MQ with the Mother leaving.  The following day, the Mother very sensibly and to her credit agreed that the children should be accommodated voluntarily pursuant to section 20 of the 1989 Act.  They were placed with foster carers.  As already noted, Child A was placed separately from Child B and Child C but in the same street.  Supervised contact took place, initially three times per week for one and a half hours per session.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Later in February 2015, the Local Authority applied for care orders.  A significant number of serious allegations were raised against the Mother. They are mostly in dispute and I will have to make findings but they included that she has repeatedly engaged in violent relationships.  It is said that this is explained by the fact that her father was a violent alcoholic.  She missed substantial amounts of schooling as a child and self-harmed at the age of 18. She has suffered from depression over a long period.  It was alleged that she has neglected the children&#8217;s needs such that they regularly presented as dirty and unkempt.  She has had disputes with her neighbours.  She was 12 weeks&#8217; pregnant but had not identified the father but said she had been raped. It was noted that she had previously alleged rape against a partner but had withdrawn the allegation and subsequently been cautioned for perverting the course of justice/wasting police time. </p>

A recital to the court order notes that the Mother said she did not know anyone serving a sentence of imprisonment.  In early March 2015, the same judge re-allocated the case to a Family Division Judge.  Directions were made in relation to various PII issues arising out of the Police investigation and a fear that disclosure might well prejudice ongoing criminal investigations.  </p>

She did not know he was on the Sex Offenders&#8217; Register.  She confirmed that both herself and Child A did have contact to Mr Hughes as he used to live next door to Father B.  On one occasion, at Child A&#8217;s request, Child A had a &#8220;sleepover&#8221; at Mr Hughes&#8217; home.  She understood that Mr Hughes&#8217; partner, IN was also in the house.  By then, a transcript of a telephone conversation between her and Mr Hughes when he was in prison had been disclosed.  She made the point that the conversation showed her asking Mr Hughes if he had abused Child A, which, she said, showed that she did not know about any abuse.

He took a firm view of the allegations in &#8220;Monsters Do Exist&#8221;.   He said in his judgment on costs that he considered the Local Authority had evidential difficulties if they were to pursue findings that Mr Hughes had abused Child A.  He noted that Child A had made no complaint of abuse.  There were no physical signs of sexual abuse when he was medically examined.  He considered there was inherent incredibility/obvious fantasy in some of the matters described within &#8220;Monsters Do Exist&#8221;.  He reminded the Local Authority that it would have general credibility difficulties in trying to rely on Mr Hughes.  He noted the telephone call from the Mother to Mr Hughes in prison which strongly suggested she had no knowledge of any abuse.  He concluded that the Local Authority would not be able to prove abuse by Mr Hughes and should, therefore, concentrate on failure to protect.  The Local Authority accepted this strong indication and agreed to amend its threshold criteria.</p>

It is, of course, absolutely no defence to a witness summons simply to say that you will not cooperate although it does make it more difficult for the court when the person concerned is already serving a life sentence and therefore not really susceptible to committal proceedings.  I would, however, still have proceeded to hear from Mr Hughes if I thought it possible that his evidence would assist me in deciding the factual disputes in this case.

To establish the threshold criteria, I need to be satisfied that each child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm and that the harm or likelihood of harm is attributable to the care given to the child, or likely to be given if the order is not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give [<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref>].

On occasions, the Mother asked to borrow small amounts of money from Ms OU and, once, Ms OU went round to her home.  She was not impressed with what she saw and said to me that it was not how she would choose to live.  When the Mother&#8217;s home flooded, she offered to take the children but, for understandable reasons, was not prepared to have the Mother and Father B in her home.  All memory is fallible but subject to issues of inaccurate recollection, I accept her evidence as being truthful and designed to help me.  She gave evidence of sightings of Mr Hughes with the children in the summer of 2012.  I find that these sightings are accurate.  One of them may well have been whilst the Mother was in hospital looking after Child C.  Some of the detail may be wrong due to the time that has passed but I accept the broad thrust of the evidence.  I am also satisfied that, when the Mother was staying with the children and Father B whilst her home was flooded, the Mother did say that there was a paedophile in the house next door.  Although Ms OU&#8217;s recollection is now hazy, she went to the school immediately to report this and I am quite satisfied it is what the Mother said.  I am not, however, satisfied that this was a reference by the Mother to Mr Hughes, who was not then living next door to Father B.  I will obviously return to my detailed findings in due course.  Finally, the Mother did say something to Ms OU about being asked to look after drugs for Father B which were kept in the airing cupboard at her home.  Ms OU referred to heroin.  I am not asked to make a finding of fact in this regard as there is no other corroborating evidence of such behaviour by the Mother and Father B.  I do not therefore do so.  </p>

Her state of knowledge may, however, be relevant to the Mother&#8217;s state of knowledge.  It was immediately clear that Ms ME&#8217;s, as she presented in court, was not someone who should be looking after young children.  Both the Mother and Father B, however, said that her presentation had deteriorated significantly since the Mother asked her to look after the children in 2012 when the Mother was in hospital with Child C.  I am inclined to accept this and therefore do so, although I doubt she was ever other than towards the opposite spectrum from Ms OU when it comes to child-caring skills.  I do not know the extent to which her current presentation is caused by the medication she is taking.  She told me that it was and that she can be confused about things and forget things as a result. She has clearly been very close to Mr Hughes, being inaccurately described by Hughes himself as his sister.  </p>

Her recollection of many incidents was either non-existent or very poor.  I cannot rely on her evidence.

She gave evidence, however, of sightings of Mr Hughes both at the Mother&#8217;s home and in the hospital when Child C was taken there at the same time as her daughter.  Despite some minor inconsistencies, I accept the broad thrust of her evidence, namely that Mr Hughes, wearing high heels, was seen by her both at the Mother&#8217;s home and the hospital in 2012.  </p>

She had kept her relationship with him hidden from the Local Authority for months and months.  Yet, in December 2014, she became pregnant by him.  On 19th December 2014, the then Social Worker, MI spoke to her about reports that she was in a relationship with Father B.  She said she was definitely not in a relationship with him.  She had been in a relationship with him many years ago but he was very violent. She said that she was shaking just talking about him.  She accepts that it was an outright lie that she was not in a relationship with him.  On 9th January 2015, Child A said, at school, that the Mother was pregnant.  Ms MI telephoned the Mother who said she was &#8220;definitely not pregnant and there is no chance I could be&#8221;.  I am satisfied this was a lie. By then, she knew full well she was pregnant.  Yet she told me in court that she really believed she was not pregnant and put Child A&#8217;s belief down to her having gastroenteritis.  On 16th January 2015, the Head Teacher told Ms MI that the Mother was telling other people at the school that she was pregnant.  Again, the Mother denied this to Ms MI saying she was &#8220;100% not pregnant and there is no way I could be.&#8221;  This was clearly a lie yet in evidence to me she denied telling people she was pregnant and said that, at this time, she really believed she was not pregnant.

It was put to her by me that she must have remembered at some point prior to the call to Hughes. She denied that and said she only remembered it when on the telephone to Hughes.  I cannot and do not accept that.  It is completely inconsistent with &#8220;ever since I found out&#8221;.  She described that as a &#8220;figure of speech&#8221; whatever that may mean.

In fact, she went to Father B&#8217;s home, although even then she claimed at one point to be sleeping rough in a field and/or in a refuge.

The recorded incident in December 2012 is but one of many such incidents.   I make it clear that I exclude Father A from my remarks in this regard and I have not heard any allegations against Father C.  I have heard from Father B and will, in due course, make findings in relation to him.  I have not heard from Mr EN so merely note that, at times, the Mother accuses Mr EN of being worse than Father B, particularly in her Facebook messages to Father C.  </p>

Although I remind myself that I was dealing with fact finding not welfare, I have to say that he impressed me as a witness.  I accept his evidence.  It is right that he has taken illegal drugs, namely cannabis and cocaine.  His use appears to have been moderate to low and historical.  Moreover, I am quite satisfied that he has not abused drugs whilst caring for Child A and would not do so.  He is susceptible to criticism for periods when he has not played a prominent part in Child A&#8217;s life. He accepted this to me and I gained the clear impression he was embarrassed and felt that he had let Child A down.  </p>

The Mother told him that there was no instance when Hughes could have had the opportunity.  This was, of course, incorrect.  Moreover, I find that the Mother knew that at the time and was, yet again, attempting to cover herself with further lies.  </p>

He told me that he was &#8220;deeply ashamed&#8221; of what happened in the video on 18th December 2012.  He told me he was &#8220;out of order&#8221; and he &#8220;deserved&#8221; to be in prison.  I do not find that he was nearly so deeply ashamed prior to the Police finding the video. I remind myself that he had been arrested in 2009 for a similar incident of domestic violence against the Mother and bailed.  That did not seem to have changed his behaviour at all.  He told me he was under the influence of alcohol alone on the evening of 18th December.  Having seen his demeanour in the video, I do not accept that.  I find that he had taken illegal drugs as well.  I will come to my specific findings in due course but it was noteworthy that Child B was present virtually throughout the incident.  The assault on the Mother was unforgivable but so was doing it in the presence of a very young child.  </p>

It was merely the one which was recorded.  I am quite satisfied that he has been physically violent to her on many occasions.  He told me that all he would do was &#8220;push her out the way; drag her down to the floor; and grip her by the top&#8221;.  He implied this was her fault as she would not &#8220;get out of the way&#8221;.  He specifically said that he was only half to blame for the violence, implying that the Mother was equally to blame.  I reject this evidence in its entirety.  I do not accept that his conduct was limited to this.  I find that he has hit her repeatedly.  I reject that the Mother is to blame.  He is entirely to blame.  I am prepared to accept that he has not used weapons on the Mother other than when he once hit her with a baby&#8217;s bottle.  He denies this.  I reject his denial.  Whilst I accept that a baby&#8217;s bottle could do damage to an adult, I also accept that it is by no means the worst weapon that he could have used.  Nevertheless, he has threatened her with weapons.  I find that this included threats with knives, even though he denies this.  I also accept that other serious incidents have been in the presence and/or hearing of the children, which will undoubtedly have caused them significant harm. </p>

She told him that they would have to say it was Mr KX&#8217;s due to her not being allowed to have contact to Father B.  Foolishly, he went along with this but his Facebook page told the truth, although the Mother may have been in part responsible for this.  I accept he was present at Child B&#8217;s birth.  Turning to Child C, I am satisfied that he did, wrongly, think he was the father although he had his doubts.  He questioned her about both Father A and Father C.  She told him that Father C had raped her and said that he must have given her a drug.  This has echoes of her story as to the alleged rape in November 2014.  </p>

They are very much attracted to each other both physically and emotionally despite their respective flaws.  I reject the suggestion that Father B cannot have been seriously violent to her because she has put up him for so long.  That would be to ignore the clear evidence of dependency that exists in many abusive relationships.  I will have to make findings when I come to deal with threshold as to the current status of the relationship.    All I will say at this moment is that I do not accept that Father B is a reformed man simply because of his prison sentence.  I find that he remains a danger to women and, particularly, the Mother and that this danger is magnified considerably when he uses alcohol and drugs.  </p>

My understanding of this is, in essence, that they have a physical but not an emotional relationship.  The Mother&#8217;s case is that, although Father C is the father of Child C, she was not aware that she had had sexual intercourse with him at the relevant time.  She has therefore come to the conclusion that he had sexual intercourse with her whilst she was asleep.  She says that he confirmed this to her in a Facebook post but she deleted it although, she says, it is possible that the Police will be able to retrieve it.  A request was made to the Police during the hearing but nothing has been heard as yet.</p>

If the findings that I make later turn out to be wrong, it could well be said that the Mother will only have herself to blame given the number of lies she has told over the years.  Moreover, it seems to me to be rather too convenient that the Facebook message has been deleted.  At one point, the Mother definitely told me that Father C made the admission in the October/December 2014 exchanges between them but I am satisfied that we have a full run of those exchanges from Father C and that such a message is not there.  I reject any suggestion he has deleted just that message.  When the Mother realised this, she changed her story and said the message was sent earlier but I reject that as well.  </p>

It is inherently implausible.  She accepts they had had sexual intercourse before this conception and had done so for a number of years.  Moreover, they have had sexual intercourse since.  Why would she do that if Father C had behaved so badly to her?  Indeed, in her Facebook messages to him, the Mother says that he is &#8220;the only bloke I ever felt safe around and trusted with my life&#8221;.  There is absolutely no evidence that he would drug her.  He would not need to do so as it seems tolerably clear that all he would have to do was ask and she would be quite happy to oblige.  I find that she invented this story initially to Father B to explain why he might not be the father of Child C.</p>

They had a water fight in front of the washing machine.  I am slightly surprised that the water fight did not lead to sexual intercourse itself but they both accept that it did not.  I accept Father C&#8217;s account that they fell asleep together on the sofa in nothing but towels.  He was then woken up by the Mother playing with his penis.  The Mother does not seem to deny that either, merely saying that she must have done so whilst asleep.  I consider that inherently implausible.  They then had sexual intercourse and Child C was conceived.  I suppose it is just possible that the Mother might sleep through sexual intercourse if she had been smoking cannabis or was very drunk but neither said that she was in such a state.  I reject as absurd the suggestion that she has been known to remove her pyjamas in her sleep without realising.  I find she was wearing a towel as Father C says.</p>

I am quite satisfied that Father C believed she was consenting to sexual intercourse.  I am equally satisfied that the Mother was not asleep, although she might have been sleepy.  It is just possible that she might have forgotten later although it seems pretty implausible.  Given the Mother&#8217;s repeated lies and her motive for coming up with such a story to stop Father B assaulting her, I reject her case.  On balance, I consider the Facebook messages support Father C&#8217;s account not hers.  When she accused him of rape, he reacted furiously.  When she set out her case, she said &#8220;I started to touch you&#8221; which is what he says.  Moreover, she got pregnant again by Father C in the autumn of 2014 but, unfortunately, suffered a miscarriage.  On 18th October 2014, she wrote to him &#8220;It&#8217;s always the same with us; sleep with each other; create a life (and) neva see each other.  I can&#8217;t keep doing that&#8221;.  This was before the DNA tests had been done, although the Mother lied shortly thereafter by telling Father C that she had already done the tests (presumably with Father B) and could prove Father C wasn&#8217;t the father.  Yet despite no DNA tests, she seemed pretty sure Father C was the father, writing on 18th October &#8220;he (Father B) knows Child C&#8217;s urs&#8221;.  It follows that I find that the sexual intercourse was consensual.  </p>

But, if she really did not know he had a criminal record, she should have made sure he did not.  If she did know, she should have ensured she knew what he had done.  It is now clear that Mr Hughes had been &#8220;grooming&#8221; Child A by making gifts to him, such as toy cars.  I find that he also allowed him to use his play station.  It appears he gave more presents to Child A than the other children.  Sleepovers with school friends and their parents are one thing, even if unusual at the age of four.  Sleepovers with strange men are entirely different.  It was unreasonable to allow it in any event.  It was reckless given what she ought to have discovered.  It was extremely dangerous given what we now know.  I am, however, prepared to accept that there was only one such occasion.  I recognise that Child A says he was scared of Mr Hughes in his Police interview.  I take the view that I should place very limited reliance on that.

Unlike Father A, the Mother does not have the defence that she only took cannabis when the children were not with her.  Even if they were asleep, this could have impaired her ability to look after them if there was a crisis during the night.  I do accept that, of itself, this would not be sufficient to take children away from a parent but it is part of the picture and the allegation is made out.</p>

It is accepted by the Mother but it is right that I should set out the full extent of what occurred.  I consider it to be a bad and very distressing assault.  Father B accused the Mother of sleeping with other men.  He placed a corkscrew against her throat.  He threatened to cut her up.  He threatened to kill her.  He pinned her down to a sofa by her throat.  He placed a pair of scissors to her throat.  Her gripped her hair violently and threw her to the floor.  I do accept that the Mother had set up the camera in advance but I do not accept that this is relevant.  </p>

I am unable to make a finding as to whether she made sexual noises over the phone to make him think she was with another man.  If she did so, this was incredibly dangerous, particularly as she had been assaulted by him on many previous occasions and could not say for sure how far he would go.  When he arrived, she realised he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol.  She knew what to expect and she was right.  It was fortunate that she had the sense to record it so that justice could be done. I was troubled by her mouthing to the camera &#8220;help me&#8221; but, on balance, I accept her account and therefore reject the submission that she set this up in a way that was reckless and very dangerous.  </p>

It is true that she allowed him in.  I accept Mr Furness&#8217; submission that she did not really have any choice as I am sure he would have forced his way in even if she had tried to prevent him.  This does not excuse the Mother however.  She continued a relationship with him even though she knew what he was like.  She lied to the Local Authority about it.  On this evening, she had invited him round.  When he arrived and she realised the state he was in, she did not call 999.  Apart from early in the relationship in 2009, she never called the Police.  I accept the allegation that she placed the children at risk of significant harm as a result and she is culpable given her agreement not to allow him in and her lies to the Local Authority.  Indeed, in June 2015, after meeting with her solicitors, she telephoned Father B and met him in Sophia Gardens.  Whilst I appreciate the children were not there, this meeting shows the difficulty she has in separating from him.  I do consider that she has unresolved feelings for him.  Her case is that he is not all bad and has shown her tenderness and love at times.  Whilst no doubt true, it does not lead me to be sure that the relationship is over for ever.  Only time will tell and that is very difficult when children need to be protected.</p>

This is admitted. She was cautioned by the Police for this.  I am not asked to find that Father B raped her and I do not do so.  I remind myself that the Mother admits a false rape allegation in relation to the pregnancy with Child D and I have found her account of the conception of Child C to be wrong.  Moreover, I could not possibly make such a serious finding without hearing from Father B&#8217;s friend, Mr KB who accompanied Father B to the Mother&#8217;s property on the afternoon in question.  There is no doubt that the Mother was found by the Police in a distressed state.  There is also no doubt that Father B was on Police bail at the time with a condition not to contact the Mother.  The Police requested the Mother&#8217;s telephone records, at which point she retracted her complaint.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that she telephoned Father B and invited him to the property.  He went in breach of his bail conditions.  Regardless of what happened at the property once he arrived, this incident does no credit to either of them.  She should not have invited him and he should not have gone.  Moreover, either the Mother&#8217;s rape allegation was false or her retraction was false.  I cannot see, however, that any of this bears on the threshold findings given what I have already found about the Mother&#8217;s relationship with Father B.</p>

I accept that, on 11th February 2015, the Mother remained in fear of Father B whom she believed would be violent to her.  I do not believe she ever thought he would kill her, despite his occasional threats to do so.  He would continue to call at her property and she would let him in rather than face the consequences of refusing him entry.  The Mother&#8217;s response to threshold is to place all the blame on Father B but I consider them both to be culpable in different ways.  For example, the Mother says that he would simply turn up and demand entry, including kicking the door to gain entry.  She says the last occasion was December 2014.  This implies that she was completely against his being there but that is quite untrue.  I am satisfied that, on occasions, she contacted him and invited him over.  She was rightly against his violence, but not always against his presence.  After all, in December 2014, they had sexual intercourse and she became pregnant with Child D, only two months after she had become pregnant with Father C.  Quite why she did not take precautions against pregnancy, I do not know.  In any event, she cannot place all the blame on Father B.</p>

It is only necessary to watch Child B&#8217;s reaction in the video to see the harm done to her by the violence between the adults.  Moreover, the Mother has consistently failed to protect the children from the consequences of the domestic violence within her relationship with Father B.  I do not accept blackmailing him with the video to be a reasonable response.  I will leave to the welfare stage the issue of whether or not she has gained insight since the institution of these proceedings and the prosecution of Father B. </p>

They include neglect of the children&#8217;s dental health, their diet, clothing, toileting, eating, personal hygiene, home conditions, stimulation, socialisation and financial management.  Although there seems to be force in the dental health neglect allegation, overall these contentions cannot stand.  In fairness, the Local Authority did not press them to cross-examination.  In the light of the improvement in the home conditions that led to the children being removed from the Child Protection Register in October 2014, it is impossible to find these allegations proved in February 2015.  The matter falls squarely within Hedley J&#8217;s definition of what society must accept in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re L</span>.

I am certainly unable to find at present that the relationship is definitely over.  Father B still has strong feelings for the Mother.  The Mother denies that she has strong feelings for him, although she says that he is not all bad.  I have found that the children have been at risk of significant harm from Father B&#8217;s violence to the Mother.  Whilst the Mother denies that he is any part of her life anymore, she was saying that on 11th February as well.  The Local Authority simply does not know whether this is the case or not.  Short of placing a twenty four hour watch on the Mother&#8217;s home, there is little it can do to protect the children.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Of course, the Mother may be able to prove at the welfare stage of the case that she has indeed changed and learned from her past mistakes.  But, as at the 11th February, that was not the case.  The lies were an integral part of the problem.  Indeed, it is in effect accepted that, if the Local Authority had known the true position in October 2014, they would not have agreed to remove the children from the Child Protection Register.  </p>
