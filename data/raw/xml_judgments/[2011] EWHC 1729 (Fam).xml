He was born in January 2000 and is therefore now 11 years old.  The parties began their relationship in about 1998 and they separated shortly after Luc's birth.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the third time that an application by the mother under Schedule 1 has been before the court.  The first time was in 2002. This application was withdrawn following the father having been made redundant. The second was as a result of an application made in 2004.  After a number of hearings, the 2004 application resulted in an order by consent dated 30 September 2005, when Luc was 5 years old.  The mother has made an application to set aside that order on the basis of non-disclosure and her present application under Schedule 1 is dated 4 March 2010.  On advice, the mother does not pursue her application to set aside the order dated 30 September 2005 because it provided only for maintenance, which can be varied pursuant to her present application and she does not seek back dating to an earlier date than 4 March 2010.  </p>

There is a dispute as to the father&#8217;s current income and income prospects, and the likelihood of him making significant capital gains.  But, the approach taken by the CSA to the income return on capital, as the father accepts, means that this is clearly a &#8220;top up&#8221; case.  However, his position is that, on any view, this is not a &#8220;big money case&#8221; and the maximum CSA award is relevant because his income is not greatly in excess of the maximum used by the CSA.</p>

She is not working and she and Luc depend and live on state benefits (from her Form E these include child benefit, child tax credit and income support) and payments from the father.

She was unclear when that medical would be and her evidence was to the effect that she was waiting for an appointment.  This caused problems relating to her funding by the LSC but this was continued for the hearing.  That leaves, from her Form E, &#163;80 a month child benefit and &#163;207 in child tax credit (so &#163;287 a month or &#163;3,444 per annum) and the housing benefit of &#163;1,200 a month.</p>

Following her separation from the father she moved with Luc to Los Angeles, and worked there as a production manager on terms that were attractive in terms of remuneration and generally.  Initially, she was provided with accommodation by her employer, and later she rented a home there.  In, I think 2006, she moved back to this country and moved in with her parents and then to rented accommodation.  After her return, she and Luc spent holidays in the USA at the house she had rented, which she kept on the basis that sub lets for the periods she was not there slightly exceeded its cost.  She told me that she had to give up her lease because she was told by her landlord that she could not sub let for more than 6 months a year.  This property is therefore no longer available for holidays.</p>

Additionally, the prognosis in that report in respect of her &#8220;post-head injury syndrome&#8221; was (a) that her memory deficit and psychological problems, and intellectual damage, will be likely to continue for the rest of her life, unless she has intensive and prolonged treatment, which may ameliorate them, and also (b) that her post-traumatic migraine will remain for the foreseeable future, unless targeted and specialised treatment is given to the mother.</p>

It consists of a report, dated 11 April 2011, by a consultant neurologist who had treated her.  But it is clear from this report that she was last seen in his clinic on 15 October 2009.  He confirms that her symptoms were consistent with the effects of post-concussion syndrome and a whiplash injury both complicated by secondary psychological difficulties, including low mood.  He adds that, should she still be experiencing these problems, further advice about their management from a neurologist with a particular interest in headaches would be appropriate, as would clinical psychology input to advise on management of her low mood, as well as any residual cognitive difficulties, with a view to further ameliorating her ongoing difficulties.  He also says that following an injury of this sort associated only with very brief post-traumatic amnesia, and no obvious injury on imaging to the brain, that the risk of post-traumatic epilepsy is not thought to be significantly increased.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the hearing, the mother produced a letter from her GP dated 18 April 2011.  This states that on 12 July 2010 the comment was made that she was seeing both a physiotherapist and a specialist, and that she was having trouble with sorting her memory and sequencing events; a possibility of frontal lobe brain damage was entertained by the doctor who saw her and a certificate for two months was provided as she was considered unfit to work in her job as a book editor.  This letter contains no other information as to whether or not the mother was considered, at other times, to be unfit for work but it indicates that she was seen in respect of complaints of dizziness in October 2010 and February 2011, and that she was prescribed tablets to assist this, and was given painkillers for her head and neck pain. She told me that since May 2010 she has suffered from labyrinthitis which causes vertigo, dizziness and sickness.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother's position was that the after-effects of her road traffic accident, and, if it is not one of them, her labyrinthitis, and so in particular her auditory memory problems, her short term memory problems, horrific pain, problems with her balance and side effects from medication, have meant that she has been, and continues to be, unable to work.  In her oral evidence, she qualified this by saying that she was unable to do the work she used to do.  She told me that she had edited a year book to assist learning at Luc&#8217;s school, for which she was paid about &#163;3,000, and that she has started work on another similar book for which she may receive some payment, but that she has no contractual entitlement to any such payment.  This might explain the reference to her being a book editor in the certificate her GP&#8217;s letter refers to, but why she needed such a certificate for her self employed work on a book is unexplained.</p>

In my view, the mother demonstrated in giving her evidence that she is an intelligent and determined woman, an excellent recall of the events of this litigation and no unusual difficulty in understanding, retaining and answering questions.  A similar performance in many work places (albeit that it would have to last over a longer but less stressful period) would make her good at her job there.</p>

The father explained that that valuation was based on an aggressive growth trajectory by reference to raising new investment funds over the period from 2008 to 2012 that would take the total assets under management to around US$10 billion, with revenues of &#163;120 million, and profits before tax of some &#163;35 million.  But this expectation was not achieved, having regard to the general financial and economic climate, and the father said that the current view of the board and senior management was that NewCo had a value of around &#163;40 million, and therefore the share price was around 40p.  But he went on to point out that, as the company was a private company, it was unlikely that, even if the shares could be sold, they would have a realisable value of much more than 25p per share and he therefore valued the shares held by his wife, himself and the EBT at around &#163;800-&#163;900,000 as at June 2009.</p>

He sought to explain the account set out in the Form E on the basis that it was something he had put forward in the ancillary relief proceedings to found the proposition that all of the shares in CCC Ltd were family assets, and to refute a claim made by his wife that they had been bought with money she brought to the marriage, and therefore should be treated as her pre-acquired assets.

I pause to comment that, although this was not investigated with him, it seems surprising that the father did not have &#163;5,000, or could not have obtained it from another source if he had wanted to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, without hearing from his ex-wife, or indeed having any account of her position save through the father, I am not prepared to make a finding as to which of them was the true beneficial owner of the founder shares.  As I understand it, and this would seem likely, the position of the wife was and is that she provided the &#163;5,000 for the shares on the basis that they would be an investment by her and so they represent assets which she brought to the marriage.  Even if, the purpose or one of the purposes, behind the shares being taken in her name was to shield them from a claim made on behalf of Luc it does not mean that the agreement or understanding between the father and the wife was that she would hold the shares for the father.  Indeed, it is perfectly possible to seek to achieve that purpose through an arrangement or understanding that the wife was to be the true beneficial owner.  So, it seems to me, that to establish that the father was the beneficial owner of the founder shares in the wife&#8217;s name, the mother would have to provide evidence to demonstrate that the court should conclude that the underlying agreement or arrangement between the father and his ex-wife was that the wife would not present the true position as to ownership to the outside world, and in particular to the mother and the court in any proceedings the mother brought on behalf of Luc.  This would involve a finding of dishonesty against the wife, which in my view it would be inappropriate for me to make without giving her the opportunity to be heard.  Additionally, in the context of the resolution of the issue of the beneficial ownership of the founder shares it seems likely that discovery as to the sale of the 25,000 shares in 2005 or 2007 would be relevant.</p>

The mother accepted and asserted that the general, carry and share bonuses were all paid to the EBT and the salary was paid direct to the father.  The father received the benefit of loans from the EBT.  I was not told the amounts or dates of those loans.  Also, I have not found a history of the shareholding of the EBT in CCC Ltd and NewCo, from time to time, and thus of any sales of such shares by the EBT.  There is however a letter from the trustees of the EBT dated 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>  December 2010 which indicates (a) that the assets of the EBT held for the father are made up of cash (a total of &#163;227,576.46 capital and &#163;2,970 income) and outstanding loans to him of &#163;342,720, and (b) that as the loans equal 60% of the trust&#8217;s total value the trustee is not prepared to make any further loans to the father.

It was due on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2010, but was only served a few days before the hearing.  Her solicitors correctly shouldered much of the blame for that and also for the very late identification of the detail of the amount of her claim.  This late provision of material plainly put unnecessary and potentially unfair pressure on the father.  Indeed, it might have rendered proper preparation of the case by him impossible if he had still been represented because then he would not have been drafting his response himself.  This approach by the mother was therefore potentially unfair.  But, in my judgment, the father was able to respond appropriately and gaps caused by the mother&#8217;s approach to benefits, and her likely income, have now been addressed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At this stage, I am not in a position to make findings on her earlier applications in the proceedings because, in my view correctly, they were not gone into in any detail before me, albeit that I was directed to a document prepared by the father, which he maintained showed that he had throughout complied with his duty of disclosure.   But the mother&#8217;s interjections as the hearing progressed, and her very late attempt to introduce further material, provided clear evidence that she regarded it as appropriate for her (a) to conduct herself in ways that she would have justifiably and strenuously have complained about if the father had done the same, and (b) to introduce material as and when she wanted to.  As to the latter, the hearing was adjourned over the Easter holiday and on the first day of the next term the mother by-passed her representatives and sent directly to me a further statement based on information received from her father and some further material  about Luc.  I excluded the latter and would also have excluded the former if the father had not indicated that he was happy to deal with it.  In my view, this approach to the provision of this information (even if, as the mother explained, her father had been away and not in a position to assist her earlier) was a clear demonstration that the mother was prepared to take an approach to this litigation that she would, with justification, have complained about in terms that it was unfair and showed a lack openness if the father had taken a similar approach.</p>

After the father and the mother had been questioned further on this topic, and a short adjournment, the mother through counsel, to my mind correctly, reverted to the stance taken in final written submissions prepared by counsel for the mother, namely that the mother was not in a position to seek findings against the father concerning his disclosure in the 2004 proceedings relating to his shares in ICo, their value and sale.</p>

However, the absence of an explanation from the father, when he  provided the management accounts that they do not reflect a full and proper allocation of expenses is an example of the father failing to comply fully with his duty to give full and clear disclosure, and supports the view that his figures and projections should be approached with caution.</p>

Further, in the case of CGTL they were acted on and, as I understood it, made some changes to the position set out in the December letter from the CEO of CGTL.  The father seemed to accept this by also asserting that the changes were shown by the invoices he had disclosed and so they were disclosed and he did not have to provide any further information because by sending the invoices he had complied with Moylan J&#8217;s order.  I accept that in part this approach flowed from his annoyance with the mother because of her approach to the litigation and her constant general theme that he was hiding assets and information.  But, and even though he complied with Moylan J&#8217;s order, this stance by reference to the signing of agreements and the ability of the mother to discover changes from an analysis of invoices is a failure to give clear disclosure of relevant changes and thus of new information.</p>

This was not challenged.  But, for the reasons given, I treat with caution the assertion that it represents the likely available maximum for the short to medium term future and that he will not have sufficient time to fit in one off commissions from time to time.  The 6 months of invoices provided pursuant to Moylan J&#8217;s order indicate that these commissions have totalled around &#163;50,000.  I accept that with five regular clients the father may not be able to keep up that rate of one off jobs, but in my view an estimate of &#163;50,000 per annum gross from such work would be reasonable.  Also, there is inevitably some uncertainty in respect of success and placement fees both as to whether they will be achieved at all, and also in some cases as to their maximum or likely amount and what credit will have to be given for regular hourly / daily rates of remuneration.  There is the prospect, recognised by the father in his final submissions, that they might produce a higher return than a retainer set at &#163;50,000 a year, whether or not credit for such retainer has to be given in respect of such fees.</p>

This is in line with, if not wholly based on, the management accounts from 1 April to 10 January (approx 9 months).  An extrapolation of them indicates gross annual receipts of around &#163;220,000 and annual expenses of around &#163;54,000 (which the father accepted were too high, and for future years he has taken them at &#163;50,000 and a pension contribution at &#163;24,000).  A deduction of &#163;74,000 from the extrapolated gross income of &#163;220,000 gives &#163;146,000 available for payment as salary to the father.  It would be reasonable for him not to take all of that as salary to provide cover for contingencies. So the father&#8217;s estimate of his income from April 2010 and 2011 of  &#163;135,000 gross (&#163;78,000 net) is reasonable on the evidence and my finding that he is not hiding sources of income, and I accept it,</p>

This excludes the CCC Carbon carry of &#163;45,000 (see sub-paragraph (ii) above) and although there is a risk that it will not be paid (and it depends on the efforts and results of others) I consider that it is fair to include it. That gives an estimate for gross income of around &#163;300,000 which equates to a net income that matches the father&#8217;s present budget (around &#163;160,000, see below) which, in my view, carries with it a fair inference that he hopes and expects to be able to meet that level of expenditure from regular income. </p>

But, in my judgment, those comparisons are not the right or important benchmarks and in setting the relevant standard of living (and thus the two elements of periodical payments) it is more appropriate to look at the standard of living during the relationship and the expectations of the parties during it for any child they may have and thus for Luc (albeit that the relationship ended shortly after his birth), and the father&#8217;s present and expected standard of living for himself and all his children.</p>

But during that period of transition, and so in the short term, both on his and my higher estimates, to meet his budgeted expenditure and my award he will have to use his readily available capital of &#163;130,000.  My award increases his budget by &#163;8,000 per annum in round terms and so (after taking account some reductions to his budget recognised in evidence) in round terms that budget becomes &#163;170,000 per annum leaving (again in round terms) &#163;86,000 for his expenditure on his present household. </p>

In my view, the nature of the father&#8217;s present household, the history of this case and a comparison of the budgets, found the conclusion that the desirability of preserving this capital over a longer period does not lead to a conclusion that it would be fair to reduce the periodical payments for the benefit of Luc to less than &#163;28,000 per annum.  Rather, if the father wants to preserve more of that capital for a longer period he should, in my view, try to do so by reducing his estimated expenditure on his present household.</p>

I do not agree with either point.  In my judgment, the contradictory and self serving accounts given by the father in respect of the ownership of the founder shares in CCC Ltd, and my findings in respect of those accounts, found a real risk that in the future the father may either (a) seek to sell and use the proceeds of sale of investments without informing the mother, and (b) seek to use significant increases in income without informing the mother of them.  As to these risks, his offer to provide his tax returns and audited accounts of T Ltd goes some way to meeting them, but the risk would still remain that capital and/or income will be used before the mother knows of its existence.</p>

As to any future investments he only has to inform the mother after the event and they would have to disclosed before the further hearing.</p>
