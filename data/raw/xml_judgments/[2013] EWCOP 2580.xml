Although it is possible to have a conversation with him about his clearly expressed views, it is plain, and agreed by even his mother MA, that he lacks capacity in some important aspects to which I shall come.  He has been diagnosed in these proceedings as having atypical autism and a pervasive development disorder.  He presents with unpredictable behaviour on occasion.  </p>

The local authority is concerned about the impact of isolation on WMA&#8217;s long term development and its social work team has reluctantly come to the conclusion that he needs to be moved into supported living accommodation, despite the difficulty of the initial move, because in the long term this will help WMA and MA to develop a more healthy relationship.  It is argued that there is currently an unhealthy degree of interdependence. The local authority alleges too that MA is unable to care for WMA properly, she is likely to be harming his development and it is against his best interests to remain with her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As long ago as 2009 the home at which WMA and MA lived was found to be in a squalid state. MA did not wish to accept outside help for herself and her son. In addition, WMA was thought rarely, if at all, to leave the home.  The local authority decided that the house was unsafe and the decision was taken to move them to a new and clean bungalow. I have seen photographs of the state of the property and a move was clearly essential.  </p>

On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2011, for example, the local authority was alerted by the police about concern as to the apparent neglect of WMA and I shall say more of what happened to WMA below.  Again, the local authority tried to engage mother and son and assist them but was met with reluctance. It is alleged that, even with the benefit of court orders, co-operation has proved extremely difficult to get.  Indeed, as will be seen, the expectations recorded by me in my order of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February of this year were not complied with, for, whilst it has proved possible to obtain agreement at court, WMA usually becomes upset and MA reluctant when people arrive at the home to assist.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reluctance to accept even basic help is, for example, exemplified in WMA&#8217;s assertion and that of MA that Delos, the care provider arranged by the local authority - who, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>assists in occupying WMA&#8217;s time constructively - should come to the house on two separate hours a week only, whereas by late May 2013 they were providing twelve hours a week assistance.  </p>

In addition, the local authority until recently sought an order appointing it property and affairs deputy and as welfare deputy for WMA, although it no longer does so.  It seeks, however, an order as to deprivation of liberty simply to ensure that WMA remains at the place to which he is moved and that that move is effected.</p>

In considering best interests, I must, of course, decide what weight to place upon his very strongly expressed wishes. Issues of capacity are decision specific so I look at each matter separately.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case is not without difficulty, given the strong views of mother and son.  The difficult problem posed in this case is this: is the court being asked to provide a better life or is it really the case that a move is dictated by best interests. Ms Weereratne put the matter well in her initial position statement and I quote:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;The Official Solicitor has previously characterised this case as being about a better quality of life for WMA.  In cases such as this it is important to take great care to ensure that what is being proposed reflects<marker name="tab"/>a proper analysis of best interests as propounded by section 4 of the Mental Capacity Act and not what is considered with the best of intentions best for the relevant person.  To separate WMA from his mother needs careful justification and a proper balancing exercise of the benefits and advantages to WMA and cannot simply be based on what others consider to be good for him.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There has been long term neglect and damage to local authority provided accommodation.  So poor was the state of repair of the previous property at P that WMA and MA were allocated that new property in October 2012 at E.  There a blocked toilet was of great concern and I note some anxiety that remains at the present property for, after a brief spell in bed and breakfast accommodation in which there were complaints about hygiene also, they moved to their present home.  Nonetheless, there has been no washing machine there, no proper floor coverings and sheets draped over the windows.  In the short period of occupation, it, nonetheless, became necessary for a deep clean of the new accommodation such was the state of its cleanliness. In addition, the home remains a tripping hazard and such improvements as there have been in the care of WMA have been prompted by Delos support workers.  It has fallen to Delos support workers to escort MA to the laundrette, even though transport arrangements have been for her to organise.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MA has hindered WMA&#8217;s adult development in that he simply is not equipped in the skills and tools for everyday living. As it became clear in the evidence, WMA learned how to make toast and tea in S, to which I shall come, but never learned at home.  MA keeps WMA at home most of the time and he cannot move freely round his local community. In addition the local authority alleges MA is psychologically abusive of her son, speaking about him in a derogatory manner and being unable to understand what he might make progress in as to social skills despite his disability.  MA is quite unable to cope, it says, with WA&#8217;s outbursts and simply fails to ask for support regarding his difficult behaviour.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I add, for completeness sake, more detail of the history of WMA&#8217;s care:  Mother was accused of neglect of WMA in 2003 when he was still a child but those allegations were dismissed and the interim care order was not renewed after a brief period in foster care.  In July 2011, MA was arrested under section 44 of 2005 Act on suspicion of wilful neglect but no charges were brought.  WMA was then taken to S, a respite facility where he spent about six months.  The standard authorisation for WMA&#8217;s deprivation of liberty was, in fact, determined by order of King J on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2012.  The Court of Protection proceedings initially brought by MA have continued, however, and to them were added the local authority&#8217;s deputyship applications that it no longer pursues.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position of MA has been a somewhat unusual one.  She came with WMA to court on day one of the hearing before me. She told me she had to look after WMA for the remainder of the hearing and would not be coming again, although she did, whilst here, concede that WMA was unable to decide, for example, whether to move house. That somewhat restricted questioning of her and, of course, her contribution to the case.  I took the view that, in reality, all she was doing was giving me her views, albeit with questions from              Mr. O&#8217;Brien and Ms Weereratnee.  She was effectively making submissions on day one.  Accordingly, I did not find it necessary to have her sworn and neither advocate objected to this course.  Although she was and is aware that her case was made more difficult by her not being in court, she chose not to come again and so has not cross-examined the social workers, the independent social worker and Dr. Carpenter.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That of itself perhaps illustrates the difficulties that MA herself poses.  She finds it very hard to cope with engaging with authority.  I regard, for my part, MA as a vulnerable person and, whilst I have no direct evidence that she, too, lacks capacity, I am concerned at the way in which she keeps her home. She is obviously dependent to a degree upon WMA for care of herself and I am concerned too by her reluctance to engage with social services and any organisation seeking to assist.</p>

He has difficulty in understanding the emotions of others and the impact of his decision making on mother.  He does not understand abstract concepts.

WMA&#8217;s own confident presentation evaporates when taking difficult decisions. He would say things such as he does not like to go out but there is no report of him ever regretting doing so. He does not think there would be compliance with help offered in the home were he to remain with MA.  WMA would be in an isolated environment.

The likely consequence of this is that the formal support will be less effective in meeting WMA&#8217;s needs than would otherwise be the case as it would be at best inconsistent with and at worst undermined by the care and support offered by  MA and her needs will take precedence over those of WMA.  </p>

He added that his concern was WMA&#8217;s health is not currently monitored properly; there is no health action plan.  Even though there are minor improvements, the property occupied poses a physical risk.  MA&#8217;s inability to manage money can result in there not being enough food in the home.  There is a risk of infection in the way food is kept and from unclean clothes. WMA remains socially isolated and desperately needs an independent life. Speaking of risks, he said those risks remain. Some are reduced but others remain high.  WMA must be removed as he needs a change of environment to assist his own mental wellbeing.  Were nothing done, there would be no plans made for MA&#8217;s deteriorating health and the risks would be higher as tension mounts between mother and son. That was inevitable.</p>

Contact should be planned very carefully for the first three months and then reviewed.  If MA will not engage with Delos then that was her decision.  She should be encouraged to participate in WMA&#8217;s plan but if she would not she should be kept informed. </p>

A protocol should be agreed with the police in the event of difficulties in removing WMA from the home and police action being taken to enforce that move, though that should be a last resort; but the protocol should not be too prescriptive.  It was important to understand what triggers behavioural problems in WMA and to avoid his distress.  It was not clear how mother and son would react but if the home were barricaded then that would be an unacceptable risk for WMA.  It would be impossible, he thought, to contemplate all possible eventualities but he broadly supported the local authority&#8217;s approach.

She said she had introduced a picture communication system to explain things to him, though I am satisfied that was done at the behest of the local authority.  WMA had learned how to wash up and wipe surfaces and mop the floor but I suspect all this came from his time at S.</p>

WMA said Delos came too much, he wanted to do things himself, and he complained they would not listen to him.  Twelve hours of visiting over four days was too much for WMA.  He liked to decide what to do on a certain day.  That answer concerned me and it seemed to me that mother would seem to support what WMA had decided, no matter how reluctant he was to undertake activities, and that would not be for his benefit.  WMA wanted to return, she said, to the level of support Delos offered in the first place. He had seen too many people:  Dr. Carpenter;        Mr. McKinstrie; social workers; people from CTLD.  It was too much for him to cope with.  But I detected that, in saying WMA took these views, he was mirroring simply what she had to say.</p>

She had to concede that, even though she had lived for less than a year in her current property, the local authority had had to provide a deep clean of it for them.  Indeed, she said CG was too critical of her.  They live in poverty and that was the problem, she said. That may be true; but it seemed to me from the photographs I saw of the first home and what I have heard of home since that mother is content at times, simply because she is unable to deal with cleanliness properly, to live in a filthy state.</p>

Would it not be better for WMA to move to an environment where he could learn these skills?  But she would not accept that.  She conceded that upon her demise WMA would have to live in the social services accommodation.  Was it not better for him to learn new skills now?

Well, she said, she had never had a relationship with social services.  She thought it was difficult to work with social workers.  They were always criticising her, she said. Her answers gave me a great deal to be concerned about.  She was referred to the schedule of tasks to be done to my order of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February of this year and there are outstanding a number of matters that she should have done, for example: laundry and washing to be done once a week commencing with clearing a backlog of washing so that the house may be cleaned as provided for;  the local authority to provide for the house to be cleaned by an outside agency;  the cleanliness thereafter was to be her responsibility;  WMA to have one night away from his mother before 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2013;  and the local authority to arrange for the appointment of an IMCA who would endeavour to arrange a meeting with WMA as soon as possible.  True enough, the local authority had been able to arrange the cleaning of the property but it was not until late May, she had to concede, that the washing was brought up to date.  WMA had not gone for respite, despite the agreement in February, and she said that was because WMA did not want it; yet, of course, it was up to her to encourage it and that caused me concern as well.  The IMCA, she claimed, had simply not worked with them.</p>

Everyone, according to her, is in the wrong and she in the right, whereas the truth is, it appears to me from the evidence I subsequently heard, that she turns help away and does not engage with professionals. Second, it is plain to me that she has kept and still keeps at times a very dirty home.

I am also of the view that MA is not deliberately abusive to him but rather has needs of her own that have not been assessed but which impact upon her ability to care for WMA effectively and to manage her own living environment. I think she is not aware that her behaviour towards him is abusive.  She has little expectations of him and there is evidence of the frustration she experiences from undertaking his care, shouting at him, preventing him from leaving the property.  MA has stated on many occasions she does not want local authority involvement with the family, blaming them for the lack of diagnosis of WMA as a child.  She has been found to be neglectful through safeguarding adults procedures. I am concerned that WMA has been treated in an inhumane and degrading manner by MA and that his true potential has been unrecognised and stifled.  In order for him to live safely and towards a more fulfilling life I think he should move on to supported accommodation whilst continuing to have contact with his mother.&#8221;</p>

He simply had not had them and he would not have them if he continued to lead the isolated life he does with his mother and I agree with her. I find KB&#8217;s evidence persuasive.  She was asked a great deal about her records but it seems to me that she answered well and gives a very accurate and persuasive view of what is best for WMA now in terms of his best interests.</p>

She prepared the new care plan for the move for WMA to B that deals with all the matters that Mr. McKinstrie said were missing.  She was very anxious to be fair and she prepared a proper plan in the event of WMA staying with his mother with two alternatives, depending on the amount of local authority involvement, but I do not propose to set out the plans for WMA at home because it seems to me that WMA remaining at home and being cared for properly is quite unachievable in the light of his attitude towards outside help and the attitude of his mother too.  </p>

She felt the care plan set out at C309 of the bundle gives WMA appropriate life choices and would involve him in the community.  At A129 of the bundle she had set out in a very careful way a balance sheet setting out the advantages and disadvantages of WMA remaining where he is.  She felt WMA needed to be moved, to be &#8220;encouraged to push the boundaries&#8221; in B. He would be &#8220;empowered,&#8221; she thought.

For example, an invitation had been sent to WMA via Delos for him to go to a barbecue at B just to see what it was like but MA had intervened, taken the invitation, ripped it up and said, &#8220;He&#8217;s not going.&#8221; Or was it not the case, Ms Weereratne asked, that WMA experienced change that was too fast and too soon?  But she did not agree and, of course, in that she has the support of Dr. Carpenter and Mr. McKinstrie.  She thought the number of hours that Delos were working in May 2013 was reasonable.  WMA&#8217;s problem was he would always say he wished &#8220;to remain as I am.&#8221;  It was difficult to know the extent to which he was influenced by MA in that respect.  When he was in S he did not say that he did not want to do things, although he would say his mother said he could not do things.  </p>

She thought there was an inadequate supply of food again in the house and she was not allowed to check the use by dates of items in the fridge.  Mother would not let her.  MA had been refusing assistance with shopping, saying that Delos disrupted her routine, which also concerned me.  The fridge at the home was not in good condition.  It was dirty and leaking liquid and the floor was sticky.  Cleaning the fridge and cleaning the floor was, of course, MA&#8217;s responsibility.  In the meantime, the washing up had been done and the surfaces were clean but those were what WMA has been doing.  The living room required hoovering.  One sofa was stained.  The toilet upstairs was not clean and the toilet seat was still not fitted. MA was wearing one of WMA&#8217;s new tee-shirts when she gave evidence at court.  </p>

She had detected more recently a change in the atmosphere towards her, something she has repeated in the more recent evidence appended by KB.

The sad truth is she has huge limitations as a carer for WMA.  She has poor eyesight, she cannot budget, she cannot keep food hygienically, she cannot keep the home clean and tidy, rather the reverse.  She is opposed to regular engagement with local authority professionals.  She will not work with the local authority on her own admission and she has spurned help from Delos herself.  Whatever she may say about being a good mother to WMA, and I am sure she intends to be one, she is, in practice, a poor one; for she has done little to forward his learning social and self care skills. Indeed, her low expectations of WMA hold him back.  WMA himself said, when at S, his mother had told him he could not do certain tasks which he then proceeded to learn to do.  Mother needs the very help from the local authority that she persistently rejects.  She is, I am afraid, deliberately cussed and difficult and I believe her own psychological limitations disqualify her from caring for WMA and looking after his needs.  </p>

The photographs of P, frankly, are revolting and remind me of conditions of homes from which young children are taken into care.  When mother and son moved into E all was not well.  There was a neighbour problem that drove them to move to their current property.  Even in the B&amp;B they were in briefly there were hygiene concerns and yet within months of occupying B Court [the current home] it required a deep clean. Whilst the property is cleaner than it was, CG observes dirty parts and there are still problems with the toilet which should always be kept spotless.  WMA keeps surfaces clean but MA just simply does not notice other problems.  It is only good fortune, in my view, that has led to no obvious infections being contracted so far.</p>

By contrast, if WMA is to move now then he would learn new skills which I hope would enable him to cope when the inevitable happens.
