The local authority, supported by the Official Solicitor oppose that move.  Despite the parents&#8217; clearly expressed views that they have no intention of arranging a marriage for S, the local authority argues that such an event is a real possibility.  If that is proved, then the risks to S of her entering into a marriage whether formal or informal are such that the court should continue the injunctive relief in the full form now sought by the local authority.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;There is a certain logical difficulty about granted a coercive order in proceedings where the relief sought is merely a declaration of the legal position.  No authority has been cited to me in support of the power to do so.  On the other hand, though merely a declaration, it is a binding statement of the legal position.  And, although this was said in the Guarantee Trust case to be rarely done, it could be in negative terms.  Thus if the outcome were to be that it would be an unlawful interference with the patient&#8217;s rights, either to remove him from this country or, conversely, to prevent his removal to Norway, then an injunction might well be granted to prevent such an unlawful act. &#8230;&#8230; I hold, therefore, that there is power to grant an interlocutory injunction to prevent the patients removal and thus to preserve the present position pending the hearing of the plaintiff&#8217;s originating summons.&#8221;</p>

There is no doubt, generally speaking, this branch of the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction extends not merely to declaratory relief but also to the grant of injunctive relief: see A v A Health Authority (2002) EWHC 18 at para. 44.  And notwithstanding the qualification which I there expressed it is now, in my judgment, clearly established that the jurisdiction in such cases is not limited to the grant of interlocutory injunctions but extends to the grant of final injunctions.  I have myself granted such injunctions in previous unreported cases involving incompetent adults.  That said, I prefer to express no views, one way or the other, as to whether this jurisdiction is exercisable or properly exercisable to restrain a marriage.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I turn from the outcome in the present case to some more general observations.  There can be no doubt in my mind that the evaluation of best interests is akin to a welfare appraisal &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;  pending the enactment of a check-list or other statutory direction it seems to me that the first instance judge with the responsibility to make an evaluation of the best interests of a claimant lacking capacity should draw up a balance sheet.  The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit.  In the present case the instance would be the acquisition of fool-proof contraception.  Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counter-balancing dis-benefits to the applicant.  An obvious instance in this case would be the apprehension, the risk and the discomfort inherent in the operation.  Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue.  At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses.  Obviously, only if the account is in relatively significant credit will the judge conclude that the applicant is likely to advance the best interests of the claimant.&#8221;</p>

There is a powerful cultural motivation for this and a history of resistance to views other than their own.  I cannot rely on their protestations to the contrary.  S requires protection from family pressures drawn by cultural priorities when the parents&#8217; protection regrettably cannot be trusted.  A protection against a risk that is neither understood nor accepted by those responsible for safeguarding S is no protection when faced with strong motivation to ignore the risk.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Official Solicitor issued a Practice Note on 1 May 2001 headed &#8220;Declaratory Proceedings: Medical and Welfare Decisions for Adults who lack Capacity&#8221;.  It concerned the jurisdiction of the High Court to make declarations as the best interests of an adult who lacks decision-making capacity.  It was particularly concerned with cases involving sterilisation and discontinuance of artificial nutrition for a patient in a vegetative state.  In paragraph 5 the Official Solicitor expressed the view that Part 8 was the more appropriate procedure and that a Part 8 claim form should be used.</p>

It noted that proceedings seeking declarations as to the best interest of incapacitated adults for civil proceedings to which the CPR 1998 applied they were more suitable for hearing in the Family Division.  The Official Solicitor&#8217;s Practice Note to which I have just referred was approved as providing valuable guidance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position therefore is clear save for one matter.  It will be recalled that CPR 8 relates to a claimant seeking the court&#8217;s decision on a question &#8220;which is unlikely to involve a substantial dispute of fact&#8221;.  The question is whether the prospect of such a dispute of fact would invalidate the use of this procedure.  I am satisfied that it does not.</p>

The patient concerned was the subject of an originating summons and the Official Solicitor acted as Guardian ad Litem for the patient.  I have already referred to part of the judgment relating to whether injunctions could be granted where the relief sought was of a declaratory nature.  Hale J held that it could be granted if it was in negative terms.</p>

The case involved an 18 year old with an intellectual age of 5 to 8 who had been accommodated with consent by a Local Authority when she was 17.  Subsequently the parents withdrew their consent for her to remain with the Local Authority.  The Local Authority sought a declaration that it would be in her best interests to remain in Local Authority accommodation and for them to restrict and supervise contact with her parents.</p>

An order was made but set aside by the Court of Appeal.  The Local Authority then made an application invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.  Johnson J held on a preliminary issue that the High Court did have jurisdiction to hear a claim for a declaratory relief under Order 15 Rule 16 which permitted a declaration only to be sought.  The mother appealed as there were irreconcilable differences between her views and that of the Local Authority.</p>

It included the power to declare that a particular person should be the decision maker on behalf of the adult who lacked capacity.</p>
