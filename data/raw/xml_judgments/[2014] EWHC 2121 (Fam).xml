	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This case provides a clear example of the difficulties created as a result of surrogacy arrangements being subject to varying degrees of domestic regulation, from significant regulation to none at all, and also because of the existence of significant differences in the effect of such domestic regulation.  There is, in my view, a compelling need for a uniform system of regulation to be created by an international instrument in order to make available an appropriate structure in respect of what can only be described as the surrogacy market.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The proceedings have been continuing for a very substantial period of time.  This has been caused in part by the need for enquiries to be made in Georgia.  It is, therefore, very much to the parties&#8217; credit that they have agreed the orders which should be made concerning the child.  It is considerably to the benefit of a child if their parents can work together in a reasonably harmonious and constructive manner.  This may well require parents to put their own differences or disputes to one side but it is never in a child&#8217;s interest to become involved in such differences or disputes.  I am entirely satisfied that the provisions agreed by the parties in this case are consistent with and will promote D&#8217;s welfare.  Indeed, those provisions are in accordance with the preliminary view I had formed on reading the papers as to what orders would fulfil the obligation imposed on the court by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, namely that the child&#8217;s welfare should be the court&#8217;s paramount consideration.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The issue I have to decide in this judgment is whether the surrogate mother was married at the relevant time.  This is necessary for the purposes of deciding whether, as a matter of English law, the father is the child&#8217;s legal father.  As Baroness Hale said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (Children) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 FLR 629" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 FLR 629</ref></span>, parenthood can be defined in a number of different ways: genetic parenthood, gestational parenthood and social and psychological parenthood.  There is, of course, in addition, legal parenthood.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">There can be no doubt that both the Applicant and the First Respondent are the social and psychological parents of the child, which is why in the rest of this judgment I will refer to them as the mother and the father.  However, this does not make them at law the parents of the child.  The father is also a genetic parent but that too, in the circumstances of this case, does not necessarily make him at law a parent or the father of the child.  The mother is not the legal parent of the child.  </p>

This was declared to the UK Embassy but very recently we became aware that the surrogate was married.  I went to the UK Embassy with the mother to declare the surrogacy but I do not think this is problematic because some of our UK citizen surrogate mothers were married but UK law regulates this and none of our former potential parents has any problem because of this.  You can check same in UK Embassy.&#8221;  </p>

They have been unsuccessful.  MK has not provided a statement, as requested, clarifying in particular the marital status of the surrogate mother.  In addition, although MK refers to there being a contract between the clinic and the surrogate mother and that she would send it, she has never in fact done so.  In her written statement addressing this issue the mother says: </p>

She did not, however, want this known and explained that the Embassy did not want married women to act as surrogates as it caused complications.  She suggested that potential surrogates were aware of this and implied that some would lie as to their marital status so as not to be turned down.  She did not elaborate on how or when she had discovered that the surrogate mother was, in fact, married and I did not ask.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Turning now to my determination, the evidence in this case, on the issue of whether the surrogate mother was married at the relevant time, is clearly not satisfactory.  The only person able to give direct evidence is MK and she has refused to provide a statement.  She has said, at different times, that the surrogate mother was single, married and divorced.  I do not consider that any greater weight can be given to MK&#8217;s e-mail of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2011 than her other statements, which were either also provided to the mother&#8217;s solicitors or to the consular official at the British Embassy.

The evidence is not sufficient to enable me to come to that conclusion on the balance of probabilities.  Indeed, in my view there is considerable doubt as to whether the clinic provided accurate details as to the identity of the surrogate mother.  It is notable that the clinic has failed to provide its contract with the surrogate mother, although this may be explained by being unwilling to reveal the terms of that contract.  </p>

In their position statements the parties were seeking different solutions.  Those being addressed were adoption, special guardianship and shared residence.  The mother sought either an adoption order or a special guardianship order.  The father, in an extremely balanced statement, sought a shared residence order.  The Local Authority supported the making of a special guardianship order.  The guardian did not support the making of either an adoption order or a special guardianship order, having regard in particular to the effect those orders would have on the parties&#8217; respective positions as parents.  The guardian&#8217;s recommendation was that both parties should have parental responsibility and that there should be a shared residence order.</p>
