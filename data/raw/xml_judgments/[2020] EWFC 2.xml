They had agreed a simple clean-break themselves. amicable drafted the order using the relevant Standard Family Orders precedent. It helped to prepare the Form A, marked &#8220;For Dismissal Purposes Only&#8221;. It helped to prepare the statement of information for a consent order in relation to a financial remedy (Form D81). It helped to prepare a joint statement regarding legal responsibilities and disclosure of assets which was signed by both parties. This latter document is not required by the rules, but I can see that it would be extremely helpful in enabling the court to scrutinise and to understand the net effect of the proposed consent order. </p>

Joint instruction of solicitors happens frequently in divorce cases. Consider a consent order which provides for a jointly owned property to be sold. The parties will routinely jointly instruct a firm of conveyancing solicitors to deal with the sale. Consider a more complex situation where a landed estate is being sold. It may have different titles, and different owners of each respective title. There may be serious tax implications. Commonly the parties will instruct jointly a firm of agricultural and tax specialists to act for them together on the disposal in their joint best interests.  </p>

Thus, rule 6.2 of the current Code of Conduct for individual solicitors (Code of Conduct for Solicitors, RELs and RFLs 2019) specifically permits solicitors to act for clients jointly where they have a substantially common interest in relation to the matter or the aspect of it, or where they are competing for the same objective. </p>

The usual meaning of "ancillary" is "subordinate". A clue to what was intended lies in the words in brackets "(such as entering appearances to actions)". These words show that it must have been intended that the ancillary functions would be formal steps required in the conduct of litigation. These would include drawing or preparing instruments within the meaning of section 22 of the 1974 Act and other formal steps. It is not necessary for the purposes of this case to decide the precise parameters of the definition of "the right to conduct litigation". It is unfortunate that this important definition is so unclear. But because there are potential penal implications, its very obscurity means that the words should be construed narrowly. Suffice it to say that we do not see how the giving of legal advice in connection with court proceedings can come within the definition. In our view, even if, as the Law Society submits, correspondence with the opposing party is in a general sense "an integral part of the conduct of litigation", that does not make it an "ancillary function" for the purposes of section 28.&#8221; </p>

What if the advice extended to drafting a claim form such as a petition, or an application for degree nisi or the statement in support? It would be surprising if this were forbidden. Imagine if you were getting divorced and you have to fill in Form E. Imagine that your brother was divorced two years earlier. Plainly your brother is not committing an offence if he gives you the benefit of his view of the law. And surely, he would not be in breach of Paragraph 4 and thus committing an offence if he helped you to fill in your Form E which you, acting in person, intended to file with the court. It is common for litigants faced with filling in Form E to approach their accountant for assistance. Plainly, the accountant would not be in breach of Paragraph 4 if she filled in the numeric parts of a travelling draft of the Form.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.17in">However, I do acknowledge that the width of the words of Paragraph 5(1)(c) do literally catch virtually every document which amicable have helped to prepare. The material part of the subparagraph reads: &#8220;preparing any other instrument &#8230; relating to court proceedings in England and Wales&#8221;. A definition of &#8220;instrument&#8221; could capture virtually any piece of legal writing. However, the consent order on this highly literal approach would be exempt by virtue of Paragraph 5(3)(b), which exempts &#8220;an agreement not intended to be executed as a deed&#8221;. A signed draft consent order is plainly an agreement and it is plainly not intended to be executed as a deed. So, on this literal approach the main document, namely the consent order, is exempt under Paragraph 5, but the accompanying Form D81 falls foul of it. This is an absurd consequence of an over-literal approach. In in this regard I remind myself of the famous words of Lord Steyn about the dangers of literalism in <span style="font-style:italic">Sirius International Insurance Co v.

But an example is given in <span style="font-style:italic">The Works of William Paley </span>(1838 ed), Vol III, 60. The moral philosophy of Paley influenced thinking on contract in the 19th century. The example is as follows: The tyrant Temures promised the garrison of Sebastia that no blood would be shed if they surrendered to him. They surrendered. He shed no blood. He buried them all alive. This is literalism. If possible it should be resisted in the interpretative process.&#8221;  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.17in">In 1980 a divorce petition had a numinous status. The Matrimonial Causes Rules 1977 were highly prescriptive as to its contents and presupposed that in most cases it would be &#8220;settled&#8221; by counsel. I myself recall drafting such petitions in the early 1980s. They were elaborate affairs which deployed arcane and impenetrable legal language. They always began with the time-honoured phrase: &#8220;The petition of Jane Doe sheweth that: &#8230;&#8221;. It is easy to see why such a sacred legal document should have been regarded by the Divisional Court in 1980 as having been &#8220;an instrument drawn or prepared in relation to legal proceedings&#8221;. Nowadays of course the populating of Form D8, the divorce petition, is a banal affair. It is largely a tick-the-box exercise. The government itself offers a service for completing this form online. </p>

During argument I tentatively expressed the view that the person preparing the documents in question was not a member of staff of amicable but in fact the customer by virtue of his inputting of the data into amicable&#8217;s website. However, I consider the human factor which I have referred to above (i.e. the checking of the documents for correctness by a member of amicable&#8217;s staff) plainly means that the member of staff in question has prepared, at least to some extent, the documents for the purposes of Paragraph 5. However, it will not be long, surely, before artificial intelligence will do the checking. When that day arrives, and it will not be far away, it could not be said that anybody at amicable has prepared the documents. </p>

It is noteworthy that in both of the cases mentioned above the unqualified person not only drafted the document but filed it with the court. By contrast amicable files nothing with the court. All filing is done by the customer. This is a key distinction in my opinion. It may be argued that I have adopted an unduly restrictive interpretation of the words in Paragraph 5; but in my opinion this is justified having regard to the fact that these provisions have a potentially penal consequence. Here I am faithfully following the guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">Agassi</span> referred to above. </p>

Could it seriously be suggested it was objectionable for a petitioner, for the sake of convenience, to give his brother&#8217;s business address as the place for all correspondence to be sent?
