For 15 days, commencing on 13th November, I have conducted a fact-finding hearing, the purpose of which is to ascertain how L died and, in particular, whether her death was caused by a member of her family.  My sad task has also been to determine whether or not L was sexually assaulted at some time shortly before her death and, again, whether such assault, if it occurred, was perpetrated by a member of her family. </p>

During the course of the hearing he has, with my permission, amended that schedule.  As would be expected, counsel for the mother, the father, M and N have added their respective positions to that schedule.  Having delivered this judgment, I shall distribute a copy of the schedule with my findings inserted into it.   In fact, of course as you now know, I have announced my findings in advance of delivering this judgment, with the consequence that all parties already know the findings that I have made.</p>

Four days later, the Home Office pathologist Dr Cary, accompanied by Dr Marnerides, carried out a special post-mortem examination.  Dr Cary reported that it was his view that the cause of death was due to compression of the neck but that the largely circumferential mark on L&#8217;s neck was indicative of ligature strangulation.  Furthermore, Dr Cary reported that there was evidence of sexual interference with injury to both internal and external genitalia, also to the ano-rectal region.  Dr Cary reported that, in his view, this was a sexually motivated homicide.</p>

HH Judge Cox in due course made interim care orders in respect of O and P on 5th&#160;December 2016.  The basis of the interim care order was the risk of physical harm, risk of sexual harm and risk of emotional harm.  The matter was listed for a directions hearing on 12th&#160;December.  The matter then came before Bodey J on 16thDecember, when the interim care orders in respect of O and P were discharged and the children were, instead, made the subject of interim supervision orders in favour of the London Borough of Southwark until further order or the conclusion of the proceedings.  These two children were allowed to return to the care of their mother, who has been positively assessed by the local authority, and also by the Guardian, as a carer for the three younger children.  </p>

Thus they have each lived under this cloud of suspicion for more than a year.  In spite of the positive assessment of the mother as a carer, it is and remains the local authority&#8217;s case that the mother is one of the pool of possible perpetrators of this most awful crime against her daughter. </span></p>

Furthermore, the father has been living away from all of his family since that time. By reason of the ongoing police investigation and these Public Law proceedings, the family has not been able to unite in grief for the loss of a loved sister and daughter.  This has been a tragic year of almost indescribable pain for this entire family.  Either one or more members of the family were involved in the most heinous crime of sexual assault and murder of a close family member or they have been wrongly accused.  It is my task to do my best to establish what happened. </p>

Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts.  The inherent probabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies &#8230;  It may be unlikely that any person looking after a baby would take him by the wrist and swing him against the wall, causing multiple fractures and other injuries.  But once the evidence is clear that that is indeed what happened to the child, it ceases to be improbable.  Someone looking after the child at the relevant time must have done it at the relevant time.  The inherent improbability of the event has no relevance to deciding who that was.  The simple balance of probabilities test should be applied."</span></p>

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened.  The law operates a binary system in which the only values are nought and one.  The fact either happened or it did not.  If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof.  If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, the value of nought is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened.  If he does discharge it, a value of one is returned and the fact is treated as having happened." </p>

In the name of the critical issue of child protection has grown up a concept, unique I believe to children law, where the usual and well understood concept of the burden and standard of proof appears to shift to the extent that, in a proper case, the judge is entitled to say that, although he cannot identify who committed the given act, he is satisfied that it is one of a given number of people in a group.  </p>

He said that he would only be able to organise a special post-mortem if they had a crime scene manager assigned to the case.  He thought at first that he would have to move the family away to an alternative address to allow the property to be fully examined by a crime scene examiner.  He said that he wanted to try and ascertain if the netting may have been used to self-harm, as part of foul play or whether this could have been a tragic accident.  He then decided to call the Homicide and Serious Crime Command as at that point he believed the circumstances to be suspicious.  He said that he thought that it was highly unlikely that a  girl of that age would self-harm to such an extent, and he was also concerned about a comment attributed to one of the younger siblings about having heard a bump in the night.

I am bound to say that I regard the steps taken by the police following their attendance at the home as a catalogue of failures.  Whilst recognising that those early on the scene formed the view that this could well have been an accident, it must have been obvious to anybody that there could be no certainty about the manner or cause of death and I would have expected the police, immediately after life was pronounced extinct, to begin to treat the area as a possible scene of crime and to continue so to treat it, at least until the result of the post-mortem was known.  I recognise that the first officers on the scene were there to try and save a life and not as scene of crime investigators, but they were soon added to and replaced by officers there with a different remit.  As I have recounted above, it was the findings of Dr Cary, at post-mortem days later, that caused the police to treat this as a potential crime.</span></p>

He was extensively cross-examined about his crime scene management and investigation.  He agreed (when pushed) that the lock on the front door was not a Yale type of lock that automatically locks when closed.  Instead, this was the type of door where one needed to lift the door lever upwards and then turn a key in order to lock the door.  Mr J.W had pointed out to him from photographic evidence taken by the police that the door chain was broken and incapable of being operative.  Mr J.W admitted that he had failed to notice this, but agreed that it looked as though the door chain would have been useless.  This photograph was taken within a day or two of the death - possibly on the day of the death - and there is no evidence to suggest that the chain had been damaged since L&#8217;s death, and I find that it was in the same condition.  Mr J.W admitted in cross-examination that no one looked to see if the door was secured or capable of being secured.</span></p>

I understand that the police are continually trying, as are most other public agencies, to channel precious resources in multiple directions, but I&#160;venture to suggest that there is no room for cost-cutting when dealing with a situation which is as potentially serious as this one was.  Moreover, and in any event, it is more likely than not that the cost to the police has increased rather than decreased as a result of their lack of attention to forensic examination and proper disclosure of material.  In the end, they have been represented at court on numerous occasions and, ultimately, the police have conceded at each stage that they need to produce the documents that I have directed them to produce.  Certainly, the costs of this case, and also to other publicly funded bodies and agencies, have been substantially increased on account of these police failures. </span></p>

Following his final police interview in June he was diagnosed by his GP with an unpleasant and stress related condition.  I accept, of course, that there will be occasions when an immediate arrest of a suspect known to be highly dangerous will require such action.  I have heard nothing at all in this case which could possibly justify such action against this  boy.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on whether the police were justified in making an arrest.  However, I would like to think that, in future, young and potentially vulnerable suspects who need to be arrested could be protected from the shame and horror of a public arrest.  The presumption of innocence is as alive now as it has ever been in our society and I see no reason why the police could not, for example, communicate with the head teacher of the school and arrange for an arrest to take place in a private place in the school.

Members of L&#8217;s family had suggested the possibility that a family member and near neighbour, who I&#160;shall simply name as Mr B, might have been in some way involved in any sexual assault of L, yet no attempt was made to try and match any of the DNA samples with his.  I note that Mr B&#8217;s DNA would probably have been on the national database at this time, he having been known to the police.

The local authority cannot have it both ways: they cannot at the same time rely on the inadequacy of the DNA samples as a reason for me to assume that it could be a family member when there is, on the other hand, clear evidence in relation to a number of the DNA samples that they did not belong to a family member.  The fact is, that male DNA samples were found in L&#8217;s intimate clothing, particularly her underpants, and that this does not appear to be DNA from a family member.

I am confident that that submission takes matters rather too far, but I am equally confident that the DNA evidence that has been initially relied upon by the local authority, and subsequently abandoned by them, points away from rather than towards the involvement of a male family member in the possible sexual assault or murder of L. </span></p>

As I have said, and is obvious to all of us, the local authority has to prove its case.  It does not begin to start to prove its case with the help of DNA when it says of DNA simply that it is "unreliable."  What the local authority is asking me to do is to find that because the DNA evidence is unreliable, I cannot exclude the possibility that the unknown male DNA found belongs to a family member.  I am of course not dealing with excluding possibilities but finding probabilities, and this leads me inevitably to the finding that the male DNA found in L&#8217;s pyjama bottoms and underpants is probably not that of a family member.  If, and I deal with this shortly, L was sexually assaulted at some point close to her death, the presence of male DNA, which is probably not that of a family member, supports the possibility, perhaps the probability, that such sexual assault, if it occurred, was committed by a male who is not a family member.</span></p>

I am bound to say that, at first sight, I was rather attracted to this document since it made the judicial task of simplifying a complicated table a great deal easier.  On closer analysis, it turned out that the use of summary and imprecise language in this table was so dangerous as to make it a completely unreliable document.  Scientific terminology associated with DNA results is, it seems, rarely going to be amenable to simplification.  Without unduly criticising the hard work that was carried out by the member of the Metropolitan Police Force that prepared this document, I would respectfully suggest that lay people - for that is what police officers are for these purposes - should not attempt the simplification of comprehensive data compiled by a forensic scientist. </span></p>

We feel as if our family is being treated wrongly and we are pleading for justice.  We have been forced to be separated from our family for almost a year now and still have not been able to fully grieve the death of our sister.  The following year is going to be very important to the both of us as, I, M, am sitting my GCSEs which will have a huge impact on my future, and I, N, am preparing for my GSCEs.  We would appreciate if you understood how difficult it would be to take such important tests whilst being separated from your family.  Life has been difficult living without our parents and you have to understand we are still kids and are in desperate need of our parents.  I hope you make the right decision and allow us to be reunited with our family."</span></p>

In support of this he says that she sought to present an idealised image of her family to the court.  I&#160;agree that she is most unlikely to be correct in asserting that she and her husband never argued.  Indeed, it was only when pressed in cross-examination that she admitted that there was a time when they were separated because he habitually chose to use a Class C  drug .  She suggested that she did not know that her husband had some relatively minor criminal convictions.  Given that he undertook a community penalty of a number of hours of unpaid work, I find it most unlikely that she was unaware of his convictions and sentence. </span></p>

I also have to bear in mind that she is completely unfamiliar with the adversarial court process which she will have found extremely distressing.  After all, she has had to endure many days of evidence, much of it extremely unpleasant, about the death of her daughter.  Although we did our best to spare the parents from having to see the post-mortem photographs, the fact is that both parents have had to listen to many days of medical evidence, which have included evidence of possible sexual interference and injury.  As is well-known, and as juries are so often advised in criminal trials following the Lucas direction - which I read out when I&#160;read the quote from Baker J's case - people can lie for any number of reasons.  I cannot regard this mother&#8217;s lack of frankness about her marriage, or about her husband's behaviour, as evidence that she is involved in the sexual assault or murder of her daughter.  I am left, perhaps, with an evasive witness. </span></p>

The local authority have not presented any evidence to the effect that the mother was the perpetrator, rather their case is that she is one of the pool of perpetrators.  Crucially, the local authority have not suggested at any time during this case that the mother and father have conspired to tell lies to the court and, more importantly, it has not been suggested that they conspired to cover up a criminal offence.  I do not blame Mr&#160;Parker for not putting this, but the absence of the allegation speaks volumes about the lack of evidence against all of the alleged pool of perpetrators. </span></p>

Therefore, suggestions that she is an unsatisfactory witness must be aimed at discrediting her to the extent that she is herself a perpetrator.  Aside from her presence in the house when L probably died, there is nothing to incriminate her.  Telephone records show that she was on the telephone to her friend during the most likely period leading up to L's death.  We also know that she was in her bedroom, alone, with her infant who she was regularly breastfeeding.  The proposition that this mother of a  baby was in some way involved in the sexual assault and murder of her  daughter is a remarkable one that needs cogent evidence to support it.  In my judgment there is no evidence to support it.  I remind myself, again, that it was not put to her that she participated in a cover up of something that her husband or one of her two teenage sons had done. </span></p>

There is no doubt from everything that I have heard that the house was in absolute consternation once L&#8217;s body had been discovered.  There is plenty of evidence enabling me to find, and I do so find, that the mother was in extreme distress.  Indeed, I have listened to the 999 call, which would distress any listener.  It is evident that there was wailing and screaming and it is likely that this was the mother.  In fact, the telephone call was not completed because the phone was dropped or the call for some other reason lost.  As I have said earlier, each of us may react differently to extreme shock.  Mercifully, most of us receive no instruction or training in such events. </span></p>

I agree that the father was vague as to whether he had ever discussed his offences with his wife.  I agree that he was vague as to whether he and his wife had separated in 2008.  Mr Parker complains that the father attempted to introduce doubt as to his having locked the front door and back doors of the property, despite having never mentioned these concerns in the police investigation or in his witness statement.  I accept these criticisms of the father.  Furthermore, as I observed during the hearing, I noted that both the mother and the father were prepared to, as I put it, "jump on the bandwagon," when, for a time, it looked as though there was CCTV footage showing an intruder coming into the property.  In fact, the CCTV footage that we had, quite by chance from a nearby property, showed the father coming into the property and the reason why he had thought that it might not be him was because the clock on the CCTV camera was at least two hours fast, suggesting therefore that the father came into the property sometime well after midnight, which is a good two hours after he did in fact return.  It is completely clear, looking at the stills and the live footage, that the person who at one point it was thought might have been an intruder was, in fact, the father. </span></p>

Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or thee recollection of the person hearing or relaying the account.  The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

There is nothing at all to suggest that L was so depressed as to be suicidal, indeed the only evidence we have about L&#8217;s well-being is that she was fit and a happy and healthy young girl.  Moreover, we have the evidence of Dr Cary that suicide among girls of this age is extremely rare.  Whilst he does not give evidence as a psychiatrist, I am, in my judgment, entitled to take note of that broad (and in court unchallenged) proposition. But my main focus on L and the prospects of suicide is founded in all of the evidence as to her general wellbeing.  I cannot, of course, hard as it is for the family to hear this, exclude the possibility that she was being sexually preyed upon by a male unknown to us.

I cannot exclude the possibility of suicide, albeit that in my judgment it is the least likely of the three possibilities.  I bear in mind that all of those who initially attended the scene took the view that this was a tragic accident and that is a view that pertained until Dr Cary&#8217;s report.

Doing the best that I&#160;can, I find that the possibility of suicide is about 10 per&#160;cent, and the possibility of accident and a perpetrated act are about 45 per&#160;cent each.  It would be wrong for anyone to regard these figures as in any way accurate, for of course they are not.  They persuade me, however, that the local authority has not discharged the burden of proof which is upon it.  I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that this was a perpetrated act, albeit that I recognise that it is one of three possibilities.  On the basis, however, that I do not discard the least probable and then allow a competition between the other two options, but that I should look at each of the alternative possibilities and aggregate them together, I am quite satisfied that the burden of proof in this case is not discharged.  Accordingly, I do not find that the local authority&#8217;s case is proved in respect of any of the contested issues.  By application of the binary principle, it is the finding of this court that neither the father, the mother, M or N are responsible for a sexual assault on L and nor are they responsible for her death.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">In this case, the police have repeatedly indicated that they intended to issue a PII application but appear never to have done so.  I say "appear" because I cannot exclude the possibility that they have made such an application to another judge, and that may properly happen in some cases, but so far as I and all counsel in this case are concerned, such an application has not been made and no order for PII granted.  Indeed, under pressure from me to make an application for immunity or some other reason for non-disclosure, or otherwise to disclose the material, ultimately the police disclosed all of the material that they had at one point resisted disclosing.  There is no doubt that, in this case, the very late disclosure almost derailed this case into an adjournment.  It was clear to all, given that L died in November 2016, that the case could not endure further delay.  I am aware that the late disclosure has placed almost intolerable pressure on all of the lawyers in this case and the teams that sit behind them.  I am equally sure that it will have caused great distress and the possible appearance of unfairness to the parents and to M and N. </span></p>
