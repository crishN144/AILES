A was born in the early summer of 2012 and is now approximately six years old. As I said in my Judgment within the care proceedings, no assessment of damages in respect of A could be made now since it is impossible to know, at this stage, the extent of the losses that he has suffered or may yet suffer as a consequence of the HRA breaches. </p>

In paragraph 53 of my February 2017 Judgment, I set out eight significant failures for which Northamptonshire County Council were responsible.  I made clear in that Judgment that I was not determining the HRA applications, but plainly my findings as to the extent of the breaches by the local authority led to the sensible compromise of the applications by the mother and the father.  Given that the Judgment which I am now dealing with is in respect of matters of principle in relation to costs, rather than detailed facts, it is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to repeat here the substance of those breaches.  </p>

The Legal Aid Agency confirmed its view that the statutory charge arising from the care proceedings would apply to Human Rights Act damages so recovered. In this case the Human Rights Act claims were brought under Section 7(1)(b) of the Human Rights Act, that is, within the care proceedings, but with freestanding pleadings.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As referred to in para 4 above the Human Rights Act claims brought respectively by the mother and the father against Northamptonshire County Council have now been compromised.  As I have outlined above, prior to that compromise, a significant issue arose as to the extent to which, if at all, the statutory charge applied in respect of the costs incurred by the mother, the father and the child within the care proceedings. These were long and complicated care proceedings with a hearing lasting some 10 days.  It is axiomatic that the costs that had been incurred within the care proceedings were so large that they would obliterate any damages recovered by the parents (and in due course the child A) within their Human Rights Act claims if the statutory charge was to apply. The moral injustice arising out of such a situation is palpable: claimants who have been appallingly let down by a local authority would find themselves recovering money from a public body with one hand only to give it back to another public body with the other hand. I am very pleased to see that this obvious injustice has now been corrected, provided that appropriate guidance is followed. I note that in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">(A Minor) v Northamptonshire <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/282" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 282 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 282 (Fam)</ref></span>, Keehan J issued an invitation to the Lord Chancellor at paragraph 123 when he said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I question whether the time has come to exclude a child&#8217;s and/or parents&#8217; HRA claim for damages from the application of the statutory charge in relation to costs incurred in connected public law proceedings within the meaning of LASPO. This is of course solely a matter for the Lord Chancellor.&#8221;</span> I am pleased that the Legal Aid Agency, on behalf of the Lord Chancellor, has now answered this question and explained his position. The Legal Aid Agency has informed the Court when this Judgment was circulated in draft that it has undertaken a review of a number of other cases where this issue has arisen since April 2017 (&#8216;legacy&#8217; cases) in order to remedy any previous cases in which the statutory charge has wrongly been interpreted as applying in relation to damages awarded for breach of human rights. Obviously it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment in relation to those legacy cases other than to note that in cases which are similar to the instant case, obvious injustices should now be cured. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Since that time the Legal Aid Agency wrote to the three firms representing respectively the mother, father and child in the care proceedings, explaining that, if the damages under the HRA were obtained on a freestanding basis, the operation of the statutory charge would depend on what costs were being claimed from the Lord Chancellor in respect of the HRA proceedings or dispute. If the answer was nothing, there was nothing to protect by way of the statutory charge.  On that basis, the Legal Aid Agency invited all three firms and counsel to provide an undertaking that they would not claim in respect of any costs incurred in connection with the HRA claim under their client&#8217;s legal aid certificate for the care proceedings. On the basis of the undertakings received, and the assumption that the recovery of the damages would take place outside the care proceedings, the Legal Aid Agency confirmed that the statutory charge would not arise in respect of the care costs. The Legal Aid Agency accordingly wrote to the claimants on 20 December 2017 to explain that, given the assurances provided, the cost of the care proceedings would not form part of the statutory charge, and that it is only the costs of the HRA proceedings or dispute to which the statutory charge will attach. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In the light of the number of cases where related issues have arisen, the Legal Aid Agency gave further and detailed consideration to the issue of when the statutory charge would arise in cases involving HRA damages claims arising out of care proceedings and has amended its approach in cases where damages were sought outside of the care proceedings, leading to the undertakings referred to above being sought. The outcome is that the parties are agreed that the claimant&#8217;s application for declaratory relief should be withdrawn with no order as to costs. This is because the Legal Aid Agency has now finalised its review of issues relating to the application of the statutory charge to HRA damages arising out of care proceedings. As I set out at the commencement of this Judgment, the Legal Aid Agency will now publish a position statement relating to the application of the statutory charge and, by agreement of all parties, I append to this Judgment a copy of that position statement which will act as guidance to parties in future similar cases. </p>

For the avoidance of doubt, where the HRA claim is completed outside of the care or other family law proceedings the costs of the HRA claim itself, if sought to be claimed from the LAA, will constitute a statutory charge.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The statutory charge operates to recover legal aid expenditure where property or money is recovered or preserved by a legally aided individual, but a claim for legally aided costs is maintained in relation to the proceedings or dispute. Such a claim will arise where the individual has not fully recovered costs from another party to the proceedings or dispute. Particular difficulties have arisen where claims for HRA damages have been made within care or other family law proceedings as to whether all of the care costs should be included in the statutory charge. The costs of care or other family law proceedings will generally not be recovered in full from the local authority and they are likely to be so high in comparison with the HRA damages that a statutory charge would absorb most or all of those damages.  </span></p>

If the LAA is asked to give an early indication as to whether the statutory charge will apply to any HRA damages in these circumstances, it will request undertakings from the provider and counsel in the care proceedings that they will not make a claim for costs in respect of any HRA work carried out as part of the care or other family law proceedings. Once the undertakings have been received, the LAA will be able to confirm that the statutory charge will not extend to the legally aided care costs. Note that, unless a certificate or amendment to a certificate specifically authorising an HRA claim has been granted, there could be no valid claim for such costs in any event. </span></p>
