		</authorialNote><span style="font-style:italic">. There was a large difference between taking account of a child&#8217;s view and doing what the child wanted, but there was a growing understanding of the importance of listening to children involved in children&#8217;s cases. In most cases an interview with a CAFCASS Officer would be sufficient, but in other cases it might be necessary for the judge to hear the child, especially if the child had requested this. Only in a few cases would full scale legal representation be necessary, but wherever it seemed likely that the child&#8217;s views and interests might not be properly presented to the court, in particular if there were legal arguments which the adult parties were not putting forward, the child should be appropriately represented. Brussels II revised required the court to address at the outset whether and how the child was to be given the opportunity of being heard and there was no reason why this should not happen in non-European cases as well; the more uniform the practise the better, and the earlier the issue of the child&#8217;s views was addressed, the less likely that the issue would cause delay. </span></p>

It does not imply that the child ought to be heard in every case. It was pointed out, with good reason, that it is not always in the interest of the child to have to give an opinion, in particular if the two parents are in agreement on the measure to be taken. <span style="font-weight:bold">It is only where the failure to hear the child is contrary to the fundamental principles of procedure of the requested State that this may justify a refusal of recognition</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">(my emphasis) </span>but no distinction should be made on this point according to whether the measure is taken in the framework of a judicial procedure or an administrative procedure.

It is the child, more than anyone else, who will have to live with what the court decides. Those that do listen to children understand that they often have a point of view which is quite distinct from that person looking after them. They are quite capable of being moral actors in their own right. Just as the adults may have to do what the court decides whether they like it or not, so may the child. But that is no more reason for failing to hear what the child has to say than it is for refusing to hear the parents' views.</span></p>
