	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings concern four children: AA now aged over 16 years old; BA aged over 10 years old; CA aged under 10 years old; and DA aged under 5 years old.  The proceedings have been extremely lengthy and difficult having commenced just over 2 years ago. Indeed, they have been extraordinary in many ways beyond just their length: the number of hearings; the level of intervention and oversight required by the court; the overwhelming volume of emails, letters, documents and statements filed with the court; the highly unusual but firm refusal by Mr and Mrs A to engage in any court-directed assessments until the latter part of proceedings due to their suspicion and lack of trust in the Local Authority; the challenges posed by Mrs A&#8217;s fluctuating health; the allegations and concerns surrounding the Local Authority&#8217;s conduct; and the need &#8211; on the basis of the Local Authority&#8217;s own application after the oral evidence of the then allocated social worker, Ms Owen - to adjourn the first part of the final hearing in September 2021, to, in effect, try and start again and &#8216;re-set&#8217; their relationship with the parents.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">At this adjourned final hearing, the Local Authority, supported by the Guardian, seek final care orders for BA, CA and DA with a final care plan that the children remain placed at home with their parents. AA&#8217;s proceedings have concluded on no order.  The Local Authority have been represented by Ms Kirstie Danton leading Tom Duggan.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Proceedings were issued on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2020 alongside an application by Stoke on Trent City Council for a High Court declaration regarding the admission of AA to hospital for investigation and treatment of what was believed by professionals to be an urgent life-threatening skin condition. Mr Justice Hayden made a declaration with respect to A&#8217;s medical treatment on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2020. Proceedings for A&#8217;s younger siblings were heard by this court the following week. An interim care order was made on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August 2020 with the children remaining at home pending a further hearing on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August. On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2020 the parents were arrested, and the children removed by the Local Authority in highly contentious circumstances. Sadly, Mrs A became seriously unwell upon her arrest and the interim contested hearing as to the necessity and proportionality of continued separation was adjourned a number of times, until HHJ Davies sanctioned ongoing separation for the reasons set out in her judgment of December 2020. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">There then followed several months of extremely difficult litigation.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">BA, CA and DA were reported to have settled well in foster care but contact between BA and his parents completely broke down in October 2020 and CA&#8217;s contact was limited and sporadic. The Local Authority&#8217;s position was that the children were simply refusing to attend. These problems were exacerbated by COVID and issues regarding whether Mr A should wear a face mask within the children&#8217;s contact centre: an issue which dominated a number of hearings in the early part of 2021. By the time of the final hearing, the Local Authority were reporting that BA was expressing clear resistance to returning home.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr and Mrs A have throughout proceedings felt hugely aggrieved by what they perceive to be the unlawful removal of their children by the Local Authority on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2020. From the outset of proceedings, they have vehemently denied all threshold allegations made against them. They were further aggrieved by the outcome of a cognitive functioning assessment of Mrs A carried out by Dr Allen in September 2020. They have thereafter refused to participate in any assessments within these proceedings, save for the parenting assessment by the ISW, which was directed after the first failed attempt at a final hearing in September 2021. They clearly perceive themselves to be in a battle with the Local Authority to prove their innocence.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">As already noted, the first attempt at a final hearing came before me in September 2021 and was adjourned at the Local Authority&#8217;s request. Since last September I am pleased to say that matters have moved on quite significantly. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">AA, given her age and firm opposition to remaining in Local Authority care, returned home at the conclusion of that first final hearing. She immediately settled well and was reported to be much happier. She sadly suffered a flare up of her skin condition in the Autumn of 2021 but continued to engage with her treating clinical team and happily her health has now stabilised again. Her education has not been so stable, with it not being possible to achieve a reintegration into mainstream education. She now receives private tutoring at home. In April of this year the ICO was, however, discharged and proceedings concluded on no order, it being accepted by the Local Authority that given her age and absolute refusal to engage with the Local Authority there was no purpose in them sharing parental responsibility for her. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">DA was also able to return home in November 2021. Given his young age he had been much less affected by the removal and was able to maintain contact with his mother throughout the proceedings. Although the court was clear that the interim threshold under s 38 remained satisfied on the grounds of medical and educational harm, it was accepted by all parties that there was no basis on which continued separation could be deemed necessary and proportionate. DA&#8217;s rehabilitation home was successful. He is thriving, regularly attending nursery and the Local Authority have no concerns about the care he is receiving. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The situation with BA and CA has been much more complex. Re-establishing contact with Mr and Mrs A was challenging, with their respective foster carers reporting quite extreme emotional reactions to attempts to progress the contact arrangements, such that the Local Authority made an application under s 34(4) in December 2021 to suspend sibling contact and pause attempts to re-establish contact pending therapeutic intervention with the children. That application was withdrawn by the Local Authority at the hearing in December, and contact was finally re-established in January of this year. Matters then progressed quickly with CA moving into the care of BA&#8217;s foster parents and rehabilitation home achieved in February of 2022. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The very significant issue which has prevented these proceedings concluding in what might have been an entirely consensual way has been the refusal of BA and CA since their return home to attend school or to engage in any way with the social work team. The reasons for the children&#8217;s behaviours and how the issues may be successfully resolved now lie at the heart of the remaining dispute between the Local Authority and Mr and Mrs A. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority, supported by the Guardian, are deeply concerned that the children are not in school and at the deterioration in the relationship between Mr and Mrs A and the social work team since the children were rehabilitated to their care. They say there are deficiencies in the parenting of Mr and Mrs A which caused the children significant harm, with an ongoing risk that the children&#8217;s needs, holistically understood, will not be met in Mr and Mrs A&#8217;s care. The Local Authority and Guardian remain concerned at the lack of insight and understanding demonstrated by Mr and Mrs A into those issues, most notably around but not exclusively with respect to education, and say the only way to provide the children with the crucial support and services they need, and ensure they are receiving a satisfactory education, is by the making of final care orders. The Local Authority&#8217;s position is that a final care order will ensure the children can continue to receive educational and therapeutic support as Looked After Children with robust oversight and monitoring by the Local Authority and, if necessary, employing their overriding parental responsibility to ensure those needs are met. The threat remains that if parents fail to engage, the Local Authority will need to reconsider their current support for placement of the children at home. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr and Mrs A, on the other hand, vehemently believe that the Local Authority are solely responsible for the harm and trauma that has been caused to their family since the children were &#8216;unlawfully&#8217; removed. They have said clearly to the court that they will not continue to work with the Local Authority.  In short, they say enough is enough. The Local Authority&#8217;s ongoing intervention into their lives is, they say, oppressive and a source of ongoing anxiety and distress both for them and the children. They do not accept that there are, or have been, any deficits in their own parenting which has led or contributed to the children&#8217;s current difficulties.</p>

The court makes that observation acutely aware of how tempting it might be to make a care order in such circumstances, when one is fully aware of the reality of the resourcing constraints on local authorities, the prioritisation of resources that result and the court is anxious to ensure the child in the individual case has the support and services he or she so clearly needs. </p>

Although she also accepted that she did not say in explicit terms to either Mr A or AA that AA&#8217;s condition may be life-threatening, the court is satisfied on her evidence that she made very clear that this was a serious condition and admission and treatment was required as an emergency. The agreement that AA could go home on &#8216;ward release&#8217; was not the preferred plan but they were seeking to try and work with AA and Mr A. She was also clear that Mr A did not seek to assist the medical team in encouraging AA to accept the need for examination, admission and treatment.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Finally, Dr Kunnath provides a paper review of AA. He notes that she was diagnosed with psoriasis with erythroderma, psoriatic arthritis, anaemia and ectropian. He explains that anaemia is very common in chronic inflammatory conditions and can occur without iron deficiency. In AA&#8217;s case her anaemia was compounded by iron deficiency. Ectropian is a condition where the lower eye lids droop downwards and outward causing difficulty in closing the eye. Chronic exposure of the cornea without treatment has the potential to cause excessive drying and inflammation of the cornea leading to scarring and severe and permanent visual problems.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Significantly, Dr Kunnath notes that, on the whole, there is no evidence to suggest that AA&#8217;s global physical needs were not met prior to hospital admission. He identified no developmental problems. However, Dr Kunnath concludes that by going against medical opinion when she presented to the hospital on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2020 Mr and Mrs A exposed her to significant risk. Her skin condition could have led her to significant morbidity and even mortality if timely medical treatment was not instituted and delayed treatment of arthritis could have led to damage to joints causing deformity and chronic disability. Ectropian if left untreated could potentially lead to corneal scarring and severe and permanent visual problems. </p>

The last home visit in which the children were present was conducted in May 2016 and the education was considered to be suitable. No concerns were noted. Mr and Mrs A have subsequently provided information and evidence of work when requested.

Mr and Mrs A provided examples of work from GD, AA, BA and CA which was discussed with parents. Following that visit Ms Softly concludes that Mr and Mrs A appear to have provided a full-time education for the children and have paid attention to literacy and numeracy. She notes that the children have also undertaken learning in areas such as science, geography, history, French and design technology and have incorporated educational visits into their learning. They have also grown vegetables as part of that learning. It is noted that Mr and Mrs A provided a range of age-appropriate equipment and there was evidence of progression in some areas of learning and in some of the work seen. Ms Softly, however, concludes that to develop deeper learning in literacy and numeracy and to be in line with their peers, the educational provision would need to strengthened and specialist subject knowledge would be required. </p>

The court observes in light of her evidence that the system for monitoring the suitability of home education appears quite fundamentally flawed. Educational review officers have no power to directly work with or assess home-educated children and they are thus dependent on what they are told by parents as to the education being provided. Furthermore, they cannot compel parents to engage with them. The parents must be willing to share the information requested. It is an entirely reactive system.</p>

In his opinion, BA has developed skills when in the care of his parents to mask displaying negative emotions to try and meet his needs. He notes that Mr A has been described as intimidating and overly authoritarian and that the Bible was used for discipline purposes with passages read out regarding being &#8216;judged&#8217; and &#8216;Satan&#8217;. In his opinion, this is likely to have contributed to BA&#8217;s visibly anxious presentation whilst instilling in him a significant fear of failure. If BA considers he has failed to live up to these high expectations he has engaged in low level self-harming. </p>

He observes that by invalidating a child&#8217;s experience of negative emotions and restricting their expression of such, children do not learn how to appropriately manage or regulate their feelings and that can lead to harmful ways of coping, adapting and acquiring a positive sense of self.      </p>

She seeks predictability and control. He notes that she goes to great lengths to mask feelings of anxiety and presents as overly compliant and conforming. He considers her to be quite cognitively rigid and has difficulty deviating from the rules. He notes that this is an attachment strategy some children employ to keep themselves safe. In his opinion these attachment strategies have been developed in the care of her parents, as an attempt to appease the adults, but unfortunately make her extremely vulnerable to exploitation by others. She is poorly equipped with the necessary skills to keep herself safe. He also notes that CA has been programmed into traditional female roles which again exposes her to exploitation if she has learned that her voice is not significant, and she must simply accept the social reality perceived by her parents. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In terms of the impact of removal on the children, he acknowledges that the process of removal will have been distressing. However, in his opinion that is unlikely to have caused significant mental trauma to the children, because they were moving from an environment where their key care and attachment needs were not met, to a safe, nurturing environment more conducive to meeting their needs. Furthermore, he gave oral evidence that it was not one event that had led to their presentation with features of PTSD but repeated experiences over a significant period of time.    </p>

Typically, for children with these attachment types, he explains that the caregivers have not met their needs and they have learnt that displaying negative emotions will not lead to comfort and care but make things worse. They thus adopt alternative strategies to attempt to have their needs met i.e. CA always happy and smiling.  </p>

He noted the right of children to develop their own identities and to define themselves, and questioned the extent to which Mr and Mrs A were able to promote the children&#8217;s own developing autonomy, freedom and choices. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Professor Wilcox is an experienced expert witness who is fully cognisant of the limits of his role.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in">It is clear that Professor Wilcox was sent only a limited bundle due to the voluminous nature of the documentation filed. It was not clear what exactly he had been sent and read from Mr and Mrs A. He was not of course instructed to assess the parents, but neither was he able to speak to them at all regarding their perception of the issues and the children&#8217;s presentation. The assessment was therefore unbalanced in that it was overly reliant on the account provided by the LA.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in">In reaching his conclusions, it is clear that Professor Wilcox has relied on information provided by the LA that is fiercely disputed by Mr and Mrs A and has not been evidentially established within the proceedings. For example, in reaching the conclusion that the children have developed type A attachment strategies and are unable to develop individual autonomy and identity, reference is made to Mr A as an authoritarian, disciplinarian who uses the bible to threaten and control the children and instil within them a fear of failure. That characterisation of Mr A has not been established on the evidence &#8211; and is not the court&#8217;s experience of him or his relationship with Mrs A and AA. It is also significant that the LA have not pursued a number of their original threshold findings against Mr and Mrs A, including that Mr A was physically violent to BA. In the court&#8217;s assessment, the threshold allegations as originally drafted but subsequently withdrawn by the Local Authority influenced Professor Wilcox&#8217;s understanding of the children&#8217;s home lives prior to removal and [wrongly] informed his ultimate conclusions.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in">It is indeed significant that the depiction of the children&#8217;s lived experiences which runs through Professor Wilcox&#8217;s analysis is contradicted by what BA and CA say about Mr A to Professor Wilcox. Indeed, it is fair to observe that CA and BA say nothing of concern regarding either parent during the assessment. To the contrary, BA says that nobody in his family gets too angry or violent and describes his father as somebody who listens to him. It is also notable that in addition to the children making no concerning &#8216;disclosures&#8217; about their family, the children do not appear to have returned any concerning scores on the psycho-metric testing (largely being average on most indicators) &#8211; all of which, rather than being taken as evidence that the children were presenting as relatively stable and well-adjusted, appears to have been interpreted as the children &#8216;faking good&#8217; and not being able to express negative thoughts and feelings. </p>

Dr Sadavarte said she didn&#8217;t know if the children&#8217;s apprehension could be because the children are completely isolated from the world but felt it was important to get the opportunity to talk to the children alone. She expressed the view that Mr A is quite over powering which makes it difficult to take the children away from the parents and speak with them separately. Dr Sadavarte did not believe that the children would open up straight away anyway.</p>

In considering risk to the other children, they took into account various impact factors that may be indicative of sexual abuse: that the family were isolated, transcient, withdrawn from services, displayed mistrust and hostility to authority and were obstructive towards professionals. There was an absence of the usual professional safeguards with eyes on the children such as teachers and nurses. The children were not engaging or talking and would look to parents before they spoke. The presentation of AA at the hospital: scared, refusing to undress and apply creams and her wish for her father to stay with her were all indicators of abuse. They also weighed the fact that Mr A was being obstructive and refused to open the door to the social workers on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July and refused to say where the children were on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July. </p>

She has filed numerous statements within the proceedings and was the author of the Local Authority&#8217;s first final evidence, albeit her welfare analysis and recommendations have now been superceded. Her evidence, particularly at the early stages of proceedings, remains important to matters of threshold and in understanding the dynamics of the relationship between the Local Authority and Mr and Mrs A. She gave lengthy oral evidence at the first final hearing.</span></p>

The concerns set out within the initial SWET focused on the parents&#8217; failure to secure medical treatment for AA. With respect to the other children of the family, the SWET explained that the Local Authority had only very limited information. They were aware of two previous referrals to the Local Authority in 2016: one from the NSPCC resulting in an Early Help Plan, and one from a health visitor in North Wales. The Local Authority&#8217;s concerns effectively amounted to the fact that the children appeared to be &#8216;invisible&#8217; because they did not attend school or engage in health services. It is noted that they are believed to be very religious and live an isolated, alternative lifestyle. DA is described as dirty and BA and CA as not speaking.</span></p>

AA&#8217;s bottom eyelids were hanging forward and looked to be swollen. Her hands were purple and blue; again these were swollen in comparison to the rest of what could be seen of her frame. Her fingernails were peeling, with thick, dark blood around and underneath them. AA&#8217;s skin that could be seen on her face, neck and hands was beetroot in colour, her skin was peeling, flaking and scabbed in places. AA was physically shaking throughout the time that she was in the room.

She notes, under a care order, parents are legally required to follow the recommendations and instructions of the local authority in respect to the children, thus ensuring their care and safety. The disadvantages of a care order are acknowledged: care orders at home can become oppressive for families, who have been deemed good enough to have their children remain in their care; and the level of social care involvement can also be intrusive.</p>

Yellow House advised parents that they needed to be encouraging the children to attend and the children needed to be walking onto the school grounds daily. They should not be given the option of staying at home. The therapist advised rather than just accepting the refusal, the parents need to work through the children&#8217;s anxiety with them, constantly reassuring them that they are safe.

She did not give oral evidence. She states that the local authority were hoping to conclude proceedings with BA, CA and DA being made subject to supervision orders. She notes that if children are at home with their parents a care order should not be needed. However, she states that after careful consideration the local authority no longer deem this a viable option as parents have failed to engage fully with the local authority whilst the children have been subject to interim care orders and there remain a number of significant issues regarding the care afforded to them. She therefore argues that there are exceptional circumstances in this case. In particular, Ms Chell believes the behaviour of Mr and Mrs A since the children have returned to their care demonstrates they would under no circumstances work with the Authority under a supervision order.</p>

She says it is the absence of the parents&#8217; fundamental ability and understanding to work collaboratively with the Authority in the best interests of the children that necessitates the sharing of parental responsibility.

It is clear to the court that both Mr and Mrs A have been completely devastated and traumatised by the events of the last two years and in the case of Mrs A it has had a very significant impact on her own health. It is important as professionals we do not lose sight of just how utterly devastating it is to have a child removed from your care. This court was particularly struck by Mr A&#8217;s description of returning from the police station at midnight on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2020 to find his wife in hospital and his four youngest children all gone.

It was at times very difficult to get Mrs A to answer the question. She was often defensive and avoidant. Mr A was similarly defensive and frequently gave only short grudging answers in cross-examination. There are clearly matters Mr and Mrs A cannot and will not accept and on those matters their views remain fixed and rigid &#8211; even if that has been at the children&#8217;s expense and has compromised the children&#8217;s best interests. For example, their absolute refusal to engage in court directed assessments within these proceedings due to their distrust of the Local Authority may well have led to a situation in which the children could not be rehabilitated home. It was not child-centred. In a situation where threshold is crossed and thus significant harm found, the court needs to understand whether parents can provide safe care for the children moving forwards. As difficult as it may be for parents to put aside their own views and feelings, in order for the court to make safe welfare decisions in such a situation, it needs to be properly informed by evidence; that means assessment. The parents&#8217; decision not to engage in assessment is clearly a decision the parents are entitled to make. It is not however one that prioritises the children&#8217;s need for timely and properly informed decision-making. The absence of any welfare evidence to counter threshold findings of significant harm, also risked the children remaining in care by default. </p>

They demonstrate no acceptance or understanding of the educational delay and poor outcomes suffered by all of the children and how that might impact on their life choices and opportunities. In the face of clear evidence before the court that the children are performing well below age expected levels, they nevertheless remained firm and fixed in their view that the education they provided was adequate and the children were performing in line with their age and ability. On those matters they have not been able to demonstrate a capacity to reflect and re-evaluate and to acknowledge any responsibility for the harm their views and actions may have caused the children. That gives the court considerable concern as to Mr and Mrs A&#8217;s understanding as to why it is important for BA and CA to be receiving their education in school and the genuineness of their commitment to ensuring that happens.  </p>

That said, the Guardian believes that &#8216;on the ground&#8217; parents are able to work with professionals and their refusal to engage may well change and improve when the court proceedings conclude and matters settle. </p>

Ms Evans confirmed that she was very concerned how AA had been left in such a serious condition and medical attention not sought sooner. It was her understanding that the skin was a major organ and was breaking down and that this could affect her other organs and be life threatening. </p>

She does not, however, consider that to be the case. In her professional opinion, his presentation and expressed feelings were genuine and he was not unhappy.

She describes BA as &#8216;hungry for education&#8217; and that he has grown in self-confidence and self-esteem. Ms Evans is anxious to make clear that she is not saying what education should look like. She recognizes that not every child needs to be in school. But she says that in this case parents have reached the limit of what they can provide.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">As to the possibility of no order, the guardian observes that Mr and Mrs A have experienced difficulties in ensuring the school attendance of BA and CA. It is her view that when BA first returned home, parents supported his decision to be home educated, despite the clear expectation of all professionals and the court that he would continue at the first primary school. She says Mr and Mrs A expressed to her their concern that Mr A would be accused of being &#8216;controlling&#8217; if he intervened against BA&#8217;s wishes. In her opinion, parents struggle to understand that they need to exercise parental responsibility and enforce appropriate structure and boundaries. They cannot deflect that responsibility to simply let BA and CA do as they wish. Ms Evans suggests there is a commonality with what happened regarding AA&#8217;s hospital admission in July 2020. The challenge for parents is that BA and CA are not the same children who were removed. She is concerned that Mrs A in particular is struggling with a defiant and willful BA who will not do as his parents wish. </p>

Ms Evans accepts that a care order for BA, CA and DA is an interference in their family life and is stressful for Mr and Mrs A. However, it is her view that without the ongoing involvement of the Local Authority the children will suffer and not meet their potential, not only as regards their education, which will limit their future job opportunities, but also in terms of their emotional well-being and developing social skills. She acknowledges that a care order represents a high level of intervention but in the Guardian&#8217;s view it is proportionate to the serious concerns that brought this matter into proceedings in July 2020, and necessary and proportionate given where matters currently stand. There is in her view still significant work required to support the children back into school and that process needs robust professional involvement and oversight. That requires in her view the structure of a care order with PEP reviews, LAC reviews and the oversight of the IRO. It will also ensure the ongoing therapeutic support of Yellow House.</p>

It is perhaps concerning that she did not make more robust challenge to the manner of the children&#8217;s initial removal against her professional recommendations at the time and did not do more to interrogate the tone it set for the relationship between the Local Authority and the parents thereafter. Similarly, the Local Authority&#8217;s conduct in vaccinating the children in the manner they did against the parents&#8217; wishes should have raised very significant concerns and needed to be addressed.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In the months that followed, Ms Evans was not aware of the extent to which the Local Authority were exercising their parental responsibility to the total exclusion of the parents. In her oral evidence she accepted that she was not aware Ms Owen was not communicating directly at all with the parents and that the parents were not being included in decision-making; she said that she assumed that they were. It also transpired in the evidence that Ms Evans was also being excluded from decision-making. She told the court she was not made aware of the strategy meeting and was not aware of the Local Authority&#8217;s decision-making around AA and her contact with family members. Similarly, she said she was not aware that the children had been immunized against the wishes of the parents until after the event.  It must of course be accepted that the true extent of the issues with Ms Owen did not become apparent until Ms Owen gave evidence at the first final hearing. However, it is perhaps a fair criticism of the guardian that she could have done more to speak with the parents and gain a better and more balanced understanding from their perspective of their concerns regarding the Local Authority&#8217;s conduct and that of the social worker in particular. Ms Evans accepted she had only limited discussions with parents as her focus was on the children. </p>

In June 2021, the guardian&#8217;s and the child&#8217;s solicitor&#8217;s clear and firm position before the court (recorded in a recital) was that in their professional view AA did not have capacity to instruct her own solicitor. In contrast, the court&#8217;s view is that she very clearly and unequivocally did and that was immediately plain to the court when she was spoken to.  Again, the court is concerned as to why that issue was not more proactively grappled with by the children&#8217;s team, suggesting perhaps again an overly deferential approach to the Local Authority&#8217;s stance.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Turning to her final analysis, Ms Evans does identify the less interventionist measures available to the court, but in the court&#8217;s judgment she gives insufficient consideration to the advantages of such orders, and insufficient weight and consideration to the problems and disadvantages of a full care order. In the court&#8217;s assessment, the guardian&#8217;s support for a care order is very much driven by what support and services the children need and the care order being the vehicle to deliver them. The court has great sympathy with that approach but there are legitimate objections to justifying a care order on that basis, particularly in circumstances such as this where the care order is felt by parents as such an acutely oppressive and draconian measure and impacts so significantly on their sense of security and integrity as a family. In the court&#8217;s judgment, the disadvantages of a care order for this family given the particular history of this case, deserved more explicit, detailed and careful analysis in the balancing exercise. Although in her oral evidence Ms Evans said she had given careful consideration to whether it would be better for the family for the Local Authority to &#8216;back off&#8217;, she said she felt that it would result in the children not achieving their potential. In the court&#8217;s judgment more consideration should have been given to exploring alternative means by which the children could receive the support and services they clearly need without necessitating a care order. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">There is also with respect to Ms Evans a tension in her position. On one hand she says that the work still to be done with parents is so significant that it cannot be achieved other than with a care order in force. Yet, in response to concerns as to whether realistically parents will work with the Local Authority under a care order, she says that &#8216;on the ground&#8217; parents are able and willing to work with professionals. If that is the case, it is unclear why, assuming a supervision order can provide the children with the support and services they need, the lesser order would not suffice &#8211; unless the purpose of the care order is to provide the &#8216;stick&#8217; (with the ultimate threat of removal) to force the parents into compliance. In fact, the court&#8217;s assessment is somewhat different. The court&#8217;s view is that the parents are unlikely to continue to work with professionals as is now their fixed position unless there is a fundamental shift in their relationship with the Local Authority and the currently entrenched power dynamics are challenged and re-set. That will not be achieved by trying to do more of the same under a care order. </p>

I am satisfied that is in the best interests of the children and the necessary and proportionate legal order in light of the ongoing risks identified.

The court accepts that the hospital (and indeed her parents) would of course be careful to listen to AA&#8217;s wishes and feelings given her age and would not wish to impose treatment on her against her will (as was the evidence of Dr Wong), but that does not mean the hospital regarded her as Gillick competent nor that the parents could abdicate their own decision-making responsibilities to their daughter. The weight of the evidence is that the hospital engaged with Mr and Mrs A regarding AA&#8217;s treatment in the expectation that they would make the necessary decisions, as parents, to ensure she received the care she needed. They were not engaging with AA as if she was a Gillick competent child exercising her own autonomous decision-making powers.

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:1.04in"><span style="color:#161616">Clearly, whether the children have suffered medical neglect more generally feeds into the factual matrix underpinning this threshold allegation. However, in the court&#8217;s judgment, there is no evidence before the court that the children more generally have suffered harm or are likely to suffer significant harm as a result of neglect of their medical needs. There is evidence that Mrs A has engaged with ante-natal care and health visiting services, albeit she has declined some non-mandatory screening tests both ante- and post-natal. She has also declined some routine follow up checks, none of which have resulted in any actual harm to the children. DA did not have routine neonatal screening, but he has no current health concerns. CA was considered high risk for DDH and presented with a clicky hip, but again, although she did not attend a review appointment, there are no residual concerns. The younger children did not receive their full programme of vaccinations. It has not however resulted in any actual harm. Furthermore, the children have been registered with GPs and there is evidence of engagement with health services by all family members when needed.  The evidence from the children&#8217;s child protection medicals is that they are all healthy with no developmental health concerns. No actual harm has therefore materialized from non-engagement in these routine health programmes, and it is a difficult argument for the Local Authority to mount that a failure to engage in non-mandatory vaccinations and neo-natal testing establishes the likelihood of significant harm for the purposes of satisfying the s 31 threshold for state intervention into the family&#8217;s life. With particular regard to BA&#8217;s medical condition , the evidence of Dr Kunnath is that it is not clinically significant and the further medical condition  is not the likely cause of his speech difficulties, albeit it may have contributed to them.</span></p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:1.04in"><span style="color:#161616">As to the likelihood of future harm, there is evidence that medical treatment is sought by the parents when necessary. Mrs A clearly personally engages with NHS medical care when the issue is a significant one and treatment is needed. Similarly, medical attention has been sought for the children when they have presented with a serious condition. Thus, GD received the necessary medical treatment for his hernia in 2012/13 and assistance was sought for AA when her skin condition worsened in 2020. There is no reason to suppose Mr and Mrs A would not similarly seek medical treatment for BA, CA or DA if the illness or concern was a significant one, as opposed to one that could be managed with herbal/alternative remedies or those available from a pharmacy. </span></p>

When balancing those considerations, the court is satisfied there is no evidence that DA, CA or BA have suffered any actual harm as a result of neglect of their health needs, and, on balance, the Local Authority have failed to establish on the balance of probabilities the likelihood or real possibility of significant harm in the future. </span></p>

Moreover, the harm is most clearly seen and evidenced by the educational achievements of the older siblings, none of whom have any formal qualifications. Sadly, whilst it is not disputed they have obtained employment, it has limited their own life choices and opportunities. This is stark for AA. She is a bright girl who had the potential to achieve in whatever sphere she chose, but her desire, for example, to become a vet, has very clearly been seriously and perhaps irretrievably compromised by the home-education she received. </span></p>

This is not a matter of criticizing or blaming Mrs A who the court is sure did her best. The court notes the parents have always engaged with the home education service, complied with all requests made of them, and no concerns have ever been raised. Whilst the court is however troubled by the apparently flawed, entirely reactive nature of that service in providing monitoring and oversight of whether a home-educated child is receiving a suitable education, and the court has some sympathy with the argument that nobody ever said to Mr and Mrs A it wasn&#8217;t good enough, ultimately the responsibility to ensure a home-schooled child is receiving an education consistent with their &#8216;age, aptitude and ability&#8217;, rests with the parents who undertake to provide that education. Where the parents fail to provide an education that meets the children&#8217;s educational needs and harm is suffered, responsibility must rest with them.  </span></p>

They themselves report having covertly recorded professionals including Dr Wong before these proceedings even commenced. They similarly report having recorded social workers and telephone calls without the Local Authority&#8217;s knowledge prior to and throughout proceedings. In recent weeks they have reverted to similar conduct, threatening to record staff from the first primary school if they attended at the family home. If Mr and Mrs A were recording professionals even before proceedings commenced, it reveals an entrenched mindset of distrust and suspicion. The court also notes the complaints made by Mr and Mrs A against both the GP and doctors at the Royal Stoke University hospital as AA&#8217;s health deteriorated and concerns escalated. Their initial response to the Local Authority social work team in the very early days of intervention can fairly be described as defensive, evasive and non-cooperative until the court intervened.</span></p>

In particular, the hostile approach adopted towards the GP and medical team at Stoke University Hospital contributed to a situation whereby the parents, rather than working with professionals to support and encourage AA to receive urgent medical treatment in her best interests, became distracted by making complaints and seeking to undermine the steps the treating clinical team were recommending as necessary. Similarly, the stance they adopted towards the Local Authority from the outset of proceedings and their absolute refusal to engage in any court directed assessments, whilst it may have been a stance they were entitled to take and arose at least in part from legitimate grievances with the Local Authority, came at the expense of the children&#8217;s welfare. It certainly did not further the interests of the children, greatly added to the difficulty and complexity of proceedings and risked creating a situation where rehabilitation home could not be supported on the evidence. </span></p>

Nevertheless, it is vitally important and there is a heavy responsibility on the Local Authority to ensure that the information it shares at key strategy meetings at which crucial decisions are made is as accurate and complete and as current as possible.

The court accepts that a Local Authority holding an interim care order must make suitable arrangements for the care of a child and that children who are subject to an interim care order cannot be &#8216;placed&#8217; by the Local Authority without a prior assessment for suitability. The court also accepts that a Local Authority holding an interim care order with the children placed at home can remove a child from the parents&#8217; care in an &#8216;emergency&#8217;, but subject to the guidance set out in <a href="https://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed130031" class="Strong" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal">Re DE (A Child)</a><span style="color:#000000"> [2014] EWFC 6, </span>to ensure procedural and substantive fairness to the parents. However, whilst the arrest of the parents clearly necessitated a need to make alternative care arrangements for the children, the Local Authority were not seeking to &#8216;place&#8217; the children but to arrange temporary emergency care whilst the parents were being interviewed. In my judgment, in such circumstances, much greater efforts should have been taken to explore whether FD and/or ED could provide that short-term care or whether other family members could be approached. It is clear that no efforts at all were made by the Local Authority to identify suitable alternative carers either in discussion with parents or the older siblings and that they arrived at the family home with a plan of removal. Neither was there any discussion with the police about staggering the interviews to avoid leaving the children without care. That again in my judgment fell short of what would be expected of the Local Authority, particularly in light of the concerns expressed by the Guardian and the Court on the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August about the potential harm to the children of an unplanned removal. </p>

The Local Authority&#8217;s conduct in failing to do so was in the court&#8217;s judgment a serious failing. Mr and Mrs A still shared parental responsibility and had a right to be consulted. Vaccinating the children was not urgent and given Mr and Mrs A&#8217;s principled objections to vaccination and that the Local Authority shared parental responsibility under an interim care order, Mr and Mrs A at least had an arguable case that the immunisations should await the final decisions of the court.

It was subsequently withdrawn. Similarly, the application made in December 2021 under s 34 to suspend both BA and CA&#8217;s contact with their siblings and the ongoing efforts to reinstate parental contact was made without balanced and robust scrutiny of the reported distress of the children and its possible causes and without the necessary anxious scrutiny of the very significant impact it would have at that stage of proceedings on the children&#8217;s family life with their parents and siblings.

However, there are a number of other credible possibilities which also need to be fairly explored: the children&#8217;s distress at leaving foster placement where they were happy and settled and the association between foster care and school; their understanding of their &#8216;old life&#8217; at home with parents where school did not feature and was not valued; confusion and anxiety caused by feeling they must demonstrate love and loyalty to their parents by rejecting anything associated with care; a basic fear of being away from parents and being removed again; and the need for the children to have space and time to adjust and settle. It is unquestionably an exceptionally complex picture but in the court&#8217;s judgment this multiplicity of potential reasons (which are not of course mutually exclusive) are not given equal weight and consideration by the Local Authority in their evidence. The default is that responsibility for these problems must lie with parents and that they are exerting a negative influence over the children, despite the acceptance by Ms Peers that the parents have engaged with the schools and Yellow House around the children&#8217;s attendance at school.</p>

Those accounts have been used to justify and explain the children&#8217;s refusal to attend school and to advance home schooling as an acceptable alternative. The evidence, including from the guardian, of the children&#8217;s experiences in foster care is all to the contrary. Mr and Mrs A do not seem to have considered that BA may well be experiencing and acting out the very same conflict of loyalties and stress that he demonstrated in the early weeks of foster care: not wanting to betray or upset his parents by expressing any sense that he was settled and enjoying aspects of his life in care, including most significantly school. His vehement opposition to mainstream schooling may be borne out of an attempt to please and reassure his parents of his loyalty to them.  In such circumstances they need to take the lead in making clear and unambiguous decisions whilst making BA feel safe to express his true feelings. </span></p>

Utilizing paid tutors, as parents have done for AA, may be an option for a period of time but the court would question whether that is realistic and sustainable for a family of modest means.

The children are refusing to engage with the social work team in any meaningful way so direct work and intervention with the children is not possible. The court observes that given the limitations on the social workers being able to directly engage with the children, the ICO has principally been used as a vehicle to organize and deliver services and support by others: Yellow House for therapeutic input and tutoring by the virtual school. The court notes that no direct work or support has been attempted by the social work team with the parents. </span></p>

On one hand confidence is expressed that the parents can be persuaded to continue to work with professionals as they have done with Ms Peers under an interim care order and the objections to doing so made so vocally in court are not borne out by their behaviours on the ground. On the other hand, they simultaneously advance a case for a care order which is based on the parents&#8217; non-engagement and non-cooperation and the necessity of a care order to secure it. It is wholly unclear to the court how simply doing more of the same under a final care order will shift this now increasingly entrenched dynamic. In the guardian&#8217;s view matters may settle once court proceedings conclude. In the court&#8217;s judgment that is overly optimistic.

There is some force in the argument that the dynamics of the Local Authority and parents&#8217; working relationship shifted after Ms Peers became the allocated social worker, but in my judgment the Local Authority have still too readily assumed when difficulties have arisen that responsibility must rest with the parents. Knee jerk reactions by the Local Authority and a somewhat unbalanced assessment of the evidence undermines confidence that the Local Authority will respond in a balanced and proportionate way to any future challenges. </span></p>

The guardian has identified additional benefits from the framework provided by a care order for delivering those services: a Personal Education Plan, LAC reviews and the oversight of the IRO. Parenting help and support can also be provided to assist Mr and Mrs A impose necessary structure and boundaries. However, returning to fundamental principles, a care order should not be justified on the basis that it is required to secure the delivery of services. All of these benefits, including a structure to provide for coordination, monitoring and review, should be available through a robust and bespoke supervision plan </span></p>

In the court&#8217;s judgment, given the vulnerabilities in the parenting capacities of Mr and Mrs A, no order would leave a clear gap in ensuring the children&#8217;s therapeutic and educational needs are met. Further support, monitoring and oversight is therefore necessary and proportionate to ensure the children are fully supported back into education, they receive the psycho-therapeutic intervention they need, and further significant harm is prevented.  </span></p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="color:#161616">The court is always anxious when making a supervision order that it will turn out to be a &#8216;toothless tool&#8217;. But this is not in the court&#8217;s judgment an inevitability. There is no reason why the Local Authority through the provision of a robust and detailed supervision plan cannot replicate in large part the same support and services they could provide under a care order. It may mean that due to commissioning barriers they cannot rely on Yellow House or the Virtual School to provide services moving forward, but funding can and should be made available to ensure alternative provision is provided under a supervision order.  Similarly, a structure can be created around the provision of that support to coordinate services and monitor progress; a structure which replicates in large part that which would be provided through a PEP or regular LAC reviews. </span></p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="color:#161616">A supervision order will of course require cooperation from Mr and Mrs A if it is to work. Its &#8216;voluntary&#8217; nature is often perceived as its most significant flaw.  However, the court hopes they will understand and accept the need for help and support to meet BA and CA&#8217;s needs and be willing to engage with the Local Authority to ensure they receive it. A supervision order, unlike a care order, will fundamentally reset the parents&#8217; relationship with the Local Authority and will signal a truly fresh and different approach. A supervision order begins from a premise of equal partnership between the parents and the Local Authority who do not acquire PR. The significant and oppressive threat of removal is removed. </span></p>

A supervision order of 12 months will allow for a focused, time-limited plan, with clearly defined goals. But ultimately if parents choose not to engage and progress is not made, if they do not remain true to their word regarding their commitment to supporting BA and CA back into school, they are very likely to face further applications for an extension of the order and even a fresh application for a care order.</span></p>

The Local Authority are to file a detailed supervision plan providing for the support and services the children require and a structure within the supervision plan for ongoing oversight and support.  </span></p>
