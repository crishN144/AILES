First, it must make an assessment or judgment whether such steps were not taken as &#8216;should reasonably have been taken&#8217;; but even if the court adjudges that they were not, that merely opens the door or gateway to the second stage and an overall exercise of discretion whether or not to recognise the overseas divorce.  [I propose to deal discretely with the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Golubovich v Golubovich <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2010/810" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Civ 810" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Civ. 810</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> as a separate heading near the end of this judgment.  At this point, I merely mention that I do not agree with, and indeed emphatically reject, the submission of Mr Aderemi in paragraphs 2 and 4 of his &#8216;Supplementary submissions re: recognition hearing&#8217; dated 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> July 2010 which he elaborated orally this morning, that the passage at paragraphs 67 to 69 of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Golubovich</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> is authority for the proposition that &#8216;regardless of which limb of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51 (3)</ref> is engaged, there is not an absolute discretion in this area or indeed a two staged test&#8217;.  In my view, the observations of Thorpe LJ at paragraphs 68 and 69 of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Golubovich</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> are expressly and very specifically confined to refusal of recognition under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51 (3)</ref> (c).  Thorpe LJ expressly refers at paragraph 68 to &#8216;the rare cases where the applicant&#8217;s reliance is on sub-<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51 (3)</ref> (c)&#8217;.  The point made at paragraph 69 is that the force of the word &#8216;manifestly&#8217; in that sub-paragraph is such that once the court has formed a proportionate judgment that recognition would be &#8216;manifestly contrary to public policy&#8217; the exercise of any residual discretion could only be one way &#8211; &#8216;refusal of recognition must follow&#8217;.  Quite different considerations apply to the policy and structure of cases falling within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51 (3)</ref> (a) and (b); and indeed if, in every case, whether falling under (a) or (b) or (c), there was no second stage discretion, the word &#8216;may&#8217; where it appears in the opening words of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51 (3)</ref> would properly read &#8216;shall&#8217;.]</span></p>

It is not simply a matter of &#8216;comity&#8217; or respect for the foreign court.
