In that case the application for a parental order had been made outside the time limit set out in the legislation.  The then President considered statutory interpretation in deciding that the court did have jurisdiction despite the expiry of the time limit.   Mr Justice Keehan decided that there was no reason why the approach taken by the then President in relation to a parental order could not be taken in an application for an adoption order.</p>

The local authority rule 14.11 report was very thorough and supported the application.  It set out that there were advantages and no disadvantages to an adoption order being made.  YCC took no issue with the failure to comply with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/44/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 44(3)</ref>, and the adoption social worker supported wholeheartedly the making of the order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was clearly in Z&#8217;s best interests throughout his life that an adoption order should be made. He had been adopted in Ukraine and believed that he was in the same legal position in this country.  He had been living with the applicant as a family member for 16 years, the applicant was married to his mother, and the applicant had had another child with the mother, W, Z&#8217;s half-sister.   The half-siblings had a close and loving relationship.  </p>

I was satisfied that it was by chance that the applicant and his family discovered that an adoption order made in Ukraine was not valid here.  It was luck that this came to light before Z was 18 &#8211; when it was likely to have been too late.  </p>

I respectfully agreed with the approach taken by Sir James Munby P and Keehan J.  </p>

Were I not to do so, Z would be denied the chance in this country to be part of his family, when he was so under the law of Ukraine.  I was satisfied that such an outcome would be an affront to public policy. </p>
