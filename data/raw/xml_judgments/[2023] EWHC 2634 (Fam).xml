	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns FD, who was born in February 1994 and is, therefore, now aged 29.  FD recalls that her earliest memory of anorexia was when she was about four or five years old.  FD&#8217;s first involvement with child and adolescent mental health services was when she was 12 years old.  Before she had reached her 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday, in 2007, FD had been admitted to X Hospital for naso-gastric (&#8216;NG&#8217;) feeding after she had stopped eating and drinking completely.  FD has been in one medical institution or another suffering from anorexia nervosa since that time.  This means that she has missed all of the usual adolescent and young adult experiences in life; she has missed the things that make life pleasurable for us as human beings.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Foundation Trust has been represented by Miss Emma Sutton KC and Mr Jake Rylatt.  Because of the issue of capacity, FD has been represented by the Official Solicitor, who, in turn, has instructed Natasha Lukies of Reeds Solicitors as her agent to visit FD and attempt to establish her wishes and feelings.  FD is represented in court in these proceedings by Miss Greaney KC.  FD&#8217;s parents are ED and TD.  They are divorced, but I have seen nothing but cooperation and family unity in my court and I am grateful to them for that. ED was accompanied at the hearing by FD&#8217;s twin sister, RD.  TD was accompanied at the hearing by FD&#8217;s younger sister, PD.  All of the family appeared online through the CVP link, with my consent, of course, rather than attending in person at court.  This was their choice and I am satisfied that through the CVP, they were able to join the proceedings and fully take part in them.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is, I suggest, impossible for anyone to imagine the emotion and the anguish which the family must be suffering, knowing that a possible (if not likely) consequence of acceding to the hospital&#8217;s application could be FD&#8217;s untimely death.  Unfortunately, neither TD nor ED have been represented and I say something about the issue of Legal Aid at the end of this judgment.  However, I am confident that the family have, at all times, been able to put questions to the relevant witnesses and they have said everything that could possibly have been said had they been represented.  RD and PD have put questions to the medical witnesses, as have each of their parents.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I discussed with counsel and with the family whether they would prefer to receive my decision at the outset of this judgment.  It must be almost impossible for a family in a situation such as this to listen to a judge laboriously going through the relevant legal principles, the competing arguments and only to receive his decision at the end of what is bound to be a fairly lengthy judgment.  Everyone has agreed that they would like to receive my decision at the outset of my judgment.  The Official Solicitor, on FD&#8217;s behalf, and all of the family now wish me to make the order which is sought by the Foundation Trust.  I met with FD last week and will say more about that meeting later in this judgment.  FD was anxious to convey to me her desperate wish to be allowed to make decisions about her own future, acknowledging, as she did, that that might even lead to her death.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, in these most tragic of circumstances, everyone agrees that I should make the order sought by the Foundation Trust.  It seems to me that it would be wrong, in the circumstances, for me to do anything other than to make the orders which are sought.  I make it clear now that I propose to make the order in the terms which have been requested by the Foundation Trust.  I am going to set out, obviously, in full my reasons for doing that, which cannot, of course, simply be that that is what everybody wants me to do.  I have come to the fully independent conclusion that it is the right thing to do.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I make this order knowing that it may have fatal consequences for FD, but also knowing that she regards her present existence as simply, to use her words, &#8220;torture&#8221;.  In other words, continuing with forced treatment is to subject her to a life of &#8220;torture&#8221;.  It is impossible for any of us to imagine how difficult it has been for the family to come to this decision.  The fact is, however, that, for 17 years, FD has been treated, often unwillingly, for her condition.  Before I do pause in a moment, I wish to say this.  I do not see this as a one-way street, with FD headed only towards an untimely end as her system shuts down through lack of nutrition.  Those who know her best, her family and those who have treated her for a significant period of time, particularly Dr A, hope and see a future for FD.  In this regard I was moved to hear, and I use this merely by way of what I regarded as an important example of hope, that Ms B at X Care Home where FD now lives has interested FD in English Literature and FD now even has her sights on the possibility of a GCSE in the subject.  Having read and seen what I have, I would see this as a triumph for FD and just possibly something that would give her the hope and the inspiration which has for so long been absent from her life. </p>

	  <num>9</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">A care plan has been put together for FD.  I have heard evidence from a number of witnesses, to which I shall, of course, return shortly, that there are very many options for FD should she choose to avail herself of them.  FD will be in the same place tomorrow, now that I have made this decision, as she is today.  She can stay at X Care Home.  If she is no longer detained under the Mental Health Act, as I believe will now be the case, she will have the autonomy to make the decisions now and not have them forced upon her.  In addressing the court, FD&#8217;s mother poignantly observed that it was not until FD was in the care and comfort of X Care Home that this application could really have been made.  FD will continue to receive nutrition through the NG tube.  FD was adamant when we met that she needs to be in charge of her own life.  There is no doubt that this wish of hers is shared by her twin sister RD, who said that FD was desperate to be treated as a person and not &#8220;as a piece of paper&#8221;.  This is also shared, as I have said, by her younger sister PD and by her parents.  The phrase about being a piece of paper was used by FD herself.  It has had an important impact on my impression of this case.  Whilst under compulsion of treatment and whilst under section, FD sees no hope for the future and only sees herself as being controlled, subject to unwelcome and inhumane treatment and allowed no opinion of her own and no control of her own destiny. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I also propose to continue the reporting restrictions order.  This case has been heard in open court, as is usual now in these Court of Protection cases, so that interested persons, people who follow legal cases, legal bloggers, and so forth, can observe the process.  However, in my judgement it is essential that the privacy of FD and her family is preserved.  I am also determined to preserve the privacy of the treating clinicians and the wonderful staff at X Care Home who are looking after FD.  Social media, these days, can produce unwanted attention, trolls and people who are determined to see bad where they should see good and to make mischief.  In my judgement, those people who work in this exceptionally difficult area of medicine, making incredibly hard decisions about young people suffering from extreme mental and psychological conditions, are entitled to have their privacy protected.  Unusually, therefore, I am going to make the reporting restrictions order in this case to be a permanent order.  I must, of course, give liberty to an interested person to apply to vary or discharge my order and I will ask for it to be provided in the order that they may do so, giving at least seven days&#8217; written notice.  Whilst I concede that there may be some public or legal interest in this case, there can be no public interest in identifying this particular family or this particular hospital or these particular treating clinicians and hard-working other medical staff.  Even if there were any public interest in revealing any of those identities, in my judgment, that public interest would be substantially outweighed by the family&#8217;s right to a private life and family life.  In particular, I bear in mind the impact that identification could have on FD and also on all of her family were there to be any identification.  </p>

But if, in due course, Mr Farmer, who is well-known in these courts, asks for a transcript of this judgment, he will be provided with an anonymised transcript, and I accept the very kind offer of Miss Sutton&#8217;s junior, Mr&#160;Rylatt, to have a first go at anonymisation.  Obviously, then that will have to be approved by both leading counsel and then, in due course, by me.  But I am, however, completely satisfied with Mr Farmer&#8217;s integrity.  He is very well-known in these courts and if he is given a copy of the unanonymised transcript with a copy of the reporting restrictions order, I know that he will, of course, abide by it.  </p>

Although I make it clear that I do not consider myself to have the power to order removal of the section, but my strong invitation that it should be removed is likely to be followed.  </p>

I do this, having heard very carefully presented arguments, out of respect for FD&#8217;s request for autonomy, out of respect for the wishes of her twin, her younger sister and her parents.  I do this because I have been persuaded that any further compulsory treatment and force-feeding and/or hydration would be futile, such a process having failed for some 17 years.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have had to recognise, as has every member of FD&#8217;s family, that the decision which I have made is replete with risk.  It carries the risk that FD will, to use her own words, &#8220;honour&#8221; the anorexia and allow it to kill her.  However, the correlative feature of this is that it offers FD, possibly for the first time ever, but certainly for the first time for a long time, autonomy, control and hope.  FD has attended the majority of this hearing remotely by CVP from the home where she is staying, and I venture to suggest and to say to her that she will have seen and witnessed the love that is shown to her by all those who have been involved in this process: people who want the very best for her.  But these people do not only include her loving family, but the caring medical team, including, if I may say, in particular, Dr A and Ms B.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I invited Miss Greaney to take instructions from Mr Edwards, from the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office, as to whether he might be willing to continue to make himself available to FD after this case concludes today.  I also asked the same question in respect of Natasha Lukies of Reeds Solicitors, who was instructed by the Official Solicitor to meet FD and to ascertain her wishes and feelings.  When I met with FD, Miss Lukies attended, and it is clear to me that she and FD have been able to build a bond of trust and friendship.  Mr Edwards and Miss&#160;Lukies  have both unhesitatingly agreed to continue to be available to answer any requests that FD may have and even to follow up whether the promised facilities of the care plan are being delivered.  I recognise that this is a big ask, not least because I anticipate that, once this case has concluded, these kind people will not be remunerated.  I am extremely grateful to each of them for their offer to do this.  It is a question which I have rarely asked in Court of Protection cases.  I recognise the central importance to FD of being able to access people that she knows and has come to trust.  When I talk of the hope for FD&#8217;s future as well as the risks, I firmly believe that that hope will be strengthened by the kind and generous offers of the people to whom I have just referred to make themselves available to assist FD.  I have also expressed the sincere offer that if it is felt, for example, by Mr&#160;Edwards or anyone from the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office, that further judicial input may help hasten any facilities that FD has requested or agreed to use, then I would be more than happy to be involved, provided, of course, that the various protocols are complied with.  I want FD to feel not only loved as she is by her family, but supported by all of the professionals who have engaged with her in this case.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Also, I want to say this. My task has been to consider all the background information and, crucially, to look forward to what steps should be taken for FD in the future.  I have only had the briefest of opportunities to meet FD&#8217;s mother and father and, as I said, this has only been online through the CVP link.  I want to make clear that there is nothing at all that makes me criticise either of FD&#8217;s parents: quite the reverse, for I have seen a family united in their sincere and profound desire to do everything they possibly can to help FD. Indeed, in her very private and frank note, FD said this: </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Everything that I have read and seen about this case currently persuades me that FD has a loving and supportive family, who have suffered so much emotional heartache as they have witnessed FD&#8217;s decline.  I pay tribute to all of them.  They have had to come to terms with the most difficult decision that a parent could really ever have to make about their child and, as I shall set out in due course in this Judgment, they have made their decision based entirely on what they think is best for FD.  But when I use the expression &#8220;their child&#8221;, of course, FD is an adult of 29, but I do so, knowing that to a parent their child is in some respects always just that.  </p>

This, obviously, is a hope which everybody involved with this case shares.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As I shall set out in more detail below, at an earlier directions hearing I asked FD whether she would like to meet me as the judge making this huge decision about her.  She indicated that she would like to meet me, not via a computer link but for me to visit her at the care home where she is being looked after.  I found the visit invaluable as an opportunity to get to know FD, at least a bit.  I made it very clear to FD, as is, of course, the case, that my visit was not about evidence gathering.  I made sure that I complied with the guidance given recently by Hayden J in relation to judges visiting patients.  I was accompanied by Miss Lukies of Reeds Solicitors and an attendance note was made and that has been circulated, of course, to all relevant people.  I thanked FD for agreeing to meet me and I said to her then, and I repeat now, that it was a privilege for me to do so.  I also offered then, and I repeat the offer now, that if she would like me to visit her again following this case, I will do so, of course complying with the appropriate guidance and protocols and ensuring that I am accompanied again and that an attendance note is taken.  I will only, of course, do such a thing with the full knowledge and agreement of all parties, but I am sure that if this is something that FD wanted, that is cooperation and participation that would be accepted by everybody.  </p>

Whilst everybody appreciates that FD&#8217;s health is on something of a knife edge, I detected hope as well as despair in my conversations with FD, and now that FD is going to be in charge of her own destiny, we must all express the hope that the optimism is rising not falling.  I have been assured that as part of the care plan such a, what I am calling, close confidante, will be found for FD.</p>

In 2009, she was variously at Unit B (Z Hospital), Unit C (Z Hospital), A&amp;E at S Hospital, and other institutions.  The following year, FD was again detained under the Mental Health Act.  This was converted to a Community Treatment Order.  The Community Treatment Order was revoked in September 2011, and then FD was variously at all the institutions referred to above. In March 2012, a further Community Treatment Order was granted, which was then revoked in January 2013.  FD was then transferred to Y Hospital, though shortly thereafter transferred to Unit C, Z Hospital, as Y Hospital was not offering NG feeding at that point. She was then transferred to C House, before being transferred back to Unit C, Z Hospital.  It was in November 2015 that FD was first referred to Dr B.  Dr B gave compelling evidence by video link yesterday.  It was, in my judgment, expert evidence of the highest quality and has been central to the determinations that I have had to make.  </p>

I do not want to distress FD or her parents any further than these proceedings must obviously be distressing them by reciting many of the unfortunate incidents that have taken place.  But, just by way of example, FD has repeatedly removed her PEG tube.  I mention it really in the context of a description by FD of her life as being &#8220;torture&#8221;.  I found her use of that phrase to me compelling.  And for her, sitting in a relatively small room, with nothing to do except have voices in her head and feeling tortured, no access to social media or television because she avoids those, it is not a life that she regards as worth living; and I understand that.  </p>

It is where I visited her and it is where she plainly is loved by the staff and where she has made genuine friends.  Based on what I saw, but more particularly on what I have read in the papers in this case and the evidence that I have heard, I cannot commend highly enough the care and love that I saw and that I have read about that FD receives at X Care Home.  It seems clear to me, and I think to everybody who knows and loves FD, that the existence FD currently enjoys is not an existence which is bearable for her.  I say this as an observation of what FD subjectively feels, and also what I understand objectively for her, being in the circumstances that I have described.  I must emphasise strongly this is not in any sense at all a criticism of anybody in the house where she is.  As I have said, that house appears to be full of love and care and I have no doubt it is a place which offers, at the moment, the best possible care in the circumstances that FD is in.  </p>

If FD is no longer being forced to be fed or, indeed, subject to anything at all against her will and if FD is given the power of control over her own decision-making, which I am now giving her, then there is, as I have said, some possibility, some hope that FD will decide to see if she can move her life into a happier situation.  All of the services which she now enjoys will be available to her.  In one sense, therefore, nothing has changed, but in another sense there has been a seismic shift, for it is FD that now has the control.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I refer to the importance of Dr B in this case.  Dr B has said in her reports to this court that FD&#8217;s identity is &#8220;totally tied up with anorexia&#8221;.  She reports that FD has an extremely poor self-image.  FD believes that she is worthless and that she deserves to die from her illness.  She has almost no interests at the moment.  She describes unrelenting internal voices telling her that she is fat and that she is ugly.  Dr B gave compelling evidence to the court on the CVP link and was asked questions by both counsel and also by both of FD&#8217;s parents and by both of FD&#8217;s sisters.  Some time was spent on definitions about FD&#8217;s capacity to make decisions in relation to her nutrition and her fluid intake.  Dr B sought to draw a distinction between FD taking fluids with no calories (such as water, black coffee and Pepsi Max) and fluids containing sugar and dextrose which would provide nutrition, which FD would regard as unacceptable because they contain calories.  The doctor described the issue as &#8220;enormously complicated&#8221; and that FD wanted to drive herself to take fewer calories, and this was driven by FD&#8217;s immense fear.  Dr B described that FD regards the anorexia as something that is unbeatable and, therefore, something that she has to &#8220;honour&#8221;.  She said that FD has a compulsion to lose weight and fears gaining weight.  She said that one could argue the case that FD has capacity to make decisions through her experiences over many years and that these give her what Dr B referred to as &#8220;a great experiential insight&#8221;.  Dr B said, and I accept, that FD does have an understanding of nutrition and energy and that she regards these forms of nutrition as suitable for other people but not herself.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Court has also been enormously helped in this case by the evidence of Dr&#160;A.  Dr A has known FD for a long time and, although I agreed yesterday that she could be released from these proceedings so that she could go and see other patients, who I am sure need her time, I note, in fact, that she has been present throughout the whole of this hearing, including the second day.  I see that, even as I am talking now, she is still shown on the screen as attending even though it is 4.30pm in the afternoon on the second day.  I have no doubt that Dr A&#8217;s attendance over this time, which was something which she volunteered and was not required to do, is because Dr A profoundly wants to help FD in this next phase of her life.  Dr A, sadly, will only be able to remain with FD&#8217;s case for a few more weeks now that I have made the orders that I have.  Whilst this is regrettable, I completely understand that her professional duties are mainly connected with other hospital trusts and that the various different trusts operating in different areas prevent Dr A from being closely connected with FD in the future.  Having said that, and as an example of the care that I have referred to Dr A having for FD, Dr A has offered that she can remain, from time to time, available for FD.  I want to express the immense gratitude of this court to Dr A for the enormous care and help that she has given to FD and which she will continue to give to FD.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Dr A probably knows FD better than most, if not all, of the various treating medical professionals, certainly in recent years.  Dr A was less supportive of the distinction drawn by Dr B between calorific fluids and non-calorific fluids.  I am persuaded that it is neither necessary nor appropriate in this case for me to seek to draw such a fine distinction.  This is not in any way to criticise Dr B, to whom, as I have already said, the court is extremely grateful.  As counsel have pointed out to me in the authorities to which I have been taken, the Court of Appeal has discouraged judges from making these fine distinctions and I do not know of any case where a distinction has been made in such a way as this about the difference between calorific fluids and non-calorific fluids.  But if I was in any doubt at all about the correctness of my decision not to draw that distinction, that doubt is firmly resolved in favour of not drawing such a distinction when I remind myself of FD&#8217;s words in her own note that:  </p>

I have been told, and I accept, that there have been occasions when FD would take substantial quantities of water shortly before being weighed in order to create the misleading impression that she had gained weight when in fact it was just the fluid that had just been put into her system.  </p>

On 20 June, FD weighed 5&#160;st 7 lbs/36.1 kg.  This was a decrease from 5 st 8 lbs/36.8 kg on 13&#160;June.  I was told yesterday that FD&#8217;s weight then was 5 st 6 lbs/ 34.47 kg and that her body mass index is now 12.3.  This is regarded as dangerously close to starvation.  I was told that FD&#8217;s current calorific intake is 1,116 calories a day, but that she has not agreed to increase this through the nasogastric tube.  </p>

I am not going to run through all of the authorities to which I have been referred.  To do so will, I fear, be tedious and would take a long time.  In any event, I regard it as unnecessary.  What I do need to do is to refer to the headline guideline cases from the higher courts rather than a large number of cases where more or less the same thing has been said.  And, of course, I must always bear in mind that these cases are very fact-specific and two cases, even dealing with people of the same gender, of the same age, with the same condition, can still be factually very different.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As is well-known to those of us who practise in the Court of Protection, the overarching principle begins with the clear statement that there is no obligation on a patient with decision-making capacity to accept life-saving treatment and doctors are neither entitled nor obliged to give it.  As I have said, I have found, following the compelling evidence that I have referred to, that FD lacks capacity to make decisions in relation to her nutrition.  This is the central issue for, of course, without nutrition FD will not survive. It is this issue in relation to which FD most of all wants to have control.  I have referred above to the risks which are inherent in giving FD autonomy and control in relation to this issue.  I have set out above the hopes and the aspirations which balance these risks.  Only FD now will be able to decide which path to take, although, as I have set out, she will be enormously supported on whichever path she chooses.  I recognise that this will not be a linear path, but that, whatever route FD chooses, there will be anguish, moments of despair, but I hope also, moments of optimism and achievement.  When I met with FD last week, I discussed with her the possibility that she might look back, say, to go one week back, two weeks back, three weeks back and say, overall, one, two or three weeks later: &#8220;Am I a tiny bit better than I was?&#8221;  And if she sees even the smallest improvement, maybe she will find that that difficult path to recovery is one that she will want to follow.  </p>

The burden of proof, of course, lies on the person asserting a lack of capacity and the standard of proof is the ordinary balance of probabilities.  Determination of capacity is decision-specific, having regard to the clear structure provided by sections 1 to 3 of the Mental Capacity Act.  Capacity must be assessed in relation to the specific decision at the time the decision is to be made and not to a person&#8217;s capacity to make decisions generally.  The draft order which has been agreed between counsel, respectively, with the Foundation Trust and the Official Solicitor reads as follows in relation to capacity: </p>

Pursuant to rule 17.1(1) of the Court of Protection Rules 2017, the litigation friend must fairly and competently conduct the proceedings for the party and have no adverse interest to the party.  There is a duty under the Mental Capacity Act to act in the best interests of the protected party.  The litigation friend must confirm that they will act in that party&#8217;s best interests.  The duty is not stated expressly in the Court of Protection Rules but is derived from the statutory scheme as a whole.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Again, I have been referred to a number of other cases in this subject and, again, I do not want laboriously to go through all of those.  But I do refer to Part 5 of the Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice.  This provides assistance in assessing best interests at paragraphs 5.29-5.36.  Paragraph 5.31 says as follows: </p>

There will be a limited number of cases where treatment is futile, overly burdensome to the patient or where there is no prospect of recovery.  In circumstances such as these, it may be that an assessment of best interests leads to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the patient to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment, even if this may result in the person&#8217;s death.  The decision-maker must make a decision based on the best interests of the person who lacks capacity.  They must not be motivated by a desire to bring about the person&#8217;s death for whatever reason, even if this is from a sense of compassion.  Healthcare and social care staff should also refer to relevant professional guidance when making decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As I have said, FD reports that, looking back, she first recognised the symptoms of anorexia at nursery school, before she was five. Whether or not this is a correct and accurate recollection, I see no reason to disbelieve what FD has said in the absence of anybody contradicting it.  On the balance of probabilities, I accept it as correct.  As I have said, FD has, since she was 12, been one way or another in an institution being treated for anorexia nervosa.  That is some 17 years.  It is fair to say I find that this treatment has failed.  I do not criticise anybody in saying that.  I do not criticise the very many hospitals, clinics and caring professionals who have treated her.  We are now in the middle of 2023.  All of FD&#8217;s family and all of the clinicians who know her well believe that imposing further treatment on FD against her will would be futile.  When I say &#8220;futile&#8221;, I use it in the strict sense as in being hopeless, of no effect.  I also, remembering the words in the Code of Practice, bear in mind these words, &#8220;or overly burdensome to the patient&#8221;.  I remind myself of FD&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;torture&#8221;.  So, I have concluded clearly, although of course on a balance of probabilities, but I am quite sure that this is one of those cases where respect for FD&#8217;s autonomy, the futility of further compulsory treatment, and cognisance of all past attempts at treatment compel me to the conclusion that preserving life at any cost is not the lodestar in this case.  FD cannot stand the prospect of being forced into treatment that she does not want.  But, as I have said, every aspect of her care that exists today at X Care Home is on offer tomorrow and as long as it is needed.  Armed with the care plan, the love, care and support of family and staff and treating clinicians, I am not prepared to accept the inevitability of FD&#8217;s death following this decision and I do not accept that inevitability.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have also been very impressed with the evidence of Ms C.  In a moment of slight levity, which I hope was not inappropriate given the gravity of the proceedings, I observed that I have never heard reference to salsa dancing in a Court of Protection case. That reference was in the context of the things that are available to FD through the NHS.  I was, frankly, amazed at hearing the list of things that might be available.  I am not going to say I encourage FD, but I just remind FD of the availability of all of these things.  I am quite determined that anything that FD may want to access she should access and as soon as possible.  As I have said, if there is any delay in the provision of those services, I would like to think that the Official Solicitor can help, or Reeds can help, or, ultimately, I can help.  Given all that we hear about the troubles in the NHS (and there is nothing that I could say that people do not already know), I have been incredibly impressed that for two days we have had two eminent leading counsel, junior counsel, two eminent psychiatrists at the very top of their game, incredibly caring staff at X Care Home, all dedicated to FD&#8217;s well-being and best interests in this case.  I do not for a second ask FD to be grateful for that, gratitude has got nothing to do with it.  But I merely observe, as a judge in a legal system which is so riddled with funding problems, that this case has been remarkably well run and I am very grateful to everybody for that.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">... It is not for judges to make political points and I do not now seek to do so.  However, it does seem to me that when Parliament changed the law in relation to legal aid and significantly restricted the availability of legal aid, yet continued to make legal aid available in care cases where the state is seeking orders against parents, it cannot have intended that parents in the position that these parents have been in should have no access to legal advice or representation.  To most like-minded people, a National Health Service trust is as much an arm of the state as is a local authority.  I can think of few more profound cases than ones where a trust is applying to the court for a declaration that a life support machine should be switched off in respect of a child.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Well, obviously, mercifully, that is not this case.  But here we have an NHS Foundation trust asking for the High Court&#8217;s approval of a plan not to compel a patient to accept life-saving treatment in circumstances where the patient lacks capacity to make that decision.  I just say again publicly and not in any way politically,  please could a review be given?  Because I have been involved in a number of very difficult cases, usually end-of-life cases, where parents have not had representation and they needed it.  As it happened, in the <span style="font-style:italic">Gard</span> case, because of the publicity, the parents were represented by excellent counsel acting <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span>.  Since hearing this case, I am aware that due to changes in the regulations (which commenced on 3 August 2023), legal aid &#8220;means testing&#8221; is no longer required for parents applying for legal representation for matters concerning the withdrawal or withholding of life sustaining treatment in respect of their child.  I am very pleased about this obviously sensible development.</p>

I am going to refer to some very helpful passages in Miss&#160;Sutton&#8217;s note in this regard.  I should say straightaway that Miss Greaney KC agrees with what Miss Sutton KC has said about this and, therefore, did not need to make separate representations to me about the law:</p>

It is ultimately a public law decision by application of section 13 of the Mental Health Act.  Additionally, even if a consequence of the court decision under the Mental Capacity Act, which refutes forced feeding, means, in practical terms, compulsory treatment under the Mental Health Act would go against that decision, they are different statutory regimes.&#8221;</p>

It would, if I may say so, be plainly wrong if we had spent the last two days deciding whether I should give the hospital the authority not to compel FD to accept feeding if only to find that feeding would be imposed under the Mental Health Act instead.  We would agree it would achieve very little at all if that was where we are.  </p>

I cannot compel clinicians to act or not act.  But it is apparent from Dr A&#8217;s evidence that she would not seek to continue to impose treatment under the Mental Health Act, notwithstanding her clear understanding that this may lead to FD&#8217;s death. </p>

A full merits review has been undertaken in the context of this Court of Protection case and there has been anxious scrutiny by all relevant professionals in coming to the difficult conclusion that compulsion should not be used.  </p>

I am not going to order, because I cannot, but I am going to ask that immediate consideration be given to the removal of the section pursuant to the Mental Health Act.  I accept what Miss Sutton KC has told me, and Miss&#160;Greaney KC agrees, that what I am saying now will have that effect.  If for some reason it does not have that effect, then, although I do not have the power to order it, I would like that, please, to be brought to my attention right away, in a message to me via my clerk, so that we can consider what the next steps should be.  But with all the experience that Miss&#160;Sutton KC and Miss Greaney KC have in this field of the law, if they tell me that is what will happen then I accept that it will. By way of update, on 30 June 2023 (shortly after the hearing), I was made aware that Dr A had completed the necessary section 23 paperwork and that FD was discharged from her section.</p>
