	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="color:#000000">These parties have been involved in litigation about their daughter for a substantial period of her young life.  In 2020, there were proceedings in which a formal application was made by the father to change her name.  This application culminated in an agreement that it should be dismissed.  The Cafcass officer at the time had recommended that the name change should occur, but for reasons which are not entirely clear the father did not pursue it at that time and the application was dismissed with the agreement of both parties.  Proceedings about child arrangements, however, continued.  U&#8217;s name surname registered at birth was that of her mother.  </span></p>

She also prepared a skeleton argument which has been very helpfully supplemented now by counsel appearing on her behalf, Mr Cleary, who helpfully distilled the grounds of appeal to three in number.  First, there was no proper application before the court for a change of name.  Second, there was no proper evidence before the court about a change of name. Third, the reasons the judge gave were inadequate to explain his decision. </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="color:#000000">First, Mr Cleary submits on behalf of the mother that the process was unfair.  The father made an informal application.  Whilst the mother had some notice that the father was going to raise the issue of a change of name, this was in a position statement only.  It is submitted that this had several consequences.  First, the fact that the father wished to resurrect the application to change U&#8217;s surname was not brought to the attention of the Cafcass officer and so no analysis of this was included in either of the two reports that were prepared for the hearing.  It was only raised by the judge during the hearing when the father was about to cross-examine the Cafcass officer.  In response to questions about it the Cafcass officer gave some generIc answers about changing a child&#8217;s surname. Those answers were to the effect that it is normal and generally in a child&#8217;s best interests to have a surname from both parents, followed by some other comments about foreign travel.  The mother then stated to the judge that the application for a change of name had been made before and dismissed to which the judge responded, "Okay."  As a result, the mother did not believe she needed to ask the Cafcass officer questions about the potential change of name, especially the evidence that the Cafcass officer had just given, and did not do so.</span></p>

	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="color:#000000">Mr Cleary also argues that there is no reference in the judgment to the principles to be applied to a change of name following the decision of the House of Lords in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Dawson v Wearmouth </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/1999/18" uk:canonical="[1999] UKHL 18" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] UKHL 18</ref></span><span style="color:#000000">, and no analysis of the child's wishes and feelings. He submits that the judge was wrong to rely on what the Cafcass officer said in such generic terms.  Finally, Mr Cleary submits the judge was not entitled to deal with an issue under section&#160;13 of the Children Act&#160;1989, which is the provision which relates to the change of a name of a child, where there is a child arrangements order, of its own motion.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="color:#000000">The judge dealt with the question of the change of name in three short paragraphs in his order.  First of all, he said this:</span></p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.77in"><span style="color:#000000">"Sometimes travelling abroad, if both parents' names are part of the surname, it is rather easier for the child to travel."  </span></p>

	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="color:#000000">The basis of this assertion is unclear and Mr Cleary says there was no analysis of how often U was likely to travel abroad, still less whether those countries she may travel to would be assisted by seeing parents' names in the surname. In any event, he said it does not constitute an analysis of the welfare interests of U changing her surname. </span></p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="color:#000000">The judge did say that it would provide U with a sense of identity. It could be said that this constituted an assessment the welfare interests of U, but if so, it was inadequate.  It was a generic statement that could have applied to any child, with no attempt to look at the specific circumstances of this case.  The judge stated that the clear message from Cafcass was that "This is usual order I ought to make."  Mr Cleary says this was not the clear message of Cafcass.  The issue had not been considered in any of the reports to the hearing and the fact that something might be thought to be a usual order is not a basis upon which to make a decision as important as changing a surname.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="color:#000000">In response to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant mother, Mr&#160;Baylis argues as follows.  First of all, there are two routes by which a party may seek to change a child's surname where that issue is contested.  The first route is under section&#160;8 of the Children Act by means of a specific issue order.  The second route, where a child arrangements order is already in force, is pursuant to section&#160;13 for an order lifting the statutory restriction preventing anyone from causing a child to be known by a new surname.  Mr. Baylis argues that section&#160;1(4) of the Act provides that where the court is considering whether to make, vary or discharge a section 8 order, it shall have regard to the welfare checklist set out at section&#160;1(3) of the Act.  Under &#160;s13, there is no such obligation albeit it does not make a material difference to the way in which a judge should approach the decision, as the paramountcy principle applies in any event. So does section&#160;1(5) (the no order principle).</span></p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="color:#000000">Mr&#160;Baylis submits that the judge was entitled to consider the application without specific reference to the child's wishes and feelings. The judge had the parties before him for two days and heard evidence from both of them and the Cafcass officer.  He took time to consider and deliver his judgment which is detailed, well thought through, and analytical about these parents and the past.  He says that the judge was entitled to deal with it even though no formal application had been made, in the wise discretion he retains as to case management.  Whilst the judge dealt with the issue shortly he did so carefully, saying this:</span></p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.77in"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">"There were three issues, I think, that I needed to deal with.  The ongoing time that U should spend with her father and the parameters of that.  The father's application to enforce and the father's application to change U&#8217;s name, which had been raised at an earlier period and which certainly was an issue at the final hearing and about which the Cafcass officer gave evidence.  The essential case, as I say, involves three issues.  The amount of time the father should spend with U and how that should be managed and when staying contact should start; for how long it should start and what should happen in holiday periods.  Secondly, name change, and third, application to enforce.  The guardian [by which I think he must have meant the Cafcass officer] maintained that it was a view of Cafcass that when things started to move on, the mother would raise difficulties, as here with hunger, as here with wet underclothing, to prevent contact from moving on.  I was impressed with the evidence given to me by [the Cafcass officer]</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:#000000"/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">because she clearly read all of previous input from Cafcass to be examined." </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.25in"><span style="color:#000000">And then at paragraph&#160;92, my attention is drawn to this:</span></p>
	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.77in"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">"Cafcass officers have recommended a name change of U.  They have recommended a name change of [U to that of her mother and father].  The mother suggests that was concluded when the father did not progress with that hearing of that much sooner in the proceedings.  I think without a judgment that it was impossible for that to be determined.  However, I have heard argument in respect of the matter in this case.  It seems to me that Cafcass has advised, again, consistently, there should be a change.  There are a number of reasons for it.  Sometimes travelling abroad, if both parents' names are retained in the surname, it is rather easier for the child to travel and to persuade various border forces it is your child where the name matches at least in part.  It also provides U with a sense of identity, that she is an equal child of equal parents and that forms part of her history, her understanding and her name.  Therefore, with a clear message from Cafcass that it is a usual order that I ought to make it, I am considering making a name change order.  However, I do think that U has [had her current name] now for seven years and I do think that [her mother&#8217;s name] should form the second part of a hyphenated name.  Therefore, I give leave for her name to be changed to [that of both her mother and father]." </span></p>

She would undoubtedly have done so had she been made fully aware, and the fact that she was not fully aware was a result of the lack of a formal application and the judge's response saying to her when she told him that the previous application had been dismissed by consent. </span></p>

He therefore did not consider her arguments about it which principally related to the child's wishes and feelings.  What those are and the weight to be attached to them is a matter for determination at a later stage.  There are cases where a child's wishes and feelings could be important, whether the judge is statutorily required to apply the welfare checklist or not.  The judge did not specifically know about how this child would feel about a name change although he did know quite a lot else about the case.</span></p>

I am not saying in every case that a judge needs to set out the law in comprehensive detail or to give a long judgment in relation.  It depends on the facts of the case.  But the fact that he did not do so combined with the procedural error that I have underlined, adds to the strength of this appeal on the other grounds as well.   </span></p>

His judgment in relation to the child arrangements was very careful and conscientious.  He set out the litigation history in this case, which is lamentable so far as this child is concerned. I am very conscious that the effect of this decision will be to prolong it. I would urge the parties to consider the effect of further disagreement on their daughter and to see whether it is still possible to compromise.  What happens ultimately will not be a matter for me but I express the hope that the issue of the proposed name&#160;change does not form too much of a distraction in what is the really important issue here, and that is the father's relationship with the child.</span></p>
