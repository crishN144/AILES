The mathematics of this was not challenged and it concluded that the acquisition of land during the course of the marriage has resulted in an increase from &#163;1,131,872 (adjusted for inflation to October 2009) to &#163;5,015,247.  This is an increase in real value of 443%, and put another way, the 1985 land value, expressed in today&#8217;s money, accounts for just over 23% of the present total value.</p>

I am of this view because she gave oral evidence as to her part in the finding and the identification of the potential of HH Farm as a route for the motorway and in its purchase, which (a) was at odds with her written evidence on this topic and (b) essentially little different from the husband&#8217;s account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept and find that the opportunity to buy HH Farm first arose because of the relationship between the husband&#8217;s father and the relevant agent.  At that time, it was well known (as is shown by a letter relating to the completion of the purchase dated 22 September 1987) that there was a real possibility that part of the land would be chosen as the route for a new road, but the plans for this were by no means settled.  The vendors would have been fully aware of this and it would be very surprising if this possibility, and its uncertainty, were not factors taken into account in arriving at the price (&#163;180,000).</p>

In my view this remained the case when the prospect that the new road would go through the land leaving parts of it difficult or impossible to farm profitably is taken into account.  No contrary evidence to that view was given and the remaining parts of the land are still farmed by the Company.  So, in my view from the view point of the Company (and subject to the purchase price) the purchase represented a &#8220;win / win&#8221; opportunity in that it could farm the land and it might obtain a windfall profit from the sale of a part or parts of it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband sought to place weight on the part his father played in obtaining a good price for the land and a good figure for crop compensation.  As to the latter, he said that the initial offer was derisory and it is clear that the negotiations took a long time.   As to the former, the negotiations were against the backdrop that absent agreement the price could be fixed by the Lands Tribunal.  The evidence did not indicate the extent and nature of the negotiations over the sale of the land for commercial development.  But I proceed on the bases (a) that the husband&#8217;s father was actively involved in those as well, and (b) that in respect of all aspects of the sales he achieved a good price, and crop compensation, as a consequence of him being a good and tenacious negotiator.  However, this participation of his father was an aspect of good management of the assets and business of the Company and, save in that sense, it does not provide an additional factor in favour of the conclusion that this source of capital (the windfall as it was referred to in argument; albeit that understandably the husband did not like the use of the term) should be traced back to and be said to be, or essentially to be, a part of or the product of, the long term farming carried out through the generations by the husband&#8217;s family.  </p>

The husband indicated that its introduction and the respective roles in the business after this of the husband and his brother was a factor behind his brother leaving the business and being bought out.  As I understand it, the purchase of CG Farm was not supported by the husband&#8217;s brother and was another factor that led to the husband&#8217;s brother leaving the business and his shares being bought by the Company (utilising the cash in the Company arising from the compulsory purchase of part of HH Farm).</p>

Also skill and experience are required to trade successfully with the supermarkets having regard to their market share, business practices and supply demands.  As to these matters the jointly instructed accountant provided useful general market information which the husband confirmed applied to the position of, and the problems faced by, the Company in connection with, for example, the approach of buyers employed by the supermarkets, the lack of written contracts and forward ordering and the rejection of  produce.</p>

But it involved entry into new markets as well as the utilisation of some of the skills involved and acquired in the farming and packing operations.  As the price paid indicates, the processing company that was acquired was not a large one and, in any event, the nature of its processing business was changed by the Company from low volume / high margin sales to the wholesale market, to high volume / low margin sales to a different range of customers.  The impact of this on the usefulness of that processing company&#8217;s contracts / goodwill and the experience and skills of its workforce was not gone into by the husband, but it seems likely that the change would diminish it considerably because, as the husband said in his second statement, the Company sought to operate in a different league and the staff acquired were resistant to change.  This change, as he points out, increased turnover substantially.  But it also substantially increased the costs and that increase and other matters have led to losses.</p>

But there was no evidence that the fitting out was therefore reduced.  To service this over capacity the Company has had to buy in produce (the husband estimated that this accounted for around 50% of the relevant sales) and this has made this aspect of the Company&#8217;s business vulnerable to changes in prices of the produce bought in on fixed price contracts with customers.  This was another contributor to the losses that were made and, as I understood it, was not comparable to any buying in of produce for packing that may have been done in the past.  </p>

So that plan should have included appropriately particularised detail of the present thinking in respect of all aspects of the business including the processing unit.  Or that information should have been provided by other means (e.g. a presentation to the Company&#8217;s Bank or other potential lenders).  In the case of the processing unit, which has made losses, the information provided should have covered in appropriate detail how the performance since it started matched the expectations for this large investment, how problems were being dealt with and the forecasts for the future.  In respect of other matters the information provided should have covered (together with the documents complying with my direction relating to what the Company could borrow) the prospects of the Company in respect of alternative routes for raising finance including that ultimately proposed by the husband and why more could not be raised.  So it should have included information as to the loss of crops and therefore turnover if land was sold (his final proposal involved the sale of CG Farm) and the intentions as to and the prospects of replacing the land that was sold with rented land and the cost of this.</p>

The accountant was not asked to express a view on whether there was any market for the shares, or to consider any detailed issues or suggestions relating to liquidity or exit strategies (although in her first report she covers the sale of residential properties from a base that she has been told by the husband that all the other assets of the company are intrinsic to the farming enterprise; and as will appear later this was confirmed and advanced by the husband when she was dealing with her supplemental report and questions raised on it).  She also went on to explain, as would be well known to lawyers advising the parties that any dividend or additional remuneration would need to be accrued from available resources to ensure that the husband&#8217;s loan account balance was not overdrawn and that financing through remuneration or dividend carries with it significant tax consequences because of the need to cover and pay them.  It is also of interest, and can have come as no surprise to the lawyers, that she comments that significant security was available from the value of the land.  She added that it may be that a period of consolidation was required until the returns expected from the processing unit are achieved and that when and if this is achieved payment of the levels of remuneration previously enjoyed by the husband may be possible.  When she was preparing that report (which is dated 28 January 2008) the husband told her that he would allow another year for it to turn round. </p>

This is because in respect of both such a valuation inevitably involves the matters of opinion, and reliance on forecasts made by the husband (some of which were not born out by the results that occurred between the two reports).  As to the former, Ms Howe&#8217;s valuation lacks some of the information that would be made available by a due diligence exercise.  As to the latter, Ms Howe&#8217;s views on adding a sum for goodwill by reference to estimated profit of the processing unit to 31 March 2010 shows (although this was not put to her) that if a due diligence exercise or a properly supported business plan and projection showed that the processing unit was likely to be profitable (and for example that it would enable remuneration at the earlier high levels to be voted to the husband as she mentions in her first report) this could affect the goodwill valuation now.  Further, and in any event, if such profits were realised this would have a major impact on (a) the value of the Company as a capital asset, (b) its ability to finance payment to the husband by way salary or dividend from profit or to finance borrowing for that purpose and more generally (c) the assessment of its value to the husband as the source of an income stream.</p>

There is a contingent corporation tax liability of around &#163;2.2m which would arise (subject to roll over relief) on the sale of all the capital assets.  If there was an actual sale of the shares in the Company the allowance for this contingent liability would be a matter of negotiation between the vendors and a purchaser of the Company as a going concern, who would not be looking to sell all the assets in the short term.  This adds a further significant variant to her valuation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To my mind the reality is that the husband&#8217;s tax bill (&#163;56,767) will have to be met either by a further dividend or by remuneration over and above the level  included in the estimated remuneration to 31 March 2010 (it may be that it would not have to be voted until a later year, but if this was the route taken it would be voted in a year when the tax rate is likely to be higher).  An approach in line with what I have been told in respect of the husband&#8217;s final offer (see below) would indicate that he would be likely to cause the Company to declare a dividend in an amount that would enable the debt to be set off and the tax on that grossed up dividend to be paid when it became due.  That grossed up amount is &#163;315,918 (calculated as follows: net sum required is &#163;227,066 grossed up to pay tax at 32.5% would require &#163;336,394 (total tax &#163;109,328) less Tax Credit 10% of &#163;33,639 = &#163;75,689 so grossed up sum is &#163;227,066 + &#163;75,689 = &#163;302,755.  In reverse dividend is &#163;302,755, so tax is calculated on that sum plus one ninth of that sum (&#163;302,755 + 33,639 = &#163;336,394, tax credit 10% = &#163;33,639 plus balance 22.5% = &#163;75,689).   This equates to an uplift of 25% (which is the uplift used by the parties).</p>

The other half is owned by his brother&#8217;s children and it is included on the basis of a tenanted valuation (as I understand it of the whole) and without any deduction for capital gains tax (because this is unknown to the wife and was not estimated by the husband) or discount because the husband only has a half interest.  The best price is likely to be obtained on a sale of the whole and the ability of the husband to effect or bring about such a sale now, was not investigated.  The wife invited the husband to give his share to their children now.  He declined to do so but indicated that his will provides and it is his present intention to leave his share to them on his death, if it then exists.  Although it seems that this asset is not readily realisable at present, and it is an inherited asset, it could increase in value (if the tenancy ends or does not exist, as to which there was some doubt) and could (by a charge on his beneficial interest) provide some security for borrowing by the husband.</p>

Further, it should not involve the expenditure of disproportionate time and money on the preparation of budgets and supporting material because, when a figure is in effect a &#8220;guesstimate&#8221;, this can be stated and it can then be considered whether more accuracy is appropriate.  Rather, the provision of such supported information should (a) encourage realistic and sensible estimates with an appropriate explanation, (b) discourage speculative, excessive and aspirational budgets and (c) enable the court to reach an informed view on the appropriate level of future income need (generously assessed) without any detailed analysis or auditing of underlying figures.</p>

The husband did this without any cross reference to his own Form E budget and on the alternative bases that the wife stayed at the matrimonial home (his figure was about &#163;70,000) and that if she moved (his figure was about &#163;60,000), but he did so without cross reference to the bases of his assessment of all the items (some were his actual expenditure).  The wife reworked her budget by introducing the husband&#8217;s Form E figures into her Form E budget.  This involved the reduction of some sums that on the evidence were in my view excessive (e.g. on holidays, food and repairs) and the introduction of items included in the husband&#8217;s Form E budget but not in hers (e.g. presents and depreciation and of the sums paid by the husband on the matrimonial home).  This exercise resulted in a figure of about &#163;97,000 (excluding a separate budget for the children).    Essentially this was an approach in which both sides &#8220;played with the figures&#8221; rather than an exercise in which by reference to actual income and expenditure during the marriage they estimated (a) past expenditure, and (b) future expenditure to provide an equivalent lifestyle.  For example, as I have mentioned no figure was estimated by either party of the amounts of drawings spent on improving the matrimonial home rather than general living.</p>

The wife being of the view that this would provide her with the potential for some development or income from the use of the land for a livery.  The wife&#8217;s oral evidence demonstrated that she had effectively done no work, or was not prepared to reveal the work she had done, in assessing the prospects of, and potential gains or income from, such uses of the matrimonial home and adjacent land.  The scheme also introduced valuation issues as to the enhancement in value of the matrimonial home and the depreciation in value of the farm if it was implemented.  Absent the husband&#8217;s co-operation the scheme was not an option.  Although, as I understand it he was never keen on it he did not rule it out and valuation evidence relating to it was therefore obtained. </p>

Albeit that the husband can trace his farming heritage and a farming business back through a number of generations the assertions to the effect that the farming land and business now owned and carried out by the Company has been in his family for generations is plainly not made out.  This is because it fails to have any proper regard to (a) the acquisition of land over the years, (b) the development of the farms and business by the respective generations during their periods of management from the start (or springboard) they had, and (c) as aspects of (a) and (b), during the marriage the Company has, applying a number of relevant tests, increased in size and value.  During that period it has increased its land base, it has developed and changed the size of its operations overall, it has developed or changed its business by the introduction of packing and processing and it has had the advantage of windfall profits.</p>

Essentially, many of the developments and changes have come about through business decisions by its management (and thus by active change rather than passive change) in the same way as happens in companies involved in different businesses (many of which will also have a land base).  For the purposes of ancillary relief, the non discriminatory approach to contributions that falls to be applied means that those who have been involved in the management of the business who were married have been supported by the domestic (and other contributions of their spouses) and those domestic contributions (and here that of the wife in her support of the husband) fall to be taken into account.</p>

That is not to say that the platform created before the Company was formed and by the times of the various gifts by which the husband became a shareholder (and which increased his holding) are not factors to be taken into account in determining how that gifted asset should be shared and taken into account in assessing the wife&#8217;s fair award.</p>

The inference is that the Bank rely on the security offered and the &#8220;bridging&#8221; nature of the loan, but if that is so the husband has not explained how it has been persuaded that the Company can meet its overdraft and other obligations after the sale of CG Farm (or his thinking as to that). </p>

The end result would in her view be that the holding company (a) would have properties to a value of about &#163;10.8m and an existing secured loan facility of about &#163;1.6m, and thus (b) would be in a better position to approach its bank for further borrowing.  </p>

I confess that I am not clear why a lender who took a fixed charge by way of security would thereby be better protected and why this separation of property and trading has such advantages, because it is always the trading that will finance the interest and repayment, absent enforcement of the security.  Also it seems to me that if such a hiving off of the trading operation was to fail that might create problems for the husband in the context of him being disqualified as acting as a director.</p>

A significant difference is that Ms Howe bases her approach in the short term on the granting of an interest only loan rather than one that is a short term bridging loan dependent on repayment through the sale of assets (and in particular of the best farming land owned by the Company CG Farm), which in November 2009 the husband had not identified as a candidate for sale.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is difficult to put a figure on the maximum amount that Ms Howe considers could be borrowed in the short to medium term.  Neither side pursued this with her.  The indication from her written evidence is that she is of the view that by a combination of (a) the present overdraft, (b) bridging finance involving the sale of assets in the short term (either residential properties or those properties and CG Farm) and (c) interest only finance, the company would be able to negotiate an additional &#163;1.5m of borrowing.  If (b) is taken at &#163;1.5m the total over the existing overdraft would be &#163;3m.  This is subject to the understandable and major provision that the lender would have to be persuaded that there was sufficient present and future profitability to warrant such a loan being made.</p>

But Ms Howe&#8217;s points on borrowing did not suggest the distribution of that profit rather she suggested its use to fund borrowing that could produce the cash (liquidity) to fund a distribution (by declaring a dividend or by remuneration). </p>

The fourth problem makes the quantification of an award that departs from equality more difficult because the sharing is related to the &#8220;windfall profit&#8221; invested after separation and if that investment is to  be treated as a good one it would increase the present capital value of the Company (inevitably on a &#8220;snap shot basis&#8221;) because it would reflect the (as yet unquantified) but hoped for and expected profit which, as Ms Howe pointed out, might return the Company to the position of being able to vote remuneration (or a combination of remuneration and dividend) equivalent to that awarded in 2002 to 2005 (i.e. the years leading up to separation).</p>

If the premise was that the husband was to realise his shares by sale (or liquidation) in my view the effects of the as yet unsuccessful investment in the processing unit after separation would reduce (or remove) the departure from equality and therefore result in the wife having a higher percentage.  This is because the losses caused by that investment at that time are largely the result of that &#8220;active&#8221; business decision to invest, rather than general market forces and so, in my view, it would not be fair to set the sharing award by reference to percentages as at separation carried through to current value.  </p>

The husband&#8217;s interest in HC Farm is inherited and therefore there is a good reason to depart from equality as to that asset.  The pension is small, and the equity of the husband&#8217;s home was acquired with the use of Company moneys post separation and therefore it seems to me follows the sharing of the shares in the Company.  But the matrimonial home (albeit paid for with moneys derived from the Company) was acquired during the marriage and for that reason, and because it was the matrimonial home, in view there is strong argument that it should be divided 50/50.</p>

But to my mind when an instalment order is made because of identified problems relating to affordability the differences narrow (perhaps to the point of extinction) and, in any event, if that is the underlying problem there are sound arguments for adjourning the claim for periodical payments or for making a nominal order, to preserve maximum flexibility to achieve fairness.</p>

The valuations carried out by Ms Howe and counsel for the wife show that the net figure for the husband&#8217;s shares is about 72% of the gross value of the Company.  On that basis the gross values of the Company on the range I have taken for the value of his 85.65% shareholding becomes &#163;11.66m to &#163;9.02m, and if those are reduced by a borrowing of &#163;3m they become &#163;8.66m and &#163;6.02m.  That would then be the underlying value of the Company and would (on the basis that the net value of the husband&#8217;s shares is 72% thereof) mean that after raising the borrowing (and paying out the dividend to the husband to fund the award) the range in the value of his 85.65% holding would be between &#163;6.23m and &#163;4.33m.
