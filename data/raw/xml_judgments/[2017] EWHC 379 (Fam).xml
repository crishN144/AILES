It alleges that she resumed her relationship with Mr ES after his imprisonment for an assault on her and she concealed that from the Local Authority.  She was then harassed by Mr ES but failed to report this to the Local Authority.  She remained in contact with Mr HP after he had been sent to prison for assaulting her and even named him as her birthing partner.  It alleges that she has limited insight and is vulnerable.  It says she is inconsistent in seeking support and has, at times, failed to accept professional guidance.</p>

Indeed, subject to a couple of small amendments and one issue that I will have to decide, the Local Authority's threshold document dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2017 is entirely agreed between the parties.  </p>

It will give the Local Authority parental responsibility for the children.  There will have to be Looked After Children (LAC) reviews and there will need to be the appointment of an Independent Reviewing Officer (IRO).

It does not give the Local Authority parental responsibility.  Subject again to discharge, it lasts for twelve months although it is possible to renew it twice, to give a total of three years.  There is no need for LAC reviews and no IRO is appointed.  Subject to the Police exercising their right to remove pursuant to a Police Protection Order, the Local Authority would have to apply to the court before the children could be removed.  Having said all that, I can direct, pursuant to the Social Services and Well Being (Wales) Act 2014 that the Local Authority prepare a care and support plan for the children.</p>

On the other hand, there is authority for the proposition that I must give full reasons if I am to disagree with the recommendation of a Guardian.  In this case, I have to do one or the other.</p>

There is not, however, nor should there be, any presumption that on proof of domestic violence the offending parent has to surmount a prima facie barrier of no contact.  As a matter of principle, domestic violence of itself cannot constitute a bar to contact.  It is one factor in the difficult and delicate balancing exercise of discretion. &#8230; In this context, the ability of the offending parent to recognise his past conduct, be aware of a need to change, and make genuine efforts to do so, will be likely to be an important consideration."</span></p>

Eventually, however, a consensus emerged that it was not possible to say that it was a non-accidental injury.  On the balance of probabilities, it was thought to be a birth related injury.  In consequence, I have not been asked to find that it was a non-accidental injury. I agree entirely that this was the correct approach.  I have heard the Mother give evidence.  She is clearly a caring and loving mother.  I accept that it is inherently improbable that such a serious injury would be deliberately inflicted on a days' old baby in a hospital.  It follows that the Mother is entitled to a finding of fact that this was an accidental injury. On the balance of probabilities, I find it was caused at birth.  In consequence, the Mother is entirely absolved of responsibility.  She did not inflict injury on her child and that is the finding of the court.  </p>

It was made clear that the Local Authority pursued its allegations of significant emotional harm to the children as a result of domestic violence.   Nevertheless, a parenting assessment of the Mother by the Social Worker, ST, dated 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016 was, in many respects, very positive as to the Mother. It is clear that there is no criticism of her physical care of the children.  She keeps the house clean and warm.  It is maintained to a tidy and hygienic standard.  She is willing to ask for and accept support.  She has encouraged and promoted the children's education.  She is attentive to their needs. The difficultly has been her inability to ensure a consistent and stable home environment due to the children's exposure to domestic violence.  There had been 13 referrals between December 2009 and May 2016 over the issue.  She has recently undertaken the Freedom Programme leading to her having a better understanding of abusive patterns of behaviour but she still requires further support.  The children say they saw Mr HP knock her out and call her a bitch and a slut.  GJ witnessed Mr ES hit her and stamp on her head.  Having said that, the Mother loves the children and her love is reciprocated.  She needs to develop more rigid boundaries but she does have the capacity to meet their needs and is willing to accept support.  She has the capacity for change within the time frames for the children.  The recommendation was rehabilitation.  </p>

There will also need to be work done to address his emotional and behavioural needs.  The assessment recommended letterbox contact to re-establish a relationship as an opportunity for Mr ES to show he can be consistent and sensitive to ER's needs.

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At times during the evidence, the Mother became distressed but I was clear that the emotions she was showing were genuine and appropriate.  She clearly loves her children very much and wants to do the best for them.  I am quite satisfied that the children should be back in her care.  Most of her cross-examination centred around whether or not she had genuinely changed and had recognised the dangers of violent men and, in particular, HP.  I have to say that I consider cross-examination on such issues to be difficult for parents in care proceedings.  She was asked when she had "seen the light" and she said it was when she was told by a hospital Social Worker and the Police in hospital how dangerous Mr HP was.  I do not accept that this was the case although I do not believe she was lying to me.  She may well have convinced herself that this was the crucial moment but I do not believe it was.  After all, she already knew how dangerous he was as he had been sent to prison for assaulting her.  I consider, however, that she has now firmly come to a conclusion as to Mr HP.  I am quite satisfied that the relationship with Mr HP is over for ever.  After all, he has a new girlfriend and I believed both when they said they did not want any contact with each other although Mr HP did want to see TB.  </p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I consider the "light bulb" moment in this case was when the children were removed from the Mother's care.  This had never happened before and it caused her to take a long hard look at how it had come to this.  I recognise that the reason for the removal was the unfounded allegation of assault in the hospital but the Mother realised that it was not just this.  She knew she had to work hard to get them back and she has done so.  This does not mean that I can be sure that she will not enter another inappropriate relationship in the future although I accept she has done good work with LG and has even set up a support network for victims of domestic violence.  I am satisfied that she will tell the Local Authority if she wishes to enter another relationship if only because she knows that there will be very serious consequences if she does not.  </p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">She was asked why she had continued a relationship with Mr HP after he was sent to prison for assaulting her. I am satisfied that she did and, at the time, she misled professionals.  I find that she did telephone him in prison to say that she had given birth to TB but she did not invite him to the hospital.  She explained the continuing relationship on the basis of her pregnancy.  I do have some sympathy for her in that regard. I also recognise the complex features of dependency in violent relationships. I am, however, satisfied that the relationship would have continued without Local Authority intervention.  It follows that the final paragraph of the threshold document, which is to that effect, is proved and will remain in the document.</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">She was asked why she did not want a care order.  Again, I consider this to be a very difficult question for a parent, as opposed to the position if asked to a family law professional.  She told me she did not want a care order as the children had suffered a lot.  She had been stressed by the trauma of separation.  She told me it was important she got support and she needed support.  What she was really saying to me was that she did not want the stigma of the children being in care.  She wanted to look after them as their mother not, as she sees it, as the equivalent of a foster carer.  I recognise that this is important to her as it would be important to most people.    </p>

He denied driving a van whilst disqualified but I accept the evidence of Ms ST that she saw him do so and I reject his evidence that his brother was driving and he was in the middle of a seat of three.  It follows that I cannot accept that he is a changed man without more.  He did tell me he had attended two sessions on the Caring Dad's programme and had six more to go.  Whilst positive, I remind myself that he has always cooperated with probation services yet has continued to offend.  </p>

If there had been no injury to TB, the placement would have been with her.  She said that ST is a very sensitive social worker.  The disagreement between them was that she saw a need here for more complex and intense work with the family than Ms ST.  Moreover, Ms WR felt that there would be times when the Mother would show resistance to the work.  At that point, there would have to be intervention from somebody who has parental responsibility, namely the Local Authority.  She said there was no proof that the Mother appreciates the impact of domestic violence.  I am not sure she is completely correct as to that.  She also said that the difference between the two orders was that there would be an IRO if there was a care order.  Moreover, she said that this was very early days.  </p>

If there is a care order, I consider that it actually makes the position more difficult.  Of course, I can make orders that require the Local Authority to give notice but, if it does so, the Mother would not be automatically entitled to legal aid.  She would have to apply for discharge of the care order (which might be difficult for her if the position had deteriorated from the position today) or for judicial review of the decision to remove, which is cumbersome and not appropriate.  I recognise there are cases where care orders are required notwithstanding placement with a parent but I am of the view that, often, the ability to remove without a court order is a disadvantage of such an order not an advantage.</p>

The Mother has cooperated.  She has indicated that she will continue to do so. She gets on well with the Social Worker.  She knows that, if she stops cooperating or ignores the advice of the Local Authority, she will likely face further care proceedings and she may well lose her children again.  This is a very powerful incentive to be cooperative.  I believe she will do so.  I am therefore of the view that it is not fundamental that this Local Authority has parental responsibility.   </p>

I do recognise that a supervision order will expire in a year's time whereas a care order will not.  I am, however, clear that this Local Authority can, should and will apply to extend it if the Local Authority is of the view that it is necessary to do so.  I make it equally clear that I would expect the Mother to consent to such an application.  It would, therefore, be a relatively simple exercise.   </p>

The need to undertake child medicals is one such advantage.  Turning to the lack of an IRO, I have formed a very favourable impression of the work of this Local Authority in this case.  I consider it will do what is necessary.  Moreover, I can and will require the Authority to produce a Care and Support Plan pursuant to the 2014 Act. I am of the view that this removes any possible disadvantage of there not being an IRO.</p>

The Local Authority would still have the same view and the only point would be if the IRO disagreed.

This is on the basis that the Local Authority will advise the parents as to what contact is reasonable and how to achieve it.  I accept that ER's views are important but not determinative.  He should certainly be strongly encouraged to see Mr ES. It may well be that Mr ES' parents will be involved at some stage.  I am sure that it is in his interests in the long term to have a safe and secure but enduring relationship with his Father.  </p>

In this case, it is fortunate that the Local Authority is prepared to facilitate supervised contact in the long term, even if only on an identity basis.  Equally, I have to pay careful regard to Practice Direction 12J.  I must consider the effect of such contact on the older boys.  I reject the suggestion, tentatively made, that the contact between TB and Mr HP could be kept secret from the others.  That is in nobody's interests.  </p>

He must complete the Caring Dad's programme. He must engage in indirect contact to TB once per month.  I understand that he has literacy difficulties but that does not stop him sending a card or small toy.  He must avoid any further involvement with the Police.  In other words, there must be clear indications that he is not going to drop out of TB's life in the way that he has in relation to four of his other five children.  I accept that he has shown a genuine commitment by attending this case and giving evidence but that is only a start.  If he can do what I have set out, he can have supervised contact commencing in January 2018 and the matter can continue as proposed by the Local Authority, namely twice per annum.  I reject the suggestion it should be four times per annum.  In some respects, this is identity contact only but I can see the justification for it in TB's interests.   </p>
