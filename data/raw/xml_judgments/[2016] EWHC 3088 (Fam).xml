In that earlier judgment, I described the events which had preceded and provoked the launch of <span style="font-style:italic">Part IV</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span> proceedings in relation to the three children, C, D and E in July 2015.  I had hoped to be able to complete the proceedings in April 2016 (see <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/3087" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 3087 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 3087 (Fam)</ref> at [4]), but this proved impossible, largely because of the complex assessment which was required (see below) following the determination of the facts.  The final hearing in fact took place on 25 October 2016.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I deliver this short judgment to indicate my approval of a consent order which will have the effect of bringing these proceedings to an end. By this order, I discharge the interim care orders, and make no further orders.  All three children, together with their newly born baby sibling (F), will remain at home in the care of their parents under no statutory order; each benefits from a &#8216;Child in Need&#8217; plan which has been devised by the Local Authority, agreed by the parents, and attracts the support of the Children&#8217;s Guardian.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is in very many ways a positive outcome to proceedings.  It will have been apparent from my earlier judgment that I was extremely concerned about the children in this case, in the care of these parents who held such radical views about Islam.  Over the course of the last 9 months, they have worked with the Local Authority, and specifically with the jointly appointed expert Mr. Rashad Ali, in a bespoke specialist piece of work, and assessment, in relation to their attitudes and opinions to Islam. There is now good evidence that the parents reject their previous ideological beliefs, which they now acknowledge to have been extreme and unorthodox; there is no evidence that they have in any sense indoctrinated C or D; they have a much more resilient attitude to extreme ideology than previously.  </p>

This was an enjoyable and valuable occasion for me, and I hope for them. Both children spoke freely; C in particular asked searching questions.  Both children presented confidently, politely and maturely; they spoke about their schools, their course preferences and their friends.  As I indicated to the father later in court, it is easy to remark that a child or children &#8220;are a credit to their parents&#8221;, but no one should underestimate the energy, time and parental dedication which lies behind that short phrase.  These children fit that description admirably well.  </p>

These, it seemed to me, were all entirely reasonable requests; the first is accomplished by the making of the final order now.  I have specifically required the Local Authority to give me assurances in relation to the other three. </p>

It is this willingness to explore and discuss their views that has led to Mr Ali making a largely positive and optimistic assessment of their capacity to change. They are to be commended for taking these first steps but as Mr Ali says, they continue to be susceptible to extremist views and further work and education is required.&#8230; He states that the parents&#8217; overall vulnerability for engagement in extremist thought processes and activities continues to be strong and that they continue to search for identity and meaning in their world view.&#8221;</p>

However, I am sufficiently satisfied from the reports of Mr Ali, who is experienced in working with those who hold and promulgate extremist views, that the attitudes of these parents have genuinely changed. The parents have undoubtedly responded more positively to the interventions of social workers during the course of this last year and levels of parental mistrust of authority have undoubtedly diminished.  All of this is a piece.</p>

The parents initially opposed publication, concerned about the risk of identification of the family in the local community, but by the time of the final hearing they raised no opposition to publication.  The Guardian expressed some support for publication, but was aware that C and D were anxious about their details being revealed.  It was strongly felt across the board that if the fact-finding judgment were to be published, then it was in the public interest to provide this concluding sequel.  Taking matters overall, I consider that there is no compelling reason not to publish, and I therefore give permission to the parties to do so in these anonymised terms.</p>
