	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">At the centre of this case, there are two children. I will identify them as A and B. They are four and three years old respectively. Since March 2018 the children have lived with their mother in England. They have had regular and extended contact with their father. The mother seeks court orders to secure the continuation of these current arrangements. The father applies for permission to relocate the children to the Netherlands where he now lives. The parents agree that wherever the children live, it would be ideal that the other parents should relocate to live close to the children where they can be &#8220;coparented&#8221;. In the absence of such arrangement, the parents agree that the children regularly and extensively see the parent who lives in another territory. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Ms Jennings who is the CAFCASS officer appointed to this case, found the parents to be exceptional parents and has no material concerns about either parent&#8217;s ability to parent the children to the highest standards. As such, she finds herself unable to make a positive recommendation about the children&#8217;s living arrangements. She suggests that the children should spend a significant portion of their school holidays with the parent with whom they do not live during the school term. </p>

The father denies making such threats and states that the mother made a unilateral decision to remove the children without discussing the same with him. It is beyond dispute that on 27 March 2018, the mother informed the father that she was taking the children to the beach. Instead she took the children to the airport and left for England where the children have continued to reside. In April 2018, the mother enrolled the children at nursery.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">I accept the father&#8217;s concerns in this regard as well placed and genuine. As he told me, there is a significant difference between living and being immersed in a culture than being tutored whilst living in a different culture. Furthermore, the English mainstream education system is not set up to support their Dutch heritage and language. Inevitably this will require additional resources to be put in place that may lead to the children&#8217;s resentment of their father or their Dutch heritage. I note in recognition of this issue, the mother told me that A has a Dutch friend who she sees regularly. She has also looked into the possibility of extra tuition in Dutch and did not accept the father&#8217;s anxieties in this regard given that the children will be spending significant periods of time with their father and the paternal family. In Ms Jennings&#8217; opinion, whilst this is an important issue, she was confident that the extended periods spent living in their home with the father during the school holidays would go a long way to address this issue. The father has provided details of a school that will teach English and states that this will best meet the children&#8217;s needs. He was unable to answer the mother&#8217;s enquiry of the school who have stated to her that children between the ages of two and five will receive thirty minutes of English lessons each week and there after this will be increased to ninety minutes. </p>

She opines that the children will adjust quickly to their new school or nursery. Much like each parent, she stated that it would be ideal that the parents live in close proximity to &#8216;co-parent&#8217; the children.

She would take any job possible, however unrewarding, if it means being close to her children but explained that this will come at a great sacrifice to her established career and quality of life where she has no friends or support in the Netherlands. Notwithstanding the lack of any direct evidence, the father sought to maintain a position that the mother could readily find suitable employment as a journalist. He invited the mother to reconsider the opportunity to co-parent in the Netherlands. He explained with great dignity and appropriate emotion that there is a material difference between the children visiting him and the children living with him. The latter would involve rushing in the morning to get to school and the normal daily challenges that are absent during the holiday periods. It is those challenges, he explained, that builds relationships and affirms his equal footing in the children&#8217;s minds. </p>

He further stated that whilst a relocation to the Netherlands will be a material change for the children, the benefits of such a change overwhelmingly outweigh a short period of adjustment by the children. During visits, he is willing to open his home to the mother and for the children to have both parents in their lives.

Both parents agreed that this should be more limited. The mother further added that she would hope that this could be a more fluid arrangement that responds to the children&#8217;s needs and the parents plans for the day.

If the children relocate to the Netherlands it is likely that they will continue to learn and use English. I accept that the current school proposed by the father has limited lesson in English. The children&#8217;s exposure to the English culture will be more restricted and limited to the time they will be seeing their mother. Should the children remain living in England, their exposure to the Dutch culture will be limited to the time that they are living with their father. However, to learn and maintain their Dutch language, inevitably requires a greater effort by the parents and the children. Whilst this maybe further ameliorated by seeing their father regularly, it is beyond argument that the preservation of their Dutch heritage will be more limited. </p>

I found her to be entirely child centred and searching for better ways of promoting the children&#8217;s needs. She was very open to suggestions and reflected on her past decisions. This was perhaps best illustrated by her approach to the daily contact with the children when they are in the father&#8217;s care.
