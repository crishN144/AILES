	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by a journalist, Ms Tickle, relating to a completed Children Act 1989 care case involving Herefordshire County Council (&#8216;HCC&#8217;). Ms Tickle wishes to be allowed to see certain documents and to screen an interview with the Mother in that case (&#8216;Ms Logan&#8217;) within a forthcoming BBC Panorama programme. The intention is that Ms Logan would be named and her face and voice unaltered. There is also an application by HCC for a Reporting Restriction Order (&#8216;RRO&#8217;) to place restrictions on what can be reported, including the naming of any employees of HCC. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Tickle represented herself, HCC was represented by Mr Malcolm Chisholm of counsel, and the Children&#8217;s Guardian by Mr Timothy Bowe of counsel. I heard fairly briefly from Ms Logan as to why she supported Ms Tickle&#8217;s application and wanted to be able to &#8220;tell her story&#8221; in public. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I held two hearings on 31 March 2022 and 13 April 2022; I adjourned the decision after the first hearing so that the Guardian could meet with Ms Logan and discuss with her the impact of the proposed programme on the children. In the course of those hearings the parties&#8217; positions, and in particular that of HCC, have changed somewhat and I will record that changing position below. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the time of the first hearing before me, HHJ Plunkett had ordered that Ms Tickle could listen to the audio recordings of various hearings in the earlier proceedings, and no party was resisting Ms Tickle seeing the documentation in issue. The dispute therefore rested on whether Ms Logan could be identified, the steps that should be taken to protect the identity of the children, and whether I should order that employees of HCC should not be identified. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The context of the application and the Panorama documentary is a series of judgments given by Mr Justice Keehan between 2018-2021 containing serious criticism of Herefordshire County Council&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Services Department (&#8216;CSD&#8217;). Mr Justice Keehan was at the time the Family Division Liaison Judge for the Midlands. Those four judgments are as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Tickle also referred to the report of Ofsted in its latest focused visit in August 2021 to Herefordshire CSD in which it said: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The local authority has made little progress in improving the quality of practice for children in need and those subject to child protection planning since the inspection in June 2018.&#8221;</span>  This Ofsted Report was the latest in a line of such reports which have been critical of the quality of the practice of the CSD. She also refers to the concerns expressed by Herefordshire councillors both in public meetings and to Ms Tickle directly about what has been happening within the CSD.  Ms Tickle argues that against this background there is a very strong public interest in a documentary revealing the longstanding problems at HCC.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time of the proceedings in Ms Logan&#8217;s case she had three children, who are now aged 8, 4 and 3. An application for an Interim Care Order was made in August 2018 and an Interim Care Order was made with the children continuing to live at home. A final Care Order was made, and about a year later Ms Logan applied to discharge the Care Order; that was done in October 2020. The nature of the case was not, in the context of public law children&#8217;s cases, particularly unusual, although of course each case is unique on its own facts. The matters pleaded in the original Threshold Document involved a history of domestic abuse between the parents and allegations of fabricated or induced illness (&#8216;FII&#8217;) based inter alia on the very high frequency of visits for medical interventions for the children. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There were a number of interlocutory Case Management Hearings (&#8216;CMH&#8217;), largely before HHJ Plunkett, but there were no judgments given, as is quite normal in this type of case. I have not listened to the recordings, but I understand that at points the Judge is somewhat critical of the handling of the case by HCC. An expert paediatrician was appointed, Dr Ward, who produced two very long and detailed reports. Throughout the proceedings the children remained at home with Ms Logan under the terms of the Orders.  </p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ultimately, HCC decided not to proceed with the FII part of the case, and an Agreed Threshold was produced which did not refer to FII.  The proceedings came to an end when the Care Order was discharged and therefore s.97 of the Children Act, to which I will refer below, does not apply to those proceedings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Tickle was introduced to Ms Logan by one of the HCC councillors who had been particularly concerned about her case, as well as about wider issues concerning the quality of HCC&#8217;s social work. On 2 March 2022 Ms Tickle wrote to HHJ Plunkett, the Designated Family Judge for Worcester and Hereford, asking for permission under s.12 of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 (&#8216;AJA&#8217;) to interview and quote Ms Logan and anyone else in the case who was prepared to speak to her about it, see the documentation in the proceedings, see any transcripts, listen to the audio recordings and identify any adults in the case who consented to be identified. She also requested that her editorial team and the BBC lawyers be permitted to listen to the audio tapes. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note, in passing, that Ms Tickle&#8217;s application was made in a rather informal manner by email and not copied to HCC or Cafcass. Given the growing support for transparency within the family justice system and therefore the likelihood of such applications becoming more common, it is important that journalists who make applications of this nature always copy in the relevant parties so that matters can be dealt with in as effective and proportionate way as possible. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">HHJ Plunkett held a CMH on 21 March 2022. At that hearing he ordered that the children be joined to the application and a Guardian be appointed, ordered that Ms Tickle be provided indices from the previous proceedings, relaxed s.12 AJA to allow Ms Tickle to speak to Ms Logan about the case and to listen to the audio recordings of the hearings, and made various case management directions. He also transferred the case to me as the current Midlands Family Division Liaison Judge. </p>

It was also apparent from Mr Chisholm&#8217;s submissions that the application for no employees to be named was separate from any issue about preserving the anonymity of the children and was not based on any risk of identification of the children through that source. </p>

By the time of the second hearing on 13 April, HCC had accepted that the terms of paragraph (c) above were too wide because almost any information was theoretically capable of identifying the children. It was therefore agreed that this would be limited to specific identifying features, such as name, date of birth and relevant addresses. HCC also narrowed (e) to any employee involved with Ms Logan, although as I explain below that remained very wide on Mr Chisholm&#8217;s interpretation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the second hearing Mr Bowe raised that it had been suggested to the Guardian that words stated by the older child, aged 8, should themselves be shown on the programme. This was the first time that there had been any indication that the child him/herself would be speaking. Ms Logan told the Court that she had recorded the child saying something about the social workers and how upset s/he had had been about their visits. I expressed some discomfort with the suggestion that the child should be recorded, both because of the increased potential for identification and because there was a potential intrusion into the child&#8217;s own private life that had not previously been raised. However, given that this matter had arisen so late in the proceedings, and the urgency given that the programme was due for editorial close shortly after Easter, I left the matter for the Guardian and the parties to consider further as to whether any application would be made to the Court. </p>

On the other hand, section 12 does not of itself prohibit publication of the fact that a child is the subject of proceedings under the Children Act 1989; of the dates, times and places of past or future hearings; of the nature of the dispute in the proceedings; of anything which has been seen or heard by a person conducting himself lawfully in the public corridor or other public precincts outside the court in which the hearing in private is taking place; or of the text or summary of any order made in such proceedings. Importantly, it is also to be noted that section 12 does not prohibit the identification or publication of photographs of the child, the other parties or the witnesses, nor the identification of the party on whose behalf a witness is giving or has given evidence.&#8221;</span></p>

For present purposes the decision of the House on the facts of Campbell and the differences between the majority and the minority are not material. What does, however, emerge clearly from the opinions are four propositions. First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each. For convenience I will call this the ultimate balancing test. This is how I will approach the present case.&#8221;</span></p>

As in so many of such cases, she may have a one-sided view of events and may have failed, and continue to fail, to appreciate legitimate concerns of HCC about the safety of her children.

I made clear that I did not consider this to be a matter for the Court. The Court&#8217;s role is to protect the best interests of the children. It is not the role of the Court to become a quasi-Press regulator, seeking to judge the accuracy of the material which the media wishes to report.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I also note, in assessing the harm to the children and the overall balance, that in criminal cases the kind of restrictions that are routinely imposed in family cases do not apply. The defendants are invariably named even though that will often give rise to a risk of identification of children. In those cases, the public interest in open justice is considered to outweigh any potential harm to the children. There is a particularly strong public interest in open justice within the criminal justice regime, whereas in family cases the interests of the children are central. However, it is in my view relevant that the broader societal interests in open justice in that context are accepted to outweigh any potential harm to children impacted by the proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore, I will allow Ms Logan to be named and interviewed on camera. I will impose the restrictions set out at 14 above, in order to limit the potential for the children to be more widely identified and to limit intrusion into their private lives by their being filmed. The position in relation to the children themselves being filmed is now that it is agreed they will not speak on camera and they will not be filmed in a way that could lead to their wider identification. All of this is subject to the comments I have made earlier about the inevitability of some identification within the immediate community. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a separate issue about whether I should order that employees of HCC should not be named. The power under the inherent jurisdiction and the statutory restrictions in s.12 AJA are entirely focused around the best interests of the children. However, with the exception of the application in respect of the current social worker, Mr Chisholm did not rest his application on potential harm to the children, but rather on more generalised harm to the interests of HCC and its ability to recruit and retain staff. Although by the end of the second hearing Mr Chisholm had accepted that his application for anonymity of employees of HCC was too wide, I will set out here my conclusions for the purposes of considering similar future applications. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am extremely aware of the problems with the recruitment of social workers nationally and in the Midlands.  I also accept Ms Ambrose&#8217;s evidence that there is a particular issue in Herefordshire, both because of its troubled recent history and the rural nature of the community. The role of a social worker is an enormously difficult one, so often being caught between the need to safeguard children, and the impact their work can have on parents in particular. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, the powers of the Court to order anonymisation in relation to professionals need to be exercised with considerable care. Social workers are employees of a public authority conducting a very important function that has enormous implications on the lives of others. As such, they necessarily carry some public accountability and the principles of open justice can only be departed from with considerable caution.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is not a situation where the type of vilification and harassment which was raised in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Abbasi</span> and has become sadly not infrequent in highly emotionally fraught children&#8217;s medical cases, is in issue. The social workers here are not being made subject to a campaign of harassment of the type in issue in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Abbasi.</span> Therefore any interference in the social workers Article 8 rights is certainly not of the level considered in that case, and is no different to any individual who may be commented upon or criticised in a public broadcast.  Ms Tickle and the BBC are undertaking a documentary programme with all the journalistic standards that are applicable. For those reasons I do not conclude that there is a justification for anonymity sufficient to justify the interference with Article 10 rights. </p>
