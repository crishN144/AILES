The judge has given leave for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of the judgment the anonymity of the SF, EF, and any members of their family and of where SF is being cared for must be strictly preserved.   All persons, including representatives of the media and legal bloggers, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with.   Failure to do so may be a contempt of court. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with SF, a Scottish woman in her 40s who has moderate intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, associated periods of severe anxiety, and a diagnosis of difficult to treat schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type).  In an earlier judgment in this case, handed down on 30 June 2023, Aberdeenshire Council v SF &amp; Ors <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2023/28" uk:canonical="[2023] EWCOP 28" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWCOP 28</ref>, I held that SF was habitually resident in Scotland, notwithstanding that she had been living in England and Wales for a number of years, first as a patient detained in hospital under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> and then, since 2022, in a supported living placement in the community. In this judgment I have to consider whether a Scottish Guardianship Order made on 16 June 2021 (the SGO) authorises SF&#8217;s mother, the Second Respondent EF, to consent to the deprivation of SF&#8217;s liberty, as she has purported to do, and whether the court should recognise and enforce the SGO as a protective measure in this jurisdiction.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is agreed, as is clear from the evidence, that SF is not free either to move from her current residence, or to come and go from it. She is subject to physical restraint at times and lives behind doors that may be locked to restrict her movement. She is under the continuous supervision and control of carers. The objective circumstances meet the &#8220;acid test&#8221; for the deprivation of her liberty set out in the judgment of Lady Hale <span style="font-style:italic">in Cheshire West v P </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/19" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 19" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 19</ref>. The arrangements that amount to continuous supervision and control are imputable to the state. SF herself is unable, by reason of her mental incapacity, to consent to the arrangements that amount to a deprivation of her liberty. However, the SGO gives power to SF&#8217;s mother to authorise the arrangements and to consent to the same. If the SGO is recognised in this jurisdiction then SF&#8217;s deprivation of liberty will have been authorised to date and will continue to be authorised so long as the SGO remains in force. If not, then in the absence of authorisation, her deprivation of liberty will have been unlawful and will continue to be unlawful until either it ceases or lawful authorisation is given.</p>

The proposed care package at the Oaks is a situation to which art.5 applies. Powers (a) and (j) are contrary to the expressed wishes of the adult. They amount to a deprivation of her liberty and are an interference with her right to choose her place of residence. However the powers were granted in a specific context namely the safeguarding of the welfare of an adult who lacks capacity and whose living conditions, self neglect and lack of personal hygiene are potentially life threatening. The decision to grant these powers is in accordance with a line of existing sheriff court decisions (<span style="font-style:italic">Muldoon</span>, Applicant, M, Applicant, and more recently <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish Borders Council v AB</span>, 2020 S.L.T. (Sh Ct) 41). In each of these cases the courts concluded that intervention leading to deprivation of liberty should not be taken without express statutory authority governing it. This was not contentious.</p>

In effect a detailed and bespoke care package has been created for the adult to address her specific needs. We are satisfied, given the factual matrix, that &#8220;a matter&#8221; or &#8220;all aspects&#8221; would cover dealing with the welfare issues of transitioning an adult from one form of care and accommodation (e.g. supported care at home) to another form of care and facility (e.g. care in secure premises), ensuring that the adult remains within the facility to address her needs, and to return her there should she leave. The narrow interpretative analysis of the provisions of the 2000 Act by counsel for the adult would serve to undermine the purpose of the 2000 Act and would curtail interventions tailored to the needs of the individual.&#8221;</p>

Having regard to its wording, I am satisfied that the SGO in this case does confer such powers. In May 2022 SF&#8217;s father died leaving her mother EF as the sole guardian under the SGO.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[55] Schedule 3 paragraph 19(3), quoted above, gives the Court a discretionary power to refuse to recognise a protective measure if certain procedural safeguards are not met. It is plain from the way in which Schedule 3 paragraph 19(3) is drafted that the Court only has a discretion to decline to recognise a foreign order if all three of the conditions in the subparagraph are satisfied. In other words, the Court only has a discretion to disapply a measure in a foreign order if it "thinks" that the case in which the measure was taken was not urgent and the adult was not given the opportunity to be heard and that omission amounted to a breach of natural justice. On behalf of PB, Ms Weereratne QC underlines the use of the word "thinks" in paragraph 19(3) &#8211; and, indeed, in paragraph 19(4) &#8211; and submits that by using this word Parliament has set the bar relatively low. For my part, however, I interpret the word "thinks" as meaning "concludes on a balance of probabilities" rather than any lower standard such as "has reasonable grounds for believing".&#8221;</p>

In contrast to sub-paragraph (3), these grounds upon which an application for recognition may be refused are separate rather than cumulative. Thus, the Court may refuse recognition if it thinks that recognition would be manifestly contrary to public policy or the measure would be inconsistent with a mandatory provision of the law of England and Wales or the measure is inconsistent with one subsequently taken or recognised, in England and Wales in relation to the adult.</p>

In addition, however, it is argued that there are further grounds upon which recognition of the measure would be manifestly contrary to public policy over and above the extent to which it is inconsistent with a mandatory provision of the law of England and Wales. It therefore makes sense to consider the impact of sub-sub-paragraph (b) before sub-sub-paragraph (a).&#8221;</p>

	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[93] First, by including Schedule 3 in the MCA, Parliament authorised a system of recognition and enforcement of foreign orders notwithstanding the fact that the approach of the foreign courts and laws to these issues may be different to that of the domestic court. These differences may extend not only to the way in which the individual is treated but also to questions of jurisprudence and capacity. Thus the fact that there are provisions within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that appear to conflict with the laws and procedures of the foreign state should not by itself lead to a refusal to recognise or enforce the foreign order. Given that Parliament has included <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref> and Schedule 3 within the MCA, clearly intending to facilitate recognition and enforcement in such circumstances, it cannot be the case that those other provisions within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that seemingly conflict with the laws and procedures of the foreign state are mandatory provisions of the laws of England and Wales so as to justify the English Court refusing to recognise the foreign order on grounds of such inconsistency. In such circumstances, it is only where the Court concludes that recognition of the foreign measure would be manifestly contrary to public policy that the discretionary ground to refuse recognition will arise. Furthermore, in conducting the public policy review, the Court must always bear in mind, in the words of Munby LJ that &#8216;the test is stringent, the bar is set high&#8217;.</p>
		    </content>
		  </level>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[94] Secondly, there is likely to be a wide variety in the decisions made under foreign laws that are put forward for recognition under Schedule 3. As the Ministry of Justice has observed, inevitably there may be concerns about some of the foreign jurisdictions from which orders might come. But as the Ministry also observes, taking account of such concerns is surely the purpose of the public policy review. Although no wide-ranging review as to the merits of the foreign measure is either necessary or appropriate, a limited review will always be required as indicated by the European Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Pellegrini</span>. That will be sufficient to identify any cases where the content and form of the foreign measure, and the processes by which it was taken, are objectionable. It also seems to me that the circumstances in which Schedule 3 is likely to be invoked, and the number of countries whose orders are presented for recognition, are likely to be limited. In oral submissions, Mr Rees pointed out that, in theory, the Court could be faced with applications to recognise and enforce orders from any country in the world, including, for example, North Korea or Iran. That may be right in theory, but common sense suggests it is, to say the least, unlikely in practice, at least in the foreseeable future. And if such orders were to be presented for recognition, the public policy review would surely lead swiftly to identifying grounds on which recognition would be refused. It is much more likely that the orders presented for recognition will be those of foreign countries whose legal systems, laws and procedures are closely aligned to our own. Concerns of this nature can be addressed by admitting evidence of the process by which the foreign protective measures were made and general evidence relating to the legal system of the state that made the order.</p>
		    </content>
		  </level>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[95] Thirdly, most orders presented for recognition are likely to be of short duration, and/or in respect of persons whose capacity may fluctuate, and/or who are in receipt of a progressive form of treatment. As a result, in such cases there is likely to be repeated requests to scrutinise a succession of orders. Recognition and enforcement is likely to require close co-operation, not only between the medical and social care authorities of the two countries, but also between the Courts and legal systems. The Convention provides a mechanism using the Central Authorities but, pending ratification of the Convention, there may well be the need for direct communication between judges of the two jurisdictions.&#8221;</p>

Mental illness may entail restricting or modifying the manner of exercise of such a right, but it cannot justify impairing the very essence of the right. Indeed, special procedural safeguards may prove called for in order to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental disabilities, are not fully capable of acting for themselves.&#8221;</p>

I consider that the HSE are both entirely correct and accurate when they identify the very close relationship between all those involved in the care and treatment of Irish adults placed in England and those involved at all levels in the Irish system as fundamental both to the fairness and proportionality of the process. </p>

My concern was that there was a risk, with the effluxion of time, that the careful scrutiny afforded by the regime that I have outlined above might become diluted and take on a more routine administrative complexion.

In doing so I note at the outset that it is no part of the First and Third Respondents&#8217; case that the process of making guardianship orders in Scotland is systemically defective. The First and Third Respondents have referred me to the Scottish Law Commission&#8217;s Report on Adults with Incapacity published on 1 October 2014, which recommends amendment of the 2000 Act to include a more detailed legal process for the scrutiny of deprivation of liberty of an adult in a care home or community placement to ensure compliance with ECHR Article 5. The Scottish government published a consultation paper in 2015 but has not yet made any decision as to how to progress the issue. Nevertheless, I am not invited to question whether the guardianship order legislation within Part 6 of AISA 2000 or the Scottish courts&#8217; general application of that legislation fails to comply with Art 5, Art 6, or Art 8 Convention rights. I am concerned with the particular SGO, and the process that was adopted to make it, in this case.

In my judgement, the case in which the SGO was made in June 2021 was not urgent. The application had been made more than three months before the protective measure was granted. There was ample time to have afforded SF an opportunity to be heard. Urgency may explain or excuse the failure to provide an adult with the opportunity to be heard, but there was no such urgency in the present case.</p>

It is relevant to consideration of those conditions that the protective measure was for seven years, was likely to cover the transfer of SF from hospital detention into the community, and that it included provisions for her physical restraint. These factors point to the importance of protecting SF&#8217;s fundamental Convention rights in this particular case. It is also relevant that at the time when the SGO was made, SF was detained as a patient in a psychiatric unit and was already the subject of a guardianship order that permitted the authorisation of the deprivation of her liberty. The European jurisprudence such as <span style="font-style:italic">MS v Croatia (No. 2)</span> (above) raises an expectation that an adult in SF&#8217;s position in June 2021 ought to be heard or, if their condition does not allow for that, ought to have representation. </p>

It was extended automatically by operation of laws passed during the Covid-19 pandemic. SF&#8217;s parents made their application for a renewed guardianship order with extended powers in early 2021. Evidence in support included certificates from a medical practitioner Marcin Ostrowski who visited SF on 11 March 2021 and who certified that she lacked capacity to make decisions about her personal welfare and her property and finances. In a separate document he certified that it would pose a serious risk to SF&#8217;s health if she were to be notified that her capacity was to be medically examined under AISA 2000 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref>, to be told of the results of that examination, and to be informed that her affairs were to be managed under AISA 2000 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref>.

In a &#8220;limited review&#8221;, it is not for me to carry out a detailed analysis of the making of the SGO in 2021 but it appears that the second certificate made by Macin Ostrowski was for an application concerning financial affairs under Part 4 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> rather than a guardianship order under Part 6. Nevertheless, he asserted that SF would &#8220;not be able to understand any aspects of this process &#8230; this could additionally adversely affect her mental state and in turn cause further harm.&#8221; Notwithstanding this warning, Roddy Gourley, a Mental Health Officer for the Applicant Council, interviewed SF on 24 March 2021, albeit for a &#8220;short period&#8221; and over a remote link.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There can be little doubt that SF was not in fact heard in relation to the protective measure (the SGO), but the relevant question is whether she had an opportunity to be heard. An adult may be unable or unwilling to take up the opportunity to be heard, but the requirement is that the opportunity is afforded to them. If they cannot express a view themselves, or could not do so to the court, then steps might be taken, as envisaged by COPR r1.2, and under AISA by means of appointing a safeguarder or advocate, to allow their voice to be heard. An adult who has a guardian, an advocate, and/or legal representation, as was the case in <span style="font-style:italic">PA, PB and PC</span> (above), will clearly have had an opportunity to be heard. SF did not have any such assistance. As COPR r1.2(e) indicates, there may be other means of securing the adult an opportunity to be heard, but in the present case there is no evidence that any attempts were made to ask SF her views about residence, care, freedom of movement, restraint, or decision-making about her life. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment therefore, no opportunity was provided to SF to be heard in the case in which the protective measure was made. Furthermore, having regard to the wide powers granted to the guardians, including authorisation of the deprivation of SF&#8217;s liberty, and the application of those powers to any future community placement, and given the duration of the order (proposed to be indefinite and made for seven years), the failure to give SF an opportunity to be heard did amount to a breach of natural justice. I am sure that all those involved sought to protect SF&#8217;s best interests and that SF&#8217;s parents were properly assessed as being suitable guardians.  I do not doubt that SF lacked capacity at that time to make decisions about her personal welfare. However, there was no opportunity for her wishes, feelings, and views to be communicated to the court and no provision made for her interests to be represented. There were no safeguards for the protection of her Art 5(1) rights. Natural justice required that in a case where SF&#8217;s liberty was being put into the hands of others for a period of seven years, she should have had an opportunity to be heard and/or an opportunity to be represented. SF&#8217;s access to the court should not have been dependent on her taking the initiative. Effective access should have been secured for her. As it is, there were no measures taken to ensure that her Art 5(1) rights were upheld.</p>

I shall consider the second question first. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref>) gives effect to the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights, such that under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s6</ref> it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right. A public authority includes a court or tribunal. Article 5(4) of the Convention provides that &#8220;Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.&#8221; In <span style="font-style:italic">Winterwerp</span> (above) it was confirmed that this provision requires &#8220;review of lawfulness to be available at reasonable intervals&#8221; [55]. In the present case the SGO was made for seven years. There is no mechanism within the SGO for reviews within that period. Although SF now has the Official Solicitor acting on her behalf within these proceedings, that provision has been triggered first by the application by Sunderland City Council and now by the application by Aberdeenshire Council for recognition of the SGO. Neither were a party to the SGO application. If SF had a right to apply for a review of the guardianship order, there was no mechanism provided to give effect to that right. As a person of &#8220;unsound mind&#8221; steps should have been taken to secure the effective exercise of her art 5(4) rights but no provisions were made. In the absence of any representation for SF or any scheduled review, it was likely that the guardianship order would remain in place, without review, for seven years. This was so even when it was known at the time when the SGO was made that SF was considered fit for discharge from her hospital detention. Significant changes in her living conditions were anticipated but no review was provided for when those changes took place. The period of seven years is far longer than the maximum one year period in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> for the authorisation of a deprivation of liberty pursuant to Sch A1, para 29(1).

Decisions may be made by one or more party to bring SF&#8217;s case back before the court in Scotland. For now, within these proceedings, the issues identified at paragraph 3(iii) and (iv) of this judgment cannot be resolved. The parties are invited to agree suggested directions for the determination of those issues.</p>
