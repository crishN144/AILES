The children&#8217;s interests are represented in these proceedings by their Children&#8217;s Guardian, Lee Falksohn.  M is competent to instruct a solicitor directly and is also therefore separately represented in these proceedings.  She wished to attend the hearing and I permitted her to do so.  She also wished to address the court in respect of her wishes and feelings during the course of the hearing and, with the agreement of the parties, I permitted her to do so, as I have done at previous hearings.  Applications for British Citizenship for each of the children are pending.</p>

They reside in the United States of America and are naturalised US citizens.  The parents have seven other children together, all younger than the siblings who are the subject of these proceedings.

He will remain in the care of S under the auspices of a final care order whilst the process of applying for British Citizenship and a US Entry Visa for J is concluded.  On the timescales provided by the experts for these steps to be resolved, it is anticipated that J will move to the care of his parents in the US in around August 2018.  The contingency plan for J should this move not prove possible by reason of immigration difficulties is that he will remain in the care of S;</p>

The local authority and S are agreed that the timetable for M to return to her care should aim for a return by the end of 2017.  M told me she would like to return by November 2017.  Pending that return further work will be completed with S and there will be fortnightly staying contact for M with her.  The process of applying for British Citizenship and a US Visa for M, to enable contact with her parents in the US if M wishes, will continue.  </p>

Whilst she wishes to resume care of M she considers that a return of M to her full-time care prior to the end of December 2017 would be premature and that she is not in a position to care for M immediately.  S is willing to have M in her care subject to M&#8217;s behaviour continuing to improve and to the placement being effected under the auspices of a final care order with the full support of the local authority fostering team.  S considers that rehabilitation must take place cautiously and is keen to work in partnership with the local authority on the work that needs to be done as a pre-cursor to M being rehabilitated to her care.  She welcomes the increased contact that will take place between her and M pending that date; </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Whilst she wishes to return to the care of S, M does not agree with the care plan of the Local Authority as it relates to timing.  Her starting position was that she wished to return to the care of S in September of this year in time to commence education proximate to S&#8217;s home.  When she articulated her wishes and feelings to me in court M was prepared to accept a move in November 2017 but emphasised that given her improved behaviour and the time she has spent in residential care, she thought the move should take place sooner rather than later.  M also made clear to me that prior to any move she wishes to have contact with S at a higher rate than that contained in the care plan; </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">The Children&#8217;s Guardian supports the making of final care orders in respect of all three children based on the care plans that I have outlined.  With respect of the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings, she relates that J ultimately wishes to live with his parents in the United States of America.  She further relates that B wishes to remain living with H and that she is very clear that she does not wish to reside in the US with her parents.  With respect to M who is separately represented, the Children&#8217;s Guardian concurs that a move to S&#8217;s in September would be premature and that further work is required pending such a move.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian is however satisfied the return to the care of S is in M&#8217;s best interests.</p>

In the circumstances and by agreement I have not been required to hear any evidence in this case.  I have heard submissions on the limited question of M&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings insofar as they differ from the care plan of the Local Authority.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, before turning to the background of this matter, it will be apparent that these proceedings have been on foot for a long time and have now far exceeded the statutory time limits stipulated by a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/32/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 32(1)</ref>(a)(2) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> as amended.  The primary driver of this delay has been the complexity of the children&#8217;s immigration position both in this jurisdiction and in the United States of America, which issues the court has had to spend considerable time unravelling with the benefit of expert evidence.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the immigration position in the United States, following the transfer of this matter to the High Court in July 2016, as at September 2016 the rehabilitation of all three children to the care of their parents in the US was being actively considered subject to visas being granted to the children.  However, whilst the court got as far as facilitating contact with the mother in this jurisdiction and directing contact between the children and their parents in the US with a view to progressing further a proposal of rehabilitation, ultimately the children were denied visitors visas for the US.  In addition, during the period in which the immigration position in the United States was being clarified, it became increasingly apparent that B and M were reluctant to move to the US to reside with their parents and that, in any event, the timescales for obtaining permission for the children to enter the US permanently was going to be a protracted one.  In the circumstances, the parties were necessarily required to re-visit the care plans in respect of each of the children, resulting in further unavoidable delay.</p>

The children arrived in the United Kingdom in around 2006 or 2007 with their paternal aunt, S.  The circumstances of the children&#8217;s birth and the manner in which they travelled to the United Kingdom remain unclear and the subject of dispute between the parents and S.  </p>

The parents claim that, thereafter, S removed the children from their maternal relatives in Kenya without permission, took them to Ethiopia and ultimately brought them to the United Kingdom, subsequently claiming the parents were dead.  The parents further contend that S sought to prevent contact.  S states that she brought the children to the United Kingdom when she brought her own son to this jurisdiction and denies that she removed the children without consent of maternal relatives.  She further denies that she sought to exclude the parents from the children&#8217;s lives.  </p>

The children were taken into police protection.  They were placed in foster care and then subsequently with H.  The father visited the children in the United Kingdom for a short period in February 2014.  During this visit the father was granted parental responsibility for the children, the local authority having made an application to the West London Family Court for an order to that effect.  In August 2014, all three children were rehabilitated back to the care of S.  B returned to live with H in December 2014 where she remains to date.  J and M remained in the care of S.  </p>

Thereafter she absconded repeatedly, associated with unknown individuals and placed herself at risk of sexual exploitation, involvement with gangs and criminal activity.  The local authority issued care proceedings on 9 February 2016, after M had again gone missing and had presented herself at an A&amp;E Department.  Whilst on this occasion the local authority did not pursue an issued application for a recovery order, a further application for a recovery order was made on 23 August 2016 and granted after M again absconded.  On 19 September 2016, the local authority applied for a secure accommodation order in respect of M.  On 22 September 2016 Holman J granted an interim order until 6 October 2016, on which date Holman J granted a further secure accommodation order until 21 December 2016.  As I have already recorded, M now currently resides in a residential placement.  </p>

On the other hand, the court should be alert to the danger of wrongly using an interim care order as a means of exercising the now defunct supervisory role of the court (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Minors) (Care Plan)</span> [1994] 1&#160;FLR&#160;253, approved by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re CH (Care or Interim Care Order) </span>[1998] 1 FLR&#160;402).  Within this context, in deciding whether to go on to final care order, the essential question is whether the court has a sufficiently clear picture of the way forward.

Whilst the Children&#8217;s Guardian communicated her wish immediately to the solicitor for B, and sent a reminder on Tuesday of last week, it was not until a month after B&#8217;s request, on the afternoon of the Friday before the commencement of this final hearing, that the solicitor for B emailed the court proposing that I meet B.

The net result of that default on the part of the solicitor resulted in a 15-year-old young person coming to the court believing she would be meeting the judge, or at least being given that impression subsequent to her arrival, when the professional responsible to her had not taken <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> of the steps required to ensure that such a meeting would be facilitated in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic">Guidelines for Judges Meeting Children who are the subject of Family Proceedings 2010</span>.

This will allow the solicitor for the child or the Cafcass officer to deal with those matters set out in Paragraphs 1 of the 2010 Guidelines, will allow the other parties to make any representations pursuant to Paragraph 2 of the Guidelines and, if the judge accedes to the request to meet the child, will allow those matters set out in Paragraph 5 of the guidance to be settled with input from all parties.  Where it becomes apparent only after the IRH that a child wishes to see the judge, the steps required by the 2010 Guidelines should be commenced immediately so as to ensure that a timely decision is made on the child&#8217;s request and properly considered arrangements put in place if the judge accedes to the request to meet the child.  </p>

The local authority&#8217;s updating evidence, including a <span style="font-style:italic">Re W</span> analysis on the question of whether M should give evidence at this hearing, was to be filed by 26 June 2017, that evidence being filed on 27 June 2017.

The local authority solicitor in this case has made clear through Mr Woodward-Carlton that both the social work team and the legal team at the local authority are working under significant pressures.  Mr Woodward-Carlton explained that the social work team is under-staffed and is carrying a caseload that exceeds its capacity.  It is now not uncommon, Mr Woodward-Carlton informs me, for the social worker&#8217;s working day to extend to midnight in order to get through the work.  Mr Woodward-Carlton also informed the court that the legal team is under-staffed and that on the Monday before the documents in this case were due to be filed, the solicitor in question had been working until 4.00am in the morning on other matters.  </p>

Namely that the local authority &#8220;missed the direction to file the care plans by 9 June 2017&#8221; for reasons that Mr Woodward-Carlton could not explain.

The seemingly mundane nature of case management directions belies the fact that they are crucial to the fair administration of justice in a jurisdiction that has available to it arguably the most draconian power available to a Court, namely the power to remove a child permanently from his or her birth family.  Within this context, the task of a case management judge is to arrange a trial that is fair by reference to domestic standards and Article 6 and 8 of the ECHR (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re TG Care Proceedings Case Management Expert Evidence</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 1250" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 1250</ref>).  It is because the case involves the state intervening in the family life of its citizens that it is so important that the local authority comply with the case management directions made by the court.  Directions that are designed to ensure the fairness of proceedings the outcome of which can be grave.  Further, case management directions are the key tool by which the court maintains fidelity to the statutory principle embodied in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> that delay must be avoided.  Within this context local authorities are under a heavy duty to comply fully with orders of the court&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The default on the part of this local authority, including the failure to lodge the bundles on time, resulted in the court not having available to it prior to the commencement of the final hearing the material it required to determine the issues before it, including whether a 16-year-old should give evidence and be cross-examined.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What should be done about the breach of case management orders and the requirements of PD27A in this case?  The first point is that the default cannot go unmarked.  Whilst I accept that the picture is a complex one and that, as Mr Bull and Mr Woodward-Carlton have eloquently explained, practitioners are working hard to get through a huge amount of work on very limited resources, the court cannot simply accept these defaults.  Further, the courts have made clear that the burden of other work is not an excuse for none compliance with the directions of the court.  Whatever the difficulties presented by resource issues, the court will not tolerate a failure to comply timeously with orders (see <span style="font-style:italic">Bexley LBC v W&amp;D</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/2187" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 2187 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 2187 (Fam)</ref> ).  With respect to the failure to comply with case management orders I repeat the following words of the President from his Seventh View of the President&#8217;s<span style="font-style:italic"> Chambers</span>: </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;What is for me is a real concern is something symptomatic with deeply rooted culture in the family courts which have been long established will no longer be tolerated.  I refer to the slap-dash, lackadaisical and on occasion almost contumelious attitude which still too far frequently characterises the response to orders made by the Family Courts.  There is simply no excuse for this.  Orders including interlocutory orders must be obeyed and complied with to the letter and on time.  Too often they are not.  They are not preferences, requests or mere indications, there are orders.  This principle applies as much to orders by way of interlocutory case management directions as to any other species of order.  The court is entitled to expect and from now on Family Courts will demand strict compliance with all such orders.  Both parties and none parties to whom orders are addressed must take heed.  Non-compliance with an order by anyone is bad enough.  It is a particularly serious matter if a defaulter is a public body.  None compliance with orders should be expected to have and will usually have a consequence see <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (A Child) Re H Children</span> [2013] EWCA Civ&#160;117&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second point is that, given the subject matter of public law children proceedings, there is of course a balance to be struck.  Not marking the default at all because the case involves the welfare of a child risks turning the welfare principle into a gross caricature of itself.  At the same time, any penalty visited on the defaulter must not act to prejudice the welfare of the children who are subject of proceedings.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, a failure on the part of social care practitioners, solicitors or barristers to comply with case management orders in public law proceedings places the court in a particularly invidious position.  In circumstances where the proceedings before the court concern the welfare of vulnerable children, which welfare is the courts paramount consideration, it will rarely be appropriate for the court to deal with the default by means of an adjournment, unless this is the only way of ensuring that the proceedings remain fair.  For the same reason, the court does not have available to it the kind of draconian remedies that may be appropriate to mark default in civil cases, for example striking out.  Given the pressures on local authority budgets and the fact that the respondent parties are usually legally aided, an order for costs as a punitive measure will also likely be an order of last resort.  Where it is a local authority that is a serial offender, the court has an option of placing proceedings into &#8216;special measures&#8217; in the way that I did in <span style="font-style:italic">London Borough of Redbridge v A, B and E</span>, requiring weekly compliance reports from the local authority in question, although this places an added administrative burden on both the local authority and the court.  Whilst the court can demand that a letter from the offender in question be written explaining their default, such letters in my experience inevitably promise that &#8216;lessons will be learnt&#8217; before precisely the same species of default is seen in future cases involving the local authority in question.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, I decided that the appropriate remedy was to summon the local authority solicitor to the court at short notice to explain the failures I have outlined.  The solicitor has, to her credit, attended today and has, through Mr Woodward-Carlton as I have outlined, given an explanation to the court.  This has allowed the court to mark the failure to comply with its case management directions and to examine the reasons for that failure.  In other cases, as I have already outlined, it may be necessary to take more draconian steps.  I am, however, satisfied that these steps meet the justice of this case.  </p>
