The application is brought by the father of Ruby, Peter Stewart Uhd (hereafter &#8216;the father&#8217;).  The father also applies under the 1996 Hague Convention to enforce certain orders he secured following Ruby&#8217;s abduction in ongoing children proceedings in the jurisdiction of Australia, requiring the return of Ruby to that jurisdiction (the father making clear he does not seek to enforce a concurrent order requiring Ruby to be placed in his care on return).  The orders were registered, and permission given to enforce those orders by District Judge Gibson on 3 January 2019. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother, Victoria McKay (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;) resists the application under the 1980 Hague Convention on the ground that the summary return of Ruby to Australia would result in a grave risk of exposure to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place Ruby in an intolerable situation for the purposes of Art 13(b) of the 1980 Convention.  In addition, the mother appeals the decision of District Judge Gibson to register and give permission to enforce the orders made in Australia.  She does so on the grounds that (a) pursuant to Art 23(c) of the 1996 Convention the Australian orders were made without her having been given the opportunity to be heard and (b) pursuant to Art 23(d) of the 1996 Convention the transfer of custody to the father is manifestly contrary to public policy.  On giving directions for its determination, Williams J listed the mother&#8217;s appeal to be heard with the application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref>.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">During the case management phase of these proceedings Keehan J made an order permitting details of this case to be reported in the media in an effort to locate Ruby in this jurisdiction.  Following the order of Keehan J, details of this case were the subject of significant levels of publicity in the press.  Specifically, the name and photograph of Ruby, the name, photograph and occupation of the mother, the name of the father, the fact that the parents resided in Australia and the fact that the mother and Ruby may be in a camper van and could be in Scotland, were published extensively by the media.  Following this publicity the mother was located.  Within this context, an Internet search of the foregoing details reveals a wealth of coverage in respect of this case, that coverage identifying Ruby, the mother and the father, together with the circumstances of this case, in the manner that I have outlined. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context and following representations from the Press Association through Mr Brian Farmer, an issue arises as to whether this judgment should be published in an anonymised form or whether, given the publicity this case has attracted by reason of the information the court has already permitted to be placed in the public domain, which publication assisted in locating Ruby, such anonymisation would be futile.  On behalf of the father Mr Richard Harrison QC and Mr William Tyzack take no objection to the judgment being published in an unannonymised format in circumstances where the salient details of the case are already widely in the public domain.  On behalf of the mother, Mr Mark Jarman </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">indicated that if the court ordered the return of Ruby to Australia the mother would seek for any published version of the judgment to be anonymised on the basis that Ruby would have a considerable change of circumstances to deal with without the additional burden of attendant publicity.  On behalf of the Press Association, Mr Brian Farmer submitted that, the public having been informed that Ruby was missing in this jurisdiction, and it subsequently having been reported that she had been found following the court permitting details of the case to be published, it is in the public interest for the press to be able to report on the final outcome of the proceedings in respect of Ruby and, more broadly, on a case that demonstrates to the public the consequences of child abduction.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered the respective submissions as to publicity, having balanced the competing rights engaged, namely the Art 8 right to respect for private life of Ruby and her parents, and of the mother&#8217;s other child, and the Art 10 right to freedom of expression, having considered the question of proportionality and having regard to the extensive information that has already been placed in the public domain by earlier order of this court, I am satisfied that this judgment should be published in its current form subject only to the anonymisation of the name of the mother&#8217;s older child, T.  I am satisfied that in circumstances where this court has already permitted the salient identifying details in respect of this family and the circumstances of the case to be widely published with a view to locating Ruby, there is little to be gained by anonymising this judgment prior to its publication on Bailii.  In the circumstances I have described, even were the judgment to be anonymised prior to publication, the identity of those with whom this judgment is concerned would be <span style="font-style:italic">readily</span> apparent from its facts in the context of material already widely available in the public domain.  Further, it seems to me that there is merit in Mr Farmer&#8217;s submission that it is in the public interest for the press to be able to report the final outcome of these proceedings in circumstances where there has been significant publicity during the initial stages of the same and, more widely, to report the consequences of this case of child abduction. </p>

In seeking to make good that exception, the mother makes extensive complaints regarding the conduct of the father during the course of their relationship, and thereafter within the context of extensive proceedings in Australia relating to Ruby&#8217;s welfare, which proceedings, as I have noted, remain ongoing in that jurisdiction.   </p>

Further, the mother contends that the impact on her own mental health of the alleged abuse of herself and the children, in the form of complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (hereafter PTSD), has likewise been such that, whatever the objective level of risk, the adverse impact on her mental health of an order for the summary return of Ruby to Australia would be such as to result in a grave risk of Ruby&#8217;s exposure to physical or psychological harm or would otherwise place Ruby in an intolerable situation. </p>

Within this context, he asserts that the mother&#8217;s premeditated and carefully planned abduction of Ruby from the jurisdiction of Australia, and her subsequent concerted efforts to avoid detection in the United Kingdom by going to ground in the Outer Hebrides, is simply a further and more extreme element of that campaign to exclude him from Ruby&#8217;s life. </p>

She is a British national but has lived in Australia since she was twenty-one and her right to reside in that country subsists.  The parents commenced their relationship in August 2012.  The mother makes a number of allegations regarding the beginning of their relationship, including that the father had &#8220;stalked&#8221; her in 2005 in an attempt to persuade her to enter a relationship with him at a time when she was in a relationship with her previous partner, Dominic McKay, the father of her other child, T, who was born in July 2009.  The mother also alleges that the father used &#8220;lies&#8221; and &#8220;serious charm offensive techniques&#8221; to begin his relationship with her in 2012. </p>

On behalf of the mother, at this hearing Mr Jarman has reiterated these allegations, making clear that the mother relies on the same together with the contended for effect on her own mental health of an order for return being made as satisfying the exception set out in Art 13(b).  However, during the course of their submissions on behalf of the father, I am satisfied that Mr Harrison and Mr Tyzack demonstrated that a significant degree of caution is required in respect of the allegations raised by the mother having regard to the totality of the evidence that is before the court. </p>

By 22 September 2014 the mother had begun tapering off her anti-depressant medication, although at the time the mother was reporting an increase in her depressive symptoms.  By 25 November 2014 she and the father had engaged in counselling and the mother was describing her relationship as poor.  Again, there appears to have been no mention of domestic abuse on that occasion. </p>

As I have noted above, in her statement before this court the mother asserts that between 2013 and 2015 the father&#8217;s behaviour included serious physical, verbal and emotional violence and coercive and economic control. However, on 28 April 2015, after telling her GP that she was feeling volatile and angry towards the father, she told the GP that the parents&#8217; relationship prior to her pregnancy with Ruby had been &#8220;normal&#8221; with &#8220;infrequent conflict&#8221;.   </p>

This is particularly so in circumstances where the mother conceded to her GP during the mental health care plan assessment on 28 April 2015 that, within the context of her recent pregnancy, she had experienced volatility with anger towards the father, and further conceded during a psychiatric assessment in the family proceedings in Australia by Dr Maloney in January 2018, to which I will come, that under &#8220;severe provocation&#8221;, she had thrown objects, taken a knife and threatened to kill the father.  </p>

A letter written by the GP after this appointment referring the mother to a counsellor states that the mother was asserting that it was her distress, low mood and heightened anxiety that was &#8220;playing havoc with her marriage relationship&#8221;.

On 18 September 2015 the mother is recorded as telling her doctor that the alleged domestic abuse had been &#8220;mainly emotional, no physical / sexual&#8221;. She alleged some physical violence towards T, asserting that the father deliberately squeezed T tightly and placed him in a headlock and used unpleasant words towards him&#8221;.  On 25 September 2015 the mother is again recorded as having given an account to her GP in which she alleged verbal, psychological and emotional abuse but not physical abuse.  The GP letter of that date also records the mother telling her GP that the father had &#8220;been placed on a court order at this stage&#8221;.

Within this context, the last time the parents were alone together was during a perinatal appointment on 5 August 2015.  On 16 September 2015 the mother applied for an interim intervention Order (analogous to a non-molestation order in this jurisdiction) alleging that the father was &#8220;stalking&#8221; her, an allegation denied by the father.  Mr Harrison and Mr Tyzack submit that in making this application the mother made no reference to physical violence towards her by the father, either proximate to the date of the application or historically, in stark contrast to the account now provided by the mother in these proceedings. </p>

However, the evidence before this court, which includes the applications and orders from the Australian proceedings, make clear that this is not in fact the case.   Comparison of the mother&#8217;s application form for an intervention order and her account to this court also raises issues.  The mother&#8217;s application form does not allege physical violence against her by the father, the mother describing an incident where the father verbally abused her, threatened her and harassed her.  There is no mention at all of the father being physically violent to the mother, let alone that he would &#8220;drag me round the house, pin me down and scream in my face&#8221; as alleged in her statement before this court. </p>

However, whilst it is the case that Judge Curtain directed on 2 May 2017 that the proceedings be placed on the Magellan list, that is not the whole story.

A further order to this effect was made on 21 January 2018. The progress of contact proved problematic (for reasons that remain disputed between the parties) and the father issued two contravention applications (akin to enforcement applications in this jurisdiction).  The first, on 15 December 2017, alleged breaches by the mother of the order of 30 August 2017, and the second, on 3 August 2018, alleged breaches by the mother of the order of 21 January 2018.  Once again, the mother appears to seek to exaggerate the position in respect of these applications, asserting in her statement before this court that the father issued twelve contravention applications, rather than the two evidenced before this court. </p>

On 30 May 2018, at the first scheduled session of contact between Ruby and her father, the mother is recorded as stating to a contact centre worker that the father may exhibit inappropriate sexualised behaviour towards Ruby during contact and a female worker would be better able to identify such behaviour.  Mr Harrison and Mr Tyzack submit that this was a wholly mendacious allegation, particularly in circumstances where only thirteen days earlier Magistrate Clifford had found that the father had not sexually abused T and where there had been no other suggestion in any context that the father might sexually abuse a child.  On 27 June 2018 the mother described the father as an abusive parent and on 3 July 2018 again raised concerns about allegations of sexual abuse, contending that the father should not be permitted to take photographs of Ruby at contact as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">there might be concerns regarding sexual abuse allegations</span>&#8221;.

The police report of the incident that is before this court likewise does not record any allegation by the mother at the time of the accident that the father was to blame.  However, by the period during which the Australian court has concluded that the mother was planning to abduct Ruby, the mother was contending that the father had tampered with her vehicle and caused the accident.  A SHIP Family Violence Risk Assessment dated 29 August 2018 indicates that by this date the mother was asserting that the father &#8220;had&#8221; loosened her wheel (the mother also reported during the course of that assessment that she believed the father was having a relationship with his lawyer and that she had &#8220;grave fears&#8221; about how the father was treating his own 90 year old father).  The mother does not point to any evidence which brought about this change of view in respect of the car accident (it is clear from the documents before this court that the wheel that came off the mother&#8217;s car was the same wheel recently fitted by a garage).  </p>

That history included an account by the mother that she displayed behavioural difficulties during her teenage years as the result of having been assaulted, which behaviour caused her to be placed in care for a period of time.  When assessed by Dr Maloney in 2018, the mother had provided the same account (against this, I note that when providing a history during the course of a mental health assessment on 28 April 2015, the mother ascribed her teenage behaviour to a high degree of pressure to perform academically).  Having set out those matters that the mother reported to him during the course of his taking a history from her, Dr McClintock reaches the following salient conclusions in his report (emphasis added): </p>

He was further clear that if the court had the benefit of findings indicating that those events had not taken place, or otherwise doubted the veracity of the mother&#8217;s account in respect of the same, then his conclusion that the mother&#8217;s presentation was consistent with complex PTSD diagnosis would, consequently, become less reliable. </p>

When he challenged the mother about this she asserted that she was &#8220;not putting it on&#8221;.  In answer to a question from the court as to whether he attached any significance to this, Dr McClintock answered that, in his experience, in the same way it was not possible to have complex PTSD in the absence of the events said to have caused trauma, it was not possible to cry without tears. </p>

However, beyond this, Dr McClintock was not able to quantify the impact of a return order.  Within this context, nowhere is his report, nor during his oral evidence, did Dr McClintock express the view that the impact on the mother of returning to Australia would be such as to disable her from caring for Ruby.  In particular, there is no suggestion in the evidence of Dr McClintock that the mother&#8217;s subjective fears are such that, whatever the level of objective risk may be, an order for return would in any event result in a deterioration in her mental health of such gravity as to place Ruby in an intolerable situation in her care or, to adopt the mother&#8217;s assertion in her statement, that a &#8220;return to Australia would be physically and psychologically disabling and consequently impact on my ability to care for the children&#8221;.   </p>

With respect to the impact of this on Ruby, Dr McClintock was clear that he was not, as an adult psychiatrist, able to comment on the effect of Ruby of this outcome.  Within this context, the court has no other evidence on that point beyond the common sense proposition that a child whose primary carer suffers mental health difficulties may be placed in a difficult situation, which proposition falls to be evaluated by reference to any evidence of the manner in which Ruby coped in the care of her mother during the difficult phases of the parents&#8217; marriage (which period included on the mother&#8217;s own evidence, difficulties with the mother&#8217;s emotional equilibrium, mood and levels of anxiety) and the protracted legal proceedings thereafter.  </p>

In his report Dr McClintock also noted that it is to be anticipated that both the necessary medication and the required psychotherapeutic input is likely to be available in Australia.  In any event, in this regard it is quite plain on the evidence before the court that, during the course of the parents&#8217; marital difficulties, and during the course of the protracted children proceedings thereafter, the mother was able to access medical care, appropriate medication and specialist counselling to assist with her issues of mood and levels of anxiety.  There is no suggestion in the evidence that such services would be denied to her if she returned to Australia with Ruby, particularly within the context of ongoing family proceedings in which the court itself ordered specialist psychiatric assessments and the services of a family specialist in the form of Ms Slattery.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to Dr McClintock&#8217;s psychiatric report on the mother, the court has the benefit of two reports from Dr Maloney, an Honorary Psychiatric Fellow at the University of Melbourne, completed in respect of the mother and the father over a year earlier in January 2018 in the family proceedings in Australia.  With respect to the mother, in a report dated 29 January 2018 Dr Maloney describes the mother providing a history of domestic abuse in her relationship with the father.  Having outlined the mother&#8217;s history, Dr Maloney made no mention of PTSD.   I also note from Dr Maloney&#8217;s report that the mother was very keen in January 2018 to paint a <span style="font-style:italic">positive</span> picture of her mental health.  Within this context, I further note the contents of a statement that is exhibited to the mother&#8217;s own statement, dated to 2018, from a friend of hers, Carmen Bulmer, which states &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I do not have any concern for [M]&#8217;s mental health from my observation of her ability to care for young children</span>&#8221;. </p>

On 5 September 2018, and prior to any diagnosis being given to the mother, whether by Dr Maloney or otherwise, the mother is recorded by the SHIP refuge as stating that she was suffering from PTSD but that this had not been diagnosed.  As I have noted, on 21 September 2018, and in the knowledge that she had the day before booked tickets to the United Kingdom for travel on 22 September 2018, the mother secured a note from her doctor stating that she would be unfit to attend court between 21 September 2018 and 5 October 2018.   It was at this appointment that the GP considered the mother was &#8220;suffering symptoms of PTSD&#8221;. </p>

Of course a judge has to be careful when conducting a paper evaluation but this does not mean that there should be no assessment at all about the credibility or substance of the allegations.

She was said wrongly to have rejected it without adequate explanation and to have failed to follow the test set out in &#167;36 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span> in her treatment of the mother's allegations. In summary, the argument was that she should have adopted the "sensible and pragmatic solution" referred to in &#167;36 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span> and asked herself whether, if the allegations were true, there would be a grave risk within Article 13b and then, whether appropriate protective measures could be put in place to obviate this risk. That would have required evidence as to what protective steps would be possible in Lithuania, the submission went. </p>

That is what the judge did here. It was for the mother, who opposed the return, to substantiate the Article 13b exception (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span> supra &#167;32) and for the court to evaluate the evidence within the confines of the summary process. Hogg J found the mother's evidence about what had happened to be inconsistent with her actions in that she had continued her relationship with the father and allowed him to have the care of E, see for example what she said in &#167;37 about the mother not having done anything to corroborate her evidence. She also put the allegations in context, bearing in mind what Mr Power had said about something good having happened in E's parenting, which she took as a demonstration that E would not be at risk if returned to Lithuania (&#167;36). The Article 13b argument had therefore not got off the ground in the judge's view. The judgment about the level of risk was a judgment which fell to be made by Hogg J and we should not overturn her judgment on it unless it was not open to her (see the important observations of the Supreme Court on this subject at &#167;35 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>, supra).  Nothing has been said in argument to demonstrate that the view Hogg J took was not open to her; in the light of it, it was unnecessary for her to look further at the question of protective measures. She would have taken the same view even if the child had been going back to the father's care, but the Article 13b case was weakened further by the fact that the mother had ultimately agreed to return with E.&#8217; </p>

This appraisal is, itself, general in that it has to take into account all relevant matters which can include measures available in the home state which might ameliorate or obviate the matters relied on in support of the defence. As referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span>, at [52], the English courts have sought to address the alleged risk by "extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting state to protect him once he is there.  In many cases this will be sufficient" (my emphasis). </p>

The expression "protective measures" is a broad concept and is not confined to specific measures such as the father proposed in this case.  It can include, as I have said, any "measure" which might address the risk being advanced by the respondent, including "relying on the courts of the requesting state". Accordingly, the general right to seek the assistance of the court or other state authorities might in some cases be sufficient to persuade a court that there was not a grave risk within Article 13(b).&#8221; </p>

Within this context, the assumptions made with respect to the maximum level of risk must be reasoned and reasonable assumptions based on an evaluation that includes consideration of the relevant admissible evidence that is before the court, albeit an evaluation that is undertaken in a manner consistent with the summary nature of proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention.   </p>

As noted above, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span> the Supreme Court made clear that such subjective anxieties are, in principle, capable of founding the exception under Art 13 (b).

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">First, the court will look very critically at an assertion of intense anxieties not based upon objective risk (see<span style="font-style:italic"> Re S (A Child)(Abduction: Rights of Custody)</span> at [27]).  Second, the court will need to consider any evidence demonstrating the extent to which there will, objectively, be good cause for the respondent to be anxious on return, which evidence will remain relevant to the court&#8217;s assessment of the respondent&#8217;s mental state if the child is returned (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (A Child)(Abduction: Rights of Custody)</span> at [34] and see also <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (Child Abduction: Psychological Harm </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 64" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 64</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re F (Abduction: Art 13(b): Psychiatric Assessment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 2 FLR 1115" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 2 FLR 1115</ref>).  Third, where the court considers that the anxieties of a respondent about a return with the child are not based upon objective risk to the respondent but are nevertheless of such intensity as to be likely, in the event of a return, to destabilise the respondent&#8217;s parenting of the child to a point where the child&#8217;s situation would become intolerable, the court will still ask if those anxieties can be dispelled, i.e. whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm can be identified (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (Children)(Abduction: Custody Appeal </span>at [49]).    Within this context, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>Lord Wilson observed at [34] as follows: </p>

If the court concludes that, on return, the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child, then the child should not be returned.  It matters not whether the mother&#8217;s anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable.  The extent to which there will, objectively, be good cause for the mother to be anxious on return will nevertheless be relevant to the courts mental state if the child is returned&#8221;. </p>

Secondly, the Report and the Handbook clearly have abduction in mind, but only in the context of proceedings for return under the 1980 Convention. In that context, both interim contact orders and &#8220;safe harbour&#8221; orders are contemplated. Abduction in cases where the 1980 Convention does not apply is not considered, yet the 1996 Convention clearly provides for wrongful removal and retention in article 7. Far from derogating from the jurisdiction of the home state in these circumstances, the use of article 11 would be supporting it. It would be extraordinary if, in a case to which the 1980 Convention did not apply, the question of whether to order the summary return of an abducted child were not a case of &#8220;urgency&#8221; even if it was ultimately determined that it was not &#8220;necessary&#8221; to order the return of the child. </p>

It would obviously not be appropriate where the home country was already seized of the case and in a position to make effective orders to protect the child. However, as Lord Wilson pointed out in the course of argument, the courts of the country where the child is are often better placed to make orders about the child&#8217;s return.&#8221; </p>

For example, the father&#8217;s apparent difficulties in parenting his step-son become an attempt to <span style="font-style:italic">kill</span> T on repeated occasions. The removal of a bicycle and a set of speakers from a car port following the breakdown of the parents&#8217; marriage becomes breaking into her house.  The proceedings in Australia become child protection litigation that merits being placed on the Magellan list when, in fact, there has been an explicit decision that the case does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> meet the criteria for such inclusion.  A car accident that the mother stated in terms at the time was nothing to do with the father becomes an attempt by the father to cause deliberate harm to the mother and the children. During the course of contact, an attempt by a contact centre worker to get a fractious 2 year old child to her father (who thereafter succeeds in quickly calming her) becomes Ruby&#8217;s &#8220;first direct experience of male violence&#8221;.

She concludes her statement by saying that &#8220;I honestly feel the [father] will not stop until one of us is dead&#8221;.  Within this context, whilst I have given careful consideration to the risk assessments by domestic violence agencies in Australia upon which the mother relies, I must also have regard to the fact that those assessments were based exclusively on the mother&#8217;s self-report, which self-reporting took place in the context I have just set out. As I have noted, examination of the evidence demonstrates that such exaggerated accounts are consistently and markedly at odds with prior statements by the mother and/or the findings of the Australian court. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that these matters constitute a further reason for the court to treat the mother&#8217;s evidence with a considerable degree of circumspection in reaching a conclusion on the objective level of risk inherent in ordering the return of Ruby to the jurisdiction of Australia. </p>

On 22 November 2018 the Australian court observed that &#8220;The mother&#8217;s actions in removing Ruby from Australia without the father&#8217;s consent or the Court order represent a serious breach of her parenting obligations which may attract significant penalty.&#8221;   </p>

First, a parent who chooses to abduct a child from one jurisdiction to another must expect to be the subject of arrest and prosecution. That is simply one of the proper consequences of a parent unwisely taking the law into his or her own hands rather than seeking relief through the courts. It sits ill in the mouth of a parent who has abducted a child to complain about the consequent risk of arrest and prosecution. Within this context, there is a principled argument that the court seeking to enforce the return of the child, and thereby maintain fidelity to an international instrument designed to discourage and prevent child abduction, has no business trying to protect the abducting parent from arrest and prosecution upon their return under domestic laws designed to achieve precisely the same end. </p>

In my judgment, it is perfectly proper for the father to ensure that his undertaking does not bring him into conflict with the domestic laws of the United States. Once again, there is a principled argument that it would be entirely wrong to expect the innocent left behind parent to place themselves in conflict with the laws of their home country in order to prevent the lawful arrest and prosecution of the culpable abducting parent. In short, it is wrong in principle to expect the left behind parent to assume some of the legal risk created by the abducting parent by giving undertakings that have the potential to, or do come into conflict with the laws of the home state. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the caveats the father places on his undertaking are both reasonable and necessary.&#8221; </p>

Whilst it is clear that during the breakdown of the parents&#8217; marriage, and in the protracted litigation between them that followed there were significant periods of strain between the parents, and that the father did commit a minor breach of the intervention order for which the Australian court imposed a penalty, the highly changeable and contradictory accounts that have been provided by the mother do not provide a proper basis for concluding that the objective risk in this case meets the imperatives of Art 13(b).

In speaking to Dr Maloney, the mother made broad assertions regarding historic domestic abuse but did not raise any allegations relating to the period following the parents&#8217; separation and no allegations of abuse of T or Ruby.  Dr Maloney was clear that the mother was keen to &#8220;paint a very positive picture of her mental health&#8221;.  Within this context, Dr Maloney did not arrive at complex PTSD.  By contrast, when the mother came to speak to Dr McClintock a little over a year later, the mother raised detailed allegations against the father both within the period of their relationship and the period following separation and specific and detailed allegations of abuse against T.  With respect to her mental health the mother provided detailed descriptions of serious and protracted symptomology. Within this context, Dr McClintock did arrive at complex PTSD. The distinction between the histories given to the respective psychiatrists and between their respective conclusions further illuminates Dr McClintock&#8217;s cardinal point that his view that the mother&#8217;s presentation is consistent with PTSD is dependent on the accuracy of the history given by the mother to Dr McClintock, which detailed history she did not give to Dr Maloney and which is in any event unreliable for the reasons I have already given. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the exception provided by Art 23(2)(c) of the 1996 Convention, I am satisfied that the relevant orders made by the Australian courts were made in a case of urgency, those orders being made in response to the abduction of Ruby by the mother from the jurisdiction of Australia.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the relevant orders fall outside the scope of the Art 23(2)(c) exception.  Had this not been the case, and whilst it might be said that it sits ill in the mouth of a parent who has abducted a child and gone to ground in a foreign jurisdiction to then plead a failure by the court in the requesting jurisdiction to provide that parent with an opportunity to be heard in subsequent proceedings to recover the child, I am in any event satisfied that the mother was given such an opportunity. The mother was legally represented in the Australian proceedings, with lawyers who attended on 7 November 2018.  At the hearing on 7 November 2018 orders were made for substituted service via email and Dominic McKay and on 9 November 2018 the Australian court expressed itself satisfied that the mother had been served by email.  At the hearing on 28 November 2018, Dominic McKay told the court that he had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">been communicating with [M]... on an almost daily basis</span>&#8221; .  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, having regard to the evidence before this court, and in particular to the assessment of Ms Slattery and the reports from the contact centre, I am satisfied that it cannot be said that the relevant orders of the Australian court are contrary to public policy for the purposes of Art 23(2)(d).  In the context of the abduction by the mother of Ruby from the jurisdiction of Australia, the orders represent the outcome of a considered welfare decision by a competent court in the context of a child abduction and where there is evidence that the left behind parent is capable of meeting the welfare needs of the child.  Before making the relevant orders the court in Australia heard submissions from the father and on behalf of the separately represented child.  The court had the benefit of, and considered, the recommendations of Joy Slattery which considered that there was no risk presented by the father having unsupervised time with Ruby. Within this context it cannot be said that the orders seeking to effect the return of the child to the jurisdiction and to place the child in the father&#8217;s care on an interim basis were orders that were contrary to public policy. Indeed, those orders come nowhere near to engaging the public policy exception in Art 23(2)(d) of the 1996 Convention. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">On the information available to this court, I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s actions in removing Ruby from the jurisdiction of Australia represented a blatant and premeditated act of child abduction.  That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that having abducted Ruby from the jurisdiction of Australia, the mother sought to go to ground in the Outer Hebrides in an effort, I am satisfied, to avoid detection.  For the reasons I have set out, this court is also left with the strong impression that thereafter the mother sought before this court to distort and misrepresent the facts in this case </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">For the reasons I have given, I am satisfied in this case that the mother has not succeeded in that aim.  Within this context, I am satisfied that I must order the summary return of Ruby to the jurisdiction of Australia for the disputes between the parents as to her welfare to be determined in the jurisdiction of Ruby&#8217;s habitual residence.  I am further satisfied that, in light of the history of this case, that Ruby&#8217;s return should be by way of a direct flight from the jurisdiction of England and Wales to the jurisdiction of Australia without transit through a third country.  I accept the undertakings offered by the father as set out above, within the context of which undertakings the order for return will be executed.  For the reasons I have given, I dismiss the mother&#8217;s appeal with respect to the registration and enforcement under the 1996 Hague Convention.  I will invite counsel to agree an order accordingly. </p>
