If, which is hotly in dispute, the parties went through a ceremony of customary marriage on 16 March 2002, they had separated by no later than February 2003 when M lodged her first divorce petition.  Ever since then there has been litigation in England and Nigeria over 21 years.  This litigation has taken place under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, Schedule 1 Children Act 1989 and Part III of the 1984 Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 12 March 2024, some 12 years after the ruling of the Court of Appeal, M&#8217;s appeal came before the Nigerian Supreme Court.  About the only matter that is agreed between the parties is that it concluded with M withdrawing her appeal and it being dismissed.  There is no transcript but I have seen notes of what transpired prepared by each side&#8217;s Nigerian lawyers.  Given the history of this case it is no surprise they do not begin to agree about what transpired at court.  It is however, obvious, that M&#8217;s counsel was given a difficult time by the Justices.  She was put under great pressure to withdraw, and eventually succumbed.</p>

The application was only referred to me a few days later.  I had at the hearing been minded to list the application to strike out together with the substantive application but when the application was finally presented to me by way of box work with not only a statement but a large number of exhibits that I had not previously seen, it seemed to me clear that the better course was to hold a separate one day hearing to deal with the application.  Both sides sensibly agreed that this was the appropriate way forward.</p>

(And in that context she did not raise the point in Nigeria whether such a celebration and intention could constitute an effective customary marriage).

The words come from authority binding on this court: Arbuthnot Latham Bank Ltd v Trafalgar Holdings Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 1426; but they are not words which derive from the statute, nor from the Civil Procedure Rules, and they should not be treated as if they had. Nor should they be employed as some form of ritual incantation. If the judge in this case had chosen to express the same principle by saying &#8220;very good reason&#8221;, or &#8220;powerful&#8221; or &#8220;sufficient reason&#8221;, he would not, in my judgment, have misdirected himself.</span>&#8217;</p>
