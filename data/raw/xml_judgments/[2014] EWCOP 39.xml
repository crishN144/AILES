Not giving her sons notice of this application (as required) appears underhand and calculating. At best, it shows a carelessness as to their responsibilities to her. At worst, it indicates an intention to strip her of any valuable assets behind the backs of her blood relatives.</p>

They now request that the court appoints Peter Blake and Paul Dickie as joint and several deputies. Both are partners at Prettys Solicitors and that firm has written to the court to confirm that it would consent to their appointment. In the alternative, the court should appoint a panel deputy. Although there will be costs to BIM as a result of the appointment of a panel deputy, this is justified given the behaviour of the applicants and the remoteness of their connection to her. </p>
