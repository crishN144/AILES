Emergency surgery was required to remove the tumour in January 2013; while the tumour was successfully removed, unfortunately the surgery has left RCW without sight.  Within days of the operation, LBX informed RCW that it intended to remove SB from her care.  By my injunction, their plan was (at least temporarily) halted.</p>

At that hearing, I further specifically encouraged LBX to pursue enquiries with a specialist Occupational Health Agency called Focal Point UK.  Focal Point UK specialises in v<span style="color:#000000">isual impairment training, vision rehabilitation training, and support services; LBX wished to </span>ascertain whether that organisation could support and train RCW in her parenting of SB, having regard to her visual disability.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sadly there has been no improvement in RCW&#8217;s vision; she remains blind, regaining no visual facility since the operation on 8 January 2013.  She reports occasional pin-point peripheral flashes of light, but no more than that.  The prognosis for her future vision is at best uncertain; RCW has been advised by her treating consultants that it may take 18-24 months before repair to the optic nerve is complete. While this leaves her hopeful of some restoration of sight, RCW appears realistic about (or at least accepting of) the prospect that this will not happen.   The plans for SB&#8217;s future have been predicated on the basis that RCW will remain significantly visually impaired.</p>

The operation, I am pleased to say, has been successful restoring greater functionality to SB, endowing her with an expanded repertoire of babble and chatter (much to the obvious delight of those who care for her).  RCW stayed with SB in hospital over the period of the operation, sleeping in a bed by her, appropriately able to offer SB comfort and re-assurance.</p>

Importantly the team, impressed by RCW&#8217;s motivation and spirit, confirmed that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">there is no evidence that RCW&#8217;s visual disability is having a negative effect on [SB]&#8217;s growing attachment to her.  &#8230; a secure attachment is developing</span>&#8221;.  The Great Ormond Street team emphasised in its detailed report the importance of a sustained package of practical support for RCW going forward, very strongly favouring the ongoing involvement of Focal Point UK.  Indeed in performing its overall review of the progress of the placement, the two teams (i.e. Great Ormond Street and Focal Point UK) &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">concluded that there are probably very few situations where visual impairment would significantly compromise a parent&#8217;s responses</span>&#8221; provided that the parent has learned strategies to compensate. The Great Ormond Street team encouraged me to make an adoption order in this case in favour of RCW, on the basis that I am satisfied that appropriate supports for RCW are in place.</p>

Focal Point UK has performed invaluable work in assisting RCW to develop new skills, and manage care tasks for SB, given her sudden sight loss.  Having undertaken 11 sessions with RCW, Focal Point UK reports that RCW has been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">highly motivated</span>&#8221;, and swift to learn new aptitudes as a blind parent providing safe care for, and in the home of, a small child; they comment most favourably on RCW&#8217;s overall ability to care for SB with her disability.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr. M (Consultant Social Worker) whose evidence had been laid before the court in February 2013 in an attempt to justify the proposed removal of SB (see <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/235" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 235 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 235 (Fam)</ref> &#167;[3]) has filed further evidence for this final hearing.  In his more recent statement, he honourably acknowledges that the local authority &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">should have managed this delicate and emotive matter differently</span>&#8221; [C25].  His statement contains descriptions of his recent visits to RCW and SB, indicating that at no time in the period since I granted the injunction has he had concerns about the standard of care offered to SB &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">who has consistently presented as being a happy and contented child</span>&#8221;.  He comments that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For several months, practical assistance for RCW in caring for SB has been offered to RCW by a number of her friends; their moral and practical support has been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unstinting</span>&#8221; (per RCW), given generously &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not for financial gain or glory</span>&#8221; but because they believe that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">SB and I are a team worth fighting for</span>&#8221; (ibid.). Since 19 May 2013, that support has largely been replaced by professional carers; RCW has welcomed this, and a good working relationship has been established.  Further specific support and assistance will be required to facilitate RCW&#8217;s mobilisation outside of the home, cooking and overnight support.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the immediate and medium-term future, RCW will plainly need support in parenting SB. The professional advice (Great Ormond Street, Focal Point UK and LBX) is that RCW should continue to receive full-time live-in support for the next 12 months or so.  RCW had hoped to be able to reduce this level of support within a shorter period, but now acknowledges the wisdom of the professional advice; she is planning a change in the supportive arrangements to introduce a live-in housekeeper/nanny (in place of the current 24/7 care) starting in March 2014.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The financial burden on RCW of the professional supports, and legal fees, has not been inconsiderable.  Even though LBX proposes to assist with the funding of further involvement of Focal Point UK for the next 12 months, the critical illness policy and sick pay arrangements of her current employer only go some way to meet the burgeoning costs.  RCW is hoping to be able to return to work within a year from now, and has been in discussions with her employer to achieve this; her employer plainly values RCW highly, and has enthusiastically accepted the need to make reasonable adjustments and flexible working in order to achieve RCW&#8217;s return to the work place.  This will coincide with SB&#8217;s more regular attendance at nursery. </p>
