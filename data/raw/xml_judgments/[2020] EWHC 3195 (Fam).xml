The appellant, who is the younger brother of the Deceased, acts as an Executor of the estate of the Deceased, along with Mohamed Arshad Khan, who is the brother in law of the Deceased&#8217;s second wife.  The Respondents to the appeal are the persons entitled to a share in the residuary of the Deceased&#8217;s estate under the terms of his will, namely the Deceased&#8217;s widow and three children from his first marriage  </p>

I offer my apologies to the parties for the length of time it has taken to give this judgment on the issue of costs.  I am only able to pray in aid as an explanation for the delay the unprecedented level of work created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of which started to be felt and thereafter grew exponentially shortly after I handed down my substantive judgment in this matter.  In particular, I should make clear that both Mr Dumont and Ms Stanley provided their written submissions as to costs on time as directed.  The delay in providing this decision lies entirely with the court. </p>

Two Skeleton Arguments were filed, notwithstanding no direction for a second Skeleton Argument, totalling 29 pages. </p>

The statement of costs was a difficult document to prepare. Care had to be taken to ensure that costs for the underlying dispute with the Appellant as executor and the litigation over the statutory demand for his costs liability should not be included.  Within this context however, Mr Dumont recognises that time spent on preparing costs schedules is a particularly sensitive issue and that the respondents&#8217; will accept a 15% reduction to &#163;750, i.e. a reduction of &#163;139. </p>

Further, Mr Dumont points to the fact that the respondents were threatened with a claim for the appellant&#8217;s costs of &#163;57,965 plus VAT, more than twice the amount of the respondents&#8217; costs. Within this context, Mr Dumont notes that the appellant is only offering &#163;16,284 plus VAT, which equates to a mere 28% of the costs spent by the appellant.  Within this context, Mr Dumont argues that the appellant&#8217;s submission that the respondents&#8217; solicitors&#8217; costs should be reduced by 60% is unsustainable. </p>

Within this context, instead of accepting the order of the District Registrar that required appellant do what he accepted he had a duty to do, that he had promised to do and which he had delayed for over a decade in doing, he decided to put the respondents to further expense, delay and inconvenience by requiring them to meet an appeal of dubious merit.  All this notwithstanding that, as I again observed in the judgment, the appellant&#8217;s obligation to account was of cardinal importance, that the Respondent beneficiaries, the Deceased&#8217;s widow and three children from his first marriage, had been without a proper understanding of the extent of and the administration of their inheritance for over a decade and that it was unconscionable for this situation to pertain any longer. </p>
