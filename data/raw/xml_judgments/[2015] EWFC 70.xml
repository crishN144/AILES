It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, while others will flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability.  These are the consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not the provenance of the state to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting; in any event, it simply could not be done.&#8221;</span></p>

He said it was time to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">call a halt</span>&#8221;.  The evidence placed before the court must address all the options which are realistically possible and must contain an analysis of the arguments for and against each option and, in particular, the nature and extent of the risk of harm involved in each of the options (Paragraph [34]).  The need for analysis of the pros and cons and a full reasoned recommendation was essential if the exacting test set out in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> and the requirements of Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention are to be met (Paragraph [36]).  There must be adequately reasoned judgments (Paragraph [43]).  The court rejected a linear approach whereby each option other than the most draconian is considered and rejected in isolation.  Instead, a balancing exercise is required in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives.  Each option should then be compared, side by side, against the competing option or options (Paragraphs [49] &#8211; [50]).  </p>

Mr S was concerned he may have a dominant/controlling personality.  He presents in a loud and agitated way and is unable to appreciate appropriate social behaviour.  There were concerns in relation to a number of his previous relationships.  One woman, H, had a ten year old daughter, W.

The T Local Authority told the woman that, if she did not end the Father&#8217;s contact to W, they would apply for an Emergency Protection Order.  There were allegations of the Father kicking down a bathroom door during an argument.  </p>

It was regrettable that it took some four months to complete the paternity test but, when he was proved to be the Father, he was introduced to Y in April 2015.  Contact was supervised.  Although there were initial concerns in relation to the Father failing to follow advice, there were many positives.  The Father is registered disabled following accidents to his hand at work.

The Local Authority states that it has ruled out rehabilitation to either parent.  The timescales for Y are not compatible with either parent achieving sustained change.  It proposes placement for adoption with contact to be gradually reduced to once per week for two hours for the Mother and fortnightly for the Father until a farewell contact following the identification (matching) of the adopters.  A decision had been made not to introduce Y to his siblings until there was certainty as to his future and that there was no merit in doing so now.  There should, however, be indirect letterbox contact post-adoption.</p>

It says that Y&#8217;s welfare requires the consent of both parents to adoption to be dispensed with.  There have been negative parenting assessments of both the Mother and the Father and, as there is no other prospective permanent carer, adoption is the only possible outcome.  The Mother has recently nominated a sister as an alternative carer but this came very late in the day.  The Mother had been specifically asked for such nominations even before the commencement of proceedings and had been warned that a late nomination would not be acceptable.  An attempt will, however, be made to contact the sister.  It is argued that long term foster care does not offer appropriate permanency, stability and certainty for Y.  The current foster carers do not put themselves forward in the long term to care for him.  </p>

He told me he diagnosed this condition himself, although he said the doctors later confirmed his diagnosis.  I do not know whether or not this was correct.  It is the excuse he uses for the many serious allegations she made against him.  Although he says that it was totally unjustified, the simple fact of the matter is that T Local Authority said that, if H continued to allow the Father contact to W, it would apply for an Emergency Protection Order. This undoubtedly shows how seriously the Authority was taking the matter.</p>

There are though disturbing allegations that the Father had an unhealthy fixation with W.  I will merely make findings as to the matters of which the Father spoke.  The records say that he said he was very close to W and, on one occasion, he had a cuddle with her and their &#8220;bodies were like hot-boxes generating heat which went inside each other&#8221;.  It resulted in them falling asleep together.  I have already noted that the Father denied saying this in his second statement. He argued that it was another wild allegation from H.  But when he was cross-examined on it more closely, he accepted that he had said this.  He explained it on the basis that it was a hot day and both he and W were very hot and, in effect, making each other hotter by cuddling. Whatever the position, what he said was deeply disturbing.  He accepted that H found W curled up sleeping next to him the next morning, although it appears to have been in the living room.  He should never have let this happen.  It explains the Local Authority concern.  </p>

The records say that the Father was reported by W&#8217;s school to be dominant.  The school had to remove him from their text messaging service.  He told me that he was only on the service as H had lost her telephone or it had stopped working.  He said that he asked for his telephone to be removed from the list but I do not accept that. At the very least, he was taking on a parenting role very quickly.  At worst, he was trying to usurp H&#8217;s position.</p>

He said he did his best to keep the arguments away from W but he clearly didn&#8217;t succeed.  Indeed, he said that W was upset as he had had a &#8220;massive argument&#8221; with her mother and she was scared.  At another point in his evidence, he told me that he would ensure that Y did not experience the terrible childhood that he had but he was not able to prevent W from experiencing that sort of behaviour.  He was either unable or unwilling to protect her. Eventually, the Mother and W were taken away by the Local Authority.  The Father told me that she kept contacting him thereafter.  He did admit that the Local Authority considered him to be the problem, rather than H.</p>

I asked how this occurred.  His answer was extremely concerning.  He told me he had been looking after a couple of kids aged 9 and 13 and that they had repeatedly kicked him there.  He said they thought it was funny.  I asked him why he didn&#8217;t stop it.  He said he was able to stop it at times.  He added that it was up to the parents to stop it.  I found this the most disturbing aspect of his evidence.  He was badly hurt by this.  Yet he was unable to stop a nine year old and a thirteen year old from doing it to him.  Why were they doing it in the first place?  This is not normal behaviour at all.  It shows a complete inability to ensure that children in his care respect proper borders.  In short, he was unable to control them.  </p>

It is abundantly clear that there was a significant period when he was attempting to obtain prescriptions for codeine on numerous occasions when he had already been given sufficient amounts of the drug for the maximum safe dose.  The various GPs he saw undoubtedly took the view that this was the case. He denied it to me forcefully.  He told me that there were &#8220;possibly more than ten occasions&#8221; on which he had left his medication behind by accident when away from home.  He asserted that there was a lodger of his that was stealing his medication and he did not realise for many months.  On one occasion, a prescription had been altered.  He told a GP that he had lost it in the street but had later found it again. Some unknown person had in the interim altered the date and he hadn&#8217;t realised.  Frankly, this was a &#8220;cock and bull&#8221; story that no sensible person could possibly believe.  It did him no credit that he was not prepared to accept that to me.</p>

A responsible parent might, on perhaps one occasion, leave his or her medication behind whilst away.  A responsible parent would not do so on ten occasions.  A responsible parent should realise within days that medication is being stolen from them. It should not take months.  I do not believe the Father&#8217;s evidence to me in this regard.  I find that, at times, he was taking excess doses of codeine.  Having denied it initially, he did eventually accept that he had historically had a problem with codeine and that he &#8220;would take more than I should as I was in so much pain&#8221;.  The concern here is that he is asking to parent a young baby.  What is the effect on him of taking excess codeine?  I find that doing so would endanger a young child.  </p>

I accept his evidence that he only takes anti-depressant medication when he feels the symptoms coming on and that he is at present clear of any difficulties.  My concern, however, is that these problems arise from his childhood problems.  The medical notes indicate that he has been offered both Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Counselling.  The notes say he rejected these offers of assistance.  He accepts that he rejected one.  He says that he accepted the other offer of help although he was not clear which one.  This does not, however, assist as he says he only went to see the counsellor, Dave, once.  He claims he did not receive notification of a second appointment.  Even if true, it shows that he has not chased up such an appointment.  I consider this aspect serious.  Given everything he has told me, he desperately needed such help but he has either not been prepared to do so or has failed to follow it up.  He says that he is now prepared to do so but it is well known that such treatments take a considerable time and can be very painful experiences.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are numerous lesser concerns outlined in the parenting assessment.  I propose merely to highlight a couple.  It is said that the Father was, at least initially, reluctant to accept advice.  He denies this but there are two incidents of concern during contact.  The first was when he placed Y on a worktop and held him with one hand whilst preparing a bottle.  The worktop was slightly higher than the tables in court.  This could never be appropriate when dealing with a baby.  The second was when he was carrying Y on his forearm facing downwards, as though Y was flying like Superman.  Three people present in the room advised him against this but he would not accept their advice.  He told me this was because Y was comfy and happy and it was ok if you know you have him well held.  This is how accidents happen.  It was quite wrong of him not to accept advice.  </p>

They live approximately 78 miles away.  The one friend, who he has specifically relied on, V, is an elderly gentleman who is not in good health.  He told me Mr V has had ten heart attacks.  I have not heard any medical evidence but I very much doubt that anyone could have ten heart attacks and survive.  The Father is exaggerating.  He did, however, accept ultimately that on a day to day basis, the care of Y would just be him.</p>

She accepted that, if possible, a child should be brought up by his birth family.

Even if a psychologist was able to say that there were things that could be done with the Father, it is quite clear that any such work would be far outside Y&#8217;s timescales.  It is not as though the Father did not have a chance to undertake Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.  It was offered to him.  I find that he refused to undertake it.  Either he thought it was unnecessary or he thought it would be too painful.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that it was the former.

I accept that there would be a advantage of him being able to have some form of relationship with his parents and also his half-brothers and sister but it is massively outweighed by the disadvantages.  He would lack permanence, security and stability.  Whilst adoption means he will be treated differently to his half-siblings, the differences in their positions are huge.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The Father does not.  It is, however, clear that it is overwhelmingly in Y&#8217;s interests for such an order to be made.  Nothing else will do.  It therefore follows that I must make the placement order and I must dispense with the Father&#8217;s consent.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I approve the care plan.  Contact hereafter will be in the discretion of the Local Authority but I agree that it should be reduced as they propose.  I further agree that there should be a farewell contact once the adoptive placement is identified as opposed to placement occurring.  The introduction to the adopters is an important time.  I consider it sensible to assume that the best way to achieve it smoothly and quickly is to terminate contact to the birth family before it takes place.  I agree to the proposals for indirect contact.</p>

I want to thank all professionals involved for the great assistance they have given to me.  In particular, I want to commend the way in which the case has been conducted by counsel.  Nothing more could have been said or done on behalf of any of the parties and, in particular, on behalf the Father.</p>
