	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have been provided with five lever arch files comprising the trial bundle. Prior to, and in the course of, the hearing I have been able to read much of that documentation, in particular the affidavit of the applicant in support of the committal application which also adopted three previous statements made by the applicant in 2016 and 2017. I&#8217;ve read the respondent&#8217;s statement in relation to the enforcement application and his affidavit in respect of the committal. Mr Horton made clear in his skeleton argument that the court was invited to read them but that they should not be taken into account in evidential terms prior to the submission of no case to answer and the respondent&#8217;s election as to whether or not he would give evidence or would exercise his right to remain silent. I had the benefit of some preliminary documents including a summary prepared on behalf of the applicant by her previous counsel which set out the evidential basis of the committal. The applicant herself had filed a position statement and a chronology. Mr Horton provided a comprehensive and detailed 21-page Skeleton Argument together with a bundle of 11 authorities. As will become clear in this judgment the reason for its length and complexity was the multiplicity of substantive and procedural deficiencies which Mr Horton identified in the committal application.  In the course of the hearing I was provided with further authorities, some further evidence in the form of emails and letters, some schedules provided by Mr Horton and following the conclusion of submissions of no case to answer, written applications to amend the grounds to particularise ground 12, and to be permitted to proceed with ground seven as if a judgment summons had been issued. </p>

He also admitted various facts in relation to ground 12 but did not accept that they amounted to contempt. The respondent then gave evidence in particular in relation to his ability to pay the school fees. He was robustly cross-examined by Ms Alexander at some length. At the conclusion of his evidence I heard submissions in relation to ground 12. Mr Horton submitted that the form of indemnity contained in the undertaking only carried with it a financial obligation and that given the wife&#8217;s acceptance that she had not paid any of the school fees, nor suffered any financial loss, the respondent was not in breach. He also submitted that it was clear on the evidence that the respondent was unable to pay the school fees which had led to the issuing of a County Court judgment and the seizure of the applicant&#8217;s car by bailiffs, and thus it was submitted that the applicant could not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent had been able to pay the fees or the judgment and had wilfully refused to pay. Ms Alexander submitted that the evidence demonstrated that the respondent did have access to funds and thus could have paid. I gave my judgment in court at the time. I concluded that the applicant had not established on the evidence so that I was sure (or beyond reasonable doubt) that the respondent had the means to pay and had wilfully refused to pay. I therefore dismissed ground 12.</p>

After hearing mitigation from Mr Horton, and seeking the applicant&#8217;s views in terms of whether sentencing should be adjourned or not, I delivered a judgment in which I concluded that the breaches were not sufficiently serious to warrant immediate committal to prison or suspended committal. I concluded that they were sufficiently serious to warrant a financial penalty but was unable to determine whether the respondent was in a position to pay such a penalty. Given the nature of his business by November, when Mr Justice Coen is due to consider a financial remedy application, a clearer picture as to the respondent&#8217;s finances might emerge. I therefore adjourned sentence to await developments in that hearing. I gave a judgment in court dealing with sentencing.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Both the applicant and the respondent described the respondent&#8217;s business as having highs and lows. The bursting of the dot-com bubble and the global financial crash both had a serious impact on his businesses. At one point the family home in Belgravia had to be sold as they could not afford it anymore. The respondent says that the last truly significant deal which netted a significant sum for the family was as long ago as 2011, and since then although he has been able to undertake work and has seen through various deals none have resulted in a significant success fee. In March 2013 the parties separated and in September 2013 the wife petitioned for divorce. At some point a bridging loan was taken which was secured on the former matrimonial home. The parties believe that it was worth in excess of &#163;4 million. On 27 November 2014, following an FDR before Mr Justice Mostyn, the parties reached a compromise which was recorded in an order of that date. Under the order, the former matrimonial home was to be sold with the expectation that after repayment of legal expenses loans and school fees the wife would receive close to &#163;1 million. Various undertakings provided for her to receive sums of money in relation to 2 particular deals that the respondent was then hoping to bring to fruition. A nominal periodical payments order was made in respect of the applicant and no maintenance was provided for in respect of the children. However the respondent did undertake to be solely responsible for the children&#8217;s educational costs (if any) and agreed to indemnify the applicant. The undertakings in that order form the basis of grounds 7 to 12 of the committal application.</p>

Eventually the former matrimonial home was rented out with the rental income being used to pay the mortgage and rental costs for the applicant and children and for the respondent. The bridging loan was not paid, it carrying a very high rate of interest. In the end the former matrimonial home was repossessed and sold. The applicant wife received less than &#163;100,000, the bridging loan eating up the lion&#8217;s share of the equity that existed. In retrospect the taking of the bridging loan was plainly a bad decision and it has left the family in a precarious financial position. No doubt at the time it was thought that the respondent would land one of the deals which would enable the bridging loan to be paid off before it had accrued substantial interest, or that the property would sell for a sum closer to the parties&#8217; expectations and again the bridging loan would have been paid off.</p>

At paragraph 5 by consent it was ordered that until the sum that the applicant was due to receive in respect of the former matrimonial home that the respondent would continue to discharge the rent on the applicant&#8217;s property. It is that order that formed the basis of ground 2. On 29 June 2017 the respondent issued an application seeking to vary paragraph 5 of Mr Justice Hayden&#8217;s order to provide that the sum the applicant had received from the sale of the former matrimonial home be used to pay her rent. Mrs Justice Parker made various orders in particular for disclosure at paragraphs 2 and 3 of that order. She relisted the matter for a hearing on 24 August before Mr Justice Hayden. At the hearing on 24 August the respondent did not appear. He had issued an application to adjourn the hearing and having heard nothing assumed it had been adjourned. Mr Justice Hayden made further orders in his absence. Paragraph 3 he ordered the respondent to pay the applicant is the sum of &#163;11,800 by 4 o&#8217;clock on 30 August 2017. A penal notice was attached to this order. This forms the basis of ground 1 of the committal application. At paragraph 5 he extended time for the respondent to comply with the directions given by Mrs Justice Parker for the filing of evidence. He amended part of Mrs Justice Parker&#8217;s order to include further disclosure. Penal notices were attached to these provisions and they now form the basis of grounds 3, 4, and five of the committal application. He also ordered the respondent to pay the applicant&#8217;s costs. That forms the basis of ground 6 of the committal application. Mr Justice Hayden dismissed the respondent&#8217;s application that the applicants share of the proceeds of sale be used to pay her rent.</p>

In those circumstances where the judge concludes that the prosecution evidence taken at its highest is such that a jury properly directed could not properly convict on, it is the judge&#8217;s duty to stop the case. Where the evidence is such that its strength or weakness depends on the view to be taken of a witness&#8217;s reliability or other matters which are generally speaking within the province of the jury, and where on one possible view of the facts there is evidence on which the jury could properly come to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty, then the judge should allow the matter to be tried by the jury. In approaching the evidence, taken at its highest, this did not involve picking out all the plums and leaving the duff behind.

Given this was in the context of a possible direction granting permission to vary the grounds of committal and to adduce further evidence in support of a committal, Mr Horton says it is clear that it was a deliberate strategy on behalf of the applicant&#8217;s legal advisers to seek to extract information from the respondent to then use in support of a committal application. The Court of Appeal in Mohan said at paragraph 41 that the strategic prior issue of the general application could not be used simply as a device to achieve only disclosure and examination for deployment in subsequent issued proceedings under the Debtors Act. </p>

In adducing evidence to show he had complied with the obligation to disclose information he would inevitably put before the court material which might be used against him in respect of the non-payment allegations.</p>

He submits that the combined effect of sections 4 and 5 of the Debtors Acts, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/31" uk:canonical="1970 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1970</ref> and the FPR themselves is to require applications in respect of money orders to be brought by this route.

He submits that it is not susceptible to variation or for the defect to be waived given the wholesale failure to comply, and that it would be unjust to do so given the penal sanctions.

She submitted that the court could interpret the undertaking to determine what expenses were deductible, that the court could resolve the issue over whether the respondent was the true beneficial owner of all of the shares and what sums if any had been paid by the respondent pursuant to his obligation under the undertaking.  She made an application that the court should treat the application for committal as a judgment summons application under FPR 33.  Mr Horton in reply noted that paragraph 33(b) of the order of 27 November 2014 gave the parties liberty to apply regarding the undertakings and that if it had not been possible to ascertain the sum owed that this was the route that the applicant should have taken. Within such an application the court could have determined whether Mr Kebbekeh was holding 50% of the shares on behalf of a third party or whether in truth he was holding them for the respondent, what expenses were properly deductible and what sums the respondent had paid in discharge of any amounts owing. He submits that the applicant&#8217;s invitation for me to interpret the clause and to resolve the disputes is in effect an invitation for me to rewrite the clause or to imply into it other terms both of which he says are impermissible in the context of a committal application.</p>

The respondent has historically paid small sums to the wife either in respect of the children or for other matters and these payments in the schedule are a continuation of that pattern of support. They were gratuitously made. In any event prior to March 2017, the wife was unaware that the husband had sold her part of the shares or Mr Kebbekeh&#8217;s and could not have attributed any payments received by her to the proceeds of sale. Nor did the respondent attribute to them to the share sale because he had not disclosed that they had been sold. There is no correlation between the receipt of the proceeds of sale of the shares and any of the payments made either in time or an amount and thus there would be a case to answer. </p>

The person or persons affected must know with complete precision what it is that they are required to do or abstain from doing. It is not possible to imply terms into an injunction. The first task for the judge hearing an application for committal for alleged breach of a mandatory (positive) order is to identify, by reference to the express language of the order, precisely what it is that the order required the defendant to do.

That burden remains on the applicant throughout but it does not require the applicant to adduce evidence of a particular means of compliance which was available to the accused provided the applicant can satisfy the judge so that he is sure that compliance was possible. </p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Waiver is now based on the interest of justice and whether the alleged contemnor would suffer an injustice or prejudice. There is no longer a threshold of exceptionality, and the court has to ask itself 'did the alleged contemnor have enough information to meet the charge?' While an attached affidavit could not provide the particularisation required of a notice, it could justify the waiver of a defect. <span style="font-style:italic">Cherwayko v Cherwayko</span> (No 2) (Contempt, contents of application notice) <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2015/2436.html" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0000FF"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/2436" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2436 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2436 (Fam)</ref></a>. Whilst PD37A does not specifically refer back to FPR 4.6 &#8216;Relief from sanctions&#8217; and by and large, FPR 37 does not set out a specific sanction for failure to comply, the sorts of issues that the court might consider when dealing with applications to waive a defect in the committal process could well be informed by FPR 4.6. However the ultimate question will be waiver causes any injustice to the Respondent.  It is clear that the power to waive a defect relates to the committal process. It does not relate back to defects in the order or undertaking itself. It does though apply to any aspect of the committal process whether it relates to particulars of the alleged breach not being included in the committal notice, to service issues or anything else which can properly be characterised as the commencement or conduct of the committal application. In cases where there is a wholesale failure to comply with the rules, whilst each individual failure might not cause injustice, the court may conclude that overall it is unfair, but also not in the interests of justice more broadly assessed, for a wholly defective process to be allowed to continue. It is in the interests of justice that the procedural code is followed; in particular where the liberty of the subject is at stake</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">FPR 37.1 which deals with the scope of applications and proceedings in relation to contempt of court identifies that it sets out the procedure in respect of committal for breach of a judgment, order, undertaking to do or abstain from doing an act. Thus it deals with acts rather than payment of money. FPR 37.4 provides that if a person required by judgment or order to do an act does not do it within the time fixed by the judgment or order or disobeys a judgment or order not to do an act then, subject to the Debtors Acts 1869 and 1878 and to the provisions of these rules the judgment or order may be enforced under the court&#8217;s powers by an order for committal</p>

The definition of judgment summons in FPR 33.9 identifies a judgment summons as the summons referred to in section 5 of the Debtors Act. The Administration of Justice Act identifies financial remedy orders (i.e. those made under part two of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>) as being capable of application for committal pursuant to section 5.  The provisions of FPR 37.1 and 37.4 reinforce that conclusion by appearing to exclude from the ambit of true committal applications to commit in respect of money orders. Undertakings within such orders are to be treated as orders themselves. Thus it appears that it is not open to a judgment creditor to seek the committal to prison of a debtor under part 37; their only route is through judgment summons. The order made on 27 November 2014 was clearly a Part II order.</p>

No doubt as a matter of good practice and certainly if the new standard family orders are used any order will contain both the penal notice as to orders and the warning as to undertakings. In this case the order of 27 November 2014 did contain a notice which followed on immediately after the undertakings which in fact was in more detailed form than that specified in the rules and which plainly related to the undertakings the respondent had given.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept that the evidence makes clear that the issuing of the enforcement application alongside the committal was entirely strategic. The transcript of the hearing before Mrs Justice Parker shows that the applicant&#8217;s counsel at that time was contemplating a committal application as soon as possible after Mr Justice Newton&#8217;s order. It is not clear whether it was Mr Justice Newton or the applicants team who timetabled the applications as they were.  So I do not accept that it is established that this was an entirely strategic application; although I am prepared to accept it was part of the thinking process of the applicant&#8217;s legal team at that time that the enforcement application might generate useful material.  The contents of the transcript suggests that there was or may have been a genuine desire to ascertain whether any other form of enforcement was feasible. Thus it does not fall into the category identified at paragraph 39 of Mohan (above) where it might be said to be entirely strategic and thus potentially an abuse of process. In any event I do not take the decision of the Court of Appeal in Mohan as authority for the proposition that if it is entirely strategic that the consequences are strikeout. In that case the Court of Appeal eventually concluded that documentary evidence disclosed could still be deployed even though obtained under compulsion. That is of course in contrast to, for instance, a statement or a Form E or other document created by the respondent himself which could not be deployed if obtained under compulsion. Thus even if the court concluded that it were a purely strategic move the consequences would have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis applying the overriding objective and in particular doing justice and achieving fairness between the parties. In this case as it happens none of the remaining grounds are affected by any evidence that may have arisen as a result of the tandem process and I cannot see any unfairness arising out of the tandem approach that was adopted in this case.</p>

The allegation in this case is of a failure to disclose material prior to September 2017. The fact that the respondent has subsequently produced the evidence in relation to that order and which may thus go to mitigation  if the breach is  proved does not make that evidence inadmissible. As the Court of Appeal made clear in Mohan evidence which is produced in answer to orders which predate the committal application is admissible in any event. In addition documentary evidence in the form of bank statements or other documents which have an independent existence was held to be admissible by the Court of Appeal in Mohan even if it was produced as a result of the enforcement and committal tandem processes.  It appears relatively common from the authorities for applications for committal for non-payment and applications for committal for failure to disclose to be heard in tandem.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"> However it seems to me that Mr Horton submission as to the proper approach to committal applications in respect of money orders is right. The combined effect of the statute and the procedure identifies a clear route for enforcing money orders which is by judgment summons. Although the court has the general power to waive defects in compliance with the procedural rules if no injustice is caused, in respect of a wholesale failure to comply based on a deliberate choice not to pursue that route I conclude that it would be unjust to treat the committal application as a judgment summons application. The rules are there for a purpose and in particular the difference between the six week penalty available in respect of a judgment summons and the two-year penalty which arises in committal as a matter of not only justice between the parties, but also in upholding the need for compliance with the procedural code and the statutes. This leads me to conclude that I should not permit the applicant to pursue this by treating the committal application is a judgment summons. This may require the applicant to use the liberty to apply permission under the 2014 order to seek clarification as to the precise sum owed with the option of issuing a judgment summons thereafter if any such sum identified is not paid.</p>

The court would need to determine whether the respondent was the true beneficial owner of the other 50% of the shares held in Mr Kebbekeh&#8217;s name; the court would need to determine what expenses were properly recoverable. These it seems to me go to the issue of whether the undertaking is in a form which is sufficiently clear so as to be capable of committal at the current time. I accept Mr Horton submission that it in effect requires the court to imply into the undertaking further terms and that the proper way of resolving these disputes is not under the umbrella of a judgment summons, but by activation of the liberty to apply direction. In respect of the amounts said already to have been paid I consider that those could properly be determined within a judgment summons application is that simply goes to whether the amount has been paid or not. </p>

Although he was not present when the August order was made it was served on him in accordance with the direction Mr Justice Hayden gave in that order.

It goes on to say adherence to this practice simplifies the court task of determining, in committal proceedings, whether or not the respondent is in breach, and may reduce the incidence of such proceedings being brought when misconceived or unnecessary</span>.&#8217;  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I conclude that there is not an absolute rule that requires an order imposing obligations with penal consequences to be incorporated in one single document. It will be fact specific. In many, possibly in most cases good practice would be to ensure that all of the order is contained in the most recent order. However in a case such as this where Mr Justice Hayden&#8217;s order simply extended the time for compliance with Mrs Justice Parker&#8217;s earlier order and imposed a penal notice which (quite properly) had not been incorporated in the earlier order it was not essential for the operative parts to be repeated. As a matter of construction it is absolutely clear what it was that the respondent was required to do in terms of disclosure. I do not consider that there is any defect in respect of the orders of July and August. Even if there were would not be unjust to proceed.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In respect of Ground 7 I accept that there would be a case to answer in respect of the evidence as to the attribution of the monies that the respondent has paid. However given that I have concluded that for legal reasons ground 7 cannot proceed this is no longer relevant. It may of course become so if the applicant operates the liberty to apply clause and the court determines what sum should properly have been due in respect of the share sale. Either the court would in that forum determine whether those payments could be attributed to the respondent paying her in compliance with his undertaking or whether they were paid for other reasons. Alternatively if once the sum is ascertained a judgment summonses issued the issue would be determined at that stage.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is fundamental to an application to commit that the order or undertaking must be clear as to what obligation it imposes. Terms cannot be implied into undertakings or orders. In respect of Ground 8, I cannot imply into that undertaking a requirement on the respondent to transfer the Agriterra shares to the applicant when it only refers to Red Rock or Red bunch. There is therefore no case to answer in respect of ground eight.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The effect of the Court of Appeal decision in Nicholls (above) is to give the court a general discretion to waive a procedural defect where no injustice has been caused. This is the conclusion which emerges from that decision but which also was the conclusion reached by Parker J in Cherwayko (above). Although Ms Alexander did not seek to amend the particulars in respect of ground 9 it seems to me that the court with its own independent obligation to uphold its orders and undertakings should go a little beyond the position of the advocate for the applicant. The affidavit filed by the wife did clearly identify in respect of this ground the particulars in which it was said the respondent was in breach. That appears at paragraph 19 of the affidavit and is in these terms</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">That allegation is supported by independent evidence exhibited by the wife in the form of the email of 15 March 2017. I therefore conclude that there is no injustice to the respondent in permitting this ground to go ahead on the basis of amended particulars incorporating the wording at paragraph 19 of the applicant&#8217;s affidavit. I do not consider there is any injustice to the respondent in waving the defect in the particulars in this respect because the allegation is clearly set out in the affidavit and evidenced. Notwithstanding the lateness of the specification of the particulars I do not consider that the respondent is in any way disadvantaged. The issue of what ground 9 covered arose earlier in the hearing and I pointed out that this was a specific allegation made and that the respondent might wish to deal with it. I therefore conclude that ground 9 can continue on that basis.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In respect of ground 12 and indemnities, Halsbury&#8217;s Laws show that in respect of the interpretation of what an indemnity means that &#8216;each case must be governed by its facts&#8217;. I do not consider that the indemnity in respect of school fees means that the husband can be in breach only if the wife incurs a financial liability.  In respect of the absence of particulars in the committal grounds this is clearly a defect but again the basis of the breaches set out at paragraph 26 of the affidavit in support. I do not consider there is any injustice to the respondent in permitting the applicant to amend her notice to rely on the failure of the respondent to pay the school fees in good time and the subsequent entry of a judgment against the applicant and the seizure of her car as evidencing a breach of that undertaking to indemnify. I therefore do not consider that there is no case to answer in respect of ground 12 in amended form. </p>

I acquitted him on ground 12. The other grounds were either withdrawn or dismissed. I have adjourned sentencing to await the outcome of the hearing before Mr Justice Cohen in order to seek to achieve some clarity in respect of the respondent&#8217;s ability to pay a fine.</p>
