	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Normally on allowing an appeal the appellate court will immediately proceed to exercise the statutory discretion anew. But I was not in a position to do so as it was revealed that two significant events had occurred since the order of 8 January 2014 had been made. First, as I explained in para 26 of my first judgment, the company which employed the husband had been sold to venture capitalists on 3 June 2014 and on 1 July 2014 the husband received &#163;1.1m gross, &#163;586,334 net, sale proceeds of his 90,000 shares in the company. These shares he had stated in evidence to the District Judge were worthless. Second, as I explained in para 27, shortly thereafter the husband was made redundant, receiving &#163;100,000 net as a termination payment. </p>

It is not surprising therefore that in the present context there can be different views on the requirements of fairness in any particular case."</p>

My Lords, I think it unnecessary to refer by name or to quote from, any of the often-cited authorities in which the courts have explained what is essentially an intuitive judgment. They are far too well known. From them, I derive that: &#8230; (2) The standards of fairness are not immutable. They may change with the passage of time, both in the general and in their application to decisions of a particular type. (3) The principles of fairness are not to be applied by rote identically in every situation. What fairness demands is dependent on the context of the decision, and this is to be taken into account in all its aspects. &#8230;"</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"This 'equal sharing' principle derives from the basic concept of equality permeating a marriage as understood today. Marriage, it is often said, is a partnership of equals. In 1992 Lord Keith of Kinkel approved Lord Emslie's observation that 'husband and wife are now for all practical purposes equal partners in marriage': <span style="font-style:italic">R v R</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 AC 599" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 AC 599</ref>, 617. This is now recognised widely, if not universally. The parties commit themselves to sharing their lives. They live and work together. When their partnership ends each is entitled to an equal share of the assets of the partnership, unless there is a good reason to the contrary. Fairness requires no less. But I emphasise the qualifying phrase: 'unless there is good reason to the contrary'. The yardstick of equality is to be applied as an aid, not a rule."</p>

However, as I will explain, pre-marital property not uncommonly becomes part of the economic life of the spousal partnership and thus acquires a matrimonial character giving rise to a (not necessarily equal) sharing claim in relation to it. </p>

The reason for this is that sometimes the matrimonial property in question will not be the product of the endeavours of the parties within the social-economic partnership that is marriage (as Guest J described it in the Australian case of <span style="font-style:italic">Farmer and Bramley</span> [2000] FamCA 1615 at para 188). Sometimes one party brings assets in which become "part of the economic life of [the] marriage&#8230;utilised, converted, sustained and enjoyed during the contribution period" (ibid at para 190). This is the concept of mingling referred to by me in <span style="font-style:italic">N v F </span>at para 9 (where I cited the remarks of Lord Nicholls in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller &amp; McFarlane</span> at paras 24 &#8211; 25 and of Baroness Hale at para 148)<span style="font-style:italic">,</span> and by Wilson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">K v L</span> at para 18(b).

So it should normally be treated as matrimonial property for this purpose." This is reflected in the remarks of Wilson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">K v L</span> at para 18(c).

Two points of view arise here. On the one hand it can legitimately be argued that the party in question has traded with the other party's undivided share and so should share with that party the profit that has been generated. On the other hand it can equally convincingly be said that the second party has not contributed to the industry or endeavour that gave rise to the profit or growth and so it is unfair that the second party should share to the same extent in that profit as the first who made all the effort. Similar controversy arises in relation to bonuses earned in the period of separation. The earner of such bonuses can validly argue that he did his work outside married life and without the support of his spouse. But the other party can equally validly argue that the ability to earn was generated during the marriage; that she was maintaining the family infrastructure pending dissolution of the marital partnership and division of the assets; and that during the period of separation the parties were financially linked."</p>

There is no question of her entitlement to any element of post-separation accrual being triggered by a 'needs' argument but I take the view that, notwithstanding the exponential increase in the growth of the Fund post-separation, its genesis as a matrimonial asset is a factor of considerable significance. That factor must, in my view, find its reflection in the overall quantum of the financial award she will receive at the conclusion of these proceedings.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the first port of call is to look at Phase 3, by far the longest period. An amortising Duxbury calculation for Phase 3 yields the sum of &#163;1,191,357. Subtracting the sum of &#163;650,000 pension share, which should then be brought into action, leaves a shortfall of &#163;541,357. This sum needs to be carefully preserved by the wife from her investment fund of &#163;1,302,491, although it will give her an investment income which I shall take at the Duxbury norm of 3% gross, giving &#163;16,241 annually.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A Duxbury calculation on a non-amortising basis for Phases 1 and 2, on the basis that there will be &#163;16,241 of annual savings income, amounts to &#163;884,030. The wife would have &#163;761,134 to set against this need. The wife would in fact only need to amortise a very small part of her investment fund to meet her needs in Phases 1 and 2. The program calculates that she would need only to amortise 13% of the &#163;761,134 or &#163;98,947.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Campbell argued that for Phases 1 and 2 the wife should not have to amortise her investment funds but she should in phase 3. I largely agree with that. The scale of amortisation in this period will be modest. But I do not agree with Miss Campbell's capitalisation methodology. I consider that the Duxbury calculator, as the industry standard, should be used to assess needs in each phase.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Plainly the division will meet the husband's needs. The SJE's evidence is that he should be able without undue difficulty to secure employment paying between &#163;71,000 net and &#163;114,000 net annually, with pension provision and the hope of bonuses. He is now aged nearly 52 so has 8 years of working life ahead of him, at least. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I now turn to what payment needs to be made to the wife to effect the division. Her entitlement is to &#163;2,257,491 of the non-pension assets. She has in her name &#163;2,100,663, excluding her entitlement to &#163;15,000 costs awarded by me on 7 October 2014, which should be dealt with after the balancing payment has been worked out. That balancing payment is therefore &#163;2,257,491 - &#163;2,100,663 = &#163;156,828. To that I add &#163;100,000 being the costs of &#163;85,000 that the husband must pay to the wife referable to the proceedings at first instance of &#163;85,000 and the &#163;15,000 costs awarded by me on 7 October 2014, giving a total payment to be paid by the husband to the wife of &#163;256,828. That shall be paid in 14 days upon which a clean break shall take effect.</p>

That it is very close to equality overall is a coincidence. But a result that divides equally assets of &#163;6m while leaving the husband with his earnings is not uncommon and is certainly not unfair. </p>
