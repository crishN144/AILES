Baltimore, London and Paris were the options.  It was decided that rather than getting married in September as envisaged, the wedding would be accelerated to take place before W&#8217;s father embarked on what were plainly going to be some very gruelling procedures.  The options for treatment narrowed to London and Paris.  By pulling strings, the parties&#8217; families were able to arrange for a wedding celebration in the Consular Section of the </p>

Not surprisingly the marital relationship suffered.

On 2 October 2018 the parties separated and H left the matrimonial home. </p>

H says that it was clearly agreed between the parties that the marriage would take place in [the capital of Country A] and the discussion was about which of two churches would be used.  An important factor, says H, was the proximity to the waterfront venue for the reception.  W denies there was any such conversation.  I find it highly likely that there was some conversation about the wedding plans and in particular where the church ceremony was to take place and that there was no suggestion that the marriage would take place anywhere other than [Country A]. </p>

Those members of his family that have been married outside [Country A] have had marriage contracts prepared for them by M. B.  Such a contract would have been unnecessary for a marriage [in Country A] as the default position in [Country A] is separation of property.  W&#8217;s family, on the other hand, has no history of marriage contracts.  W&#8217;s parent&#8217;s marriage had been celebrated in Paris with no contract and her brother&#8217;s marriage has not yet been celebrated.  Although I accept H&#8217;s evidence that the marriage plans were discussed, the parties agree that the marital regime was not part of the discussion. </p>

W was fully consumed in looking after her father, to whom she was exceptionally close, as well as having to deal with such things as her wedding dress.  There were just two weeks between diagnosis and wedding and I have no difficulty in accepting that choice of marital regime was the last thing on W&#8217;s mind.  I accept that it was only on the day before the wedding that H told W that they needed to go to the office of M. B to sign some documents, without specifying what they were, and it was only when they got to the office that W and H saw for the very first time the document. </p>

Furthermore, she says that she was a mess at the time of the ceremony.  On the one hand she had the delight of marrying a man that she loved, and on the other hand the fear of the imminent loss of her father who was dear to her.  So much had happened in the past two weeks that she was not in a position to focus at all on any document put before her.  She trusted her fianc&#233; and would have signed whatever she was given.  I accept her evidence on this in its entirety. </p>

I dismiss this suggestion.  H on the other hand suggests that it was done for the benefit of W&#8217;s family to ensure that H did not benefit from whatever W inherited upon the demise of her father.  I do not accept that scenario either as there is no evidence of any discussion on the matter between the families or within W&#8217;s family.  I am also sceptical of the alleged benefit that it would bring W compared to what she would lose as a result. </p>

B about the circumstances surrounding the document.  I do not draw any adverse conclusion from the absence of H&#8217;s father as the evidence of his deep disappointment at the divorce and his refusal to become involved is manifest.  The absence of M. B is much more mysterious.  He provided a letter which I admitted in evidence setting out how the meeting took some two hours and in the course of which he explained everything to W but it is now clear that the letter written by him when the marriage broke down, recalling what happened some 8 years previously, does no more than parrot what H told him had happened.  M. B has failed to provide any documentary evidence or his file despite the request of the court, and nor has he filed a statement.  I am therefore not prepared to put any weight on the letter that he wrote to H. </p>

H says that F always described it as a gift.  I am satisfied that the reason for this description was because H&#8217;s family wished to avoid income tax, as W has suggested.  I am sure that it was in fact remuneration, the exact amount of which may have been in F&#8217;s discretion.   </p>

I decline to make such a finding.  F has provided each of his five children with substantial homes.  H received his gift (as I find it to be) later than his four sisters.  Whilst it is more than any of them received it is not significantly more than one of his sisters who received her payment to purchase in Switzerland well before H.

H&#8217;s account was that his father described it as a gift whilst H thought of it as remuneration (albeit never declared as such).  H claims that he and F argued about his description and H alleges that F said that if he did not like it being called a gift, H was free to treat as a loan and/or return it.  Whilst I accept that F said this, I do not consider that he ever expected it to be returned.  H accepts that the word &#8220;avance&#8221; was used in describing this receipt and W says that this shows that it was an advance on future profits.

In so determining I am not overlooking its provenance, but, in exchange, W will have no claim over H&#8217;s business assets including those which were purchased with the $8m representing accrued remuneration.  It follows that there is no question of H taking out a charge on the property.  It means that W will own the property in which she and the children will be living for many years to come.  It will be her decision as to when, if ever, she sells it.   </p>

Furthermore, he does not need it.  I am satisfied that he will be well able to rehouse himself without the need of resorting either to the proceeds of the home in many years&#8217; time or requiring it for security for borrowing when he is likely to have sufficient other assets to provide by way of deposit or security. </p>

In other words, and we wish to emphasise this, subject to only one qualification it is and remains the obligation of a wife who has obtained access to her husband's documents unlawfully or clandestinely to disclose that fact promptly, either if asked by her husband's solicitors or at the latest and in any event when she serves her Questionnaire. Disclosure in this way of the fact of what she has done is not in any way inconsistent with the Rules.
