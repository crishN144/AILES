The mother had two older children by a previous relationship.  After the marriage, the mother gave birth to two daughters, E and P, now aged 16 and 15 respectively.  In 2001 the family relocated to France, living in the Dordogne area.

Although many factual matters remain in dispute between the parties, there is a considerable amount of evidence, including statements by these children and from one of the mother's two older children by a previous relationship, that the mother has had a long-term drink problem.  The mother denies that she was ever an alcoholic.  She states that in a time of extreme stress she has turned to alcohol but has never developed a dependency.  Her assertion is that it was the father's behaviour that gave rise to difficulties in the marriage, including his gambling.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In 2009 the father left France and came back to England.  Since then the parties have not lived together, although I understand they are not yet formally divorced.  Thereafter, there was limited contact between the father and the children for some time.  In the summer of 2012 and 2013, however, the children spent one month each year with the father in England.  In the summer of 2014, T told his mother that he would not be returning to school in France for the following September.  As a result, the mother refused to allow T to come to England that summer, fearing that he would not be returned.  At that point, the father reported the mother to the NSPCC in England, who in due course alerted social services in France.  Shortly afterwards, E travelled to England without the mother's knowledge or consent.  After her arrival, the mother learned what had happened and then gave her consent to P following her.  T, as I understand it, did not come to see his father last summer.  Subsequently both girls returned to France at the conclusion of the summer visit, although the police were apparently involved in that process in some way.  E returned to the school where she had been a weekly boarder, some hour or so away from the mother's home in Dordogne, and P in September 2010 also started boarding at that school as a weekly boarder.  </span></p>

Those documents disclosed that French social services had become involved following the referral by the father to the NSPCC in 2014, and then an email from the mother's older daughter in July 2014, in which she gave details of her concerns, including the mother's alleged long-term alcoholism, her destructive personality and erratic and occasional violent behaviour, and the impact of these matters on the children, including allegations that the mother had threatened suicide, had kicked the children out, had thrown things, and psychologically abused the children.  As her daughter stated:  "She is just getting worse and the children are really suffering".  At that stage P was still living at home, and it was alleged that much of the day-to-day care of T fell on her shoulders.  On other occasions it was alleged that T had been left alone overnight while the mother had been out seeing her boyfriend.  There was also an allegation that P had been sexually abused by a friend of the mother but that the mother had refused to believe the allegation.  </span></p>

Those enquiries were referred to the prosecutor, and she in due course concluded that the children were the victims of conflict between their parents and of what was described as the mother's dysfunctionalities, and were seen as unhappy, insecure and suffering psychologically and had therefore suffered abuse and neglect in the care of the mother.  As a result, the prosecutor asked the court to authorise a formal investigation.  </span></p>

I also note that the mother has undertaken regular blood tests which appear to show that she is abstaining from alcohol, although the father (relying on statements made by E and P, and on what he says T has observed during Skype contact) does not accept this is.  I also note that the documents produced from France show that at an earlier stage T's school reports were, to quote Mr. Power's words, "really very good and give no indication that his home life was impacting on his studies".  </span></p>

It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions.  There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities.  But in evaluating the evidence the court will of course be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague Convention process.  It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under article 13b and so neither those allegations their nor rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.  </span></p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be 'real'.  It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as 'grave'.  Although 'grave' characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two.  Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as 'grave' while a higher level of risk might be required for the other less serious forms of harm.  </span></p>

As was said in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re D</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, at para.52, '"Intolerable" is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean "a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate"'. Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation.  Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress.  It is part of growing up.  But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate.  Among those, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself.  Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent.  Mr.&#160;Turner accepts that if, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant:  eg, where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child. </span></p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand.  More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home."  </span></p>

It is the father's case that that risk is grave.  In his written evidence he describes how, as is his case, his relationship with the mother was initially very good and close until her drink problem became more serious; how she had received treatment that had been unsuccessful; how she had attempted suicide; how, after the separation, the children had told him she was continuing to drink excessively and that they were being left to fend for themselves; how the mother had become involved with a Frenchman who had been abusive towards T; and how the situation had deteriorated to such an extent that he felt compelled to notify the NSPCC.  He also relies on the information disclosed from the French authorities (summarised above).  </span></p>

This court is not, I stress, in a position to make any definitive findings on allegations about the mother's behaviour, but it seems to be accepted by the mother that she has at least to some extent resorted to alcohol in the past and also that she has had some mental health issues.

Secondly, Mr. Jarman submits that this was a blatant abduction, despite the mother's attempts to stop it, and the court must be vigilant to ensure that the general policy considerations of the Convention are respected and upheld.  Thirdly, Mr. Jarman submits that as French proceedings are under way and a French agency about to report, the court should be slow, both for practical reasons and as a matter of policy, to interfere with measures started in a Member State.  Fourth, Mr. Jarman submits that T's real objection is to returning to his mother and that those difficulties can be overcome by the undertakings which the mother has proffered, as already discussed, or, alternatively, as already indicated, in Mr. Jarman's submission, there is no good reason why the father should not accompany T to France and look after him there until such time as the French court makes its decision as to his future.  </span></p>
