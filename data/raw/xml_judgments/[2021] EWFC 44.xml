	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">I am dealing today with two children.  X, born in 2009 who is 12, and Y, born in October 2020 who is now four months old.  Y, as I say, was born at full gestation, but in December, when he was almost two months old he was seen for a check up and some bruises were noticed.  What followed was that he was referred to hospital because of those bruises, and a CT scan of the head was taken which was indicative of a non displaced fracture to the left parietal bone, according to the radiologist who looked at that CT scan. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">A further skeletal survey was carried out which also showed linear lucency in that region.  It was therefore believed that this little boy had suffered bruising and a fractured skull, for which there was no explanation.  I should say no explanation for the fractured skull because the mother had indicated that it might be possible that the bruising had been caused by too strong a grip whilst changing a particularly virulent nappy.  The Local Authority then felt it needed to take protective measures for the children, and it was right to do so on the basis of the medical evidence with which it was presented.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">The parents, very responsibly gave their consent to the children going to live with the maternal grandfather, which is what happened in December of last year.  Proceedings were then started and there was an initial hearing before me on 23rd December 2020, when I made an Interim Care Order in respect of Y.  I ordered a report then from Dr Olsen, a Consultant Paediatric Radiologist, and that early hearing was, as it happens, very useful because it enabled the Court to order that report from Dr Olsen very early on in the proceedings, which meant that it has now been received.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">Dr Olsen&#8217;s report came in and indicated that, in his view, the parietal bone lucency seen on the CT scan, is an accessory suture, which is a normal variant, and is not therefore indicative of a skull fracture.  That being so, the Local Authority immediately notified the Court and sought a hearing at which it could withdraw these proceedings.  It&#8217;s case had always been that without the skull fracture, this would not be a matter that ever came before the Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">Happily, Dr Cartlidge has also filed his report before today, and that enables me to look at the bruising as well.  The bruising, Dr Cartlidge describes in this way.  First of all he says that the medical aging of the bruising does not contradict the history given by the parents of first noticing the bruising on a specified date in December.  Secondly, he says that he thinks that they are consistent with the legs being held too tightly.  Thirdly, he says that the mother thinks that she could have caused the bruises by holding Y&#8217;s legs too tightly when changing a soiled nappy, and he says this: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0in">bruising could have been caused accidentally by a bit of heavy-handed gripping whilst changing a nappy.  Clearly that is something that the mother must be careful about in the future, but it is not the sort of incident that causes the Court particular concern, and it is not the sort of incident that requires any order to be made, or indeed crosses the threshold under Section 31 of the Children Act. </p>

The two children have been away from them now for more than two months, and they have had restricted contact because of the difficulties with the lockdown and Coronavirus.  I do want to say to them that, although the end result of this case is the Local Authority withdrawing proceedings, the Local Authority were right to bring them on the basis of the evidence. </p>

I give leave for the medical report of Dr Cartlidge and of Dr Olsen to be released to the police, if they require sight of those reports to ensure that the police action ceases as well.  I would like the report of Dr Olsen to be sent to the head of the radiological department at the relevant hospital, so that it can be seen by the radiology department and [used in training] by them, so that hopefully this does not recur in the future. </p>
