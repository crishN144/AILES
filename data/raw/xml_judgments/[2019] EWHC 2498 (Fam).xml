	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">Bamfield, both of whom were cross examined. At the start of the second day, Mr Hoar applied for permission under CPR r38 to withdraw the application. He made that application because in the light of the oral evidence he accepted his case could not proceed. After hearing submissions from counsel, I indicated that I would give the LA permission to withdraw, but that I would give a full judgment. I decided to do this because the issues that gave rise to the original application, and the problems that arise in relation to KR&#8217;s care and his relationship with the LA, are unlikely to simply disappear. If there are any future applications in relation to KR and ST I anticipate it would be useful for a future judge to understand what has happened in these proceedings. Further, there are issues which have arisen in this case which are troubling and on which it may be helpful for me to give judgment.  </p>

He has right sided hemiplegia, brain injury and epilepsy. He is unable to self-mobilise, is confined to a wheelchair and only has movement in one arm. He is in need of fairly constant care and is completely dependent on those who care for him. He has some speech impediment but can communicate as long as one takes the time to understand him. He has been assessed to have capacity to make decisions about his residence and welfare, and was most recently assessed in January 2019. Therefore he has had capacity in relation to those matters throughout these proceedings, and that has never been in issue.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">In 2004 KR was attacked and suffered life changing injuries. He spent a prolonged period in hospital and at some stage moved to CP, a care home. In 2015 he moved from CP to live with ST in a Council flat in Croydon (the property). This is a one bedroom flat. From this point onwards ST became his primary carer. Ms Bamfield, who is ST&#8217;s social worker, gave evidence that given KR&#8217;s needs ST has been having to sleep in the living room on a sofa whilst caring for KR, presumably ever since 2015.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The following summary of the facts is taken from an Agreed Chronology. In July 2016 there is a safeguarding assessment which states that KR had a bloody face and black eye and reports that KR had said that he wanted to leave and go into a care home before ST kills him. He later confirmed that he did not wish to go into a care home. There follows a sad pattern of concerns around KR&#8217;s care, and allegations of domestic abuse between ST and KR, with the allegations pointing in both directions. It is right to note at this point that KR, because he cannot mobilise, is necessarily very vulnerable to any physical assault. </p>

However, a fair summary seems to me to be that the LA had perfectly valid safeguarding concerns about KR&#8217;s care, and that the couple have had a troubled and at times highly antagonistic relationship.  </p>

It is not entirely clear what services had been provided before that, but it appears from Ms Jones&#8217; evidence that the care agency was intended to provide a more intensive level of care. The arrangement was that carers were supposed to visit the property three times a day, seven days a week. There were from the start some problems with ST allowing access to the carers that I will return to below. </p>

Some of them had been previously disclosed, but it is almost impossible to tell which ones. Very few had been exhibited to the LA&#8217;s witness statements. The vast majority of these documents will necessarily never have been seen by KR or ST because they come from the LA&#8217;s records.  Some of these documents paint a materially different picture from that in Ms Jones&#8217; witness statements, particularly in respect of the degree to which ST was obstructing the carers from CSL accessing the property and at least checking on KR.

Firstly, it is not acceptable that they were only disclosed, at least in this form, so shortly before trial. The hearing date had been set down since 21 May 2019, and the late disclosure meant the bundles were both unmanageable, and in reality, unreadable. Secondly, the disclosure appears to have been in the form of simply putting all these documents in the court bundle without any attempt to agree the bundle. Again, this is not acceptable, at the least attempts must be made to agree a bundle, and the bundle should be limited to documents which will be necessary for the judge to consider. </p>

This case commenced with an application for an injunction without notice. It continued through a series of interim injunctions where the judges necessarily had very limited time to examine background documents, even if they had been exhibited, which in key instances they were not. It is trite law that when a without notice injunction is applied for there is a duty of full and frank disclosure and there is in any event a duty on any claimant not to mislead the court.

I will refer below to the European and domestic caselaw on the importance of the State not interfering into individuals&#8217; marriage. In those circumstances the obligation for full and frank disclosure is as important if not more important, than in any other form of litigation.

Surprisingly, the bundle I was given did not actually contain the exhibits to the witness statements, but I was handed DL5 in court. That was a note which was produced at a meeting that Ms Jones had had with the manager of CSL. What this note made clear was that twice every week CSL had produced no information about the number of visits, and whether ST had prevented access or not. This immediately undermined the evidence referred to above that on average ST had only let in the carers three times each week. There were 6 wholly unaccounted for visits, where there was no evidence that ST had refused access. Ms Jones could not explain why there were two unaccounted for days. Further on close scrutiny during cross examination it became clear that the average of access only being allowed three times a week was not even sustainable on the days on which there was information.  </p>

It therefore follows that there was no evidence from KR in front of Cohen J.

In both statements he says in terms that he wants to live with ST. He makes clear that he likes CP and it provides him with a good standard of care. However, he does not want to live in a care home, certainly not for the rest of his life and he wants to go home. In the second witness statement he speaks very honestly about the problems that ST has had with alcohol and how he does not like it when she becomes drunk and can be very difficult. However, he also acknowledges that in the past he has behaved very badly to her, including having assaulted her.

The inherent jurisdiction can be invoked wherever a vulnerable adult is, or is reasonably believed to be, for some reason deprived of the capacity to make the relevant decision, or disabled from making a free choice, or incapacitated or disabled from giving or expressing a real and genuine consent.

The LA had documented incidents when DL had committed physical assaults and verbal threats against his parents, and had exercised a very high degree of coercive control over them and over when and if at all carers could visit them. By the time of the full hearing, the father had moved into a care home. The mother and DL continued to live together, and it was accepted the mother had capacity in relation to where and with whom she lived. It is relevant to note, that the injunction sought and granted in DL constrained what DL could do in the house, but did not require him to leave the house, or prevent him and his mother living together. The injunction was therefore significantly less onerous, and amounted to much less interference with article 8 rights, than is the case in the present case.  </p>

There is, in my view, a sound and strong public policy justification for this to be so. The existence of &#8216;elder abuse&#8217;, as described by Professor Williams, is sadly all too easy to contemplate. Indeed the use of the term &#8216;elder&#8217; in that label may inadvertently limit it to a particular age group whereas, as the cases demonstrate, the will of a vulnerable adult of any age may, in certain circumstances, be overborne. Where the facts justify it, such individuals require and deserve the protection of the authorities and the law so that they may regain the very autonomy that the appellant rightly prizes. The young woman in Re G (above) who would, as Bennett J described, lose her mental capacity if she were once again exposed to the unbridled and adverse influence of her father is a striking example of precisely this point. </span></p>

At an interim hearing Hayden J had made orders preventing Mr Meyers from living at home and from living with his son. The proceedings had been going on since 2017 and it is clear from the judgment that the local authority had made copious efforts to support Mr Meyers in his own home and that it had become impossible to do so because of the son&#8217;s behaviour, see [10 and 11]. The evidence as to the conditions that Mr Meyers had been living in could hardly have been more extreme, see [15]. However, he remained adamant that he did not wish to live in the care home and wished to return home to live with his son. </p>

I do not doubt that there is strong paternal love, alongside a real dependency on KF as the only family Mr Meyers perceives to be left to him. I have not seen any evidence of KF forcing his father, either physically or verbally to act against his will but I am clear that the intensity of this relationship occludes Mr Meyers's ability to take rational and informed decisions. Mr Meyers, is, as I have said, determined to keep well and strong. His ambition to reach 100 years of age is keenly felt. The life force beats strongly within him. Return to the bungalow, whilst his son remains living there and in the absence of an appropriate package of care, as the Local Authority correctly submits, jeopardises Mr Meyers life in a real and not merely theoretical sense. When Mr Meyers left the bungalow he was malnourished, dehydrated and hallucinating in consequence of an infection. He nonetheless managed to raise the alarm. Next time he might not be so fortunate. Though he says he is, in effect, prepared to take the risk (" I would rather die as a result of [KF] than live a life without [him]") I cannot easily reconcile this with Mr Meyers' lusty and vigorous attitude to life generally.  </span></p>

KF's influence on his father is insidious and pervasive. It triggers Mr Meyers's sense of duty, guilt, love and responsibility. These, in my assessment, are pronounced facets of Mr Meyers's character, reflected in a different way in his sense of duty, love for his country and pride in his medals. In this particular context however, these admirable features of his personality have become confused and distorted in a relationship in which the two men have become so enmeshed that the autonomy of each has been compromised. In reality, KF exerts an influence over his father which is malign in its effect if not in its intention. The consequence is to disable Mr Meyers from making a truly informed decision which impacts directly on his health and survival. </span></p>

As I emphasised in Redbridge London Borough Counsel v A (supra), I instinctively recoil from intervening in the decision making of a capacious adult. However well motivated the State may be in seeking, paternalistically, to protect people from their own unwise decisions, it is a dangerous course which has the potential to threaten fundamental rights and freedoms. Again, as I said in Redbridge London Borough Counsel v A, the inherent jurisdiction is not ubiquitous and should be utilised sparingly. Here Mr Meyers' life requires to be protected and I consider that, ultimately, the State has an obligation to do so. </span></p>

However, it appears to me that the answer to this case, and the correct analytical framework arises much more clearly under article 8. In order for article 5 to be in play the orders sought would have to be restricting KR&#8217;s liberty. However, the LA do not seek KR to be required to live at CP, they merely require him not to live with ST. Although in practice KR given his condition would have little or no choice certainly in the short run, but to live at CP if the order was made, the order itself would not be a removal of his liberty. As such I do not think that this is a case where article 5 is in truth the issue. This entirely accords with Cobb </p>

That had now been done and KR was clear that he wanted to leave CP and live with ST. Mr Mant argued that the use of the inherent jurisdiction in this type of case was limited to the provision of such thinking space, as contemplated by Macur J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">LBL</span>, and to the degree that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Meyers</span> suggests that a wider and more permanent order could be made it was wrongly decided.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">The fact that he is physically vulnerable cannot possibly be sufficient to incur the use of the inherent jurisdiction. In my view the principles that are articulated in the Mental Capacity Act Code about assumptions about capacity not being made on the basis simply of age and physical disability must apply equally strongly when it comes to determining whether an individual is vulnerable within the meaning of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">SA</span>.  There is some evidence that KR&#8217;s views as to where he wants to live fluctuate, and may change when he is with or has just been with ST. However, it is important to be careful to distinguish between the entirely natural and common influence that one close family member will have over another, and the &#8220;undue influence&#8221; or &#8220;coercion&#8221; identified in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">SA </span>and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">DL</span><span style="font-style:italic">. </span>If a dysfunctional family relationship is to fall within these principles then the evidence has to show that the vulnerable individual is incapable of making their own decision.  </p>

As such he would fall into the principles set out by Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Wakefield MDC v DN</span> at [47] about the inherent jurisdiction being used on an interim basis while further inquiries are made. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">However, by the time the matter came before me KR had been living away from ST for a period of almost 6 months. His evidence was clear in his two witness statements that he wanted to leave the care home and live with ST. The witness statements suggested that he had carefully weighed up the pros and cons of living with ST, and come up with a well thought out position. This might fall within what the Mental Capacity Act calls an unwise decision, but if an adult without capacity is allowed to make an unwise decision so too must someone facing an application under the inherent jurisdiction.  I do not reject the possibility that in extremely exceptional cases the inherent jurisdiction might be used for long term or permanent orders forcing the vulnerable adult not to live with the person(s) he wants to, as was the case in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Meyers</span>. However, that must be a truly exceptional case. As was contemplated by Macur J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">LBL</span>, and apparently supported by McFarlane LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">DL</span> at [67], the normal use of the inherent jurisdiction is to secure for the individual, who is subject to the alleged coercion or undue influence, a space in which their true decision making can be reestablished. If the inherent jurisdiction is used beyond this then the level of interference in the individual&#8217;s article 8 rights will become increasingly difficult to justify. </p>

In my view there are two key differences from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Meyers</span>, which I will consider through the analytical framework of article 8. Firstly, there is the scale of the interference in stopping a couple, who have been married for 40 years and both of whom have capacity, from living together. It is hard to imagine the State interfering more intrusively in a person&#8217;s private life.

The factors which are relevant here are the level of risk to KR and whether there are less intrusive means that could have been employed by the LA. The evidence in the present case as to risk to KR is very much less strong than was the case in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Meyers</span>. As Ms Jones largely accepted in cross examination, the evidence of risk of fatality to KR does not hold up to scrutiny. Ms Jones raised two risks. She argued that KR could be left alone by ST for prolonged periods and thus not be given food and water and that raised a risk of fatality; and that ST might assault him. The first posited risk was simply unrealistic. ST was letting the carers in generally at least once a day, and if she did leave him for a long period the carers were coming around three times a day and thus could take emergency measures (i.e. call the police) if he had been left for an unreasonable period and they could not access the property. I do not doubt that at times ST can be very difficult, and that there is a risk that she might leave KR particularly if she was drinking. But this risk was  controlled by the carers visiting regularly.  </p>

It is difficult overstate how misjudged this approach was, given the colossal interference that the LA then saw fit to pursue through this litigation, not to mention the cost of that litigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">In terms of risk to KR from ST, I accept that this is a couple with a history of domestic violence. Historically KR accepts that he did hit ST, but it is obvious now that given his physical disability he is more at risk from ST. There was some evidence from bruising that ST may have assaulted KR but this is certainly not clear. In any event it would only be in the most exceptional case that the State would seek to forcibly prevent a couple from living together where there was a history of domestic violence, in circumstances where both genuinely said they wanted to live together. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">Further, this is again a point where the LA have plainly failed to properly consider less intrusive means to mitigate the alleged risk. The couple live in a one bedroom flat and due to KR&#8217;s disability ST has been having to sleep on a sofa in the living room ever since KR returned home in 2015. ST is obviously under extreme strain living in these circumstances and being KR&#8217;s primary carer. I asked what steps had been made to find them more suitable accommodation, but Ms Bamfield told me there were no supported flats available, and they were simply on the LA&#8217;s waiting list for a two bedroom flat. It is obvious to me that before seeking a highly draconian order and making such a colossal interference in this couple&#8217;s article 8 rights it was incumbent on the LA to ensure that they had suitable accommodation. That simply has not been done.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">In conclusion I therefore find that the risks on the facts of this case do not justify the interference under article 8(2). Further I find that the LA has not properly considered whether there are less intrusive means by which KR could be properly protected. In these circumstances I find that making the order sought would not have been necessary or proportionate.  </p>
