She was born in 2018 to her mother (&#8220;M&#8221;) who was then 19 and her father (&#8220;F&#8221;) who was then 17. They are now 25 and 23 respectively. Sadly during her short life, Annie has been the subject of legal proceedings twice previously. This case marks the third set of private legal proceedings concerning her welfare.</span></p>

She was legally assisted through the previous two sets of proceedings and at the start of this third set of proceedings by her sister (&#8220;S&#8221;) who is a qualified non-practising solicitor. She also remains very close to her mother, Annie&#8217;s maternal grandmother (&#8220;MGM&#8221;). F is likewise close to his mother, Annie&#8217;s paternal grandmother (&#8220;PGM&#8221;).</span></p>

She has done so since 2020. However, there is no formal child arrangements order for Annie to live with MGM. Neither does MGM currently have parental responsibility for Annie. Annie&#8217;s older maternal half sister Brie (also a pseudonym) who is 7 also lives in that same house and likewise only spends time with M.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;border-style:none"><span style="color:#000000">These fresh proceedings have arisen subject to two applications made on 30 March 2023; (i) an application from M to vary the extant Child Arrangements Order so that Annie no longer spends time with F, and, (ii) an application from MGM for a parental responsibility order. These were precipitated by allegations of abuse made against F that were purportedly disclosed on the 4 February 2023, only 3 days after District Judge Spanton had concluded the second set of proceedings on 1 February 2023. In that second set of proceedings the court had ordered that Annie continue to live with M and spend substantial time with F on a fortnightly basis (&#8220;the CAO&#8221;).</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;border-style:none"><span style="color:#000000">The matter was then heard by HHJ Farquhar on 5 May 2023 who determined that a fact finding hearing was necessary, that the CAO couldn&#8217;t be enforced until then, but that Annie should attend weekly supervised contact at a contact centre until the next hearing. It was also ordered that M be assessed for an intermediary. Perhaps optimistically, HHJ Farquhar also set the matter down for a combined 2-day fact-find/final hearing on 22-23 August 2023, no doubt in the hope that the applications could be promptly addressed and resolved without delay.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;border-style:none"><span style="color:#000000">As matters transpired, there was not an effective final hearing in August 2023. Instead, because of various matters not having been resolved within such a tight timescale, including the necessary Communicourt intermediary assessment, police disclosure, video disclosure, and M&#8217;s application for legal aid, the hearing was adjourned to the first available date after 24 October 2023 but still with a time estimate of 2 days. Critically the PTR was vacated but not relisted.</span></p>

On the 17 January 2024 at a hearing before me, it was plain that the matter was still not properly prepared and needed again to be adjourned because of significant failings from M&#8217;s solicitors to obtain all the necessary evidence and disclosure for an effective hearing. The matter was therefore relisted to a 4-day hearing from 17-20 June 2024 before me sitting as a Recorder where I had time set aside that would not ordinarily be available to the District Bench.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;border-style:none"><span style="color:#000000">I subsequently made a wasted costs order against M&#8217;s solicitors for their inexcusable failings in properly preparing the case for that aborted hearing. The adjournment had caused significant expense for F who is privately paying for representation via the generosity of, and loans secured by, his extended family. His legal spend as of today for all 3 sets of proceedings has been in the region of &#163;40,000. I also attached a penal notice to the order for supervised contact which was subsequently complied with by the maternal family.</span></p>

Unfortunately, even the start of this hearing was plagued by further procedural difficulty because of M&#8217;s intermediary falling unwell and therefore being unable to attend, meaning that M could not give evidence on the first day as originally timetabled. M&#8217;s intermediary has however been able to attend for Days 2-4 of the hearing. As such, the amended timetable was largely retained, meaning that I spent the entirety of Day 1 hearing MGM&#8217;s evidence. Day 2 was concerned with the evidence of M, the maternal aunt S and the Social Worker from the Local Authority  who I shall refer to by the pseudonym &#8220;Ms Jackson&#8221;. Day 3 was used for the evidence of F and PGM, with submissions from counsel in the afternoon. Today (Day 4) has been used for deliberation, judgment and matters arising.</p>

As such, I have invited all counsel to address me as to the same during closing.</span></p>

In the first, MGM&#8217;s tone is hectoring and stressed and could fairly be termed interrogatory. Likewise, Annie begins cheerfully but becomes increasingly distressed, to the point of becoming defensive and insistent that she has told the truth. The second video, which appears to resume 9 seconds later, presents MGM with a far calmer tone and Annie speaking in a quiet, soft and more uncertain tone. No explanation has been offered as to who or what &#8216;froggy&#8217; is and why there was no follow up on it being &#8216;froggy&#8217; who &#8220;told them that&#8221;.</span></p>

[Ms Jackson] explained that when Annie first made the allegation, she said it was Caleb who had put a toy inside her bottom but MGM told her this was not possible. If Caleb, at age 4, has engaged in sexualised behaviour including penetrating Annie's anus, this is extremely concerning and indicates a likelihood he may have experienced sexual harm himself&#8230;</span></p>

The timing of the allegation may be relevant, being made shortly after the unsuccessful application to reduce F&#8217;s level of contact with Annie, with MGM possibly seeking to ensure contact will no longer go ahead. It is very rare for children to make false allegations and they are more likely to minimise and deny, rather than embellish. There is concern regarding the nature of the recordings made by MGM though it is possible that MGM has encouraged / coerced / coached Annie's comments following receiving a genuine disclosure from Annie.</span></p>

Although this was directly ordered with M having been represented at the hearing by counsel, that order was not complied with until enforced at the later hearing of 17 January 2024. This was despite F having located and made applications to two different contact centres. Indeed, it is common ground that it was because of MGM creating such hostile barriers to any contact commencing, that the first Contact Centre then refused to facilitate the same, even following a later court direction encouraging it to reconsider. The centre manager considered it &#8216;non negotiable&#8217; to be able to work with MGM such was the high level of hostility encountered.</span></p>

As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is &#8216;capable of amounting to a corroboration.&#8217; In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of  </span>R v Middleton<span style="font-style:italic"> [2001] Crim.L.R. 251. &#8216;In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should, therefore, take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt&#8217;.&#8217;</span></p>

Rather than reflect on the impropriety of this action, a step which has led to F being effectively &#8216;cut out of the loop&#8217; of knowing about his own daughter&#8217;s medical needs and health, she considered it an oversight, before somewhat improbably asserting, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I&#8217;ve filled out a form for every individual person in my house</span>.&#8221; Which would of course mean her having filled out GP forms not only for the three minor children in her house, but for her adult son, her adult daughters, and also her adult son in law who is a legal professional.

She was however clear, that Annie seemed to be referencing her &#8216;bum&#8217; by which she meant anus, and not her vulva.

This was in the knowledge that she was a direct witness to the aftermath of the initial purported disclosure on 4 February 2023 and the actions taken in respect of Annie thereafter. She was certainly and deliberately vague as to what extent she had assisted MGM in &#8216;putting together&#8217; her witness statement, and was similarly elusive about how and why she had read at least some of the confidential court documentation in this case.

It is clear that from late 2019 up until the outset of these proceedings, both the father and the maternal family had made a plethora of accusations against the other. This approach appeared - at least at face value - to weaponise bruises, scratches or scrapes as proof of purported abuse and/or neglect. I am not apportioning any blame for this as &#8216;equal&#8217; or saying it was &#8216;like for like&#8217;. Rather I am neutrally observing that both &#8216;sides&#8217; to this case have engaged in behaviour that was at least partially mirrored by the other in what became a cyclical pattern. That is particularly difficult in this case because the historical reality was that Annie <span style="font-style:italic">did </span>suffer from maternal neglect, leading her to be placed on a Child Protection Plan, and being removed from M&#8217;s primary care.

I find that this has played a significant part in skewing or warping the initial ability of MGM and S to more carefully and sensibly engage with the plethora of improbable scattered stories Annie gave in relation to the Lego Allegation. It inhibited their capacity to apply a more detached wisdom to recognise that she had not been abused at all, and was &#8211; as she insisted in the original video- telling the police the truth. Simply that she had scratched her itchy bottom. Their inability to carefully manage Annie&#8217;s own welfare apart from what has been termed a possible &#8216;hyper-sensitivity&#8217; to the possible mention of abuse, presented and continues to present a real concern as to their ongoing ability to manage Annie&#8217;s welfare in the future.</p>

Annie in this case was a purported victim or complainant. Ms Jackson said on multiple occasions under cross examination that she reached her premature conclusions by &#8216;believing&#8217; Annie. However, this failed to engage with both the wider evidential canvas <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> with the complex nuance that needed to be applied when a child had given maybe six or seven accounts that were fundamentally at odds with the other. After all, Annie at various times asserted differing explanations that, (a) she had an itchy bum and scratched it, (b) building blocks fell on her, causing her bum to bleed, (c) a Care Bear from MGM&#8217;s house crawled into her bottom, (d) her cousin Caleb put a toy in her bottom, (e) no-one did it, (f) she dreamt it, and (g) that &#8216;Daddy did it&#8217;. It is not possible to simultaneously &#8216;believe&#8217; all of these accounts. No-one has invited the court to believe the account of a 30cm Care Bear crawling like a cat into Annie&#8217;s vagina. Rather, it is the role of the court to weigh the issues, to scrutinise the entire &#8216;broad canvas&#8217; of the evidence in its totality and to make findings on the balance of probabilities accordingly. When the evidence is properly and carefully weighed on that basis, the na&#239;vet&#233; of simply cherry picking or believing one isolated statement of a 4-year-old child is exposed as being wholly unsustainable, and an unsafe basis upon which to make such profound findings. </p>

This is consistent with her previously having been treated for worms when presenting as itchy in the past. It is also consistent with the clear medical inspections which revealed no harm, her happy, contented and talkative demeanour, and her ongoing insistence that she felt safe and happy with F and wanted to spend time with him.</span></p>

From the making of the videos of 8 February 2023 onwards, I find that this behaviour of MGM and S, either subconsciously or wilfully, effectively coached Annie into repeating the disclosure in various terms. She was encouraged to repeat this and was emotionally rewarded by stating the same. A narrative was fixed by the maternal family thereafter, and given the label that Daddy did &#8216;rude things&#8217; to Annie. This narrative was morphed from an early unambiguous disclosure of anal bleeding, into vaginal penetration only at a later stage.

A significant part of that rationale is indeed linked to safeguarding and Child Protection so that children and adults alike are able to speak in a straightforward and accurate way about the anatomy of genitalia.

Annie in reality lives with MGM (and S) and has done for some years, despite MGM having no PR and no legal standing to undertake the same. As has already become apparent in this case, this has meant that MGM has listed herself both as next of kin and legal guardian on Annie&#8217;s GP registration form, whereas F has not even been registered and has no idea as to her current treatment. For example, there was apparently a recent concern or suspicion that Annie may be suffering from an (unrelated) medical condition, which F only discovered during the course of evidence given during this hearing. Whilst such an informal loose arrangement under advisement by the Local Authority may have been tenable for an infant or young child when the wider family were on better terms, it is plainly an unviable situation now. Annie&#8217;s welfare patently requires a proper assessment of her long-term future living arrangements with a particular view to whether MGM should be given PR and/or whether it is in Annie&#8217;s welfare interests to continue to live with her and S at all.</span></p>

This is to ascertain the motivations for the wider actions of the MGM and S over these past 16 months, to ensure that any emotional harm suffered by Annie can be treated, and to advise on how similar future exposure can be safeguarded against. That assessment will also consider the ability of all parties but in particular M, MGM and S to reflect on this judgment and demonstrate any ability either to respond appropriately to this judgment or retrench to their former narrative. Although S is not a party to these proceedings, it is clear that she - alongside MGM - has taken a quasi-parental role over Annie&#8217;s life over these past years, including taking her to the doctors and even giving instructions to the Social Worker in previous proceedings.

It will also explain why Ms Jackson is being discharged from further work with this family. I trust this will ensure that future cases involving disputed allegations that are subject to future findings of fact are dealt with sensitively without pre-judging the outcome so as not to prejudice the viability of a hearing, but more importantly, so as not to damage the welfare of a child. I direct this as a constructive point of hopeful assistance, and not out of any spirit of condemnation or to lay blame at the door of a department that I am all to keenly aware faces a vast workload with dwindling resource and time available to meet it.</span></p>
