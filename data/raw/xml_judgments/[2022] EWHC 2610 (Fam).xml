N was joined as second respondent to the proceedings by order of HHJ Hess, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, on 26 September 2022. N is represented through his solicitor guardian, Kevin Skinner. N opposes the application. He does not wish to return to Latvia. He also does not wish to  be separated from his mother and sisters.

This has to be noted in the context of the mother&#8217;s over-arching allegation that the father&#8217;s whole litigation strategy is part of his controlling and coercive behaviour; it is surprising therefore that he has not sought to put the mother under the threat that primary care might be removed from her and given to her alleged antagonist, him. </span></p>

He obtained an order against her once she had left on the holiday, to prohibit her from leaving, which causes me to doubt whether such automatic permission (akin to the English permission under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>) does apply or if it does whether it is for 3 months.

The case was then appealed to the Civil Court of Vidzeme Regional Court, which on 7 June 2022 overturned the decision. Its judgment is important and I will return to it. But essentially it allowed the father&#8217;s appeal and provided for joint custody between the parents. The Latvian Court of Appeal dismissed the father&#8217;s complaint of perjury and violation of the children&#8217;s rights. There were some inconsequential administrative costs of the appeal which the father was ordered to pay to the mother (a total of &#8364;72.02) and a legal aid contribution of &#8364;110.

I was surprised as this scenario is a highly probable one. If a return were ordered, the Mother would probably not simply surrender their care to a man whom she believes to be something of a monster.

Also, that the older half-sibling was not going to return. The Mother stated that she was thereby forced to elect which of her children she was going to stay with.

It is, as article 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect. Thus, the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting state to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so. In Hague Convention cases within the European Union, article 11.4 of the Brussels II Revised Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003) expressly provides that a court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of article 13(b) "if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return". Thus, it has to be shown that those arrangements will be effective to secure the protection of the child. With the best will in the world, this will not always be the case. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">No one intended that an instrument designed to secure the protection of children from the harmful effects of international child abduction should itself be turned into an instrument of harm</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.&#8221;</span></p>

It would be indeterminate because the court has no information as to when or how the mother and the children would be together again. These children, aged five and three, would be leaving their lifelong main carer without anyone being able to tell them when they will see her again. In my view it is not difficult to describe that situation, in the circumstances of this case, as one which they should not be expected to tolerate. I acknowledge that the current situation has been caused by the mother's actions, and that she was herself responsible for severing the children from their father but, as referred to above, the court's focus must be on the children's situation and not the source of the risk.&#8221;</span></p>

In such cases, even though the taking parent's return with the child would in most cases protect the child from the grave risk, any efforts to introduce measures of protection or arrangements to facilitate the return of the parent may prove to be ineffectual since the court cannot, in general, force the parent to go back. It needs to be emphasised that, as a rule, the parent should not &#8211; through the wrongful removal or retention of the child &#8211; be allowed to create a situation that is potentially harmful to the child, and then rely on it to establish the existence of a grave risk to the child.&#8221;</span></p>

The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country.

There may, of course, be cases when this is not realistic because the allegations are not connected. However, I would suggest that, when a judge takes this course, he/she should make this clear.

On the mother's case, she would have insufficient financial resources to meet, even, her and the children's basic needs. Putting to one side the judge's reliance on the father as a source of financial support, the judge had no substantive evidence that the mother would be entitled to state benefits which would enable her to meet the needs of herself and the children for any significant period of time. Again, the evidence from the Spanish authorities suggested that there was, at least, considerable fragility in the mother's position which might lead to the children being taken into care. The judge's dismissal of the mother's concern about this because they would be returned with the mother, and not returned to foster care, does not, with all due respect, address the mother's concern.</p>

The rhetorical question of why did she engage with the Latvian process at all? (including to appeal level) if she had no faith in the Latvian administration justice, remains unanswered. (It is also noteworthy that no single incident was cited of the court&#8217;s supposed bias (indeed, the Court&#8217;s rejected some of the father&#8217;s contentions) or an occasion where the Latvian police corruptly failed to act.)

There are three foci to the protective measures I plan to put in place &#8211; (a) financial security (b) domestic violence protection which will include limiting the amount of time that the parties will come into contact with each other and (c) a short hiatus before the children should return. (c) requires some explanation; the mother&#8217;s anxiety is in part triggered by her fear that she will not be able to engage the Latvian courts in time; her counsel helpfully told me that she needs 10 days to issue her application and it will take 4 weeks to be heard. By giving a little longer to facilitate the return of the children, I am giving her the opportunity of engaging the Latvian courts before the return. This should allay her fears; if the Court in Latvia says her fears are misplaced or even invented then they will have been in the best position to do so. If they recognise her fears and their impact on the children then it is likely they will give her a further period of time. In any event it goes  along way to reassuring her in respect of the fears which are the bedrock upon which her anxiety and claimed mental health issues is based.</span></p>

The underlying and central foundation of the Convention is that, where a child has been unilaterally removed from the land of her habitual residence in breach of someone's rights of custody, then she should be swiftly returned to that country for the courts of that country to decide on her long-term future.</p>

It is important to understand what the Convention does not do. The Convention does not order a child who has been removed in the circumstances I have described to live with anybody. The Convention does not provide that the parent who is left behind should, on the return of the child, have contact or access in any particular way. The Convention does not provide that, when an order for return to the child's homeland is made, the child should stay there indefinitely. All the Convention provides is that the child should be returned for the specific purpose and limited period to enable the court of her homeland to decide on her long-term future. That is all it decides. </span></p>
