He has a diagnosis of autism, severe learning disabilities, and William&#8217;s syndrome, which is characterised by developmental delay and other variable features. He is unable to communicate verbally but is effective, indeed dextrous, in non-verbal communication. He has, during the course of the last twelve months, been diagnosed as suffering from chronic kidney disease and has now entered end-stage renal failure. This application which I have heard during the course of today and yesterday was to have been heard later this month but Jordan&#8217;s condition deteriorated to such a degree that the case had to be brought forward. For the avoidance of doubt, with end-stage renal failure, without haemodialysis treatment, Jordan will further succumb to the disease, deteriorate and die.</span></p>

The proceedings in April concentrated on whether it might be possible for Jordan to receive a kidney transplant. Dr T was consulted. Dr T is a Consultant Nephrologist, who has 20 years&#8217; experience as a Transplant expert and has been involved in the care of more than 3000 kidney transplant recipients. He has played a significant role in advising on kidney transplantation to NHS England Renal Services Transformation Program and is an Executive member of the British Transplantation Society. He was clear that if haemodialysis were to take place it was essential that the patient was spontaneously compliant. Moreover, he considered that the capacity to participate, co-operatively, in haemodialysis was a prerequisite of eligibility to be placed on the transplant list. </span></p>

He told me that in the not-so-distant past, before society began to develop a more enlightened understanding of the needs of people with disabilities, a patient like Jordan would almost certainly not have been considered suitable for a transplant. It was agreed, in April 2023, that Jordan should go on the transplant list. The time involved in waiting for a suitable transplant, as the public is well aware, is considerable. It was thought that unavoidable delay could be utilised to best effect by ensuring that Jordan started upon what has been called a &#8220;desensitisation plan&#8221;. By this, it was meant that specialist nurses would work with him to replicate the circumstances of haemodialysis, to enable him to adjust and prepare for it.</span></p>

However, the evidence shows that he has a real capacity to learn and adapt even to intrusive procedures. Nobody was certain how Jordan would respond to the desensitisation plan, but I think it is accurate to describe that response as has having exceeded everybody&#8217;s expectations. I think it is important to say that these achievements have been both remarkable and transformative. They are due to the work and commitment of a number of people, most obviously and most importantly Jordan himself, for whom it cannot have been easy. Jordan has been supported by the unwavering commitment of his insightful, intelligent and endlessly patient parents, and also, the dedication of the nurses whose daily and regular task it has been to implement the work.</span></p>

It would have been quite remarkable if it had not been characterised by some disappointment and inevitable difficulties. But it has been able to achieve a gradual but clear diminishment of Jordan&#8217;s anxiety about attending hospital. His father stresses that his condition does not stop him learning from his experiences. There is a great deal of evidence of that. On a practical, utilitarian level, that is achieved by endless repeat and reward cycles. Jordan, who has had to use the NHS services periodically throughout his life, has, as his father said, come, eventually, to associate hospital as a place where he goes when he is in pain or unwell and ultimately feels better.&#160; Recently, and very surprisingly, against the backdrop of the past, he had to attend at A&amp;E because his radiologically inserted gastronomy (&#8216;RIG&#8217;) tube was dislodged. His mother told me that there was no priority made for his disabilities, nor for a moment did she suggest there should be. Jordan waited for many hours in A&amp;E and cooperated with the treatment ultimately required. That is a significant milestone in his life and must, at least in part, be due to the desensitisation work he has been participating in. His mother&#8217;s pride in this achievement was almost palpable. I had the real sense that she had not considered that Jordan would ever have been able to manage it. Long hours of delay at A&amp;E are now sadly commonplace. They are a challenge for all of us but for Jordan, it is a real accomplishment and rightly identified as such by his family. </span></p>

However, despite his achievements on the desensitisation programme, a conclusion was reached that he would not be able to undertake haemodialysis without sedation. Haemodialysis will involve Jordan attending the hospital&#160;three times a week for three to four hours at a time and remaining quiet and still for that period. I note that absent sedation, Jordan has on occasion in fact been able to achieve a three-hour stint in hospital without moving around. I am not sure that when I heard the case in April 2023, I really thought he would be able to achieve that. Thus, what I am emphasising, and what all the clinicians have, at different stages, referred to, is the &#8216;dynamism&#8217; of this case, by which I mean that circumstances change regularly and perhaps more significantly than are always readily grasped or absorbed. This presents a real challenge for all involved in Jordan&#8217;s care, particularly, in trying to evaluate where his best interests lie. It requires there to be regular and efficient sharing of information between different professionals in different areas of medicine and with repeated updating. It also imposes on very busy professionals a requirement to absorb new material and readjust their views to a changing landscape. This is always difficult but, I recognise, particularly so when services are under pressure.</span></p>

The fact that Jordan has autism and severe learning disabilities, does not in any way weaken the obligation to achieve the objectives that Lady Hale identifies. For Jordan and others in similar circumstances, the process requires creativity, imagination, and determination to elicit what their likely views and attitudes to treatment may be. One of the witnesses expressed the view that Jordan&#8217;s situation effectively deprived him of a voice. That is not the case. As the case law of this court has consistently demonstrated, challenging though it may be, understanding the wishes and feelings of those who have experienced lifelong incapacity, across a sphere of decision making, is achievable. It has been achieved, in this hearing, as in so many others by focusing on Jordan&#8217;s personality and approach to life. The primary conduits for this crucial information have been his remarkable parents. This is not only through the videos they have sent to me, which show Jordan interacting with familiar carers at his day centre but by their descriptions of him: his approach to life, his enjoyment of people, his bold, slightly zany sense of humour which pokes fun provocatively but always in a good-mannered way. Their descriptions have not only brought Jordan&#8217;s views and attitudes into the evidence, but they have, through their words, secured him an almost tangible presence in this courtroom. It is amazing how the description of friends, relatives and parents can achieve this with the frequency that they do. To observe it is one of the great privileges of hearing cases in the Court of Protection. I also recall how at an earlier hearing, Jordan&#8217;s parents described to me his utter delight in watching a particularly flamboyant former President of the United States of America and similarly extravagant former Prime Minister of the UK. Jordan&#8217;s fascination with these two large personalities, in many ways, is further illustration of his curiosity for life, his vibrant humour, and his determination to look outwards towards the world rather than inwards to his circumstances. His inquisitiveness about everything but particularly people, demonstrates a real engagement with life. </span></p>

Sometimes, the court confronts circumstances which, when analysed, contemplate the protraction of death rather than the promotion of life. However, the preservation of life will always weigh heavily in the balancing exercise that the court has to conduct. Intrinsic to that exercise must be an unswerving recognition of the obligation to promote personal autonomy, human agency and dignity. These underpin the ECHR and are integral to it. </span></p>

Jordan is a young man who enjoys life away from medical treatment procedures and is a much-loved member of his family. He has shown remarkable resilience throughout his life, having endured numerous invasive and often painful medical interventions, but the relative success of the first desensitisation programme in my view suggests he can learn to tolerate procedures when they are carried out in a Jordan-centred way.</span></p>

In addition, he will inevitably have some pain and discomfort which may increase his distress and sensitivity and impact adversely upon his tolerance for these medical interventions. From my experience of working with Jordan, I think that this procedure and post-operative treatment is only going to be possible with heavy sedation. The risks and benefits of that are for the anaesthetists and intensive care teams at CUH to consider. I would of course be happy to liaise with my counterparts at CUH to help them plan for any admission for Jordan with my knowledge of him.&#8221;</span></p>

I was left with the clear impression that he had outstripped her expectation. That said, she did not avoid the reality that he can become agitated and distressed. As Nurse W infers above, the evaluation of risks and benefits of any regime of sedation relies heavily, albeit not determinatively, on the evidence of the general anaesthetist. It is important that I record that notwithstanding the above, Nurse W ultimately considered that haemodialysis, with sedation would not be in Jordan&#8217;s best interests. She viewed his historical reluctance to attend hospital and his anxiety about needles as reflecting a resistance to treatment which she takes as him indicating that he would not want the intrusive haemodialysis regime. I found Nurse W to have conducted a thorough and insightful analysis of the desensitisation work but on this last point, i.e., her interpretation of Jordan&#8217;s wishes, she has not had the benefit of the much broader range of information that I have and for that reason, I consider this aspect of her analysis is incomplete. </span></p>

Sometimes, as here, the dialectic generated by that approach can be a constructive exercise, in that it stimulates focus on the alternative analysis.

This could happen between dialysis sessions or during a session. There is a moderate risk of pain or discomfort if he forcibly pulled out a dialysis CVC that had been given time (usually 2-3 weeks) to &#8216;bed in&#8217; underneath the skin. There is a small unquantifiable risk of bleeding if the dialysis CVC is removed in an uncontrolled manner.

These risks are definite but not quantifiable and would result in the need for additional treatment such as intravenous antibiotic treatment which may require admission to hospital, further procedures under sedation or general anaesthetic such as removal of the existing CVC and a delayed insertion of a new CVC, critical illness or death.</span></p>

Jordan would require a general anaesthetic for this procedure as he did for his previous procedures such as the RIG, kidney biopsy and gastrointestinal endoscopy. The procedure would be carried out in a theatre or the interventional radiology suite of the hospital. The timing of the procedure would depend upon the availability of the anaesthetist and the operator inserting the CVC (either a renal physician or an interventional radiologist).</span></p>

An infection in the bloodstream may result in a need to wait for at least 48 hrs after removal of the old CVC to allow intravenous antibiotics to work before a new CVC is inserted. An increased blood potassium would represent urgency and may require the insertion of a CVC during non-routine hours with Jordan having to be placed on an emergency theatre list to obtain an anaesthetist to attend.</span></p>

In order to safely deliver the dialysis treatment we consider a proactive approach is in Jordan&#8217;s best interest to allow for a safer delivery of haemodialysis. This would involve Jordan being sedated or anaesthetised on arrival to the designated area in hospital where he would subsequently be dialysed and then allowed to recover from his sedation before leaving for home. This would need to be done three times per week. An alternative option to delivering treatment, which we consider to be a less safe way would be to attempt to connect and dialyse with Jordan awake and to administer intravenous sedation on a reactive basis, leading to potential risk to Jordan or staff during the dialysis treatment. This would involve a heightened risk of loss of dialysis CVC access and ability to dialyse in addition to risks such as bleeding, air embolism and inadequate CVC care with infection. It would involve the need for trained security personnel at his bedside who would need to implement physical restraint which would cause potential distress to Jordan, carers and staff. Either approach would involve a deprivation of Jordan&#8217;s liberty at least three times per week on an open- ended basis until the prospect and success of a transplant materialised.</span></p>

If I may say so, that is very clear from all I have heard and read. Although the Trust has asked me to conclude that dialysis, whilst sedated, is not in Jordan&#8217;s best interests, they have very properly and impressively constructed an alternative care plan, designed to facilitate sedation if I take a contrary view. This is a very careful and well thought through care plan. What is striking is its unswerving focus on Jordan, not just in terms of his personality but by harnessing the positive experiences of the desensitisation programme. I do not propose to set out the care plan here in any detail. Precisely because it is so &#8220;Jordan focused&#8221;, it is also rather an intimate and private document. It is enough to say that it contemplates gradual familiarisation with the kidney centre therapy room, led initially by staff who Jordan knows and is comfortable with but gradually introducing others. It involves simulating a line, preparing him for the sounds that the dialysis machine makes and constructing incentives and positive reinforcement which both the nurses and Jordan&#8217;s parents have found to be effective. The plan is staged to go at a pace that it is thought Jordan will tolerate. What I find so impressive about the plan is how clearly it is drafted and how accessible it is to anybody reading it for the first time. </span></p>

Dr M has extensive experience of working with adults with disabilities. She was asked to advise on how it might be possible to manage Jordan both prior and subsequent to a renal transplant. Jordan remains on the list but suspended until this issue is resolved. Nonetheless, his name is working its way up, during the period of suspension. If he is able, ultimately, to tolerate haemodialysis there is a prospect of a transplant. Dr M has already navigated the insertion of a RIG tube for Jordan, under general anaesthetic, and considers that went well. What is proposed here, however, is very significantly more complex and intrusive. In her report, Dr M proffered the following observations: </span></p>

This could include removing unnecessary monitoring, Camilla and familiar carers calming Jordan if possible or administering sedation either as a planned continuation postoperatively or in a response to agitation. When Jordan had his renal biopsy he was kept sedated afterwards to allow the period of bed rest that was needed. The risk of extended sedation compared to bleeding post kidney biopsy was taken into account. There is always a possibility that Jordan may pull at the IV access. It was obvious when Jordan was ready for the cannula to be removed as he kept pulling at the bandage.</span></p>

She supported the Trusts&#8217; application but was clear that the decision as to whether haemodialysis should be pursued was, ultimately, one for the court. However, it was very clear that she was not in any way compromised ethically about combining dialysis and sedation, in principle. There had been a lot of discussion, both amongst the doctors and nurses, and during the course of the hearing about whether Jordan might satisfactorily be sedated by buccal midazolam. Dr M quickly identified that as a red herring. She told me that the titration of what she referred to as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;clean&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">intravenous medication, enabled the anaesthetists to titrate according to need and to do so quickly and reactively. She contemplated a scenario where Jordan might sometimes only require sedation at such a level that it was effectively equivalent to the buccal midazolam (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;just to let him chill&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">) but equally, that there might be periods where his anxiety required significant sedation. Importantly, when that passed, the sedation level could be quickly lowered. Dr M told me that she was satisfied that she could deliver this with very limited distress to Jordan. She also told me that the recovery period from sedation could, in some patients, be very quick, perhaps only a matter of minutes. In others, it might be longer, even as much as 40 or 50 minutes. Sometimes, the same patient might react to the sedative in a different way. </span></p>

The plan would be to commence haemodialysis in the morning so that much of the fasting would be overnight. His mother told me that this would not present the kind of problem for Jordan that it might do for many of us. Jordan frequently has to be reminded, by prompting, to eat. If he is not, it is unlikely to occur to him. Something of this lay behind the decision to insert the RIG tube. </span></p>

The plans may properly be characterised as pioneering. At every dialysis session, there would need to be an anaesthetist, an operating department practitioner, and airway equipment, including anaesthetic machine/ventilator. This would require haemodialysis to be on the main site and, inevitably, involve allocating important resources which are much in demand. Dr M confronts the risks directly. </span></p>

Some of those risks involve potentially very serious consequences. But the calibration of risk really requires confrontation with the alternatives. Jordan&#8217;s parents have been both intellectually and emotionally rigorous in the way that they have addressed this issue. They have identified Jordan&#8217;s quality of life, as I have set out. They have reflected on Jordan&#8217;s temperament and personality and concluded that he would choose to live. I agree with that conclusion.

Hospitals are busy and inevitably bureaucratic; they must sometimes feel impersonal and institutional. It does not require great imagination to see how parents under stress might sometimes feel resentment, and perhaps conflict. I have no doubt that Jordan&#8217;s parents will at some times have experienced all of this but they have recognised its inevitability and worked around it. They have great respect for all the doctors and nurses involved and a strong and constructive working relationship with them. Jordan is the undoubted beneficiary of this. They have concluded that even in the face of the significant risks that may lie ahead, the point has not come to relinquish Jordan&#8217;s life. They consider that respect for his dignity and autonomy points to affording him this opportunity for life however difficult the path ahead may be. </span></p>

Here, though dialysis is undoubtedly burdensome, it is certainly not futile. On the contrary, it holds out the possibility, by transplantation, of a restoration to health. The real issue is whether the process of dialysis with all its attendant risks is so contrary to Jordan&#8217;s best interests that it should not be pursued. Having regard to Dr M&#8217;s clear view that Jordan&#8217;s sedation can be managed, I have come to the view that the opportunity of dialysis ought to be afforded to Jordan and that such opportunity can properly be said to be in his best interests. </span></p>

The interplay between general anaesthesia and nephrology is key to a proper evaluation of the broad medical picture, again, for the reasons set out. In addition, and with no apology for repetition, I have had extensive opportunity to explore Jordan&#8217;s own likely wishes and feelings to a degree that has not, hitherto, been possible. It is important that I record that the Official Solicitor, on Jordan&#8217;s behalf, has, on the conclusion of the evidence, come to the same view that I have arrived at and for largely similar reasons. </span></p>

How society treats some of its weakest and most vulnerable is undoubtedly a measure of its own health and maturity. They have asked me to lift the reporting restrictions which have, to date, anonymised Jordan&#8217;s name in order to promote these principles. Additionally, there are two more practical objectives which have caused me to yield to their application. Firstly, publicity may be effective in achieving for Jordan what is known an &#8216;altruistic donor&#8217;. By that is meant the receipt of a &#8216;live&#8217; kidney.</span></p>

Most importantly it means the transplant procedure can be planned and prepared for. For Jordan, that is particularly important, for so many of the reasons I have alluded to above. It also serves to enhance the prospect of his compliance. Moreover, there is also real potential that the follow-up treatment might be significantly less burdensome for Jordan than in the case of a cadaveric donation. It is not necessary for me further to burden this judgment with the details underpinning this. Addenbrooke&#8217;s Hospital are prepared to keep Jordan on the transplant list, with what is referred to as &#8220;suspended status&#8221;. The parents hope that they might be able to utilise some degree of publicity in order to seek a suitable kidney match. </span></p>

The central venous catheter (CVC) remains in situ permanently throughout dialysis.  There is an ever-present risk of Jordan pulling it and perhaps detaching it. His parents have assiduously researched to see whether there is any bespoke clothing that can effectively cover the line to diminish risk of Jordan accidentally or intentionally disconnecting the CVC. They have not been able to identify an operative supplier at the moment. They consider that some publicity for this issue, might assist. It strikes me that there is every possibility of this being successful. Having seen photographs of the CVC in situ, in other patients, it strikes me as distinctly possible to achieve some simple and practical solution. In many ways, this might be central to help Jordan achieve the identified goals.</span></p>
