	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The London Borough of Redbridge applies to adjourn this final hearing in respect of a little girl, E, aged 2 years 9 months old.  In this case the London Borough of Redbridge has, by its own admission, failed so comprehensively to comply with the directions of the court that it is necessary in my view (notwithstanding that all parties accept the inevitability of an adjournment in the circumstances I will come to) to examine and record in a short, published judgment the default that has led to the need to adjourn this already very significantly delayed case.</p>

Within this context, the local authority intends within 14 days to provide the court with a comprehensive explanation of the defaults which form the basis of its adjournment application.  In the circumstances, I confine myself for the present to an account of the procedural history that has led to the need for this to case be adjourned, which history is not disputed by the local authority as a matter of fact. </p>

This order was made in the face of the mother&#8217;s case for a continuation of the rehabilitation plan and the local authority&#8217;s case arguing for placement for adoption, supported by the Guardian.&#160; The mother again appealed and the Court of Appeal allowed her appeal on 26 July 2016.</span></p>

Within this context, I pause to note that, during the course of her judgment, Black LJ observed as follows in relation to the case the local authority had placed before the Recorder:</span></p>

The most up to date local authority statement, dated 4 March 2016, was to the effect that a care order should be made and E removed from the mother&#8217;s care, but there was nothing in it about adoption.  The local authority&#8217;s position statement for the March hearing said nothing about adoption either.&#8221;</span></p>

The local authority&#8217;s documentation was not helpful.  The social worker had recently changed. There was no placement application which, although understandable because of the shortness of time between the local authority&#8217;s decision and the hearing, increased the danger that the hearing would fail to focus on the real issues.  The Guardian&#8217;s analysis of the consequences for E being adopted was inadequate as the Recorder accepted, commenting that there was an absence of evidence, both from the local authority and the Guardian about the harm that the child would suffer by being removed from the mother.  All of these matters will have contributed to this careful Recorder not focusing upon and dealing with central issues.&#8221;</span></p>

On that date it was apparent that the local authority had failed to comply with parts of the order of 28 July 2016.   In particular, the local authority had failed to comply with a number of the case management directions, including a failure to file and serve the minutes of any LAC Reviews that had occurred since March 2016 and a witness statement from any Police officer who attended the alleged incident on 27 December 2015.  A further feature of the local authority&#8217;s conduct brought to the Court&#8217;s attention on 1 September 2016 was the alleged persistent failure by the local authority solicitor with conduct of the case to reply to correspondence from the solicitors instructed by the mother.  </p>

The seemingly mundane nature of case management directions belies the fact that they are crucial to the fair administration of justice in a jurisdiction that has available to it arguably the most draconian power available to a court, namely the power to remove a child permanently from his or her birth family.  Within this context, the the task of the case management judge is to arrange a trial that is fair by reference to domestic standards and Arts&#160;6 and 8 of the ECHR (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re&#160;TG (Care Proceedings: Case Management: Expert Evidence)</span> [2013] 1&#160;FLR 1250).  It is because a care case involves the State intervening in the family life of its citizens that it is so important that the local authority comply with the case management directions made by the court, directions that are designed to ensure the fairness of proceedings the outcome of which can be grave.    Further, case management directions are the key tool by which the court maintains fidelity to the statutory principle, embodied <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, that delay must be avoided.

In short, the ADM had taken it upon herself to make findings about the cause and provenance of the aforementioned injuries notwithstanding that the same have not been the subject of forensic investigation or findings within these proceedings.  The late service of the ADM&#8217;s decision had prevented this fundamental issue being identified earlier and at a time it was still capable of remedy without impacting on the final hearing.</p>

In particular, he had been unable even to achieve instructions as to the timetable for a further decision by the ADM.  This was notwithstanding the fact that on 1 September 2016 I had directed the local authority to file and serve by 4pm on 14 October 2016 a further decision of the ADM to be taken in light of additional evidence to be filed ahead of the final hearing and not available when the initial decision was made by the ADM.</p>

Whilst, pending the outcome of the independent investigation the local authority says that it intends to conduct, I have foresworn from a detailed investigation of the <span style="font-style:italic">reasons </span>for the local authority&#8217;s serial default, it is plain from the conclusions of the Court of Appeal, and the subsequent accepted history that I have described, that that default conceded by the local authority has already resulted in shocking levels of delay for this young child.  Plainly, this is a factor that must weigh very heavily indeed in the court&#8217;s decision whether to adjourn the final hearing, particularly in circumstances where it would appear that E is displaying anxiety and confusion consequent upon changes made to her living and contact arrangements whilst these proceedings remain ongoing.

The ADM&#8217;s decision should be timetabled so that both applications are before the court, otherwise the court is likely to be missing important evidence and analysis relevant to evaluating the local authority&#8217;s care plan.  Indeed, without the ADM&#8217;s decision, the care plan is likely to be inchoate or at least conditional (see <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey County Council v S </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/601" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 601" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 601</ref>).  Thus, whilst it may be said that the court is able, in light of the observations made by the Court of Appeal, to anticipate the risks created by the absence of a placement order application, I remain satisfied in light of these well-established principles that it would be inappropriate to proceed to a final hearing absent the decision of the ADM, a placement application and the associated evidence in circumstances where the court is being asked to approve a care plan that will permanently remove E from her mother&#8217;s care and place her for adoption.</p>

As matters stood last Wednesday, no judge of the Family Division could accommodate an adjourned five-day final hearing before the end of February 2017.  Whilst there is a possibility that the matter could be heard in mid-November, that possibility has yet to be confirmed and remains subject to developments in another case.  Further investigation is accordingly required to determine whether this matter can come on for hearing on those dates or whether an alternate date will need to be found.  I nonetheless intend today to give directions that will move this case towards an adjourned final hearing in the shortest time reasonably achievable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Tara Vindis on behalf of the E submitted that this case is one that requires to now be put into &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">special measures</span>&#8217;.  That is an apt analogy.  Within this context, it is my intention that the local authority will provide a written report to me each Friday morning at 10.00am by way of email to my Clerk confirming the continued compliance with the timetable the court intends to impose.  In the event of default on the part of the local authority, the matter will be brought back into the list for a compliance hearing.  It is my expectation that the local authority will comply with its heavy duty to obey the directions of the court.  In this respect, I repeat the following words of the President from his seventh <span style="font-style:italic">View from the President&#8217;s Chambers</span>:</p>

I refer to the slapdash, lackadaisical and on occasions almost contumelious attitude which still far too frequently characterises the response to orders made by family courts. There is simply no excuse for this. Orders, including interlocutory orders, must be obeyed and complied with to the letter and on time. Too often they are not. They are not preferences, requests or mere indications; they are orders. This principle applies as much to orders by way of interlocutory case management directions as to any other species of order. The court is entitled to expect &#8211; and from now on family courts will demand &#8211; strict compliance with all such orders. Both parties and non-parties to whom orders are addressed must take heed. Non-compliance with an order by anyone is bad enough. It is a particularly serious matter if the defaulter is a public body. Non-compliance with orders should be expected to have and will usually have a consequence: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (A Child), Re H (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1177" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1177" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1177</ref>.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, and within this context, I am invited by Ms Maclachlan and Ms Vindis to order that the local authority show cause as to why it should not pay the costs thrown away by the need to hold a compliance hearing last Wednesday and the need to adjourn this final hearing.   Having regard to the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/51" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 51</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref>, the principles set out in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Ridehalgh v Horsfield </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 3 All ER 848" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 3 All ER 848</ref> and the matters set out above, I am entirely satisfied that this is a case where it is appropriate to order that the local authority show cause why it should not pay the costs thrown away in respect of the hearing on 12 October 2016 and the adjourned final hearing.   Whilst Mr Pavlou asks that the court await the results of the independent enquiry into the failures set out above that is to be held by the local authority before the court orders that the local authority show cause, I remain satisfied that such an order is appropriate at this stage having regard to the matters I have set out above. The outcome of the independent enquiry will, if relevant, no doubt be relied on by the local authority as part of its effort to show cause when the application for wasted costs comes on for hearing.</p>

I order the London Borough of Redbridge to show cause why it should not pay the wasted costs of the hearing on 12 October 2016 and this final hearing.  I will give directions to ensure the efficacy of the adjourned final hearing on a date to be identified.</p>
