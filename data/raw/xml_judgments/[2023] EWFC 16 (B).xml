	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The real issues were not immediately clear to me, partly because Mr G is not represented. It comes to this: if he owns 50 per cent of the London property, there is enough equity to pay the confiscation order as his share would be &#163;509,164. If he only has a one third share, his share is worth &#163;336,982, and not sufficient to pay the order. In fact, Mr G told me, and this seems to be confirmed in correspondence, that his mother agrees that the confiscation order should be paid from the sale of the London property even if some of this comes from her share. It does not leave any scope for a lump sum order. If I were to make an order which transfers the London property or has the effect of preventing it being applied to the confiscation order, there is a prospect of the Husband being ordered to return to prison.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is relatively little contentious law, but it was necessary to understand the working of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (&#8220;POCA&#8221;). The confiscation order was made at hearing in May 2019. I have seen a transcript. The confiscation order was assessed in the full sum of &#163;337,214.78. The court also considered the available assets to meet this debt. The Wife and the Husband&#8217;s mother Mrs AG were given the opportunity to make representations, but the Husband says the hearing was mostly concerned with the quantification and his mother did not attend. Ms Jackson and Ms Wood agree that confiscation and family law principles may involve consideration of different tests but relate to the same people and the same assets. Neither the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 nor the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 takes priority over each other. If a court dealing with financial remedy proceedings makes a property adjustment order after the confiscation order has been made but before enforcement proceedings have concluded in relation to the confiscation order, there will have to be an adjustment order by the Crown Court of the relevant amount available.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Stodgell v Stodgell [2009] EWCA Civ 243</span> the Court of Appeal held that it was not appropriate to make a financial order that would have reduced the assets available to satisfy the confiscation order, but the facts were different as the amount of confiscation ordered exceeded the value of all the assets and the whole could have been pursued through bankruptcy. In this case there were found to be sufficient assets comprising a 50 per cent share of the London property and any balance from the former matrimonial home. The Scottish property was not considered as it was not necessary.</p>

Even if she was not served with notice, she is now out of time to appeal. However, in Enforcement proceedings, it would still be open to her to claim that she owns two thirds of the London property. Mr S said, and it was accepted, that Mrs AG has accepted that she would agree to the discharge of the full sum, even if it meant using part of the 50 per cent she claims. This however does not bind me, and the issue of ownership is live before me. Mrs AS would also have the right to make representations as to the ownership of the Scottish property by virtue of s 51(8) of POCA.</p>

There is an issue as to what happened to the Father&#8217;s share when he died. In principle, it would pass on intestacy. This is a matter of Scottish intestacy law. The mother was the executor. The Husband says that it would have passed to her. Ms Wood raises a question as to the limit of the amount which passes automatically to a Wife on intestacy. In the Crown Court, the Schedule showed a 50 per cent interest in the London property with an equity of &#163;420,000. Mr G says his counsel did not put forward his correction to the schedule and that it passed unchallenged. Mrs AS did not attend and did not make representations. Whatever happened, the findings of the Crown Court have not been appealed and are conclusive as far as they go. However, Mrs AG would be able to raise her interest in Enforcement proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the evidence before me, I have real doubts as to how it can be said that the Husband acquired a half share when it had previously been held as tenants in common. It is not sufficient to speculate as to Scottish inheritance law, and there is no will, or bequest. It is true that the parties to the marriage lived in the property as a home for a short time and that the husband thereafter kept the rental income. He says that he is now repaying his mother, and a sum of money was paid to her. The explanation is not self-evident. In my view it is as consistent with family members working together as a family as clear evidence of ownership. Whatever may be the result in Enforcement proceedings I cannot find that the Husband&#8217;s interest is more than 33.33 per cent, or &#163;336,982, now completely subsumed by the confiscation debt. Further, there can be no doubt that even if taken as a matrimonial asset as a result of the parties having cohabited there, it came entirely from the Husband&#8217;s family. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Sottish property was not considered in detail by the Crown Court. There is no doubt that the Husband was the legal owner until recently. He accepted that he did make some payments of the mortgage long ago before he moved to England, but he says that the reality is that he held it on behalf of his mother. I am inclined to the view that he did have a share in this property before he transferred it to his mother in August 2021. But there has been no application to set aside this transfer, and Mrs AG is not before me so I cannot make findings which are binding on her. I do not find that he is the beneficial owner of this property. However, I do consider that he is likely to receive further support from his mother in the future, and it may take the form of an interest in this property. If he held a half share it would be worth &#163;260,687. In any event it is plainly a non-matrimonial asset.</p>

However, I have no doubt that the Husband and his mother are working together. She did not provide her statement in time, though she blames misunderstanding. However, she could have been called to give evidence, by remote video if appropriate and the Husband did not seek to call her. She has offered to utilise part of her share in the London property to ensure the Confiscation Order is paid, and I have little doubt that she will continue to support her son.</p>

He would be giving up free accommodation with his mother, where he has stayed since the summer of 2021. There is a history of joint ownership of family property, and as I have indicated the history of the Scottish property leads me to consider that her support is likely to continue. </p>

Her health issues make obtaining employment more difficult, and this has to be balanced against the advantage of Universal Credit in paying the interest on the mortgage.

Despite what was said in the confiscation proceedings, I do not consider that the Husband has a half share in the London property, but only one third. In any event. Mrs AS has a realistic chance of establishing this in Enforcement proceedings. That she is willing to contribute to paying the Confiscation Order in any event shows family co-operation rather than the beneficial ownership. Secondly, in any event, the Confiscation Order has to be paid to avoid the prospect of the husband having to return to prison if the Confiscation Order not being met.  If I were to make the level of order the Wife seeks, there would be a risk of this unless Mrs AG contributed deeply from her unchallenged share. However critical I am of the Husband&#8217;s conduct, I do not think that it would be right to place him at this risk, and it would be giving the Family Court&#8217;s orders priority if I were to transfer his share in the London property to the Wife. I do not give POCA priority, but in the circumstances of this case, I recognise it and take it into account.</p>

This point was not fully argued before me, so I indicate that I am inclined to direct that the Husband&#8217;s pension should be shared so as to give the Wife two thirds and the Husband one third. This will give her the opportunity to take a lump sum to discharge the mortgage and some security for her retirement. I expect the Husband to have support from his own mother. I would not take into account her own small pension. I do not have the exact figure that I would have from a pension report, but I do not think that adjourning to obtain a report from a pension expert to undertake a more accurate calculation would be justified. I will however hear argument on this point.</p>
