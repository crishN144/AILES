The children&#8217;s mother is aged 44 years; she is represented by Ms Osborne of Counsel instructed by Family Law Group. The father is aged 53 years; he is represented by Ms Cantor-Freedman of Counsel instructed via the public access scheme. Both parents share parental responsibility for the children.

That application was accompanied by a Form C1A (allegations of harm and domestic violence) of the same date.

By Form C100 dated 13 October 2022, the father made a cross-application for a child arrangements order and an urgent prohibited steps order preventing the removal of the children to Spain.

That hearing was originally listed to take place before me in August 2023 but was ineffective. The matter eventually appeared before me for a finding of fact hearing over four days commencing Tuesday, 21 November 2023, that first day being set aside for reading and the consideration of the audio recordings.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I wish to preface this judgment by summarising the issues to be determined. First, I am concerned only with the allegations of the mother against the father, which allegations fall almost exclusively into the category of coercive and/or controlling behaviour. The mother has (in her written evidence) referred to an incident of alleged smacking of the children by the father but she accepts that is not an allegation which is pursued and that the court must, therefore, proceed on the basis that the father has not physically abused the children. Indeed, as the mother has confirmed, there is no suggestion that the father poses a risk of physical harm to the children. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Second, I am not tasked with determining such cross-allegations as are made against the mother by the father in his written statements. Indeed, I note that those allegations were formally withdrawn at the pre-trial review before District Judge Bridson on 25 July 2023, with the caveat that there remain safeguarding issues which the father wishes to pursue at such time as the court turns to the determination of the children&#8217;s welfare.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">That brings me to my third point: I am not today making any decisions concerning the children&#8217;s welfare. That being said, I note at this stage with regret the delay experienced in these proceedings to date, not least because &#8211; having heard their oral evidence over three days &#8211; I have no doubt that both parents love the boys passionately. In considering the mother&#8217;s allegations, I have also had cause to consider various reports from professionals in which the children have reported missing their father. The father in particular has expressed his frustration with the slow pace of these proceedings.</span></p>

While the exact chronology is somewhat woolly, it is common ground that the parents discussed separation on 12 or 13 September 2022 and that the father initially left the family home to stay with his mother. He returned to the property a few days later. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the atmosphere in the home appears to have become very tense very quickly, a situation exacerbated by a number of interactions with professionals. On 20 September, the mother&#8217;s sister contacted the police to report her concern that the father was being &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">controlling</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;. This was then followed by another complaint on 28 September, this time by a friend, making further allegations that the mother was the subject of controlling behaviour.

Those applications were heard the same day, when the court made a without-notice order prohibiting the father from removing the children from the care of the mother. A specific issue order was also made for the father to return the children to the mother&#8217;s care upon service of the order. Cafcass were directed to undertake safeguarding checks and the matter was timetabled through to a first hearing dispute resolution appointment. In addition, the court made a non-molestation order against the father to last for a term of twelve months, which order included a zonal provision not to enter a specified parish or go within 100 metres of any property where he knows or believes the mother to be living.</span></p>

That latter application was accompanied by a Form C1A in which he made a series of allegations against the mother, including that she had caused emotional and psychological harm to the children. In support of his application, the father had provided a 29-page statement along with a link to a large number of electronic files; by order of 17 October 2022, he was directed to provide the same in paper format.</span></p>

While making what allowances I am able for his status as a self-representing litigant, I remain of the view that his preparation of evidence during the course of the proceedings to date has bordered on the obsessive. When I first heard the matter back in October 2022, I was faced with a densely typed 29-page statement and a collection of some 232 pages of exhibits. As I have said, permission was refused to rely on the same but I made clear that I was not making a criticism at that time, urging the father to provide a more focused and concise fifteen-page statement that would assist the court. What followed was his statement dated 11 November 2022, which (he says) totals just fifteen pages. While that is true, the font is miniscule, densely packed, with minimal spacing and ribbon-thin borders; it contains some 13,000 words and, when transplanted to size 12-point font, 1.15 spacing, spans some 28 pages. It is, in short, a dissertation.</span></p>

In addition to his statements dated 19 September 2023 (five pages), 31 October 2023 (fifteen pages plus exhibits) and 9 November 2023 (five pages), his written evidence totals some 74 pages of narrative statement. In many places, his lengthier statements simply copy and paste swathes of earlier statements such that I have read the same evidence at least twice.

Understanding the scope and ambit of the behaviour however, requires a recognition that &#8216;coercion&#8217; will usually involve a pattern of acts encompassing, for example, assault, intimidation, humiliation and threats. &#8216;Controlling behaviour&#8217; really involves a range of acts designed to render an individual subordinate and to corrode their sense of personal autonomy. Key to both behaviours is an appreciation of a &#8216;pattern&#8217; or &#8216;a series of acts&#8217;, the impact of which must be assessed cumulatively and rarely in isolation.

It is an impression that I have also formed over the course of this hearing. The main example concerns the father&#8217;s anxiety around the Russian invasion of Ukraine and his involvement with an organisation known as the North Atlantic Fellas Organisation (&#8220;NAFO&#8221;), with whom it appears to be common ground the father worked to combat online Russian propaganda. He describes this as a group &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">using humour to fight misinformation on Twitter</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;. Both parties recall an occasion when the father spoke to the mother at 03:00 in the morning and informed her that the power plant at Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine had been shelled. That this discussion took place and at around that time in the morning is not disputed; the father explains that he &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">followed this story one evening and expressed concern to [the mother], I know individuals throughout Europe shared my concern over this and broader Russian nuclear threats</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;.

Whether or not he awoke the mother deliberately (as she alleges) or she was already awake because she is a light sleeper, the parents were by then sleeping in separate rooms and it seems to me obvious that he made the decision to inform her &#8211; at 03:00 &#8211; that Russia had attacked a nuclear power station in Ukraine.

In that vein, I place this action in the context of his e-mail sent on 27 September 2022, in which he announced his discovery that the mother had obtained housing on a particular road. On a balance of probability, there is a clear pattern of behaviour perpetrated in the weeks following separation in which the father made clear to the mother that he knew what support she had sought and where she was going.
