	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On 15 February 2019 I made interim care orders in respect of four children, one of whom is Q now aged sixteen. Q will be seventeen years old in a relatively short period of time.  The background to the care proceedings is largely irrelevant given that this judgment concerns itself with an issue of jurisdiction, namely whether an interim care order can subsist after the subject child reaches their seventeenth birthday.  It will be obvious from the above that this issue arises with respect to Q and that it must be resolved before she reaches her seventeenth birthday. </p>

A child may require accommodation if there is no person who has parental responsibility for them; if that child is lost or abandoned; or if the person caring for a child is being prevented (whether or not permanently and for whatever reason) from providing the child with suitable accommodation or care [section 20(1)]. Local authorities are obliged to provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who has reached the age of sixteen and whose welfare the authority consider is likely to be seriously prejudiced if they do not provide him with accommodation [section 20(3)]. Young persons aged sixteen to twenty-one may be provided with accommodation in a community home for those aged over sixteen if the local authority considers that to do so would safeguard or promote their welfare [section 20(5)]. </p>

Public law proceedings could only continue whilst there was a jurisdiction to make the final order being sought by the applicant local authority.

In 1985 four Working Papers were published for consultation. A largely positive response to the Working Papers together with the Government&#8217;s own review of public law children proceedings resulted in the Law Commission&#8217;s 1988 Report on Family Law: Review of Child Law, Guardianship and Custody. That report gives some insight into the thinking behind the age-related provisions in what was eventually to become the Children Act. Paragraph 3:25 reads as follows: </p>

The courts&#8217; present powers to make custody and access orders endure until the child reaches 18, although the court will rarely, if ever, make a custody order which is contrary to the</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">wishes of a child who has reached 16. Any other approach is scarcely practicable, given that this is the age at which children may leave school and seek full-time employment and become entitled to certain benefits or allowances</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">in their own right. However, the matter goes beyond the question of what is practicable. There are powers of direct enforcement of custody orders which operate upon the child rather than the adults involved. The older the child becomes, the less just it is even to attempt to enforce against him an order to which he has never been a party. As we explain below, it is usually thought unnecessary to accord party status to children in family disputes and in general we would not disagree. We recommend, therefore, that orders relating to the child&#8217;s residence</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">contact or other specific matters of upbringing should not be made in respect of a child who has reached 16 unless there are exceptional circumstances and that orders made before that age should expire then unless in exceptional circumstances the court orders otherwise. There may be exceptional cases in which it is necessary to protect an older child from the consequences of immaturity but these will be rare and the court will no doubt always wish to make the child a party before doing so.&#8221; </span></heading>

A child assessment order may be made with respect to a child, that is a young person under the age of 18, but if the child is of sufficient understanding s/he may refuse to submit to a medical or psychiatric or other assessment [section 43(7)]. In practice, the latter provision means that such an order is unlikely to be made with respect to an older child who is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Gillick competent&#8221;</span>. Emergency protection orders can be made with respect to a child who is aged seventeen (or sixteen if married) but are strictly boundaried by the effect of section 45(4)(b) which does not permit an application for their extension by a local authority where a local authority is not <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;entitled to apply for a care order with</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">respect to</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">a child&#8221;</span>. Additionally, a child of sufficient understanding may refuse to submit to any direction for medical or psychiatric examination contained within an emergency protection order [section 44(6) and 44(7)]. These emergency provisions, though applicable to those over the age of 17 (or sixteen if married) are, in practice, boundaried by the ability of the Gillick competent child to refuse to submit to assessment and by their limited duration (without the possibility of extension, in the case of an emergency protection order, if the local authority is not entitled to apply for a care order).  </p>

The following matters seem to me to be highly pertinent to that exercise. First, a child is defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> as any person under the age of eighteen yet Parliament specifically chose to curtail the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to make final and substantive public law orders in respect of children who had reached the age of 17. Insofar as an exception applies to the jurisdiction to make public law orders, it is a downward revision of the age limit to sixteen years in the case of a child who is married. Second, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> consistently emphasises the age of sixteen in recognition of a child&#8217;s developing autonomy hence (a) the provision that section 8 orders may only be made in exceptional circumstances if a child is aged 16 and (b) the provisions of section 20 which provide for a child aged 16 to consent to accommodation even if a holder of parental responsibility objects. The downward revision of the age at which substantive public law order can be made reflects the fact that, in marrying, a child has taken a step to establish their own family separate from the care and control of a parent. Third, whilst the ability of a parent, local authority or court to impose arrangements under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> on an unwilling child diminishes as the child approaches adulthood, it is important to bear in mind that, in the case of a sixteen or seventeen year old who lacks capacity, they are capable of being subject to powers exercised by the court under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> [<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2(5)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>].     </p>

Those amendments were intended to reduce the administrative burden on courts and local authorities of having to renew interim orders on a periodic basis. That this was the intention behind those legislative changes is clear from perusal of the Family Justice Review completed by Sir David Norgrove in 2011. The amendments to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38</ref> appear to have been tied to the twentysixweek limit within which care proceedings should ordinarily be completed. The Review recommended that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;judges should be allowed discretion to grant interim orders for the time they see fit subject to a maximum of six months and not beyond the time limit for the case. The</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">courts&#8217; power to renew should be tied to their power to extend proceedings beyond the time limit&#8221;</span> [Executive Summary, paragraph 77].

He did not hear full argument on this issue and was concerned with an application for a secure accommodation order where no specific age limit applies as <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> simply refers to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a child&#8221;</span>. Furthermore, as Mr Barnes submitted, the reasoning of Williams J would suggest that there was no specific provision for an interim order to cease to have effect on a child&#8217;s eighteenth birthday. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/38/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 38(4)</ref> as originally drafted conferred no power on a court to retain a child under an interim care order until one day short of their eighteenth birthday. I accept Mr Barnes&#8217; submission that, where <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38</ref> (as amended) contains no explicit power to continue an interim care order beyond a child&#8217;s seventeenth birthday, I must be cautious about interpreting the provision to extend the intrusive powers of local authorities and of the court. Such an extension would come into clear conflict with the overall scheme in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. Further, there is force in Mr Woodward-Carlton&#8217;s submission that a child of seventeen would be impermissibly placed in care by the extension of interim orders in circumstances where only the threshold pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/38/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(2)</ref> had been established.  Having considered matters carefully, I have decided that it would be wrong to interpret the amended <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/38/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(4)</ref> as having substantially extended the court&#8217;s jurisdiction without (a) that being explicitly recognised either in the Explanatory Notes to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> or in the contents of the Family Justice Review and (b) when the stated intention of the amendments was that of reducing the administrative requirements of public law proceedings. To do otherwise would (a) represent a substantial interference with the Article 8 rights of the subject child to a private and family life and (b) undermine the carefully calibrated age thresholds in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.   </p>

That was a recognition of the growing autonomy of the individual child. Likewise, the ability of a final care order to persist until the age of eighteen is a recognition of the obligations placed on a local authority, once parenting has been established to fall below the reasonable standard expected, to ensure a child is not left without appropriate care before becoming an adult. Those matters support my analysis of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/38/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(4)</ref> as amended.    </p>

To be clear, interim care and supervision orders made for a period during which the child turns either seventeen or gets married (if aged sixteen) are impermissible. If, prior to the 2014 amendments, interim public law orders were being made which extended beyond the child&#8217;s seventeenth birthday, they should not have been given (a) the absence of an explicit power to continue such orders beyond a child&#8217;s seventeenth birthday and (b) the age thresholds set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.

Mr Woodward-Carlton submitted that an interim care order which continued beyond a child&#8217;s seventeenth birthday led nowhere.

Where those remedies are not available, the continuation of the proceedings appears, at first glance, illogical. By analogy, the court cannot maintain public law proceedings in circumstances where it has been established that the threshold criteria cannot be satisfied as, even on an interim basis or in wardship, no continuing reasonable belief could be maintained that, if the court&#8217;s jurisdiction were not exercised, a child was likely to suffer significant harm [see the analysis of Munby P (as he then was) in paragraphs 120-126 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">(Children) (No 3)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/3651" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 3651 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 3651 (Fam)</ref>].    </p>

I remind myself that no court seised of public law proceedings is required to make either interim or final public law orders. It may decide that a section 8 order or indeed no order is an appropriate disposal at either an interim or final stage. Whilst no interim or final public law order would, on my analysis of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/38/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(4)</ref>, be available in respect of a seventeen year old child (or sixteen if married), I am not persuaded that these welfare-driven proceedings themselves would necessarily lack purpose and must fall away once the jurisdiction to make either interim or final public law orders is lost. In some cases, it may be crucial to establish whether the threshold criteria have been met because this might determine the basis for future decision making by a local authority, for example, as to the type of support available to the child or family concerned. Whether that exercise is necessary and proportionate will be a matter for the good sense of the judge managing/determining the proceedings. For example, it might not be where a child of seventeen wishes to be accommodated against the wishes of those with parental responsibility. Additionally, although final public law orders would not be available to the court, the court might conclude the proceedings before the child is eighteen by making other orders available to it such as a section 8 order (assuming exceptional circumstances applied) or by making orders under the inherent jurisdiction. Whilst the latter could not operate to require a child to be placed in either the care or supervision of a local authority or to require a child to be accommodated by a local authority, other orders under the inherent jurisdiction may be entirely suitable in the circumstances of the individual case. I conclude that, when the jurisdiction to make interim and final public law orders is no longer available, careful scrutiny of the circumstances of each case is required by the court in order to discern whether the proceedings themselves lack merit and whether it is proportionate and in the child&#8217;s welfare interests for them to continue. Discontinuance of the proceedings is likely to be the proportionate, welfare-driven outcome in many such cases and, if that is so, the local authority should be permitted to withdraw its application. There will, however, be some cases where a useful forensic and welfare-driven purpose might be served by the continuation of public law proceedings albeit without the structure provided by interim public law orders.</p>
