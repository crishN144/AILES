They were divorced in 2010 on the mother&#8217;s petition alleging unreasonable behaviour by the father. They have two children: M, a girl, born in April 1997, and J, a boy, born in January 1999.</p>

The father, as he confirmed to me, was represented on that occasion by counsel. There is no need for me to go into the details except to note that paragraph I of the order made provision for payment by the father of the children&#8217;s school fees. That part of the order was subsequently modified, as to the mechanism rather than the substance, by a Deed of Agreement executed by the mother and the father on 12 July 2010.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The litigation in relation to the children culminated in an order made by Hogg J on 22 March 2013 in which she dismissed the father&#8217;s application for contact with M (the order reciting that M &#8220;does not currently want to have any contact&#8221; with him) and dismissed his application for a residence order in relation to J (the order reciting &#8220;the court recognising the wishes of J&#8221;). The order also contained an order against the father under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. The order further recited that the father&#8217;s two applications were &#8220;totally without merit&#8221;. At the same time Hogg J granted the mother a non-molestation order and other injunctions against the father. There is a transcript of the judgment given on that occasion by Hogg J which I have read. I have also read the transcript of the proceedings before Hogg J on 20 March 2013. For present purposes what is important is that the father (transcript page 19) accused the mother of having committed adultery, which she denied. </p>

In fact the father brought matters back to court almost immediately, there being a hearing before Hogg J on 20 December 2013. This phase of the litigation culminated in an order made by Hogg J on 16 April 2014, the central provisions of which were as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father returned to the fray, making further applications on 1 July 2014. Those applications were supported by a witness statement dated 1 July 2014 in which the father, expressing himself in language which was extremely crude, vulgar and defamatory, made the most outrageous and fatuous allegations about both Hogg J and Baker J (who had dealt with the litigation at one stage). Anyone who may hereafter have occasion to consider any application by the father should read that statement. The applications came before Hogg J on 22 July 2014. There is a transcript of the hearing, which I have read. In the light of what he has more recently said to me, it is important to note what the father was saying to Hogg J at the end of his submissions:</p>

In April 2009 &#8230; Mrs K begged me, begged me with tears running down her eyes, begged me to stay in the marriage &#8230; And what was going on in the background? From January, you see it from the legal fees being paid, January to June she was plotting with &#8230; the divorce from hell.&#8221;</p>

The mother responded with an application issued on 6 March 2015 seeking the father&#8217;s committal to prison for various breaches of the injunctive order made by Hogg J on 22 March 2013. That application was supported by an affidavit the mother swore on 6 March 2015. </p>

The mother had filed a witness statement dated 2 March 2015 in response to the father&#8217;s applications.

So far as I can see there is not a proper particularisation of the alleged contempt and there may be, for all I know, evidence which he would wish to rely upon, but you cannot start committal proceedings simply by saying, &#8220;I am going to rely upon all the evidence in the case&#8221;.

He has set it out very clearly in his skeleton argument and set it out again very clearly now. He says that the applications which you are making to me today are indistinguishable from the applications you made to Mrs Justice Hogg last July. He has taken me to the key passages in the transcript of the proceedings before Mrs Justice Hogg which show that you explicitly raised in front of her, for example, the question of school fees; and he has taken us to the order in which she dismissed all your applications.&#8221;</p>

Therefore you are stuck with, and I am stuck with, Mrs Justice Hogg&#8217;s order of July last year. He says that is the end of your applications unless you can point to some new development which has taken place since July of last year &#8230; Is there some new development?  Has there been some change &#8230; since July 2014? &#8230; What is it?&#8221;</p>

For the father to seek to re-open matters already concluded against him he must show that something has changed since the last hearing before Hogg J in July 2014, show that there is fresh evidence available to him now that was not available to be put before Hogg J and which puts a different complexion on matters. That, in my judgment, the father has signally failed to do.</p>

The father said that this supported his case that the mother had subjected him to &#8220;blackmail&#8221; and &#8220;duress&#8221; in relation to the order made by District Judge Gordon-Saker on 25 February 2010. Leaving on one side the fact that these emails are not, strictly speaking, evidence against the mother, and the fact that it never seems to have occurred to the father that, judging by their tone and contents, they may have been designed and sent as a false admission intended simply to infuriate and insult him,<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

Where does it take him? He has disavowed proceeding against the mother for perjury. How does it establish a case of &#8220;blackmail&#8221; or &#8220;duress&#8221;?

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;THE PRESIDENT: &#8230; There are many people in many different parts of society who, for various reasons &#8211; they may be cultural, they may be religious, they may be social &#8211; still treat adultery as a very serious matter and do not want to be seen, to be understood by their friends, to be guilty of adultery. I entirely understand that. That is still a very powerful feeling amongst many people in our society. My point is a rather different one. Whatever the views outside these walls, adultery, whether  admitted or proved, does not actually at the end of the day, unless it is very, very unusual or very, very extreme, have any impact upon either what the court does in relation to non-molestation injunctions, or in relation to children or in relation to the money. </p>

It&#8217;s immaterial. It&#8217;s just a non-issue. It is the determination to hide that adultery, for the world not to see and to create a completely different reason for divorce. That is what I am saying. Adultery is not an issue here. It is the desire to create a different history. &#8220;[He] was this type of guy. [He] was that type of guy. That is why I am coming to court for a non-molestation&#8221; &#8211; to use the children and so on. That is what it is all about. The adultery is the beginning of it &#8230; That was the magnetic bit about the desire to hide it and the desire to use the children with the new story, the new [father]&#8221;.</p>
