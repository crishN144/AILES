It seeks to support them so far as is possible and practicable and in the best interests of the person concerned, and it does so in a variety of ways. However, it is not the function of the court to anticipate, ring-fence or maximise any potential inheritance for the benefit of family members on the death of a protected party, because this is not the purpose for which the compensation for personal injury was intended. The position would be different, of course, if the individual concerned had substantial funds surplus to his requirements that were derived from another source, such as an inheritance or a lottery win.&#8221;</span></p>
