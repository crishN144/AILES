	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">I gave a ruling at the start of this hearing to allow into evidence statements from the intervenors and their accountant, and that ruling is to be considered alongside this judgment. The cross examination of the respondent proceeded on the basis that &#163;178,000 of money had disappeared from the parties&#8217; joint account and been spent on Property 5, and so I allowed into evidence, after he had been through the witness box, a bank statement produced by him showing where that money went which, I might add, was a statement from a joint account held by the applicant and respondent which the applicant had referred to in her Form E.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">I have received written submissions from all parties. The applicant now appears to recognise that her argument for a constructive trust whereby she and the respondent each hold 50% of the beneficial interest in Property 5 may not succeed, and so she invites a quantification of her interest under the constructive trust. Somewhat surprisingly, it is also now submitted for the first time that, in the alternative, a resulting trust has been established. The court therefore finds itself in the position of having to grapple with a case which is something of a moveable feast.</p>

In addition, they say that the applicant should not be permitted to depart from the case which she had set out prior to the hearing. To do so, they say, would be unfair.</p>

Each case will turn on its own facts. Many more factors than financial contributions may be relevant to divining the parties' true intentions. These include: any advice or discussions at the time of the transfer which cast light upon their intentions then; the reasons why the home was acquired in their joint names; the reasons why (if it be the case) the survivor was authorised to give a receipt for the capital moneys; the purpose for which the home was acquired; the nature of the parties' relationship; whether they had children for whom they both had responsibility to provide a home; how the purchase was financed, both initially and subsequently; how the parties arranged their finances, whether separately or together or a bit of both; how they discharged the outgoings on the property and their other household expenses. When a couple are joint owners of the home and jointly liable for the mortgage, the inferences to be drawn from who pays for what may be very different from the inferences to be drawn when only one is owner of the home. The arithmetical calculation of how much was paid by each is also likely to be less important. It will be easier to draw the inference that they intended that each should contribute as much to the household as they reasonably could and that they would share the eventual benefit or burden equally. The parties' individual characters and personalities may also be a factor in deciding where their true intentions lay. In the cohabitation context, mercenary considerations may be more to the fore than they would be in marriage, but it should not be assumed that they always take pride of place over natural love and affection. At the end of the day, having taken all this into account, cases in which the joint legal owners are to be taken to have intended that their beneficial interests should be different from their legal interests will be very unusual.&#8221;</span></p>

Although it is submitted that she would never have agreed to move to Property 5 if it was not to be her forever home, it was of course the respondent&#8217;s work which had led to them living in properties while they were being developed on three previous occasions, and so I do not accept the applicant&#8217;s evidence in that respect.

I find that, on balance, she was truthful with her creditors in 2019 when she said that she had no assets other than her car. It is obvious that the IVA nominee would have been interested in all of the applicant&#8217;s assets, whether in her name or not. Her creditors would otherwise have been misled. By the time of the IVA, the development of Property 5 was complete and she was asserting no interest in it, and the proceeds of sale of Property 4 were gone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.01in">So, returning to the conundrum which I set out earlier, and although the respondent relies on <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin</span> to make good the point that the applicant&#8217;s evidence was unreliable, in my judgment it is more than that. Although it is right that the applicant did not know precisely what the arrangements were, she had sufficient knowledge to know that the case which she has advanced in these proceedings was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> what they were. In that sense, she has, in my judgment, been dishonest in pursuing her claims. She told her creditors the true position. She has minimised the involvement of the intervenors despite overwhelming evidence, in order to claim a 50% share in their property now worth (on her figures, which I understand are not agreed) up to &#163;1.25 million which she occupied, for the most part rent free, for years. That must feel like a real slap in the face for the intervenors in particular. In my judgment, there was never a common intention that she would have an interest in that property, she did not even think she had an interest, let alone rely on the idea that she did, and she has suffered no detriment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.01in">Given the conclusions I have reached on the evidence, I do not need to determine whether the applicant should be prevented from pursuing a resulting trust claim at the eleventh hour. The claims fail whichever way I analyse them, and I dismiss them. However, the nebulous way in which the applicant has pursued her case does underline the need for proper pleading in similar sorts of cases, given the principles in <span style="font-style:italic">TL v ML</span>, the parties&#8217; duties under Rule 1.4 of the Family Procedure Rules to assist the court to further the overriding objective in Rule 1.1, and the expectation of fairness which rightly arises from Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In my view, it is incumbent on parties involved in this type of claim to raise with the court, at the case management stage, the need for directions to be given of the sort contemplated in <span style="font-style:italic">TL v ML</span>.</p>

That is essentially the argument in favour of publication of the parties&#8217; names advanced on behalf of the intervenors. It is suggested that the case needs to be reported to highlight the need for a party in a similar position to the applicant to set out their case, and the court is invited to draw analogies from <span style="font-style:italic">Uddin v Uddin</span> [2022] EWFC 75.</p>

Publication of the details of this case in a way which identifies them is liable, in my judgment, to impact their right to respect for their private and family lives. Although the applicant and respondent both live and work locally, I am not on balance convinced by the submission, however, that their financial futures would be likely to be adversely affected if the judgment is published, at least to a greater extent than cases heard in open court would. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.01in">However, I do have greater concern for the Article 8 rights of the children. They are 11 and 9 years old respectively. They have a significant and important part of their minorities ahead of them. I see it as their parents&#8217; job to shield them from any parental acrimony to the extent practicable, and naming the parties is therefore counterintuitive. As it is, the argument was whether their grandparents own the property which they might see as home, and my findings are that neither of their parents has an interest in Property 5. Publication of the judgment will be unlikely to assist them, and the detrimental impact of publication is difficult to predict in circumstances in which the family, at present, has little or no public profile.</p>

However, this is a decision at Family Court level which has attracted no outside interest as far as I am aware. So, when the Article 8 and 10 rights are considered together, in my judgment the proportionate approach is to place greater weight on the parties&#8217; rights, and for the court to anonymise the names of the parties, the children and the addresses referred to, in order to protect the children in particular, and the risk of jigsaw identification of them. That would still permit publication of the judgment, so that the principles of open justice can, to a great extent, be honoured, and my view that cases of this sort should be clearly pleaded underlined.</p>
