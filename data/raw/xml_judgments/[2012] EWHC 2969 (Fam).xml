She suffers from asthma, which has since her removal from her parents been well controlled by common basic inhaled steroid medication (Seretide) and occasional use of an inhaled bronchodilator (Salbutomol).  Her asthma does not currently impinge on her daily life to any significant extent, although she had one hospital admission for two days in March 2012 for exacerbation of asthma following an infection.  She does not suffer from any other life-limiting conditions.  Her regular clinical reviews are all clear.  Her attendance at school has been excellent and her participation has been full, in the physical and social aspects of school life as well academically.  She is currently a well child physically, and there are soundly-based professional hopes that her current medication can progressively be reduced.   Asked how she was in July 2012 by the jointly-instructed medical expert Dr H, J said she was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;much better now&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.</span></p>

Her asthma was uncontrolled, despite receiving the most extreme treatments available.  She was on intensive treatment to combat reported nocturnal desaturations (reduction in blood-oxygen levels).  She had also suffered a number of reported Apparent Life-Threatening Events (ALTEs) while in the care of her parents.</span></p>

This is not surprising, because since she was under a year old she had been under continuous medical care and her condition had baffled and defeated the efforts of the country&#8217;s leading specialists, despite every conceivable strategy to control her asthma and to diagnose the cause of desaturations and ALTEs.  None of the three specialists who gave evidence had encountered a child who has had more varied or intensive treatment.</span></p>

I rely on the evidence of the 999 calls and my assessment of the parents&#8217; reliability as reporters, as to which see below.  I also note that J remained in hospital for three months after the April 2010 event and that during this time, she had five episodes of desaturation associated with coughing, each responding rapidly to oxygen and bronchodilators.  On no occasion did she require resuscitation.  Furthermore, it is notable that J has suffered no ALTEs and few recorded desaturations in the past year.  Although this cannot be conclusive in itself, it fortunately points towards the probable absence of an undetected underlying condition that causes respiratory arrests in J. </span></p>

Their evidence about asthma treatment has evolved in response to the case as it has developed.  The concession that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;only one puff&#8217; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">of Seretide was being given was made on the opening day of the hearing.  Their evidence about J&#8217;s supposed ALTEs is, I find, exaggerated and unreliable in its detail.   They have both given unreliable descriptions of J&#8217;s condition to the school and to the emergency services.</span></p>

This was not </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;being overprotective&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> or </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;wrapping J in cotton wool&#8217;, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">as they put it</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">: </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">they were inflicting experiences upon her that were cruel because they were unnecessary.</span></p>

It likely that she is benefiting from being in an environment where she is treated as an ordinary child.</span></p>

This is not altogether unnatural, particularly where M is a nurse, but it has had the most serious consequences.  They have used the NHS to the fullest extent, but have not shown a genuinely co-operative and trusting approach towards outsiders, whether in the medical services, or in the school, and it is not surprising that they kept outreach teams at arms&#8217; length.</span></p>

In J&#8217;s case, there is a likelihood (in the sense of a risk that cannot sensibly be ignored) that, if returned to her parents, she might resume the role of being a sick child.  That risk must now be assessed alongside other welfare factors.  The parents will need to demonstrate a significant and dependable change in their approach.</span></p>

Paediatricians are conditioned to trust parents, particularly where a child has a genuine medical condition.  That instinct was strong in this case, despite indications that it needed to be examined.  Dr C had concerns about the reliability of these parents as long ago as 2008 but, having taken advice from her child protection lead, she did not pursue her doubts, a decision she regrets.  The doctors will form their own conclusions, but those may include the following: </span></p>
