	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Shortly before marrying, they entered a Pre-Nuptial Agreement in October 1997.  It is essentially a separation of property agreement.  It prevents either party from making claims against the other in the event of divorce.  Both were represented by separate solicitors but it seems pretty clear that the process leading up to the signing of the Agreement was, at best, limited.  </p>

Part of the title is held in the name of the Wife and part in trust. The property was purchased during the marriage in a dilapidated condition and has been restored to make a magnificent home and park.  The Wife financed the entire development.  The Husband&#8217;s elderly mother occupied a property on the estate.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although neither party undertook any remunerated employment during the marriage, I am satisfied that both made a significant contribution to the marriage in their respective roles as Wife/Mother and Husband/Father.  There has been a somewhat unedifying dispute as to exactly how much work the Husband undertook in relation to the development of the grounds at the Z Estate.  I propose to make no findings as to this, as it is irrelevant to the issues I have to determine.  There is, however, no doubt, that the Wife made a completely unmatched and very large financial contribution to the marriage by way of her inheritance.  There is also no doubt that the spouses kept their finances almost entirely apart.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Very regrettably, the marriage broke down in the early part of 2014.  It is absolutely clear that the Husband took the breakdown of the marriage very badly.  Initially, he moved into a house on the estate close to the main house.  In June 2014, he moved to rented accommodation off the estate. He found this move very difficult indeed.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Following the separation, the parties instructed extremely experienced expert family lawyers.  Both will therefore have had tip-top advice.  Having said that, the negotiations proceeded pretty informally.  Each party appointed an old family friend, effectively as an &#8220;honest broker&#8221; to assist in reaching agreement.  The negotiations were successful.  An agreement was reached and financial disclosure provided.  It seems clear that the Pre-Nuptial Agreement did not figure significantly in the negotiations although the Wife&#8217;s solicitor did send a copy to the Husband&#8217;s solicitor.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The initial proposal from the Wife appears to have been to pay to the Husband &#163;20 million in full and final satisfaction of his claims.  This was eventually reduced to &#163;17.34 million.  I understand this reduction was primarily related to the tax consequences of extracting the money from the Wife&#8217;s trusts, namely &#163;10,404,000.  The Husband&#8217;s own resources of just over &#163;2 million may have been another factor.  </p>

She disclosed other assets and liabilities that meant that her own resources, including her estate, were some &#163;27.2 million net of liabilities.  In addition, she disclosed trust assets with a gross value of &#163;413 million.  This reduced to &#163;242 million net of tax. Her income was in the order of &#163;1.8 million gross from trusts and personal assets.  </p>

The Husband was to retain these assets, meaning that his assets would be around &#163;19.5 million after payment of the lump sum of &#163;17.34 million.</p>

The first tranche was to be paid within 14 days.  The second tranche would be paid within 14 days of the Husband&#8217;s mother vacating the cottage on the estate that she was occupying.</p>

On 1st December 2014, the Husband transferred &#163;1,659,100 to solicitors for the purchase of a property for his mother. Completion took place in late January 2015 and the Husband&#8217;s mother has since vacated the Z Estate and moved to the property.  The second tranche has not been paid, initially by agreement and later as a result of a stay I imposed on 23rd April 2015.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">22 days after the making of the order, the Husband committed suicide.  His funeral took place in early January 2015.  His will was disclosed to the Wife on 13th January 2015.  It was a new will made in September 2014 and therefore after the breakdown of the marriage.  The elephant in the room, which has not been mentioned by anyone during the course of the case, was that it did not leave his assets to the three children, other than his personal chattels.  In fact, the entire estate was left to his three adult brothers, J A, K A and L A.  I recognise that he may have felt that the children already had more than sufficient and did not want them coming in to large sums from him on their majority.  I am pretty sure, however, that it is the change in the will that has led to this litigation.</p>

It accepts that the death of the Husband was not actually foreseen by the Wife but it argues that it was not unforeseeable.  It goes on to argue that the order was not an order to meet the Husband&#8217;s needs and that, in essence, he had a sharing claim against the Wife&#8217;s resources in general and the matrimonial home in particular.  It is argued that the latter was central to the marriage.  He had earned his share.  In any event, the court should exercise its discretion to uphold the order.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The response of the Appellant is simple.  She argues that the death of the Husband was definitely not foreseeable.  She says that his mental health was investigated in great detail by a number of top professionals in the period after the separation and he was, in due course, given a clean bill of health.  She says that she would certainly not have agreed to pay him such a large sum of money if she had any inkling of what he intended to do.  She says that, in any event, the award was most certainly a &#8220;needs based&#8221; award and sharing played absolutely no part in the negotiations or the computation of the award.  She relies on the Pre-Nuptial Agreement in this regard.  In short, she says that, had the court known the full facts when it made the order, it would have had to proceed on the basis that the Husband&#8217;s needs were for the next twenty two days only, namely the period until he died and that no award would have been made in such circumstances.  </p>

In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Barber</span>, the Wife suffered from severe liver disease.  The evidence was to the effect that there was a &#8220;reasonable hope&#8221; that she would live for at least five years.  In fact, she died within three months.  In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Reid</span>, the wife was aged 74 and had disclosed that she was registered blind, had high blood pressure, high cholesterol and was diabetic.  She died two months after the date of the order.  In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Barber</span>, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part and held that the it was appropriate to consider what order would have been made had the judge known that she only had three months to live.  In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Reid</span>, Wilson J held that the wife&#8217;s death was not reasonably foreseeable.  Notwithstanding the possibility of death at any time, there was no material which should have placed the wife&#8217;s death two months later into the minds of the parties as being a significant, ie more than a theoretical, possibility.</p>

In the first type of case, the court decided that, if the award was based on sharing such that the deceased was entitled to receipt of his or her share of the matrimonial assets, there would be no justification for returning those assets to the other spouse notwithstanding the change in circumstances.  The cases where there was part return of the money were those where the appellant&#8217;s needs required him or her to receive some of the deceased&#8217;s share of the assets.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is entirely right that the Husband was in a bad way following the breakdown of the marriage.  Indeed, he very briefly checked himself into hospital in June 2014 but stayed only a few hours before discharging himself.  Moreover, in early August 2014, the eldest child disclosed concerns about her contact with her father.  She was not, in fact, making allegations of sexual abuse against him but was, it appears, uncomfortable in his presence.  It seems likely that he was somewhat insensitive to her needs but no more.  He was, however, arrested by the Police in early August 2014 and kept in the cells overnight.  No action was, however, subsequently taken.  Undoubtedly, this distressed him immensely. </p>

Whilst it is clear that, initially, the doctor felt that the Husband might present as a suicide risk, the reports became ever more positive.  On 26th August 2014, he wrote that the Husband had never expressed an active intention to harm himself but this was in part due to his valued role as a father.  The doctor was concerned that this level of risk could increase if his role as a father was jeopardised but he noted that the Husband was not taking antidepressants and denied suicidal thoughts. The doctor was clear that the Husband did not present a risk to others and was not describing any aggressive intent to harm himself or others.  By 29th August 2014, the Husband was described as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">calm, coherent and logical</span>&#8221;.

The youngest child had been supposed to stay the night but did not want to at that point.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">So what is my conclusion?  It is accepted that the Wife did not foresee the Husband&#8217;s suicide.  But was it foreseeable?  I am quite clear that it was not.  The reports as to the Husband&#8217;s mental health had become uniformly positive by September 2014 at the latest.  The Wife and her advisers were entitled to rely on those reports and clearly did so.  Contact was taking place.  I am quite clear that if it really had been foreseeable that the Husband would commit suicide by the end of 2014, the Wife or her advisers would have come to that conclusion and contact would have been stopped, whether by the professionals or the court.  The emails do not show a suicidal man.  They show one that is angry that he was still not having unrestricted contact even though, on his own case, there was nothing wrong with him.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Using Wilson J&#8217;s test in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Reid</span>, the suicide of the Husband could not have been seen as a significant possibility by the court, the Wife or her advisers.  It was at best a theoretical possibility.  Nothing had happened since the final letters of Dr C and the report of Dr D that could conceivably be said to have put the Wife on notice whether constructive or actual that the situation had changed.  The fact that she willingly agreed to pay him over &#163;17 million is relevant to this.  I recognise that it is not said she did foresee his death but, if there was material that should have led her to realise that his death was foreseeable, she would not have agreed to this award being made and her advisers, who would have considered the position objectively, would not have let her.  The Husband&#8217;s suicide was unforeseen and unforeseeable.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am quite satisfied that the Husband&#8217;s claim was primarily needs based.  All the assets in this case came to the Wife by inheritance/gift.  With the possible exception of the matrimonial home, all the assets were non-matrimonial property.  They were not mixed.  Indeed, the Husband retained his assets, separate from those of the Wife throughout the marriage.  The only possible exception was that the Husband was given a revocable life interest in the Wife&#8217;s main trust assets after her death but I am quite satisfied that this was needs based provision, to provide for him in the unlikely event that she predeceased him.  Moreover, the appointments were revocable. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is right to note that there was no great consideration of how the award was calculated in the negotiations.  I reject any suggestion that the Husband&#8217;s belief that he was &#8220;entitled&#8221; to a significant award is of any relevance.  In so far as he makes the point in his letter to his brothers, he specifically justifies that entitlement on the basis of the pain allegedly caused to him by the Wife as a result of the breakdown of the marriage.  He does not do so relying on his efforts during the marriage. </p>

In a letter dated 2nd June 2015, the Executors&#8217; solicitors refer to the Wife telling Mr K A that she did not want the children to think the Husband was living in reduced circumstances and made reference to him being able to live comfortably on &#163;20 million.

But, equally, there was no claim by the Husband&#8217;s lawyers to a sharing entitlement.  In particular, no valuation of the matrimonial home was required.  Given the nature of the assets, a needs based award, generously assessed, was the appropriate way to proceed.  In so far as there was a sharing claim, it was undoubtedly for less than the needs based claim, such that the needs based claim prevailed.  I therefore take the view that this was primarily a needs based claim and therefore susceptible to being set aside pursuant to the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Barder</span> jurisdiction.</p>

I have quoted from the judgment of Lord Nicholls in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miller</span> as to the unique position of the matrimonial home.  I remind myself that the Z Estate was not an ancestral home acquired by aristocratic ancestors of the Wife centuries ago.  It was acquired during the marriage.  It was dilapidated.  It was rebuilt to a very high standard.  The grounds were extensively developed.   This was undoubtedly a joint project even if all the money came from the Wife.  Regardless of which account is correct as to the Husband&#8217;s work on the grounds, there can be no doubt that this was a family home at the very centre of this marriage.  Indeed, although a very minor point, there was an Estate partnership between the Husband and the Wife.  I accept that it did not generate any profit and had no value but it &#8220;managed the Estate&#8221;. I have therefore come to the conclusion, in the circumstances of this case, that the Z Estate was matrimonial property notwithstanding the source of the funds to acquire it.</p>

The Wife&#8217;s disclosure, however, stated that the net value of the part of the Z Estate held in her sole name was &#163;14.9 million net.  A sharing award of one-third of this value, namely &#163;5 million would, in my view, have been an entirely appropriate award given the length of the marriage and the Husband&#8217;s contributions as husband and father, having taken into account the observations of Lord Nicholls.

They cannot pick and choose the extent to which it was effective.  I remind myself that it was agreed long before <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Radmacher</span>. Very limited thought was given to it at all.

In the context of the length of this marriage, the contributions the Husband did make and the Wife&#8217;s wealth, I do not believe an award to enable him to make bequests would be unreasonable.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In one sense, an award of &#163;5 million simply seems right applying the section 25 criteria after a marriage of this length given the Wife&#8217;s huge wealth.  It can be justified on sharing and it is not out of kilter with a needs award.  That is the sum I would have ordered in November if I had known all the facts.  It would leave the Husband&#8217;s estate with a fraction over &#163;7 million once his assets are included.  Net of IHT, this comes to around &#163;4.4 million.  It would be a fair award.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It follows that the appeal is allowed.  The lump sum is reduced from &#163;17.34 million to &#163;5 million.  The second tranche is set aside.  There must be a repayment from the estate to the Wife of &#163;3.67 million.   </p>
