	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This is an application made by MS for declaratory relief pursuant to s 17 of the Married Women&#8217;s Property Act 1882 (&#8220;MWPA&#8221;). Her claim arises in the context of a settled relationship with the first respondent, AJ, of just under five years.  He is the father of her two children, now aged 5 and nearly 4 years old.  The parties met in Paris in 2008 and lived together in London throughout their relationship which ended in difficult circumstances in 2013.  Although they became engaged in February 2009 and, five months later, had a ceremony of blessing in respect of their intended marriage, it was never formally celebrated because the respondent was unable to secure a divorce from his wife at the time.  In March 2015, the English court made a declaration of non-marriage in respect of this relationship.  The present application is now made by MS in order to disentangle the financial consequences of her former relationship with AJ in circumstances where the more wide-ranging discretionary provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> are not available to the court.  I propose to refer in this judgment to MS as &#8220;the applicant&#8221; and to AJ as &#8220;the respondent&#8221;.  I do so in order to preserve their anonymity and intend no disrespect to either in adopting this otherwise somewhat impersonal style .</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The applicant has been represented by Mr Martin Pointer QC and Mrs Rebecca Carew Pole instructed by Schillings.  Whilst the respondent formerly instructed lawyers, he represented himself for the purposes of the final hearing.  He did so, if I may say so, with a comprehensive grasp of the facts and the law and put his case before the court with courtesy.  Notwithstanding the combined expertise of the applicant&#8217;s legal representation, I am satisfied he has not been disadvantaged as a result of not having lawyers on this occasion.  Every point which could and should have been taken in respect of his case has been put before the court.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At the heart of this application is a dispute about the beneficial ownership of four central London properties which these parties own, or in which either or both have had an interest during their former relationship.  The portfolio is encumbered by a significant raft of secured bank borrowings and the third respondent in these proceedings is X Bank, the mortgagee (&#8220;the Bank&#8221;).  The second respondent is an offshore company, WC Limited, which holds the legal title to one of the properties.  The second and third respondents were joined as parties to these proceedings in May 2014.  Their party status reflects their interests in protecting the property and the two mortgages in which they have an interest.  Whilst I heard from Mr Goward on behalf of the Bank on the first day of the hearing, the company has played no part in the proceedings albeit that I have been shown correspondence from Mr W who is an officer of WC Limited.</p>

Those proceedings have now concluded on the basis that the children live with their mother in an apartment which is currently provided by her parents.  The respondent sees the children on a regular basis at Westbourne Terrace where, for the time being, he continues to live.  At the start of the hearing, and with the consent of all parties, I made an interim order for the sale of that property and a marketing exercise is now underway.  The respondent has agreed to vacate the property albeit that the date upon which that should happen has yet to be decided.</p>

This flowed from the very unfortunate circumstances of the breakdown of their relationship.  It was the applicant&#8217;s case in those proceedings (accepted by the judge in a fact-finding hearing) that from 2010, at a time when she was pregnant with her first child, the respondent had subjected her to verbal and emotional abuse.  By the time she was expecting their second child, his controlling behaviour (as found by the judge) had escalated to physical abuse.  His subsequent acceptance of his mistreatment of the applicant is buttressed by a significant raft of findings made by District Judge Gibson at the conclusion of a contested fact-finding hearing in April 2014.  I have been provided with a copy of her judgment which records those findings and her detailed reasons for accepting the evidence of the applicant and rejecting that of the respondent.   </p>

In the course of my analysis of that evidence, I shall have to make my own findings as to who is telling the truth about a number of issues.  I approach that task by reminding myself that the fact that the respondent has been disbelieved in previous litigation and has been found to have lied does not necessarily lead me to conclusion that his evidence in these proceedings is unreliable and not worthy of belief.  A witness may lie for a variety of reasons including humiliation, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear, distress, confusion or emotional pressure<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

He also accepted that his behaviour had been controlling.

Whilst I do not need to rehearse its contents for the purposes of this judgment, its contents are revealing of the expectations which he had in terms of the dynamics of his future relationship with the applicant.  </p>

She was then 31 years old and was living and working in London.  Her parents provided the deposit of &#163;350,000 and the balance of the purchase price was raised by means of a &#163;400,000 mortgage. (This mortgage was paid off in 2006 or 2007.) Over the intervening years, its value has increased from &#163;750,000 to somewhere in the region of &#163;2.65 million.  The flat has been generating a rental income which is paid into the sole account of the applicant.</p>

This property was purchased in November 2008 some eight months after the parties met.  The purchase price of &#163;1,425,000 was financed by a deposit of &#163;507,205 (cf. &#163;501,299 in written agreement at [F:8]) which was raised by a new mortgage secured on the applicant&#8217;s Rutland Gate property and a further mortgage of &#163;1,047,000 (cf. &#163;1,022,500 at [F:8]) which was secured on Falcon House itself.  The mortgage payments were serviced by the rental income generated from Rutland Gate.  In this way, the property &#8220;washed its face&#8221; without additional cost until 2011 when the mortgage fell into arrears in circumstances to which I shall come.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is the respondent&#8217;s case that the parties signed a written agreement which provided that the underlying beneficial interest in Falcon House would be held by them jointly notwithstanding the absence of any direct financial contribution by him to its purchase.  The applicant accepts that she was asked to sign a document to this effect which had been prepared by the respondent but she contends that she never agreed to share with him the beneficial ownership in Falcon House and the document was never signed by her.  Notwithstanding the fact that the apartment was purchased with the intention they would live there, it is her case that the clear understanding between them was that the property would be hers absolutely.  She says that the relationship was then its very early stages.  Not only had she put up 100% of the purchase monies, she had also taken on additional borrowings which were funded by further charging the equity of her property in Rutland Gate.  Those borrowings were to be (and were in fact) serviced by her separate income from the tenants in Rutland Gate.</p>

There is a dispute between the parties as to whether or not the applicant shared his enthusiasm for such a purchase.  She was by then pregnant with their second child and she told me that she had no appetite for another move at that stage.  She was also concerned about additional financial exposure in circumstances where the respondent was not generating an income and they were reliant on the rent from her two properties.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In terms, the respondent&#8217;s case is that his discussions with the Bank (led by him but supported by the applicant) were focused upon a tax efficient scheme which would both enable them to take advantage of their non-domiciled status as French Lebanese nationals and increase their foothold in a rising central London property market.  By that stage, their three London properties were worth a total of &#163;5.3 million gross.  The aggregate mortgage debt secured on those properties was &#163;2.072 million.  The underlying equity of &#163;3.228 million would have exposed the survivor of them to a very significant UK inheritance tax liability.  Within the material before the court was a copy of the written tax advice prepared by solicitors, Child &amp; Child, who, at that stage, appear to have been advising both the parties and the Bank.  That advice appears to be predicated on the basis that the applicant and respondent were legally married to one another which, of course, they were not.  The document which I have seen speaks of the estate passing from &#8220;the deceased spouse&#8221; to &#8220;the surviving spouse&#8221;.   That, of itself, has no significance for the purposes of my judgment save perhaps that it indicates in terms that this couple still regarded their relationship as one of commitment notwithstanding the difficulties which had by then surfaced.</p>

The respondent had a professional background in banking but, since the start of his relationship with the applicant, he had been a self-styled entrepreneur.  He was then in the process of setting up a new private equity business (T Partners) which appears never really to have &#8216;got off the ground&#8217;.  The applicant was responsible for the majority of the family&#8217;s living expenses which she met from her rental income.  It is also her case that she lent the respondent a substantial sum of money to assist him with the start-up costs of his business which included legal and other professional fees.  In addition her father injected capital of some &#163;200,000 into his fund.  </p>

Of this, some &#163;20,000 (or &#163;50,000, on the respondent&#8217;s case) was repaid to the applicant.  It appears that the sales of the French properties were distressed sales which took place at the instigation of the banks which had lent money to the respondent.  Whilst there was insufficient evidence for me to be able to make findings as to what, if any, capital was returned to the respondent as a result of these sales, it appears that whatever came back to him (which was not significant) was ploughed into the start-up costs of his new business venture.</p>

She says that throughout their course (from February to September 2011) she was marginalised from what was going on despite her repeated requests of the respondent to include her in the discussions.  Eventually she left him alone to continue negotiations and preoccupied herself with the impending birth of their second son.  She contends that she was put under undue pressure by the respondent and, as a result, she was persuaded to engage in the scheme to &#8220;keep the peace&#8221;.  (In this context, she does not rely upon that undue pressure as affecting her contractual obligations vis &#224; vis the Bank; it is no part of her case that the Bank&#8217;s mortgages should be set aside.)  Again, her case is challenged by the respondent who says that she was throughout kept informed and that she positively embraced the opportunity to put in place the scheme which he had devised with the Bank.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In terms of structure, what was envisaged was that a new central London property would be purchased as a family home.  That property was to be held in the name of an offshore company which would be formed by the Bank to serve as the acquisition vehicle.  Provided that the control and management of that company was not exercised or exercisable by either of the applicant or the respondent, it was envisaged that their occupation of the new property would not give rise to any benefit in kind income tax charge on them as directors or shadow directors.  The shares in the company were to be owned by a new non-resident trust formed and managed by the Bank in Jersey which would thereafter act as trustee.  The beneficiaries of the trust would be the applicant, the respondent and their two children.  The respondent had made it clear to the Bank that he wished to retain power to revoke the intended trust and to amend its provisions as well as to retain control over distribution policy.  In order to avoid any argument that such control would render the trust vulnerable to an argument that it was UK resident with the loss of capital tax protection, the solution settled upon was the use of a settlor who was resident in, and a national of, Lebanon.  It appears that in the early stages of the negotiations the respondent had volunteered the name of a Lebanese woman whom he trusted to act in accordance with his wishes.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In order to provide maximum tax protection, what was being proposed was the extraction of maximum liquid equity from the existing London property portfolio.  The Bank would thereafter lend 80% of the value of the three existing properties (&#8216;the primary loan&#8217;) which would replace the existing borrowing, leave sufficient cash for the deposit on a new property <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> a residual fund of &#163;1.15 million which was to be invested offshore.  That investment (in a bond or wrapper) was intended to produce sufficient income (with the rental income from the three other properties) to service the Bank debt.  The bond was to be owned by a second (and separate) offshore company, WH Limited, thereby ring-fencing the security of the underlying value for the protection of the Bank in the event of default.  The balance of the purchase price of the new property would be funded by a separate mortgage loan (&#8216;the second loan&#8217;).  The investment &#8216;churn&#8217; generated by the bond (anticipated to be some &#163;250,000 per annum) would be an essential element of the borrowers&#8217; ability to discharge the interest payments on the two loans.  Because of their non-domiciled status, this income would be payable offshore without any corresponding tax liability on the basis that they would be permitted to draw down up to 5% of the funds which remained offshore.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It was, on any view, an ambitious scheme as the respondent himself accepts.  It was always going to be dependent on the production of sufficient income from the offshore bond to enable the parties to service the debt.  Aside from the rental income, neither had any income or potential income stream to defray their day to day living expenses.  Judging from the evidence I have heard and read, their standard of living, whilst not unduly extravagant, was comfortable.  Certainly there is no evidence of any consequential &#8216;reining in&#8217; of discretionary spending in the aftermath of the increased burden of debt.  There is some issue as to what the Bank was told during these discussions about the respondent&#8217;s income from his business and/or the existence of other offshore assets.  At a late stage in the negotiations, the individual leading discussions on behalf of the Bank (Mr H) had circulated an email which referred to the need for a further &#163;220,000 of additional equity to be invested in the structure because of unexpectedly low property valuations in respect of the existing property portfolio.  That email went on to refer to the potential need for the respondent to liquidate &#8216;other offshore investments in a depressed market and thereby incur remittance fees if he were to use personal resources to meet the shortfall&#8217; (which, of course, he did not have).  There is a further reference in a later email from the Bank to the potential existence of other funds or assets owned by the respondent. On 22 August 2011, Mr H wrote in these terms:-</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, the most persuasive piece of evidence showing that the Bank is likely to have been misled about the existence of other offshore funds is an email which the Bank sent to the respondent on 11 August 2011 shortly before the conclusion of the negotiations.  This is but one of a whole series of emails which went back and forth during the summer of 2011. Having read them, there is no doubt in my mind, and I find as a fact, that the respondent was driving these negotiations forward with the Bank with little, if any, active involvement of, or participation by, the applicant.  This particular email is a lengthy document which discusses various points arising out of the discussions flowing from the tax advice which had been given by Child &amp; Child.  In the context of preparing the loan documentation, there is this reference in one of the Bank&#8217;s e mails to the respondent:</p>

As I mentioned in my email on Monday, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">to ensure that the lending is primarily deductible against the properties</span> to get the net asset value to zero for IHT purposes (as your advice envisages) will require specifically drafted loan agreements and this will take a little time to agree and finalise.&#8221; (my emphasis)</p>

I am satisfied that the applicant had no such assets.  On the balance of probabilities I am persuaded that representations to this effect were made to the Bank by the respondent and probably in order to bolster his credibility or standing with the Bank both as borrower and potential client.  Certainly there is nothing in his email sent in reply the following day to correct any assumptions it was making in this respect.</p>

These were treated as separate mortgage transactions in relation to each of the properties.  The manner in which its security was to be enforced in the event of a default was to be a matter for the Bank at its sole election.  In these circumstances, and because she was the legal owner of two of the three properties, it was a separate condition of the mortgage offer that the applicant received independent legal advice.  The Bank also required copies of each tenancy agreement entered into in respect of the rental portfolio of properties and stipulated that the rental income generated by the tenants was paid into a separate bank account in the name of the respondent.  He was to be the sole mortgagor.</p>

The purchase price of Westbourne Terrace was &#163;3.25 million.  There was no cross-collateralisation between the two loans.  The applicant&#8217;s exposure in the event of default in respect of the primary loan had increased from a total mortgage debt on her two properties in the sum of &#163;1,557,670 to the potential loss of the entire equity in both, then some &#163;2.54 million.  Whilst the respondent&#8217;s Queen&#8217;s Gate flat was included in the security for the &#8216;interlocking&#8217; primary loan, the value of the (2011) equity in that property was just under &#163;570,000 and the Bank had effective <span style="font-style:italic">carte blanche </span>as to the manner in which it chose to enforce its security.  It seems to me highly likely that the Bank might well have taken the view that, in the event of default, it was a cheaper and more expedient option to move first against the more valuable properties in order to enforce its security in the event of default on the primary loan.  In this event, the applicant&#8217;s properties were squarely in the line of fire.  I do not, and cannot, make specific findings about the precise degree of her potential exposure save that both properties were, and remained, vulnerable throughout the five year mortgage term subject only to their ability to service the debt and repay the principal at the end of that term.</p>

The vendor was threatening to pull out of the sale if completion was delayed any further and the purchase went ahead as planned but in circumstances where there was a shortfall in the residual funds which were earmarked for the offshore investment bond.   As a result of an oversight, the solicitors had failed to factor into their completion statement the professional fees which had been incurred in connection with the mortgage refinancing.  That sum, together with a second charge which was secured on the respondent&#8217;s property at Queen&#8217;s Gate (just under &#163;95,000), reduced the cash sum remitted to Jersey to less than &#163;1 million.  It was never invested in the proposed bond and still sits in a designated account as a cash reserve.  As at 5 January 2016, the balance in that account was &#163;957,204.  Thus, an essential component element of the scheme was missing.  The revenue of &#163;250,000 per annum which had been earmarked to meet a substantial part of the mortgage interest was simply not available.

At that point in time, as her email shows, they were trying to refinance the debt with alternative mortgage lenders.  Nothing came of those attempts.  In a document attached to her email, the applicant had compiled a schedule showing the ownership of each property, its current value and the rental income and expenses to be set off against each.

I suspect that the interim order for the sale of Westbourne Terrace has given the Bank some comfort but it cannot be expected to wait much longer.

As I have said, it is his case that there was a specific agreement between them at the time, recorded in writing and signed by the applicant, to the effect that, as future cohabiting partners who had agreed to service jointly the debt on the two mortgages taken out to fund the purchase, they each held a 50% beneficial interest in the property.  The applicant has no recollection of signing any such document.  She denies there was any such agreement.  I have a report from a jointly instructed expert graphologist, Dr AG, who has concluded that the signature of the applicant on the document produced by the respondent is more likely to be a &#8220;simulation&#8221; than a genuine signature (she does not use the word &#8216;forgery&#8217;) although the evidence which supports her conclusion, whilst positive, is &#8220;only weak&#8221;.</p>

The respondent pleads a &#8220;pooling agreement&#8221; whereby the entire property portfolio was thenceforth to be held on the basis of equal beneficial ownership. The applicant denies that there was ever any such agreement, arrangement or understanding between them that any beneficial interest in either of the apartments at Falcon House or Rutland Gate should pass to the respondent.

For the time being, it is sufficient to record the respondent&#8217;s case that the subsequent restructuring of the financing for the property portfolio in 2011 was part and parcel of this &#8220;pooling&#8221; arrangement or agreement which the parties had concluded as between themselves and which began with the purchase of their first shared home at Falcon Court.    </span></p>

The Bank&#8217;s corporate trustees regard the respondent as the beneficial owner of the shares in the company; he, in turn, regards himself as holding those shares on trust for himself and the applicant in equal shares.  Whilst Mr Pointer and Mrs Carew Pole suggest in their opening note that the production of such a trust document would have provided a conclusive answer to the issue of their respective shares in the property, this submission in based upon the (now) familiar doctrine established in <span style="font-style:italic">Pettitt v Pettitt </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1970] AC 777" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1970">[1970] AC 777</ref> and confirmed in <span style="font-style:italic">Goodman v Gallant </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/1985/15" uk:canonical="[1985] EWCA Civ 15" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] EWCA Civ 15</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] 1 FLR 513" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] 1 FLR 513</ref>.  As a strict proposition of law, they are, of course, correct.  However, for my part, I am not necessarily persuaded that such a trust instrument in the particular circumstances of this case would necessarily have provided a definitive answer. In accordance with the tax advice from Child &amp; Child, I suspect that the intention was to draft the trust deed in such a way that the applicant, the respondent and the children would all have been named as within the potential class of beneficiaries who might benefit under wide discretionary powers vested in the trustees, subject to any underlying letter of wishes which the (unidentified) settlor or nominated protector of the trust might have signed.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8216;In order to decide whether the plaintiff has a beneficial interest in [the property] we must climb again the familiar ground which slopes down from the twin peaks of <span style="font-style:italic">Pettitt v Pettitt </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1969] 2 All ER 385" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1969">[1969] 2 All ER 385</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1970] 2 All ER 780" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1970">[1970] 2 All ER 780</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1971] AC 886" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1971">[1971] AC 886</ref>.  In such a case as the present, where there has been no written declaration or agreement, nor any direct provision by the plaintiff of part of the purchase price so as to give rise to a resulting trust in her favour, she must establish a common intention, between her and the defendant, acted on by her, that she should have a beneficial interest in the property.  If she can do that, equity will not allow the defendant to deny that interest and will construct a trust to give effect to it.  In most of these cases the fundamental, and invariably the most difficult, question is to decide whether there was the necessary common intention, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">being something which can only be inferred from the conduct of the parties, almost always from the expenditure incurred by them respectively</span>.  In this regard the court has to look for expenditure which is referable to the acquisition of the house: see <span style="font-style:italic">Burns v Burns </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1984] 1 All ER 244" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1984">[1984] 1 All ER 244</ref> at 252-253, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1984] Ch 317" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1984">[1984] Ch 317</ref> at 328-329 per Fox LJ. If it is found to have been incurred, such expenditure will perform the twofold function of establishing the common intention and showing the claimant has acted upon it.  There is another and rarer class of case, of which the present may be one, where, although there has been no writing, the parties have orally declared themselves in such a way as to make their common intention plain.  Here the court does not have to look for conduct from which the intention can be inferred, but only for conduct which amounts to an acting on it by the claimant. And, although that conduct can undoubtedly be the incurring of expenditure which is referable to the acquisition of the house, it need not necessarily be so.&#8217; [my emphasis]</p>

Lord Diplock points out that, even where parties have not used express words to communicate their intention (and therefore there is no direct evidence), the court can infer from their actions an intention that they shall both have an interest in the house.  This part of his speech concentrates on the types of evidence from which the courts are most often asked to infer such intention, viz contributions (direct and indirect) to the deposit, the mortgage instalments or general housekeeping expenses.  In this section of the speech, he analyses what types of expenditure are capable of constituting evidence of such common intention; he does not say that if the intention is proved in some other way such contributions are essential to establish the trust.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Having undertaken a thorough review of the development of the law in relation to constructive trusts and the developing jurisprudence which underpinned that development, Chadwick LJ took the opportunity in <span style="font-style:italic">Oxley v Hiscock</span> to summarise the law in this way:-</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold">[68]</span><marker name="tab"/>I have referred, in the immediately preceding paragraphs, to &#8216;cases of this nature&#8217;.  By that, I mean cases in which the common features are: (i) the property is bought as a home for the couple who, although not married, intend to live together as man and wife; (ii) each of them makes some financial contribution to the purchase; (iii) the property is purchased in the sole name of one of them; and (iv) there is no express declaration of trust.  In those circumstances the first question is whether there is evidence from which to infer a common intention, communicated by each to the other, that each shall have a beneficial share in the property.  In many such cases &#8211; of which the present is an example &#8211;there will have been some discussion between the parties at the time of the purchase which provides the answer to that question.  Those are cases within the first of Lord Bridge&#8217;s categories in <span style="font-style:italic">Rosset</span>&#8217;s case.  In other cases &#8211; where the evidence is that the matter was not discussed at all &#8211; an affirmative answer will readily be inferred from the fact that each has made a financial contribution.  Those are cases within Lord Bridge&#8217;s second category.  And, if the answer to the first question is that there was a common intention, communicated to each other, that each should have a beneficial share in the property, then the party who does not become the legal owner will be held to have acted to his or her detriment in making a financial contribution to the purchase in reliance on the common intention.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-weight:bold">[69]</span><marker name="tab"/>In those circumstances, the second question to be answered in cases of this nature is &#8216;what is the extent of the parties&#8217; respective beneficial interests in the property ?&#8217;  Again, in many such cases, the answer will be provided by evidence of what they said and did at the time of the acquisition. But, in a case where there is no evidence of any discussion between them as to the amount of the share which each was to have &#8211; and even in a case where the evidence is that there was no discussion on that point &#8211; the question still requires an answer.  It must now be accepted that (at least in this court and below) the answer is that each is entitled to that share which the court considers fair having regard to the whole course of dealing between them in relation to the property.  And, in that context, &#8216;the whole course of dealing between them in relation to the property&#8217; includes the arrangements which they made from time to time in order to meet the outgoings (for example, mortgage contributions, council tax and utilities, repairs, insurance and housekeeping) which have to be met if they are to live in the property as their home.&#8217;</p>

He limited himself to drawing attention to one &#8216;critical distinction&#8217;.  If there is to be a finding of an actual &#8216;agreement, arrangement, or understanding&#8217; between the parties it must be &#8216;based on evidence of express discussions between the partners, however imperfectly remembered and however imprecise their terms may have been&#8217; (see <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 1 All ER 1111" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 1 All ER 1111</ref> at 1118, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 1 AC 107" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 1 AC 107</ref> at 132.

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">&#8216;In sharp contrast with this situation is the very different one where there is no evidence to support a finding of an agreement or arrangement to share, however reasonable it might have been for the parties to reach such an arrangement if they had applied their minds to the question, and where the court must rely entirely on the conduct of the parties both as to the basis from which to infer a common intention to share the property beneficially and as the conduct relied on to give rise to a constructive trust.  In this situation direct contributions to the purchase price by the party who is not the legal owner, whether initially or by payment of the mortgage instalments, will readily justify the inference necessary to the creation of a constructive trust.  But, as I read the authorities, it is at least extremely doubtful whether anything less will do.&#8217; (<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 1 All ER 1111" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 1 All ER 1111</ref> at 1119. <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 1 AC 107" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 1 AC 107</ref> at 1322-133.)&#8221;  </p>

This is not a task to be lightly embarked upon.  In family disputes, strong feelings are aroused when couples split up.  These often lead the parties, honestly but mistakenly, to reinterpret the past in self-exculpatory or vengeful terms.  They also lead people to spend far more on the legal battle than is warranted by the sums actually at stake.  A full examination of the facts is likely to involve disproportionate costs.&#8221;</p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;In law, &#8216;context is everything&#8217; and the domestic context is very different from the commercial world.  Each case will turn on its own facts.  Many more factors than financial contributions may be relevant to divining the parties&#8217; true intentions.  These include: any advice or discussions at the time of the transfer which cast light upon their true intentions then; the reasons why the home was acquired in joint names; the reasons why (if it be the case) the survivor was authorised to give a receipt for the capital moneys; the purpose for which the home was acquired; the nature of the parties&#8217; relationship; whether they had children for whom they both had responsibility to provide a home; how the purchase was financed, both initially and subsequently; how the parties arranged their finances, whether separately or together or a bit of both; how they discharged the outgoings on the property and their other household expenses.  When a couple are the joint owners of the home and jointly liable for the mortgage, the inferences to be drawn from who pays for what may be very different from the inferences to be drawn when only one is the owner of the home.  The arithmetical calculation of how much was paid by each is also likely to be less important.  It will be easier to draw the inference that they intended that each should contribute as much to the household as they reasonably could and that they would share the eventual benefit or burden equally.  The parties&#8217; individual characters and personalities may also be a factor in deciding where their true intentions lay.  In the cohabitation context, mercenary considerations may be more to the fore than they would be in marriage, but it should not be assumed that they will always take pride of place over natural love and affection.  At the end of the day, having taken all this into account, cases in which the joint legal owners are to be taken to have intended that their beneficial interests should be different from their legal interests will be very unusual.&#8221;</p>

That case concerned a slightly different aspect of the law, namely whether beneficial interests under a constructive trust could be varied by inference or imputation.  There, the family home had been bought in joint names by a cohabiting couple who were both liable for the mortgage but without any express declaration of their beneficial interests.  Lord Walker and Baroness Hale delivered a joint judgment which is now regarded as the most authoritative modern guidance as to the proper approach in cases of this sort.  In my view it now provides the starting point for the road map through this area of the law. Paragraph 51 contains their conclusions set out in the following five headline points:-</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The property was acquired in the applicant&#8217;s sole name.  The presumption therefore is that she is the sole beneficial owner.  As Lord Neuberger observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Stack v Dowden </span> at para [115], where a home is purchased in the name of only one party, this is almost as likely to have been a conscious decision as where it was acquired in joint names.  Thus, the respondent has first to surmount the hurdle of showing that he has any beneficial interest at all in the apartment in Falcon House, before showing exactly what that interest was.  It is common ground that he made no financial contribution towards the purchase price.  It is also common ground that the relationship between the parties at this point in time was relatively new.  In order to fund the purchase, the applicant was in effect re-mortgaging her property at Rutland Gate since the original mortgage had been repaid in its entirety some eighteen months or two years before the purchase of Falcon House.  The applicant&#8217;s evidence (which was not challenged) was that her parents had given her the funds with which to redeem the balance of the mortgage debt by way of an accelerated inheritance.  Certainly, by the time she met the respondent, Rutland Gate was mortgage free.  It is also common ground that she, alone, was responsible for the mortgage repayments on both properties between 2008 and 2011 when that mortgage was repaid as part of the financial restructuring with the Bank.</p>

She advances his reluctance to become involved in the acquisition of a central London property as part of the evidence which supports their common intention and understanding (i) that Rutland Gate was not to be put at risk beyond the security it provided to enable the purchase of Falcon House to proceed; and (ii) it was never their intention that he should acquire an interest in Falcon House since that interest would have to be declared in the context of his ongoing divorce proceedings.  She relies upon a specific conversation, or series of conversations, with the respondent during the course of which she says that she made it clear to him that she was not prepared to put at risk that which her parents had given to her to ensure her future financial security.</p>

I accept that, from time to time, the solicitor dealing with the purchase of Falcon House was sending emails to the applicant and the respondent jointly.  This piece of evidence on its own does not, in my judgment, establish a common intention that each was to have a beneficial interest.  Much of the correspondence is addressed solely to the applicant.  However, that email correspondence (which is exhibited to the respondent&#8217;s statement) leads me to the issue of the written agreement which the applicant is said to have signed confirming their joint beneficial interests in the property.</span></p>

As our client had searched through his papers and not found his original, and as your client had removed many items from the matrimonial home when she departed in September 2013, he believed that she had removed this document.  He now accepts that he was mistaken in that belief but it was nevertheless a genuine one at the time stated.  It remains his belief that your client removed her original and has lied in her evidence by claiming that the agreement was never signed and by producing only an unsigned version&#8221;.</p>

Mr Pointer&#8217;s suggestion was that he had then replicated the applicant&#8217;s signature on the signed version of the document and scanned it through a computer and had thereby produced the document which was sent to his solicitor and copied to the applicant&#8217;s solicitors on 29 May 2015, together with the explanation that it had been &#8220;discovered&#8221; amongst old papers.  The respondent denied that he had done any such thing.  He was unable to explain why, if a signed version of the document had been available from 21 December 2008, the document in respect of which Mr L was giving advice on 13 January 2009 was an unsigned version.  The respondent agreed (i) that Mr L&#8217;s email of that date and the advice he was giving was clearly written <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">in contemplation</span> of an agreement; (ii) that the version of the agreement referred to in his email as the document in respect of which advice was sought was plainly a draft; and (iii) that there was no attempt in the applicant&#8217;s reply to that email the following day to explain to Mr L that in fact the parties had already signed the agreement in that form some three weeks before.  All that the reply said was, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;We will get back to you if we feel we would like to set something up with Victoria&#8221; </span>(i.e. the solicitor who had been nominated in the firm&#8217;s private client team).  Further, it appears to be agreed as between the applicant and the respondent that it was the cost of securing advice in relation to a written agreement which preventing them from taking the matter any further.  On the applicant&#8217;s case, she had no intention of signing any such agreement, regardless of the expense of obtaining legal advice.  It is curious, to say the least, that the respondent&#8217;s oral evidence was that, notwithstanding the contents of Mr L&#8217;s email, by mid-January 2009, each of the applicant and the respondent had in their respective possession a signed copy of the document upon which he now seeks to rely.  It is his case that, whilst his came to light on 1 May 2015, the applicant has throughout knowingly withheld her signed copy.     </p>

She told me during the course of her oral evidence that she had no knowledge of what was discussed between the respondent and the conveyancing solicitor during their telephone conversation on 12 January 2009, nor does she have any independent recollection of the subject matter of her email to the solicitor on 20 November 2009 regarding the &#8220;single page letter&#8221; of understanding which she wanted him to draft.  She presumed that it was a reference to the document which the respondent wanted her to sign.  She recalled that the first time she saw the document which the respondent had prepared was shortly after completion when she saw it on the dining room table at the Falcon House apartment.  The respondent told her that it was important and he wanted to run it past the lawyers.  When cross-examined by the respondent about the document, she told me that she knew she had not signed anything because she was put under pressure by him to sign and was unwilling to do so.  She explained that her parents had helped her financially both in relation to the original deposit on the Rutland Gate flat and subsequently in paying off the mortgage on that property.  This had occurred long before she met the respondent and she had the strongest sense that this was intended by her parents as her financial security which must be &#8220;kept safe&#8221;.  She felt that the respondent&#8217;s request that she transfer half of the value of Falcon House to him was an unreasonable imposition on her and unfair to her parents who had entrusted the Rutland Gate equity to her for her future security.  She volunteered in her evidence that she was well aware that this was important for the respondent who wanted to feel that acquiring the property at Falcon House was the start of their joint lives together.  She told me that she was very uncomfortable about the entire arrangement and hoped it would just &#8220;go away&#8221;.</p>

Having recorded that the simple and variable style of the applicant&#8217;s signature renders it vulnerable to simulation and difficult to authenticate, Dr Giles identifies these points of difference as positive (albeit weak) evidence that the signature on the letter of agreement is not genuinely that of the applicant. </p>

I have no doubt that it was not easy for her to deal with the respondent&#8217;s cross-examination given the circumstances leading up to the breakdown in their personal relationship.  Nonetheless, she made eye contact with him throughout and gave her evidence in a clear and careful manner.  Where appropriate, she was prepared to make concessions or tell me she could not remember details.  When providing answers to some of the respondent&#8217;s questions, she was able to give me colour and detail which went beyond the written structure of the formal pleadings and her written evidence.  I did not interpret this detail to be an attempt on her part to embroider or improperly bolster her evidence.  Rather, it had the clear ring of truth and of memory recaptured as the detail of these events was explored forensically.  At no stage did I have the impression that she was dissembling or deliberately withholding the truth.  Her evidence in relation to the written agreement and the reasons why she was unwilling to sign it were in my judgment both compelling and credible.  </p>

But they are snapshots, albeit vivid snapshots, of the very early stages of this relationship.  It was a relationship which developed very swiftly and one which, within a short period of time, saw them living together at Falcon House as a couple.  </p>

Whilst I accept that she raised the issue of some form of agreement with the conveyancing solicitors at the time of purchase, I believed her evidence that she was then under some pressure from the respondent to &#8220;sign up&#8221; to this agreement and that she had hoped very much that, as an issue, it would simply &#8220;go away&#8221; with the passage of time.  </p>

I have already referred to the fact that the contemporaneous written evidence in the form of the email from Mr L on 13 January 2009 points unequivocally to the unsigned version of the agreement being the document which he was being asked to consider and advise upon at the time.  It simply makes no sense for the respondent now to suggest that both he and the applicant had, but three or four weeks before, concluded their agreement and signed the document in acknowledgement of that fact.  I am troubled by the fact that, having discovered such a crucial piece of evidence in his case, it took him almost a month to convey the news to his solicitor.  The applicant had produced the draft Letter of Agreement which was in Mishcon de Reya&#8217;s conveyancing file some five months earlier and I do not find it credible that, having stumbled upon &#8220;the smoking gun&#8221; as he was sorting through old papers, he took no further action and failed to inform his solicitors for almost a month.</p>

His evidence about this was inconsistent and confused.  He told me that he thought he would have sent it to Mishcon de Reya because he could not think who else might have been interested in its contents.  When it was put to him that it could not have been sent to those solicitors because there was no signed copy on their file, he told me that he had no memory of its intended destination.

The fact that he agreed that Falcon House should be purchased in the sole name of the applicant in order to put beyond doubt his positon in those divorce proceedings (if that was indeed his intention) suggests that there never was any common intention at that time that he should have such a beneficial interest.  If that was not the position, then the only alternative explanation is that he was deliberately intent on misleading the French and/or English divorce court(s) and was willing to rely on perjured evidence in those proceedings.  </p>

Whether this was a deliberate attempt by the respondent to mislead or simply a self-aggrandising and un-particularised assertion of underlying wealth and financial status such as to make him attractive to the Bank as a client, I know not.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In conclusion, I am satisfied, and I so find, that the applicant did not sign the original draft which the respondent put in front of her and which was subsequently sent to Mr L in January 2009.  I am satisfied that the document which is referred to in Mr L&#8217;s email of 13 January 2009 was indeed the draft of the same, or a document similar to, that which was put before the applicant on the dining room table at Falcon House.  I am satisfied that, whilst she was probably not subjected to overt pressure or threats of any kind, the applicant did feel under a degree of emotional pressure to sign up to a proposal which emanated from the respondent and which involved sharing the equity in the flat they had just acquired as their first home together.  I am satisfied that it was a proposal on his part to which she never agreed.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Thus, on the basis of my findings of fact, I reject the respondent&#8217;s case that there was an express agreement that the beneficial ownership of the Falcon House apartment would be shared. Neither, for the reasons explained above, am I prepared to draw an inference in relation to the necessary common intention between these parties from their conduct at the time.  In order to establish a beneficial interest, that conduct must have involved some course of financial conduct which is referable to the acquisition of the property.  The respondent does not assert that he made any direct financial contribution towards its acquisition nor does he dispute the applicant&#8217;s evidence that she paid the mortgages which were taken out at the time of purchase.  I can find no reliable evidence that by that stage they were &#8216;pooling&#8217; their resources or operating a joint bank account from which either the mortgage payments, or their day to day expenditure, were paid.  I accept the applicant&#8217;s evidence that she was paying the mortgage of some &#163;1,700 per month from her rental income from Rutland Gate (some &#163;62,400 per annum gross). As to a mingling, or &#8216;pooling&#8217; of their financial arrangements, it is accepted that the parties never had a joint bank account.  Throughout the period of their relationship, they maintained separate accounts.  At this point in time, I am satisfied that such income as the respondent had from his rented property at Queen&#8217;s Gate was absorbed entirely with the cost of setting up his new business.  For some six months he was renting an office in central London and paying the salaries of three staff (including a personal assistant).  This was the applicant&#8217;s evidence but it was not challenged by the respondent.  When this proved too expensive without any income from the business, he reverted to working from home.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I accept that, on occasion, there was a payment from the respondent to the applicant in respect of monies which she had provided.  I heard about one such transaction involving either &#163;50,000 or &#163;20,000.  I do not need to make a finding about which figure it was.  The applicant told me, and I accept, that this money came from the proceeds of sale from his Monmouth Road flat.  She says that she does not know what he did with the balance although she suspects that it was ploughed into the start-up costs of his new business.  I accept the applicant&#8217;s evidence that they kept their finances separate and, whilst they may have had discussions and exchanged emails about cash flow issues and the rent which was being generated by the portfolio of properties, for the most part this did not come until later when the restructured debt became unsupportable.  I do not regard the email which the respondent has exhibited at [C:290] as being evidence which will support a finding in respect of any &#8220;pooling&#8221; or mingling of their finances.  This is no more than an email which the applicant wrote to the solicitors dealing with the completion of the Westbourne Terrace purchase in connection with some direct debits relating to mortgage arrangements which were in place prior to the 2011 refinancing exercise.  Whilst that email refers to &#8220;our accounts&#8221;, it is clear from the evidence (and accepted by the parties) that they never had a joint account. </p>

As I have said, it is common ground that he made no financial contribution to the purchase price or thereafter to the mortgage repayments.  He had no income at the time save for the rent he received from his Queen&#8217;s Gate flat.  I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence I have heard that the burden of discharging the majority of their domestic outgoings fell on the applicant&#8217;s shoulders.  This was a responsibility which I accept she discharged voluntarily since she had the greater rental income and wanted to support him as he tried to establish his new business.  He had no liability in respect of either of the mortgages which she continued to discharge and his assumption of liability for the current mortgage structure did not come until some three years later.</p>

The applicant&#8217;s pleaded case was she was throughout very anxious and reluctant to allow her two properties to be exposed to further borrowing.

I ask myself, first, whether there is any cogent or reliable evidence in this case of any discussion between the applicant and the respondent in relation to the proportions in which each was to share.  The Respondent has been unable to assist me with any evidence of specific discussions between them prior to the purchase of Westbourne Terrace.  He relies entirely on the agreement to share equally which he says was the basis upon which they lived their lives together.  In relation to this issue, I have accepted that the applicant&#8217;s evidence was true:  they simply never turned their minds to the precise proportions in which they were to share.</p>

Towards the end of 2010, the two year fixed rate mortgage which was secured on Falcon House came to an end and the mortgage payments doubled overnight from &#163;2,000 per month to &#163;4,000 per month.  Since she was meeting the household expenses (including the mortgage) from her savings and the rental income from Rutland Gate, the applicant&#8217;s evidence is that she had a discussion with the respondent about selling the property.  There was still no income flowing into the household from his business.  I accept that she was under financial pressure at this point in time.</p>

In April 2011, she had sent an email asking him if he was able to transfer &#163;4,000 to her bank account because she was overdrawn.  She said if he could not help, she would draw on her savings and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;try to convert some dollars&#8221;</span>.  By August of the same year, shortly before the remortgage was completed, she had made a further request for funds because she was once again short of money because of a mortgage payment and a credit card bill.  The respondent relies on these emails as evidence of a joint pooling of their resources.  I do not regard them as such.  In my view these requests were no more than the applicant asking for financial assistance with her cash flow from her partner who, at that stage, was contributing nothing towards the cost of the property in which they were living and, in all probability, very little towards their joint domestic economy.  I do not intend this as any criticism of him since this appears to have been the basis upon which they were operating at the time.  The applicant told me that she was supportive of his attempts to set up the business, as &#8211; it seems &#8211; was her family judging by the significant investment which her father had made. </p>

She was shown an organograph which purported to explain the structure of the purchase and the ownership of the property.  At that point, Mr S told her that one of his colleagues, Mr P, would need to speak to her separately in connection with signing the Bank&#8217;s documentation.  She says that she had a fairly brief meeting with this gentleman who informed her that she would be providing her properties as security for the loan which would be used to purchase Westbourne Terrace.

She recalls the respondent becoming agitated and she felt under pressure to sign the papers.  He assured her that she needed to trust him and that he would take care of everything.

The rent from those properties would service part of the mortgage debt and he would provide an income to meet their household expenses.  It seems that the applicant was never fully aware of the significance in the scheme of the income which was to have been generated by the investment bond or wrapper.  At all events, the applicant signed the mortgage documentation pledging her two properties as security for the restructured mortgage financing and the purchase of Westbourne Terrace was eventually completed on 5 October 2011.</p>

He was so happy about the idea of moving to a big house &#8211; a grandiose place &#8211; although I am sure part of his interests were for the children.  The reality was clear to me.

I have accepted as true the applicant&#8217;s evidence of the strain under which she had been placed financially and her attempts to placate the respondent as he became increasingly absorbed over the weeks and months in the complex scheme which he was seeking to negotiate with the Bank.  I find her description of &#8220;walking on eggshells&#8221; to be a fair representation of the atmosphere between them at the time.  She was caring for a small child and was heavily pregnant with their second son.  I found her description of her private one to one conversation with the respondent at the solicitor&#8217;s offices to have the clear ring of truth.  The respondent says that he has no recollection of this exchange between them.  I am entirely satisfied that it happened, and that it happened more or less in the way in which the applicant described it to me.  I am not surprised that, by this stage, she felt enmeshed in the deal and unable to back out even when presented with the opportunity by the solicitor.  She knew the personal investment which the Respondent had made in bolting down the final aspects of the deal with the Bank and I accept that she was highly anxious about upsetting him or doing anything which might put the scheme at risk.</span></p>

Simply pointing to the fact that they were living as a family cannot, in my judgment, provide a sufficient evidential basis for his case in circumstances where the evidence pointing in the other direction is so compelling.  I have rejected his case that there was a common &#8216;pooling&#8217; of their finances which might lend some support for a merging of their proprietary interests.   I am equally satisfied that the applicant was telling me the truth about her recollection of the specific discussions she had had with the respondent.  I am confident that she did, indeed, and on several occasions, express her concerns to him about the risk which the Bank&#8217;s scheme entailed in respect of the two properties which she regarded as hers.  I am equally confident in my finding that he did offer her reassurance and confirmed that, come what may, those properties would remain protected within the restructured scheme.  I find his evidence to the contrary to be unimpressive.  I find his account of their relationship and her enthusiasm for the scheme and the purchase of Westbourne Terrace to be overlaid with a superficial gloss which fails entirely to acknowledge the underlying reality of their lives at that time.  The applicant&#8217;s account of &#8220;walking on eggshells&#8221; throughout this period and trying to contain the respondent&#8217;s volatile temperament is lent considerable support by the finding of District Judge Gibson that the first incident of violence perpetrated by the respondent against the applicant took place a matter of weeks after they completed the purchase of Westbourne Terrace.  On that occasion, and at a time when she was seven months pregnant, he pushed her violently to the floor, pressed the sole of his shoe against her cheek and threatened her with a baseball bat.</p>

I have already found that there was no merging or &#8216;pooling&#8217; of their interests prior to that date.  The applicant was the sole legal and beneficial owner of Falcon House and Rutland Gate at the time Westbourne Terrace was acquired.  A finding that their interests in the latter followed and reflected their respective contributions into the financial restructuring scheme is the inevitable consequence of my acceptance that the respondent had agreed to protect within the scheme the equity which the applicant was introducing by way of security for the Bank.  Even if I am wrong to infer that was their joint intention (which I do not believe I am), then the evidence &#8211; in my judgment &#8211; supports the imputation of such an intention by the court (whether expressed as an intention, or an agreement, arrangement or understanding between them).  In these circumstances, the presumption of shared beneficial ownership in equal proportions is displaced.</p>

Their occupation of the property as a home was relatively short-lived in any event and the default in the mortgage conditions was precipitated after only a few short months when the entire scheme collapsed.  Even if I am wrong about the inference or imputation which I have drawn in relation to their intentions at the time (which, again, I do not believe I am on the basis of the totality of the evidence), I would nevertheless consider this apportionment of the beneficial interest in Westbourne Terrace to be a fair outcome.  I remind myself about what was said by Tomlinson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Graham-York v York &amp; Others</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/72" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 72" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 72</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] 1 FLR 407" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] 1 FLR 407</ref> at para 22.

It is essential, in my judgment, to bear in mind that, in deciding in such a case what shares are fair, the court is not concerned with some form of redistributive justice.  Thus it is irrelevant that it may be thought a &#8220;fair&#8221; outcome for a woman who has endured years of abusive conduct by her partner to be allotted a substantial interest in his property on his death.  The plight of Miss Graham-York attracts sympathy, but it does not enable the court to redistribute property interests in a manner which right-minded people might think amounts to appropriate compensation.  Miss Graham-York is &#8220;entitled to that share which the court considers fair having regard to the whole course of dealing between them <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">in relation to the property</span>&#8221;.

The respondent obviously feels keenly that he will be financially disadvantaged by the outcome proposed by the applicant.  Financial disadvantage and an attempt to ameliorate any perception of the same by a largely discretionary process of readjustment are not factors which can, or should, have any bearing on outcome in this case as a matter of law.  I would still have been obliged to follow a route to an outcome based upon the whole course of their dealings in relation to the acquisition of the property at Westbourne Terrace and that route, based upon my findings, would have led me to apportion their interests as to 82% to the applicant and 18% to the respondent.</p>

The respondent contends that this was spent on repainting the entire flat at the commencement of the tenancy.  He says that the applicant was fully aware of this expenditure and the need for the work to be completed.  When pressed on the cost of the work in the course of cross-examination, the respondent was not able to provide any exact figures as to cost and Mr Pointer invited me to proceed on the basis that the work is unlikely to have cost as much as &#163;10,500.  I have no reliable evidence as to what was spent; equally, I have no evidence that any balance not spent on the work was &#8220;misappropriated&#8221; by the respondent.

The respondent&#8217;s evidence was that he had retained these funds to make good the damage which she had caused during the period of her occupation.  He was challenged in cross-examination about an email he had written to the letting agents in November 2013 in which he had promised to return the full deposit to the tenant.  It emerged from his oral evidence that he had in fact spent the money and part had gone to meet the cost of a three week holiday which the family had taken together.  He has offered to indemnify the applicant in respect of any liability for this sum in the context of any remaining dispute between him and the former tenant.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I hope and expect that the draft order which was put before the court can now provide the framework for moving matters forward in terms of the steps which will need to be put in place in order to discharge the liability due to the Bank in an orderly manner and thereby avoid any action by the receivers.  Arrangements will need to be made in relation to the date upon which the respondent is to vacate Westbourne Terrace and, if this is not agreed, I will deal with the matter either on paper or by way of further submissions.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I propose to leave it to the parties to liaise as necessary with my clerk.  In the event that a short hearing is necessary to finalise the order, and because I am due to start a case which will absorb the remainder of this term, I will be prepared to list the case at 9.30am on a date before the end of this term convenient to the applicant&#8217;s legal team and the respondent.   It may well be that the Bank and/or WC Limited will wish to make short submissions on that occasion.</p>
