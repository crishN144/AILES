Z is the only child of X and Y, the first and second respondents to these proceedings.   Z is presently living in the full-time care of his mother in a supported living placement.  He is having contact with his father on a regular basis, although it is right to record at the outset that those contact arrangements have not been without their difficulties.  An important headnote to this judgment, and one which I record at the outset, is that it is no part of the local authority&#8217;s case that Z should be removed from the care of either of his natural parents.  The care plan for Z is that he will remain living with his mother during his minority in a fully supported placement which meets all of their particular needs whilst maintaining his ongoing relationship with his father.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">The facts which lie at the heart of this application, in their current presentation, are highly unusual, if not unique.  The statutory obligations imposed on the local authority in terms of the duty of care which it owes to Z have presented some very significant challenges.  The forensic process has itself thrown up challenges which have had to be carefully managed at every turn in order to accommodate the particular needs of Z&#8217;s mother who, for a number of reasons, has very particular vulnerabilities in the context of this litigation.  She was born profoundly deaf to impoverished parents and has had no formal or recognisable speech whatsoever since her birth.  The circumstances of her early life meant that she did not receive even basic or rudimentary help and assistance to come to terms with these difficulties and her interaction with the wider world around her.   She has clearly formulated basic coping strategies which she has developed over the years in order to function in an adult world where hearing and speech are the very essence of communication.  Y told me that over the years they had together developed an informal means of communicating with one another which enabled the process </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0in">of daily life to continue.  He has also given me examples of instances where X has displayed intelligence and problem-solving skills.  She clearly has both a sense and a memory of place and understands the day to day realities of her life as it is lived with Z.  She is presently taking care of all his day to day needs and there are no immediate concerns in relation to the care which she is providing with support from those who live with her in the shared placement.  For reasons which will become apparent, she is represented in these proceedings by the Official Solicitor following a finding that she lacks litigation capacity.   </p>

They were initially identified as professional experts who would be most likely to be in a position to assist the court in terms of its understanding of X&#8217; ability to communicate generally and in order to ascertain her wishes and feelings in the context of establishing the facts and making welfare decisions for her own and Z&#8217;s future.  I shall return to the substance of their evidence in due course.  What is very clear to me is that over the course of this litigation, and with the benefit of all the professional assistance she has been receiving since the onset of these proceedings, her ability to communicate and make herself understood has improved significantly.  The picture of the woman which emerges from the early reports when this litigation commenced at the beginning of 2017 is very different from that which emerged during the course of the oral evidence which I heard during the final hearing.  </p>

They married outside of the UK in January 2013.  This was a third marriage for Y who has two adult children from his first marriage which lasted some twenty odd years.  When that marriage broke down, he met his second wife whilst on business abroad.  With the demise of his second marriage after some eighteen years, he travelled to </p>

According to the account which Y gave to an independent social worker who carried out an early parenting assessment, at the time they met, X was working casually &#8220;on the streets&#8221; carrying out menial tasks such as collecting rubbish.  He has subsequently given me an account of her mother having &#8220;sold&#8221; her when she was a teenager.  She was apparently sent off to work in the country&#8217;s capital city as a domestic servant and her mother was paid US$14 per month for her daughter&#8217;s services.  It was on any view a desperate existence.  At that stage X could neither speak nor hear although it appears that she was able to communicate through a mobile telephone by dialling numbers and using vibrations from the phone.  Y accepts that he was distressed at the demise of his second marriage.  He accepts that he had almost financial security at this point in his life having just settled the claims of his second wife.   </p>

Z was born outside of the UK in March 2013.  At that time the family appears to have been living a somewhat peripatetic lifestyle.  Over the next four years they lived on different yachts moored at a local yacht club.  Y had enjoyed a professional career in engineering over a number of years.  Following the start of his relationship with X, it seems that he was earning a living cruising and carrying out various yacht repairs based in and around a yacht club.   </p>

He put in place various arrangements to help X with her communication issues.  He enlisted local help in order to teach her rudimentary reading skills.  He took her to a hospital to see what could be done about her hearing. The family eventually moved to England in 2015 and set up home in accommodation lent to them by a friend.  Y planned to set up a takeaway restaurant in which X was to do the cooking.  For these purposes he secured some local premises which he was converting.

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0in">March 2017, this young mother presented at Z&#8217;s nursery school exhibiting symptoms of physical pain and distress.  She could not properly articulate or verbalise her predicament because she did not have the means of communication to do so.  Nevertheless, it was clear to the nursery worker who met her at the nursery school on that morning that she was in a significant amount of physical discomfort.  She was &#8220;hobbling&#8221;, holding her back and was observed to be supporting herself up the sloping path to the nursery school entrance by holding the side wall which ran alongside.  When offered a seat inside the school, X was plainly distressed and visibly crying.  She was asked if someone had hurt her and she made a series of gestures as if she was punching a static ball.  She was pulling at her coat and pushing her arm behind her back.  She showed the nursery worker a picture of Y on her mobile telephone and appeared to be gesturing that he had been drinking.  The photograph on her mobile telephone appeared to show Y asleep or unconscious on a bed.  Without any spoken word, she was making various gestures to indicate what the nursery worker interpreted to be &#8220;shouting, pulling of clothes, fighting and drinking&#8221;.   I heard oral evidence from the nursery worker who observed all of this.  She made a contemporaneous written account at the time and she came to court to speak to that account.  Insofar as she was accurately describing to me what she observed on that occasion, I have no reason at all to doubt what she told me.  There were at that stage no extant proceedings involving Z or this family.  There were no &#8216;red flags&#8217; which might have given rise to any concerns or caused the nursery school to watch for any such signs.  The nursery worker told me that she saw X often when she brought Z to school and she would greet her just as she would any other parent. </p>

It is the accuracy of that narrative which lies at the heart of this case since Y has been consistent in his denial of any mistreatment of his wife, </p>

Miss Abigail Bond has represented her since the end of 2018.  Mr Simon Green has appeared for the local authority and Mr Hugh Cornford for Z&#8217;s Guardian.      </p>

Throughout, he has been entitled to public funding which would have enabled him to instruct both a solicitor and barrister to represent his interests in court.  Whilst I understand that he did have some advice from a solicitor in the very early stages of the litigation, he has chosen to represent himself with the assistance of a McKenzie Friend.   </p>

I have accorded him a significant measure of latitude given what is at stake and his obvious focus on securing the future of his family unit.  Even when it became apparent that the local authority was not seeking to remove Z from the care of his mother or to prevent ongoing contact between Z and his father, Y has been unrelenting in his condemnation of the manner in which the local authority has brought its case and my conduct of its progress towards this final hearing. </p>

He has repeatedly demanded that meetings be set up so that she can make her position clear and properly consider the options for ongoing family life with Z whether that is lived by his parents separately or together.  He has made it plain that he does not think that X is capable of looking after Z safely even within the confines of the supported living placement where she has now settled.  He has accused the local authority of deliberately depriving X of her liberty and controlling her movements so as to prevent contact with him, his McKenzie Friend and wife, and other former friends and acquaintances who knew the family before March 2017.  These accusations have continued throughout despite the fact that X has been free to leave her home in the supported living placement and to go about her daily life without any apparent restriction, knowing full well how she can make contact with Y if that is what she chooses to do.  His case has alternately been put on the basis that Z should return to live with him in order that they can devise a means of co-parenting Z or, most recently in the weeks leading up to this hearing, that the whole family should relocate back to X&#8217;s country of origin at the expense of the local authority where X can decide whether she wishes to live with him and Z with the support of her family or separately.  That has been his case since he travelled out to X&#8217;s country of origin in the later stages of this litigation in order to secure from the maternal family a &#8216;power of attorney&#8217; to act on their behalf in these proceedings.   </p>

In particular he has referred to the practice of &#8216;organ harvesting&#8217; by wealthy individuals in need of transplant operations.

He has had no confidence that the local authority has been acting in Z&#8217;s best interests.  He has seen its stance throughout as being driven by basic human prejudice and an unwillingness to accept that neither the age difference between them nor X&#8217;s obvious disability at the time of their marriage should give rise to any concern. </p>

He has refused all such invitations.  His response to my refusal to endorse his witness template (which included both me and Lord Justice Peter Jackson within the list of witnesses he wished to cross-examine) was a request that I recuse myself from further involvement in the case on the basis of &#8216;criminal judicial bias&#8217;.     </p>

His litigation conduct has certainly not assisted the progress of the forensic enquiry which has been ongoing in this case in order to make decisions in Z&#8217;s best interests.   Whilst he attended court for the first day of the final hearing with his McKenzie friend, Y soon made it plain that he did not, and would not, recognise any decisions made in relation to Z&#8217;s future.  He declined to take any further part in the proceedings and left the court building.  He made it clear that he did not intend to submit himself for cross-examination and did not wish to ask any questions of the witnesses from whom I was due to hear.  I declined to adjourn the proceedings and thus I did not have the benefit of hearing directly from Y who had made it plain that he was not going to participate further even in the face of committal proceedings.  I was unwilling to take steps which would inevitably have led to further delay for this child and, with the agreement of all parties, I continued with the hearing.  I am satisfied that, in Y&#8217;s absence, any relevant or material questions which he might have put to the various witnesses were asked.  In the main, Mr Cornford on behalf of the Guardian took the lead in this respect but I asked several questions myself of various witnesses, including Dr Austen and X&#8217;s social worker, the professional who probably knew her best in terms of the time she had spent with her. </p>

That appearance was in the context of enabling the court to take the next steps in this difficult litigation.  Clearly, it has not been considered appropriate by any of the parties for X to attend hearings in person.  She has been found to lack litigation capacity.  In the context of enabling the court and the parties to understand what, if any, reliance could be placed on X&#8217;s communications about what had happened to her and her wishes for the future, Dr Austen was charged with the responsibility for conducting a supported interview which was video-recorded.  Following the release of the discs and transcripts, a hearing was convened and, over the course of a full day,  Dr Austen gave oral evidence which effectively took the court through the bespoke process she had adopted, highlighted aspects of the interview with X which she considered were important, and answered the questions which were put to her by all three counsel and by Y.  I have a transcript of her evidence within the material in the court bundles.  Thus, whilst Y did not take up the opportunity to crossexamine Dr Austen or to challenge her evidence during her second appearance before this court, he did have the opportunity to ask her questions and to put his case on 29 June last year. </p>

It is quite right to record that I had expressed reservations about the extent to which X&#8217;s responses, and Dr Austen&#8217;s interpretation of those responses, might properly stand as a form of direct oral testimony from her. If the State is to assume powers to intervene in the private family life of X and Y in terms of the way their collective Article 8 rights are exercised and enjoyed, there must be a proper evidential basis for doing so.  If the local authority is right in its contention that interference with those rights is justified on the basis of child protection issues in a wider and ongoing context, the court can only proceed on the basis of facts which it finds to be established on the balance of probabilities.  Once such a fact is proved, this court will treat that fact as established and future decisions concerning Z&#8217;s care will be based on that, or those, findings.  If the local authority fails to prove a fact on which it is relying, the court will disregard that allegation completely. </p>

I have also given myself a specific direction that a witness may choose not to tell the truth for a number of reasons.  These can include shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear for the repercussions and distress.

I stressed to him that, notwithstanding his conduct of this litigation and the disrespect which he had shown to me and the court process, I was prepared to listen to him in the context of the arrangements which I was being asked to consider for Z.

In circumstances where X does not wish to share a home with him in future, he would wish to care for Z himself although he would want Z to see as much of his mother as possible under some (as yet undefined) co-parenting arrangement.  Crucially, he wishes to end all future involvement of the local authority in Z&#8217;s upbringing.  He regards their actions to date as having unnecessarily fractured Z&#8217;s home life just as he regards the local authority as having wrongly prevented X from exercising her rights to a private family life with him and their son.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">At an earlier stage of these proceedings when the matter was before The Circuit Judge, the local authority sought permission to withdraw its application for public law orders.  They did so because the only evidence which was then available was the &#8216;Widget&#8217; statement which was obtained during X&#8217;s initial interview with the police on the day after her presentation at Z&#8217;s nursery school in March 2017.   The court had subsequently given permission for the instruction of Dr C, a specialist clinical psychologist with an expertise in dealing with the deaf.  He filed two reports in March and July 2018 which went to both X&#8217;s litigation capacity and her understanding and communication skills.  He assessed her cognitive ability as lying within the first centile.  In other words, 99% of people of her age would perform better cognitively.  This placed her at that stage in the &#8216;mild mental retardation&#8217; category of the ICD-10 although her memory for visuospatial stimuli was in the low average range.  This, he concluded, was the result of severe language deprivation.  He was of the opinion that all the aids to communication (including Makaton, drawing, BSL, Widgit symbols, objects of reference and role play) had the potential to enable effective communication with her provided that focus of that communication was about mutually familiar concepts.  What he felt was lacking in X in this case was a sufficiently developed inner language, or sense of what language is for, to enable her to communicate about abstract possibilities or hypothesis in the future. </p>

In this context, he was clear that she lacked <span style="font-style:italic">litigation </span>capacity and required separate representation through a litigation friend, which role the Official Solicitor has since assumed. </p>

It addressed a number of written questions which had been put to him following receipt of his mainframe report.  In terms of how X might be helped or facilitated to answer questions, he made the following key points.  First, her capacity to respond depended on the questions which were asked of her.  He was firmly of the view that giving evidence live in a court room setting would be &#8220;extremely problematic&#8221; unless the questions were &#8220;extremely concrete and accessibly presented&#8221;.  Secondly, he thought that some questions were best posed outside of court before any relevant hearing.  His addendum report suggested a number of ways in which such a process might be achieved. </p>

When shown pictures of her mother and sister she was able to comment on how they had changed and to show consistent pleasure on her face and in her body language.  Under such conditions, she expresses plausible chronology (such as the places she has lived, the year she moved, and retains a reliable order of events).  Once in a flow of expression, more word/signs or pictures can be dropped in to steer her to give further detail. </p>

She told me that the process itself, including contextualising her questions throughout for the individual she was seeking to engage, was a process which she frequently deployed in the course of her practice when she was gathering information from a patient who had limited communication skills.  Dr Austen made frequent and regular use of tools during the time she spent with X, such as photographs and 3D figures such as teddies/dolls with photographs of faces of people known to X stuck on to them.  She acknowledged that determining whether or not the answers were true was a matter for me and she appreciated that her function was to report to me as accurately as she could what X had intended to convey through her communication.  I have watched the DVD recordings of what took place during that meeting on three separate occasions and what is clear to me is that much of the context of X&#8217;s responses to Dr Austen comes from the body language she was displaying when signing her answers.  I observed some clear and obvious demonstrations of body language, gesture and emotion which told me much about what X was experiencing as she responded to the different topics which were raised with her.  Dr Austen&#8217;s professional observations in this respect coincide with my own.  She put it in this way: </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.53in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;So, for example, any time that X is talking about [Z], there&#8217;s a warmth and a humour. &#8220;Oh, he likes football&#8221;, and &#8220;boys will be boys&#8221; and, you know, that sort of body language where you can see a sort of &#8211; a happy warmth.  There is another set of body language where X is commenting on Y where there is a lot of twisting to one side in a body language that is quite painful.  There are a few bits coming forward in an aggressive form but there is an angst that is very different to when she is describing [Z] and then there is a third set of body language that I think is important around her family where, shown the pictures, she is open, she is sitting forward, she is looking at them, making comments about them and then when I introduce the toy that I have used, the figure that is her mother, there is a genuine sadness and she takes the doll and holds it and cries and turns away in a sort of almost slightly ashamed to be crying way.  She stays looking at her mother&#8217;s picture.  I felt that my job as an expert in sign language and clinical psychology was to facilitate a series of conversations or body languages in X that other people could understand.&#8221; </p>

Validity means would you and I or X be talking about the same thing.  Have we got a shared understanding, a shared context ?  Reliability is if I think I&#8217;ve got it and I have got that shared validity &#8230; On the topics that I have answered &#8230; by coming back to questions, by comparing them to previous discussions, I was able to say on those, not all of them, but on the ones I managed &#8230;. I felt I had validity and reliability, that the bits I commented on we were definitely talking on the same topic and the answer that X was giving me was the same answer.&#8221; </p>

He put two particular examples to her by way of illustration.  The first was an occasion whilst they were living abroad on their yacht talking to another yacht owner.  He had shown them an advertisement or picture in a magazine relating to a repair yard which he wished to visit.  X had signed to indicate that she knew where this yard was.  </p>

He told me that she had only been on this road once before, some six months before.  Dr Austen acknowledged that X had better visual and memory skills than language skills.  She thought the episode described by Y was entirely possible.  Significantly, she acknowledged that we were likely to find other &#8220;islands of ability&#8221; as her cognitive function improved with professional support.  In similar vein, she accepted that another of Y&#8217;s examples might well have been within X&#8217;s competence and ability.  He had described how she had assisted him to develop a vacuum process to remove water from the hulls of fibreglass boats. This she had achieved by drawing on a piece of paper the need to ensure that the air which went back into the hulls was dried and all moisture extracted before it was pumped back into the hulls.  He stressed to me during the June 2019 hearing that this was an important example of her ability to think and weigh matters because he continues to maintain that he has not assaulted her physically or sexually and thus the only explanation for the narrative which she has delivered to Dr Austen through her use of sign language is some form of calculated misrepresentation of the truth.  Indeed, he went so far as to tell me that she has &#8220;a very high level of competence&#8221; and &#8220;a decision-making brain, a weighing-up brain, a calculating brain&#8221;.  He gave as a further example a situation where X had communicated to him her intention to drive a hire car which they had parked at a boatyard whilst abroad.  He had told her this was not possible because of the volume of people and traffic at the boatyard.  He subsequently discovered that she had taken the car and driven it to a nearby shower block before returning the vehicle to the place where it had been parked.  He used this as a further example of her ability to make up her own mind when she wanted to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;and she has the ability to disobey&#8221;</span>.   </p>

Dr Austen was categoric in her view that, drawing on her 28 years of professional experience, she had been left in no doubt that X had a very significant learning disability and cognitive impairment.  She remained confident that X did not have the cognitive or linguistic capacity to deliberately formulate a lie. </p>

In the context of the evidence as a whole, I also have to consider how far X&#8217;s understanding and ability to communicate has evolved in the three years since March 2017 when she first presented at Z&#8217;s nursery in apparent distress.  Y denies each and every one of the allegations against him.  It is his case that any physical aggression during the marriage was directed towards him by X.  Whilst he has not given me any sworn evidence from the witness box, he described to Dr Austen during the hearing in June 2019 an occasion when the parties were living in one country but spending some time in another country.  He maintains that he came back to their hotel room to find X engaged in sexual activity with another woman.  He says that she attacked him on this occasion and caused him to pass out by striking the back of his neck.  He accepts that there were tensions and strains in their relationship in the months leading up to their separation but he maintains this was due in part to financial worries about the business he was trying to establish for their mutual benefit and his increasing inability to satisfy her sexual needs. </p>

He asked me then to consider whether conversations about sexual assaults, money and &#8220;Y&#8221; were creating in her mind a highly distorted internal narrative which places him at the centre of a train of events which are not the reality of her recently lived experience.

She did not depart from her clear evidence that she was &#8220;very sure&#8221; that, in relation to the specific allegations of physical and sexual assault, she was being told by X about what she had experienced in an episode or episodes of physical and/or sexual assault involving Y. </p>

Y had himself confirmed during that assessment that he was drinking more at the time when his relationship with X was deteriorating.  Z&#8217;s social worker has also reported concerns about Y&#8217;s  excessive use of alcohol.  Y has since refused to undergo hair strand testing for these purposes.

First, I accept that X appears to be frightened of Y and to regard him as someone who is in a position to exert power and influence over her.  Whilst I cannot extract from her narrative a coherent account of what may or may not have happened on an occasion or occasions when other third parties were present, I am satisfied that she has described an occasion or occasions when he has made sexual demands of her in circumstances where she has been an unwilling partner.  I am further satisfied that he has displayed anger towards her and that his actions are likely to have been influenced in part by excessive consumption of alcohol on these occasions. </p>

What emerged from this evidence was a picture of a warm and socially open woman who took care of most of the aspects of Z&#8217;s school life, who travelled quite freely on buses to get around her local neighbourhood, who travelled unaccompanied to the shops, and who is able to use her computer and access the internet through sites such as Google and Google Maps.

When she has a particular knowledge or experience of something, she can now relate that experience to others through her use of sign language.  What she is not able to do is to conceptualise circumstances and events outside of the context of a real lived experience.

She would circle both fingers around the sides of her head to indicate he would appear &#8220;crazy&#8221; after these episodes of drinking and recounted an occasion or occasions when he tripped over a door or clothes left on the floor before falling onto the floor.   </p>

At the outset, Y had pointed to Z&#8217;s social worker&#8217;s wedding ring and then pulled off her own wedding ring which she has not worn since.  She had also raised her hand to her mouth to demonstrate someone drinking before hitting herself on her upper torso and leg with her fists.  This all came in the context of being shown a photograph of Y.  She repeated these demonstrations to Z&#8217;s social worker on four subsequent visits.  The social worker is quite clear through the course of her relationship with X that she has not wished to return to live with her husband although she has cared consistently for Z through several placement moves. </p>

X&#8217;s social worker agreed that for X  this would be a complex concept because it would involve an understanding of the impact of her language on others and this is not yet part of her communication skills or language.  She is easily able to communicate her own feelings in the context of past events such as worry, fright or feeling sad. However, X&#8217;s social worker&#8217;s evidence was that whilst she could not categorically say that X was incapable of lying, she believes a deliberate manipulation of the truth would be very difficult for her.  What she is clear about is what she wants for herself and Z in terms of their own lives.  She wants to live where she is, for her son to continue with his schooling here and to visit her family, but on the basis she will return to a home in England. </p>

Despite having both a tablet and a mobile telephone at her disposal, she has not once sought to make any contact with Y .

In order to address the issues raised in the context of X&#8217;s recent progress, she had been shown a transcript of the evidence which I heard the previous day from X&#8217;s social worker.  Dr Austen told me that she was not entirely surprised to see the significant improvement in her communication abilities.  She had anticipated that her skills might evolve over time with the right professional input and support.  She saw that improvement as likely to have occurred in both her communication skills and probably in her IQ score.  She was clear that both X and Z would need ongoing support both from the Deaf CAMHS team and those supporting the BSL lessons.  Dr Austen saw her own role with the family as an evolving one.  She agreed with X&#8217;s social worker that X&#8217;s internal comprehension was now much better when it was linked, or referenced, to her actual experience. </p>

Dr Austen clearly took pleasure in the progress which had been made when she was shown the notes which X had recently written in relation to the family friends.  She remained of the view that X did not have full litigation capacity and would continue to need support with her parenting through the resources which were being provided but Dr Austen remained clear about the answers and responses she had received from X during her interview process.  She was asked about the near contemporaneous &#8216;Widget&#8217; statement which X had given to the police in the immediate aftermath of the events in March 2017.  Dr Austen was initially highly sceptical about the reliance (if any) which could be placed on that statement.  However, during her evidence at the final hearing she told me that this piece of evidence should not be discounted altogether as part of the broader emerging picture as it has evolved through the similar accounts which X  has now given to many others.  She told me that there were similarities in the manner and methodology in which the information had been communicated by X on both occasions.  Just as she had tailored the bespoke process of her own interview in a &#8216;gestural, role-modelled&#8217; way to elicit spontaneous responses from X, so too had the police attempted to record through their process the information which they believed she was attempting to communicate.  In Dr Austen&#8217;s view the fact that X had made many similar reports to others gave an important consistency to her narrative.    </p>

The purpose of that rule is to maximise the potential reliability of any evidence a party is capable of giving whilst providing adequate protection for that party&#8217;s particular vulnerabilities.  Having carefully considered the expert evidence of both Drs C and Austen, I was persuaded, and remain persuaded, that she could not have given any reliable evidence were she simply to have been called to the witness box in the usual way.  It was for this reason that, with the consent of all parties including Y, I sanctioned the bespoke interview process which was carried out by a highly experienced professional whose qualifications and particular experience of working in this field over nearly thirty years made her uniquely placed to undertake the task. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">In terms of the reliability of the account she was able to give through that process, I bear in mind a number of factors.  The first is that I am fully aware that Y did not, and does not, repose any confidence in the court to deal fairly and justly with the allegations which are made against him by X.  When I refused his recusal application, he made it plain he was not going to take any further part in these proceedings.   It was a great shame that he chose to absent himself because he has not heard at first hand much of the evidence which I have recorded in my judgment.  His principal quarrel is with Dr Austen and her conclusions but I remind myself that his absence from the final hearing did not deprive him of his opportunity to test that evidence in cross-examination.  He had that opportunity during her first appearance in June 2019 and he took full advantage on that occasion of asking her a great many questions for much of that two day hearing.  The verbatim record of that cross-examination is reflected in the written transcript which is within the material before the court. </p>

I do not draw that inference as a direct consequence of his failure to give evidence.  Rather, it is but another piece of the wide canvas of factors and evidence from which I must stand back in my global survey of all the material I have available and from which I must make my decisions.  His failure to give evidence is certainly consistent with his general attitude to this litigation and his refusal to engage in a number of its aspects.  Following the two day hearing in June 2019, I directed that there should be a further parenting assessment of Y by an independent social worker.  He was to be fully involved in the choice of expert and I further directed that he would be excused from any obligation to contribute to the costs of that report.  I stressed to him at the time that it was essential that he cooperated with that assessment if I was to take any further his wish to care for Z at the conclusion of these proceedings.  </p>

When he indicated a preference to submit to the court the results of monthly alcohol tests which his general practitioner would carry out, I afforded him this option.  He has never filed any such reports.   He has refused to seek legal advice and support preferring throughout to conduct his own case in a manner which, as I have said, has made this a much more challenging piece of litigation for all the professionals involved.  He has made various threats against the social workers involved in the case and the local authority more generally.  It is only right that I record in my judgment their professional responses to much of the material which he has circulated during the currency of these proceedings.  </p>

He sees the &#8216;removal&#8217; of X and Z from the family home by the local authority as a fundamental violation of his, and their, Article 8 rights.  He sees this final hearing and the fact-finding enquiry on which I am embarked as a breach of his Article 6 rights.  As I have already noted in this judgment, I have given Y throughout every possible opportunity to participate in the process of determining his son&#8217;s future and the optimum arrangements for his care and upbringing.  He has refused to answer any questions in cross-examination and there is no statement of truth on any of the material with which he has deluged the court and the parties.  His approach to the various outcomes for Z has been inconsistent and, most recently, entirely at odds with his initial presentation.  I shall need to come on to consider his position in terms of the welfare aspects of this case at a later stage.  Nevertheless, I am charged with ensuring a just and fair hearing of all these matters not only for Y but also for X and Z.  In this context, Y&#8217;s abject refusal to assist this court by subjecting himself to questions from their representatives and the local authority can only be seen as an attempt on his part to distance himself as far as possible from any adverse findings and to obscure so far as possible the forensic transparency of the factfinding process. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">One of the findings sought by the local authority is that X lacks the sophistication of internal language and functional language skill.  As a result, she is said to be incapable of lying.  That finding finds its reflection in the clear evidence I heard from Dr Austen.  In this context I have to bear in mind the very significant progress which X has made in terms of her BSL signing abilities and communication skills.  Nevertheless, it remains the clear view of both X&#8217;s social worker and Dr Austen that the process of manipulating an account of specific events and experiences so as to present a misleading narrative remains outside her cognitive functioning and use of language.  To the extent that it is necessary, I have been guided by Dr Austen&#8217;s expert opinion since she has a wealth of professional experience which I do not.  That said, I have reached my own conclusions as to where the truth is likely to lie by an holistic examination of <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>the evidence which is available to me.  What I can be clear about is that, whatever improvement there may have been in X&#8217;s ability to communicate, her descriptive accounts communicated in the only means she knows, have been consistent and given to many of those involved in one way or another in this litigation.  That, in my judgment, is an important factor which I have to bear well in mind.  Those accounts originated from her first presentation at Z&#8217;s nursery school in March 2017 and they have not changed in their various iterations since.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">I remind myself again that this litigation commenced because of the manner in which X presented when she arrived to collect Z from nursery school on 13 March 2017.  The nursery worker made a contemporaneous written account of events and came to court to give evidence at the final hearing.  This is a firsthand account from a witness who observed X and who had no reason to fabricate or exaggerate what she saw.  There were no visible cuts or bruises observed on that occasion but the graphic description and vivid demonstration she gave me leaves me in no reasonable doubt that this lady was in pain and exhibiting distress.  I accept that the nursery worker observed a woman who was &#8220;hobbling along &#8230; looking really uncomfortable &#8230; and struggling&#8221;.  Further, the demonstration which X herself gave to the nursery worker in her attempt to communicate what had happened to her in terms of having been hit, having her clothes pulled and Y&#8217;s drinking in that context appears to be an uncontaminated account of what the nursery worker actually saw.  Her clear memory of these events coincides with her contemporaneous written notes and she has no conceivable reason to mislead this court in relation to them.   There is no evidence before the court to suggest that X sustained an accident on that day whether in the home or anywhere else.  I am not suggesting for one moment that it is incumbent on Y to provide an alternative explanation for her presentation on that day but the absence of any report of a prior accidental injury is part of the forensic fabric which I have to examine carefully in the context of the totality of the evidence which is before the court. </p>

She contextualises those feelings of fear, which I accept she has experienced, around alcohol and anger.

In particular, I have the clearest recollection of that part of Dr Austen&#8217;s evidence when she demonstrated how insistent X was on ensuring that a particular point she wished to make had been understood.  She became physically and emotionally engaged with Dr Austen; her whole posture and body language changed as she sought to establish eye contact before signing and demonstrating what she wished to convey.

Dr Austen has immense experience of working with communication-disabled individuals.  Despite the early challenges which X presented, she was left in no doubt at all as a professional that she had understood that which X was seeking to convey in relation to physical and sexual assaults perpetrated by Y.   She was asked more than once about this.  On each occasion she said she was &#8220;very sure&#8221; that X had given her a number of accounts of physical and sexual abuse. </p>

I find it is more likely than not that this has been a course of conduct rather than an isolated incident which occurred shortly before her presentation at the school on 13 March 2017.  I find that his excessive consumption of alcohol in the months leading up to their separation on that date may well have had a part to play in triggering his aggression and provoking the assaults but that factor can never excuse his behaviour.  As a vulnerable woman, X was less able than others to protect herself and Z within the home they shared and I reject entirely the suggestion made by Y that it was he who was the victim of his wife&#8217;s alleged assault or assaults. </p>

Y has resisted my description of him as an arrogant man in terms of his approach to his lack of representation and his ability to run this complex case himself.  He has been keen at every turn in his written and oral submissions to the court and others to stress his professional qualifications and his experience as a man of the world in terms of his business connections.  I find it difficult to understand why a man would deem it appropriate in this day and age to denigrate his wife as a failed housekeeper.  Whilst I do not place undue or inappropriate weight on that particular allegation, it tells me much about the dynamics of their personal relationship </p>

His schedule also provides solid corroboration for the description which X has given to Dr Austen of her attempts to leave the family home and Y&#8217;s attempts to prevent that happening.  It begs the question: why was she so anxious to remove herself from his sphere of influence if she was part of a family household which was focused on Z and his best interests?  She has plainly had strong maternal instincts throughout the local authority&#8217;s involvement with the family; that is attested to by several of the social workers and the shared lives carers with whom she has lived for the last three years and more. </p>

I cannot be any more specific about exactly what happened on these occasions but I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities both from what she herself has said, from Y&#8217;s own allegations against her, and from the presence on the door of the bolt that something of this nature occurred.  Her account to Dr Austen certainly reinforces what she has communicated on several occasions and that is her wish to live separately and apart from Y </p>

It is a small and slightly chaotic room in which there are piles of papers and numerous books along with a computer screen, Z&#8217;s toys and &#8216;Mister Man&#8217; books and the personal items of day to day life.  Its general layout is not unlike a large cabin on a boat.  Given the years which this family spent living on boats, this is perhaps a living arrangement with which they were used.  The point is that Z&#8217;s bunk bed is situated directly above the double bunk which was used by X and Y.  He would have been sleeping but three or four feet above them on a regular basis.  </p>

It seems to me unlikely that the opportunity to participate in intimate relations was restricted by [Y] in the manner he suggested to those occasions when he and [X] could use the bedroom in the main house.  I think it is far more likely that, whether or not after consuming alcohol to excess, he sought sexual gratification from his wife whilst in their own bedroom in the barn.  This appears to have been X&#8217;s experience and, as I have said, her husband has declined to enter the witness box to give the court his own account.  On balance, I am persuaded that it is more likely than not that Z was present on occasions when his mother was harmed by his father both physically and sexually. </p>

The loal authority has secured a commitment from its senior team manager that it will continue to fund this placement until Z achieves his majority at the age of 18 years.  In the absence of a care order, his intention would be to maintain that same financial commitment although he can offer no guarantees were Z not a child in respect of whom the same statutory obligations arose.  In terms of Z&#8217;s ongoing contact with Y, the local authority&#8217;s position remains as it was before he absented himself from the final hearing.

My specific findings in relation to the harm inflicted on Z&#8217;s mother by his father and Z&#8217;s own proximity to those incidents have been reached from the foot of all of the evidence which is now available to the court.  I am entirely persuaded that Z was indeed suffering harm as at March 2017 and that such harm was attributable to the care being given to him if an order was not made not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give him.  This has been a challenging case for all the reasons I have explained and the evidence gathering which has been ongoing throughout has informed my conclusions in relation to the state of affairs which existed within Z&#8217;s home as at the date when those proceedings were initiated.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">For reasons outwith her own control, X was unable to provide the care Z required without significant support in the household in which she was living.  Far from receiving that support, she was, as I have found, living in a home where, for at least several months, she was the victim of domestic abuse.  Y was the perpetrator of that abuse.  In that environment, Z was suffering, and likely to continue to suffer, significant harm.  Pursuant to the interim care order which was made by the Circuit Judge, both Z and his mother were removed from that environment.  All the evidence now points to a situation where Z is flourishing both at home and at school.  I am satisfied that, had that removal not taken place, there was a real possibility of serious harm which could not be sensibly ignored having regard to the gravity of the emotional and psychological harm to which Z was exposed when the local authority became involved with this family.  Y&#8217;s attitude to this litigation throughout and the wholly unjustified allegations he has made about his wife and others convinces me that he lacks the insight to understand how his behaviour has impacted both X and Z.  I do not consider that there were any interventions which this local authority could have made either at the time or since which would have made that home a safe environment for Z or his mother given the very particular circumstances of this case.  In this context, whilst I accept that their intervention was an interference with Y&#8217;s Article 8 rights to a family life, it was an entirely proportionate interference having regard to the competing rights of both X and Z in terms of this child&#8217;s need for protection.  Z&#8217;s best interests remain the court&#8217;s paramount consideration but I bear well in mind that those best interests include his right to be brought up by his natural parents. </p>

The Official Solicitor recognises that the care plan is entirely on all fours with the principle of &#8216;parenting with support&#8217; because of any particular needs of deficiencies in their own specific ability to care properly for a child: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re D (No 3) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2016/1" uk:canonical="[2016] EWFC 1" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWFC 1</ref> at para 152.  In this context I accept that the local authority has recognised the close bond which exists between Z and each of his parents.  It has acknowledged her ability effectively to parent Z with the support which has been put in place.  She, for her part, has adopted wholeheartedly the need for that support and is engaging fully with it in terms of Z&#8217;s needs in his day to day life.  As X&#8217;s social worker was able to demonstrate to me so graphically during the course of her oral evidence to the court, X&#8217;s abilities in terms of her capacity to communicate effectively appears to be on an increasingly steep upward trajectory with the help and support she is receiving.  Like Dr Austen, I share the hope that these &#8216;islands of ability&#8217; will expand significantly in the future.  What is not in doubt is that she is currently providing effective and loving parenting with the support which she has and that Z is securely attached to her and wishes to remain with her.  The counterbalance in terms of his ongoing relationship with is father is the local authority&#8217;s recognition that there will be regular ongoing contact between Z and Y.  As matters stand, and because of his failure to engage with the parenting assessment which I directed, Y represents an unassessed risk in terms of contact arrangements.  The care order which the local authority seeks will provide a measure of flexibility in terms of these arrangements. </p>

She remains concerned about Y&#8217;s alcohol misuse in the absence of regular testing and she considers that this represents a potential risk of neglect and emotional harm for Z if left unmonitored.</p>

At other times, he has stressed to me that he does not wish to remove Z from the care of the mother he acknowledges he loves and needs. </p>

I know not how he afforded this international travel given his self-professed insolvency.   When I became aware of his latest proposals, I made it clear to Y that if he was intending to ask the court to consider this as an option for Z, he would need to file evidence about what Z and his mother&#8217;s circumstances would be in the event of a return to that country, including provision for schools and medical facilities, as well as living arrangements. </p>

A child arrangements order would mean that these parents would not have to share parental responsibility for Z with the local authority.  However, in my judgment that course would considerably weaken the protective infrastructure which the current care plan provides in terms of the maintenance and durability of the current shared lives placement which is home to X and Z.  It would remove the ability of the local authority to ensure his ongoing safety and wellbeing through regular reviews and medicals. </p>

I am entirely persuaded that she would be quite unable to navigate any contact arrangements if those had to be agreed or enforced directly or indirectly with Y.  This is a woman whom I have found to be unusually vulnerable in terms of the dynamics of her personal relationship with her husband.  Z is getting older but he is still not yet at a stage where his own wishes and feelings would be a sufficiently protective factor in the context of any private law orders.  I consider it vital for the successful maintenance of Z&#8217;s entitlement to enjoy a relationship with <span style="font-style:italic">each</span> of his parents that the local authority is given some status through shared parental responsibility in those arrangements. </p>

The social worker does not believe that X would be safe in the community on her own with Z and I share that concern.  I agree with her that she would be quite unable to manage any approach by Y without support.  I heard reports that Y has already been seen at Z&#8217;s school recording the arrival of the family friends without the school&#8217;s permission.  The social worker does not believe from her own conversations with Z that he has ever considered the option of living fulltime with his father.  She, too, speaks of the lack of insight on the part of Y to which I have already made reference in my judgment.  It is clear to me that he seeks to continue to exert some form of influence over X in relation to their ability to successfully co-parent Z.  The social worker received a call from the local Housing Officer who informed her that he had made himself homeless and was requesting new accommodation in the vicinity of where his wife and child were now living.     </p>
