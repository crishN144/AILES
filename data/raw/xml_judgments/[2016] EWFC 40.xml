	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are private law proceedings under the Children Act (CA) 1989 (as amended by the Children and Families Act (CFA) 2014) concerning two boys of dual British and Arabic heritage; A, who was born on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2012 and is three and a half years old and B, who was born on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2014 and is just over two years old; they are the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> and third respondents to these private law proceedings and are represented through their guardian. They are the sons of M (the applicant and their mother) who is English and F (the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent and their father) who is of Arabic/Egyptian heritage and is currently incarcerated and subject to a deportation order. This case was heard in Bristol Magistrates Court as F is in prison and there are no facilities or cells available at the civil and family courts in Bristol. F was originally imprisoned in 2015 after a trial in the Crown Court for breaches of court orders forbidding him from molesting M, and had completed his sentence; but he was not released as he is subjected to a deportation order.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The two boys were born in England and have always lived with their mother. B was born after M had, on her case, fled the family home for the second time because of F&#8217;s violent and controlling behaviour. She and the children now live in part of a refuge because of the continued harassment by F. M attended court on the second day of this trial to give her evidence from behind a screen. Although there were facilities for M to attend the rest the hearing by video-link she chose not to do so. M alleged that F has been violent and controlling throughout their relationship; F denies any such behaviour. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case was listed before a High Court judge for a fact-finding hearing because there were allegations that F has been &#8220;radicalised&#8221; and that he supported Islamic State (or Daesh) and that this may present an additional threat to the children in the future. Following F&#8217;s arrest M had been interviewed by the local police and her responses to questions about F had led to her being questioned by officers of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), however, when the case came before me there were no criminal proceedings pending in respect of any radicalisation or terrorism charges. Although M&#8217;s counsel, Miss Elizabeth Isaacs QC, had sought disclosure orders regarding the status of any police investigation, she was unable to identify any details, or to specify with any exactitude in a disclosure order what information she sought on M&#8217;s behalf. As the matter remained live at the outset and was pursued during the hearing, on the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016, this court made an order regarding the status of any past or present investigation seeking disclosure from the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. With the assistance of the children&#8217;s solicitor, who contacted the office of the Commissioner, the court was able to establish that, after an initial investigation there was no further action being taken by the police. I shall return to this issue later in my judgement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In February 2015 F was convicted at Crown Court after a trial by jury for the offences connected as a result of breaching protective orders made in November 2014. He continues to deny the facts which led to his conviction, however, at the preliminary hearing in May 2016, I decided that this court could properly rely on the fact of those convictions and the facts which led to them, and it was neither necessary in the interests of justice nor proportionate for those matters to be re-heard or re-tried in this court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M made an application for orders under the Children Act (CA) 1989 on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 2015, these include child arrangements orders (that the children live with her and that there is no contact ordered with F), a specific issue order (that the children are to be known by different names), a prohibited steps orders and an s91 (14) order (restricting F from making further applications to the court).</p>

Their guardian supports the application made by M for orders that will have the effect of stopping the children from having any contact with their father. The guardian also supports, on welfare grounds, applications by M to change the children&#8217;s names and to place restrictions on any further applications being made by F to the court in respect of the children. </p>

F claims that he is a Syrian national and M says he is Egyptian. The question of F&#8217;s nationality was an issue between the parties but on the evidence before the court it was not one that seemed capable of resolution, however, after the trial concluded the court received further information from the Home Office. M and F met on an Islamic dating web-site and were married in an Islamic ceremony within two months of their introduction, in London, in December 2011; and later in a civil ceremony at Chelsea Register Office on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2012. On 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2012 their first child, A, was born. In January 2013 M, F and A moved to live in a rented property, (which was in F&#8217;s sole name) on the Worlds End Estate, London. On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2013 F was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">F has been less than forthcoming about his background; indeed, he refused to discuss it with the children&#8217;s guardian. What is known is that his mother is an Egyptian and a teacher, and that she, and the children&#8217;s paternal grandfather live in Alexandria, in Egypt. F&#8217;s brother and sister also live in Egypt however throughout this trial F has claimed that he is a Syrian national. This court was not made aware of any communication from the Home Office (a request had been made under the protocol for communication between the Home Office and the court), however after the conclusion of the hearing on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016 it was brought to my attention, through my clerk, that the Family Court office in Bristol had received several emails from the Immigration Enforcement (Criminal Casework) in Croydon.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M and F married very quickly after they met (within six weeks) and A was born within three months of the civil ceremony. It is M&#8217;s case that throughout the marriage, and during the whole time that she was living with F, he was violent, abusive and controlling; she was socially isolated; F controlled the family finances; that she was not allowed to go out on her own; and, that A was present and would have been affected by the domestic abuse. It is her case that she became depressed, and as a result of this, she was prescribed medication and had referred herself to a counsellor to help her cope with her situation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During their marriage M and F had had a joint bank account, however, F had his own bank accounts into which were paid the benefit and welfare payments which he claimed and which included enhanced disability living allowance (DLA) for himself and which, he accepted in his oral evidence, he was paid, up until his imprisonment for breaches of the Family Law Act (FLA) injunctions in 2015. The evidence before this court suggests that for most of the time that he was receiving DLA the claim was fraudulent. F also received the family tax credit and the child benefit payments. M had access to the joint account but had little or no income of her own. The money that was paid into the joint account was controlled by F.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the marriage both M and F practised the Islamic faith. M had converted, she told me, after travelling abroad and being impressed by the welcoming and tolerant nature of the Muslims she had encountered in several countries including in The Gambia and North Africa. It would seem that there was divergence in the way that M and F believed that they should observe and follow their faith which was most starkly realised after A&#8217;s birth when the issue of circumcision arose. Eventually, although this took place in the presence of both M and F, it was arranged by F and carried out privately by a doctor who was not the child&#8217;s GP. It was accepted by both parties that the baby was very distressed by the procedure and that it affected his mother who was crying herself and very upset at the baby&#8217;s distress. In his evidence F denied that A suffered any ill-effects but the GP records obtained by his guardian include a reference to treatment for an infection following the circumcision. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although it was part of M&#8217;s case that F had been radicalised or was involved in radicalisation and counsel for M, Miss Isaacs (who was instructed in this case in March 2016) made an application for disclosure against the police, she did not identify against which part of the police service or named officer or officers an order should be made. Thus an order for disclosure could not be made as it would have been too imprecise and incapable of enforcement. The court was aware that the police had not, at any stage, provided M or the court with any material that would suggest that there were any current investigations in respect of extremism, radicalisation or offences under the anti-terrorism legislation. Indeed, there was no evidence filed on behalf of M that supported this allegation apart from her recollection of conversations with police officers after F was arrested in her garden for breaches of the non-molestation injunction in June 2014.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I shall return to the precise allegations of domestic abuse made by M when I set out the findings she seeks below, but will deal with other issues raised on her behalf first. M had said in her written evidence that she did not believe F to be a Syrian national as he had claimed in his evidence; she said he was an Egyptian national which he denied. At issue and in the background to this case is F&#8217;s determination to remain in this jurisdiction and to stop his deportation. The case is not about a determination of F&#8217;s nationality, but it is a matter that has been repeatedly raised, not least by F himself, who claims that if he is deported to Egypt he will then be deported from there to Syria where his life will be in danger. The solicitors and counsel he instructed in this case are not instructed in any applications by him against the deportation order or any application for judicial review, in respect of immigration decisions, which F claimed was underway.  </p>

F was found by a police officer in M&#8217;s garden behind the shed and he was arrested, charged and remanded in custody. This incident, which ultimately led to F&#8217;s conviction, resulted in a multi-agency risk assessment (MARAC) collating evidence about what the local authority and police considered to be a high risk case of domestic abuse. M said in her statement, and I accept, that she was regularly warned by the police and other professionals that they were worried about her safety and that of the children. She and the children were moved from Cheltenham, to a location which remains confidential. M has become highly anxious, has had counselling (to which I have already referred) and CBT. She describes herself as on a constant state of high alert and is frightened to let the children out of her sight; even to the extent that she is too fearful to allow them to go to nursery school.</p>

The jury had found F guilty after a trial and the following facts are taken from the statements made by witnesses, including police officers, for the trial and whose evidence the jury had accepted. It is noteworthy that the jury found that F had previously breached the order in November 2015 by sending a letter to M, not long after the order had been imposed. By the time the breaches took place in June 2014, M was living with the two children (the younger child was barely a month old having been born on 2nd May) at an address that had been fitted with a panic button because the authorities had considered F to pose a high risk; it was only as a result of M being able to press the panic button that the police arrived so quickly.</p>

A short time later, the police arrived. K told the police that he was completely unaware that F had been served with a non-molestation order and thought that any contact F had with M was legal.</p>

Later, at about quarter past seven that evening M telephoned the police to tell them that a bag containing a hammer and a screwdriver had been found in her garden. At about half past nine that night the first neighbour noticed that the white Ford Galaxy was still parked in the same place and did not appear to have been moved, and remained unattended.

Furthermore, I infer from your activity, and with what you had brought with you, you were not only going to force your way into your wife&#8217;s house but also to do her harm or abduct the children, or both. You were caught in the act of hiding behind a shed in the garden by a police officer who chased you across several gardens before you were finally apprehended. You were to complain that you suffered from a slipped disc, but as the officer pointed out, you appear to have cleared large fences in your bid to escape. This was one of several maladies that you complain of.&#8221;</span></p>

There was no medical evidence in support supplied by the prison doctors despite F&#8217;s attempts to get it. In addition to the three-year term of imprisonment there is a ten year restraining order in place until 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2025. F is forbidden to contact M or the children directly or indirectly (except through a solicitor). He cannot go to any address where she is resident. He cannot enter Gloucestershire except to attend the family court or for pre-arranged visits to see the children. He is not to instruct anyone or encourage in any way any person to contact M or the children (except through his instructing solicitor). On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2016 my clerk was sent an email purporting to be from F&#8217;s father, from whom the court has heard nothing and who had filed no statement within the proceedings. It had had attached an email to M which, on the face of it, was an apparent attempt at breaching paragraph 4 (set out above) of the restraining order by contacting M through the court.  </p>

She had recognised F&#8217;s voice. F had begged her to speak to him and although not threatening in the context of this case that would have made little difference to the impact of this communication on M.

Some of this was not relevant, such as that from Swansea University as I was not being asked to make a determination about what had occurred there. The court would not have ordered the disclosure of the medical records to F who is totally unqualified to interpret them. The further delay which would not have been in the interests of the children and the evidence from his friends and family members would not assist me in reaching a decision about the complaints made by M as no-one had been present at the time of the alleged incidents of abuse and violence (one was someone F had known for 3 months in 2009 who had never met M). F asked, again, to take a polygraph test, an application I refused. </p>

The evidence of PC Archer is referred to above. The court was provided with the children&#8217;s GP records by the children&#8217;s solicitor; this included confirmation that A had, indeed, suffered an infection to his penis after circumcision took place when he was an infant as his mother had said he had. The court office in Bristol received information from the Home Office during the hearing which was, unfortunately, not drawn to my attention until after the trial. On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 2016 an email was received from the Home Office, Immigration Enforcement Criminal Caseworker in Croydon which said that F has been confirmed as an Egyptian National. He was scheduled to attend the Egyptian Embassy on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016 for a face to face interview and to collect his ETD (travel documents) but that F had refused to go saying that he had a family court hearing. There was no hearing on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016. Throughout the hearing and afterwards (the email from his father sent to my clerk says they are Syrian Nationals) F persisted in claiming Syrian nationality and did not inform the court of the refused interview with the Egyptian Embassy or the confirmation of his Egyptian nationality. I have no doubt that he hopes to avoid deportation by claiming he will be deported from Egypt to Syria, however there is absolutely no evidence before me which supports these claims, nor F&#8217;s assertion that he is a Syrian national. </p>

During her evidence M was, at times, clearly distressed and she was in tears on more than one occasion; notably when she was speaking about A&#8217;s circumcision when the baby was crying and in pain. She was palpably frightened and I find that her fear was genuine and heart-felt. After she had given oral evidence on the second day of the hearing, M decided not to participate in the hearing by video-link (which had been put in place) and gave instructions by phone.</p>

I find this suggestion incredible; even if he was deluding himself about the state of their relationship such a phrase used in that way could only have referred to A.

M described how F had bought the baby a toy replica of an AK47 assault rifle for his first birthday and had then posed for pictures copying the stance of fighters who have posted their images on-line.

F has during their short relationship, which lasted little over two years, repeatedly threatened and used violence against M. The violence had not been slight, or at the lower end of any scale; on several occasions he has seized M by the head and neck and attempted to choke or strangle her; once while saying that he would be able to break her neck in one twist. He has slapped her, kicked her, shaken her and thrown her to the ground when she was pregnant. These are all serious assaults and the choking or attempted strangulation must have been terrifying to endure. </p>

I find that he bought the baby a replica assault rifle for his first birthday, which F later posed with himself; and that he watched violent films when the child was there. This behaviour would have caused M to fear for A and that his father was exposing him to, and encouraging him in, the use of violence. I do not accept that F is, as he has said, a peace loving man who would not even harm animals because he is a vegan; as his evidence about this was another example of self-serving evidence which suddenly appeared during his oral evidence without any previous mention of it.</p>

I accept that she only had access to the money in the joint account and that the amount of money available in that account was entirely controlled by F. Even on his own account M was isolated from friends and family, but I do not accept that this was her choice, rather I find that he set out to keep her isolated and refused to allow her to mix with other people. I find that he forbade her to speak to other men without his permission; he intimidated her when they were out by making her walk in the inside of the pavement and avoid contact with other men; he shut her in the bedroom when his friends visited him; he repeatedly threatened to take A away from her to get her to comply with his wishes; he threatened to kill her and A if she left or contacted the police; and, that he explicitly told her that violence was the appropriate way to discipline a woman. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">F made repeated claims to professionals that M was not fit to be a mother; this he continued to do throughout these proceedings and in his oral evidence. There have been two social service assessments of the family because of referrals due to domestic abuse. The first was by Kensington and Chelsea in August 2013 when M and A (then 9 months old) were referred by a senior care health advisor, to whom M had disclosed that F had grabbed her round the neck, causing bruising to her throat, amongst other physical abuse. This description corroborates the evidence in her statements. M was interviewed by a social worker and by the police; she was then taken by her mother from the police station to her mother&#8217;s home. As M and A were considered to be living in a &#8220;place of safety&#8221; outside the borough the case was not taken any further. When M and F reunited this triggered a further referral in September 2013; this time the referral was by the health visitor. M told the social worker that she was a practising Muslim, but not as strict as her husband, and that she had not been in agreement with circumcision, however F had gone ahead with it; M had felt it was cruel and painful for the baby and that it was not necessary (further corroboration of M&#8217;s evidence). The risk of further domestic abuse was considered to be raised by M&#8217;s being pregnant. The risk was assessed as High. These two s47 CA assessments corroborate M&#8217;s evidence.</p>

The assessment recorded that the domestic abuse she was experiencing was of the &#8220;controlling and intimidation nature [sic]&#8221;, such as putting a tracking device in A&#8217;s pram, following her when she was out on errands and checking her mobile phone each time she received a phone call or message. F was described as minimising the incidents and that he made out that his wife was &#8220;sensitive and over-reacts&#8221;. It was recorded that it was not possible to discuss the domestic abuse in detail with M who feared she would be placed at more risk of domestic abuse at home had she done so; as the assessment records the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the fact that [M] fears the consequence of this discussion is evident [sic] of the level of intimidation and worry that his behaviours have had upon his wife.&#8221;</span></p>

I find that F did place a tracking device in A&#8217;s pram, and that he did follow M when she went out; specifically, I find that he followed her when she went to social services offices. As he had done so it was unsurprising that the assessor made the comment about the evidence of the level of intimidation experienced by M. To go to the extent of putting a tracking device in the baby&#8217;s pram is an example of the extreme lengths that F would go to try to control and monitor M&#8217;s movements; when this was coupled with following her she must have been left feeling terrified, undermined and powerless. I have no doubt that F intended that she should feel that way. </p>

The breaches of the non-molestation order were very serious, as was reflected in the sentences handed down, and armed with a plethora of sinister implements F can only have been intending to cause harm to M and the children or intending to abduct them as the judge said in his sentencing remarks. F posed a considerable and a serious risk to M and to the children at that time and there is no evidence before me that would support a finding that the risk is in any way diminished. F continues to use all means at his disposal to try to circumvent the restraining orders, the fact that those means are very limited is only because he remains behind bars. Based on his past and current behaviour, his denial of his criminal convictions and the absence of any remorse the likelihood is that F would again attempt to track M and the children down and to harm M and abduct the children. Abduction causes lasting harm to children and the risk that it is likely to occur must be taken into account by this court when considering how safe it is to allow F&#8217;s involvement in the children&#8217;s lives now and in the future.</p>

This fear has led to her, and therefore the children, leading much more restricted lives than they otherwise would have done. She was, and is, frightened that F could track her down as he did when she was living down in Gloucestershire and is so fearful that he would manage to do so again that she cannot bring herself to let the children out of her sight. This fear is not ill-founded, it is all too easy to access information on the internet, and F has done this before. For that reason, she has not enrolled A or B in a nursery and it is for that reason that she seeks an order to allow her to change the children&#8217;s names.</p>

She accepted in her oral evidence that she had done so and that A had struggled with calling himself and B by different first names but that they are now used to them. The guardian was aware that she had done so and did not criticise her because she understood why M had done it; the guardian was also under the impression that it was not wrong for her to do so, and of the opinion that it had done the children no harm. This latter view has some force to it, children are often called nicknames or call themselves by a different name to their given name and it does them no harm at all. In this I follow the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Child&#8217;s Name: First Name)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 FLR 973" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 FLR 973</ref>, CA and keep in mind, as observed in that case, that it is regarded as commonplace for a child to receive different given names during the course of family life. </p>

I did not hear any evidence about how the investigation of F originated in Gloucestershire and it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the police had seen in what M told them evidence of extremism and had escalated the case as a result. Certainly some of his behaviour was bizarre and had included posing in a museum and elsewhere in battle-dress and with weapons; he had purchased night-vision goggles, gas masks and bullet proof clothing and had shown an active interest in the conflict in Syria (but not in the actions of Daesh per se) so it would have been that behaviour about which M properly spoke to the police.</p>

This is a case where a mother of two very young children has been continuously and systematically abused, she has been forced to move home, more than once, to keep herself and her children safe from a violent man who acts as he wishes, regardless of court orders put in place to keep him away from her, and to keep the children and their mother safe.

F says that M is paranoid and that these allegations are part of a conspiracy against him by M and other unidentified people, and the professionals who have been involved with the family. He says he is a changed man having completed relevant behaviour and anger management courses while in prison, about which I have already made comment; the guardian observes that to be effective such courses are aimed at perpetrators who have acknowledged the abuse they have perpetrated against their victim. F has not acknowledged, or accepted to any meaningful extent, any of the violent and controlling behaviour I have found he meted out to his wife and infant son, nor has he shown the slightest insight into the impact on M and the children of his actions. It was submitted on behalf of the children that F had displayed &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a complete and abject failure to take responsibility for anything he has done</span>&#8221; and that there was nothing in his evidence to show he had any understanding of the aims and purposes of the courses he had undertaken in prison.

Moreover, he has continually been negative and hostile towards M and, even if he were able to have contact without harming M or attempting to take the children, the evidence is that he would use any and every opportunity to undermine her, as their mother, during contact.</p>

I have no doubt that any order for contact would have a profoundly negative affect on M and would seriously undermine the quality of care she is able to give the children.

They have no relationship with F (because of his behaviour) and so these very young children would need to be brought to prison to be introduced to him; there is no-one to carry out this sensitive work with the children. It is highly unlikely, given their previous assessments, that any agency, local authority or child-care professional would undertake this work or consider it to be in the children&#8217;s best interests. Moreover, F is likely to be deported to Egypt in the short term so the likely distressing effects on the children and their mother would be for the short term gain for F alone. In any event, the court will not order contact to take place, even if F were to avoid deportation, because the risk he presents is overwhelming.</p>

The guardian accepted that she has not made any enquiries herself of the paternal family, but, I accept, that this is because F did not ever suggest to her that he wanted his family involved with contact nor did he volunteer any information that would have made their participation possible. The involvement of his family was something he expediently raised during the hearing, after I had made some enquiries about the children&#8217;s extended paternal family.  Thus, the guardian was not able to assess what, if any, risks they may present to the children or whether or not they would collude with the F in using information to locate M and her children. The manner in which F suddenly was willing to produce information about his family at the end of the hearing; none of which could be checked or confirmed is evidence, I find, of his determination to try to control events including court proceedings. Again, this mirrors the remarks made by His Honour Tabor in the Crown Court.</p>

The guardian raised additional concerns on her part about F&#8217;s suggestion that the paternal family could be the conduits for indirect contact all of which carry weight; first and foremost, they have not been the subject of any kind of risk assessment. Quite how any assessment could be carried out when even their identity is not clear, much less their circumstances or addresses, begs more questions than it answers. In F&#8217;s first statement he refers to one brother, not two brothers or a twin brother; these persons were introduced during his oral evidence. No-one including this court or the guardian knows what, if any, information F has shared with the family about his current circumstances and what their views are about M or the children. F has said he has had no contact with them for two years; yet, again for the first time, in his final statement and oral evidence, he claimed that his father would be willing pay for private health care and education for the children.   </p>

M and the children are not in contact with their maternal-grandfather because M has been unable to trust him to take seriously the need to keep their location secure. Secondly, even if they were, they would not be able to Skype as they are very small children who do not speak Arabic and have never met F&#8217;s family.

It is her view, and one that I share, that to allow F to access health and educational information would inevitably lead to F finding out where the children and M were living. F has already demonstrated what he is likely to do once he has such information. I conclude, on the evidence and facts of this case, that to share information about the children&#8217;s GP or schooling with F will not promote the children&#8217;s welfare in any sense. Not only has F already shown how he would use the information to the detriment of the children and their mother, the pernicious effects on M, of the knowledge that F has information that may lead to F locating the family, are already apparent in the way that the family&#8217;s lives are circumscribed. Any obligation on school or GP or local authority or agency to share information with F in the future would deeply affect and undermine the children&#8217;s mother&#8217;s ability to put down healthy roots in a community and establish a level of security and consistency in their schooling and in the provision of health services for the children, because of her well-founded fears.

The court was influenced by the fact that the child would in reality not be brought up as a Muslim. The child was living with the mother who was a 'non-practising Christian' and the father described himself as a Muslim but he was not strictly religious; as I have observed the same lack of strict adherence in F, who himself declares himself not to be a strict observer of Islam, so I keep this in mind. </p>
