I was assisting her with her property and organising her finances. She wanted this arrangement to be formalised and informed me that she wished to make a Lasting Power of Attorney in my favour. Unfortunately before she could do this she lost capacity. I continued to deal with her affairs as I had always done and followed her wishes. Her son, who lives in the USA was aware of what I was doing and supported me. I was subsequently informed that the local authority had applied to become Aniela&#8217;s deputy. I was served with papers and lodged an objection. It would seem that the COP5, which was sent recorded delivery to the court was never received and the order was made.&#8221;</p>
