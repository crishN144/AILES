In each case the problems with which I am faced derive from the fact that whereas the mother has public funding the father does not. In part these are problems which pre-date the implementation in April 2013 of the relevant provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10" uk:canonical="2012 c. 10" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012</ref> (LASPO).

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is difficult to see that, if certainty is the appropriate test, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/10/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(3)</ref>(a) could ever apply. It does not seem to me that certainty is the appropriate test nor does the language used in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/10/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(3)</ref>(a) require it. In order to establish a breach of a human right, an individual has to establish on the balance of probabilities that such a breach has occurred. ECtHR jurisprudence suggests that a high level of probability is required. I see no reason why that should not be applied in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/10/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(3)</ref>(a) since Parliament must be taken to have appreciated that that was how breaches could be established. This seems to me to be the correct approach if <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/10/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(3)</ref>(a) is to have any sensible application. Thus if the Director is satisfied that legal aid is in principle needed when its refusal would to a high level of probability result in a breach, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/10/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(3)</ref>(a) is met and means and merits will determine whether legal aid is to be granted and to what extent. It may for example not be necessary to grant legal aid for more than advice, particularly as the obtaining of advice from a competent solicitor may save further cost by persuading the individual that he has no case or enabling him to present his application in a way which enables the decision maker or court to deal with it expeditiously and without the cost incurred in seeing whether a litigant in person does have valid points.&#8221;</p>

If legal aid is refused, there must be a substantial risk that there will be a breach of the procedural requirements because there will be an inability for the individual to have an effective and fair opportunity to establish his claim &#8230; It follows that I do not entirely accept Coulson J&#8217;s conclusion in [<span style="font-style:italic">M v Director of Legal Aid and Casework</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2014/1354" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 1354 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 1354 (Admin)</ref>.] that the test whether the refusal would impair the very essence of the right leads to a conclusion that the grant of legal aid will only rarely be appropriate. The very essence is that in procedural terms it can be put forward in an effective manner and there is a fair process.&#8221;</p>

The father is a convicted sex offender, having convictions for sexual offences with young male children, the second of which was committed during the currency of these proceedings. Reports were commissioned from Ray Wyre Associates dealing with the question of the risk which the father poses to his son. Reports commissioned by the father were provided by DS of Ray Wyre Associates on 28 March 2011 with a more recent addendum report dated 15 January 2014. On joint instructions, reports were commissioned from JD of Ray Wyre Associates, the original report by JD being dated 3 February 2012, with an addendum report dated 27 February 2014. Following receipt of those reports the father&#8217;s public funding was terminated. An appeal against that decision was dismissed. The current applications before the court are by the father for contact to his son (now for a child arrangements order: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>) and by the mother for an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

In a public law case where the proceedings are brought by a local authority, one can see a possible argument that failing all else the local authority should have to pay. In a case such as the present where one party is publicly funded, because the mother has public funding, but the father does not, it is, I suppose, arguable that, if this is the only way of achieving a just trial, the costs of the proceedings should be thrown on the party which is in receipt of public funds. It is arguable that, failing all else, and bearing in mind that the court is itself a public authority subject to the duty to act in a Convention compliant way, if there is no other way of achieving a just and fair hearing, then the court must itself assume the financial burden, as for example the court does in certain circumstances in funding the cost of interpreters.&#8221;</p>

But it seems to me that these are matters which required to be investigated in justice not merely to the father but I emphasise equally importantly to the son, as well as in the wider public interest of other litigants in a similar situation to that of the father here. I emphasise the interests of the son because, under our procedure in private law case like this where the child is not independently represented, fairness to the child can only be achieved if there is fairness to those who are litigating. There is the risk that, if one has a process which is not fair to one of the parents, that unfairness may in the final analysis rebound to the disadvantage of the child&#8221;</p>

From the information recorded in your judgment, it is clear that the father in this case failed to satisfy the statutory merits criteria required to access funding. The merits test is a fundamental and long established part of the legal aid system, and ensures that limited public money is focussed on sufficiently meritorious cases and is not available in cases lacking sufficient merit.

Every defendant is not guilty until proved to be so. Where, for example, a defendant is accused of rape, the trial cannot be conducted on the assumption that he is a rapist and the complainant a victim, since the whole purpose of the proceeding is to establish whether that is so or not.

However, it would be for the judge to decide whether and how to put questions in relation to those matters. In the present case, the judge, in the course of submissions before the trial, correctly characterised himself as a transmission channel rather than a defence advocate so far as the questioning of witnesses was concerned.</p>

It should of course also be borne in mind that there is a heavy duty on prosecuting counsel, which particularly arises where a defendant is unrepresented, to be scrupulously careful in the way in which the case is presented, so that no unfair prejudice against the defendant can arise from the manner in which the trial is conducted.&#8221;</p>

Such a statutory provision should also provide that the costs of making available to the court an advocate should fall on public funds. I can see no distinction in policy terms between the criminal and the civil process. Logic strongly suggests that such a service should be made available to the family jurisdiction. If it is inappropriate for a litigant in person to cross-examine such a witness in the criminal jurisdiction, why not in the family jurisdiction?&#8221;</p>

It is no part of the roles of the Guardian or of the children&#8217;s solicitor to adopt the case of one party in cross examination or argument. After the fact finding case is resolved it is essential that both parties retain confidence in the guardian and in the institution of CAFCASS.

The mother&#8217;s position is, as Ms Reed put it, that she cannot contemplate the prospect of being cross-examined directly by the father, and that the court has a responsibility to ensure that the best evidence is given, that it is fairly challenged and that the findings made are robust and correct for the benefit of the child. She submits that it is difficult to see how the mother can be enabled to give her best evidence without the father being represented, either through a grant of legal aid or in one of the ways referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Q v Q</span>.</p>

But there is a further and even more serious problem: the acute tensions that may arise when an alleged perpetrator cross-examines the alleged victim.</p>

His or her function is to give to the court such assistance as he or she is able on the relevant law and its application to the facts of the case. An advocate to the court will not normally be instructed to lead evidence, cross-examine witnesses, or investigate the facts. In particular, it is not appropriate for the court to seek assistance from an advocate to the court simply because a defendant in criminal proceedings refuses representation.&#8221;</p>

Again I have heard no sustained argument, but my inclination is to think that the answer is, no it does not, for principle suggests that such an important right is only to be cut down by express words or necessary implication, and neither is very obviously to be found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>G(6): see again <span style="font-style:italic">General Mediterranean Holdings SA v Patel and Another </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 WLR 272" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 WLR 272</ref>.

The first is that the matters to which I have referred above (in particular those relating to the issues of privilege and related issues) are matters on which the father in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>, and even more so the father in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>, desperately needs access to skilled legal advice, both before and during the fact-finding hearing. These are not matters which the judge conducting the fact-finding hearing can determine without the benefit of legal argument on both sides. If the judge is deprived of adversarial argument, and if the father is denied access to legal advice both before and during the hearing, there must, in my judgment, be a very real risk of the father&#8217;s rights under Articles 6 and 8 being breached both in the family proceedings and possibly also, in the case of the father in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>, in the criminal proceedings.

If it is not, then I will have to consider what, if any, further order to make. I am inclined to think that, for all the reasons already indicated, the father in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> requires access to legal advice beforehand and representation at the fact-finding hearing to avoid the very real risk of the court being unable to deal with the matter justly and fairly and of his rights under Articles 6 and 8 being breached. I am inclined to think, therefore, that, if he is unable to afford representation and pro bono representation is not available, and if there is no other properly available public purse, the cost will have to be borne by HMCTS. </p>

I have therefore not had occasion to consider any further the point I made in <span style="font-style:italic">Q v Q </span>(para 18), where I suggested that &#8220;In a public law case where the proceedings are brought by a local authority, one can see a possible argument that failing all else the local authority should have to pay.&#8221; That is a matter for another day. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have concluded that there may be circumstances in which the court can properly direct that the cost of certain activities should be borne by HMCTS. I emphasise that (the provision of interpreters and translators apart) this is an order of last resort. No order of this sort should be made except by or having first consulted a High Court Judge or a Designated Family Judge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I emphasise also that the allegation in each case is one of sexual assault, in two of the cases an allegation of rape. It may be that a similar approach is appropriate in cases of serious non-sexual assault. It may be that it will not be appropriate in less serious cases. I express no concluded views, beyond drawing attention to the trite observation that everything will, in the final analysis, depend upon the particular facts of the specific case. </p>

For my part I would urge the early attention of both the Children and Vulnerable Witnesses Working Group and the Family Procedure Rules Committee to those aspects of the various matters I have canvassed that fall within their respective remits.</p>
