	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 18 July 2011 I gave judgment on W&#8217;s application financial remedies following divorce. That judgment sets out the background and my reasons for my disposal. I ordered H to pay to W a lump sum of &#163;268,000 and a contribution to her costs of &#163;100,000 by 1 October 2011. That contribution was specified to be inclusive of sums recoverable under earlier costs orders including one made by Parker J against Damsonetti (UK) Limited (&#8220;DUK&#8221;) on 4 October 2010.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since my judgment H has not paid anything towards my award. He has unsuccessfully sought to mount appeals in the Court of Appeal against my orders as well as the costs order of Parker J. For her part W initiated proceedings in the Companies Court to wind up DUK. In response H has applied in the Companies Court to seek to prevent advertisement of the winding-up petition and he has sought to litigate by way of appeal in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division in relation to default costs certificates issued in relation to the order of Parker J. Further, he has applied in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division for pre-action disclosure in relation to a proposed free-standing civil fraud action against W alleging non-disclosure by her of material facts relating to her bankruptcy in the main proceedings before me.</p>

In addition DUK owes W about &#163;13,500 in relation to costs orders made in the later litigation, which sum is not within my enveloping costs order made on 11 July 2011.</p>

Mr Brooks accepts that it would be improbable that any other assets would be owned other than by the trust, but posits the unlikely arrangement that there are vast assets out [there] owned by the trust of which the trustees are ignorant. The fact that some assets such as Canaska do not appear in the trust records (such as they are) does not alter the implausibility of this.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I believe that H has managed to put some funds aside which will not be lost in the inevitable failure of Damsonetti UK (where receivers have been appointed by the banks). The best indicator of preserved funds is H&#8217;s lifestyle which has continued at an indulgent level. I would put the assets at no more than &#163;1m. I do not believe that on the evidence it would right for me to infer the existence of funds of a greater quantum than this. However I do not have to be more specific than this as a result of my conclusions as to how delay should be reflected in this case&#8221;</p>

Though I disagree with this finding, as he has not made any provision for my ex-wife from such a fund I am not appealing it&#8221;. And H has not. His appeal was based on other grounds. On 23 February 2012 Thorpe LJ finally refused permission to appeal, on an inter-partes hearing.</p>

He has also been orally examined before me. However, this is not some kind of disguised appeal against my primary finding of fact, which cannot be disturbed. The purpose of the further inquiries of H is to discern ways and means whereby my order might be implemented and also to examine carefully whether H in fact has any valid argument for seeking a further deferral of the time in which to pay the sums due.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Brooks advances a number of claims. As refined in his final submissions these are as follows. First, he seeks variation of the Krejci Family Trust (&#8220;KFT&#8221;) by pulling out of it a fund of &#163;373,082 for W absolutely, which should include within it (and be specifically vested in W) the following assets which are within England and Wales: 14 and 15 Groveside Court, Battersea (which are owned by the Jersey company Damsonetti Holdings Limited (&#8220;DHL&#8221;), a motorcycle and two cars (which are also said to be owned by DHL). On that basis Mr Brooks would be content for his enforcement application to be adjourned generally. Additionally Mr Brooks innovatively seeks that under my inherent powers I should make a non-statutory civil restraint order preventing H from embarking on any kind of satellite litigation against W in any court without obtaining the prior permission of this court. </p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The structure, I remind myself, is very familiar. KFT owns DHL which owns DUK. DUK owns the UK commercial properties, now all underwater to a large extent. DHL owns the properties and items of personalty mentioned above. DHL has not guaranteed DUK&#8217;s liabilities, so when that fails (as I thought it inevitably would when I wrote my first judgment, but now am not so sure, for reasons which I will explain) there will be no recourse against DHL. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In para 62 of my main judgment I recorded that on the then available valuations and the level of secured mortgage debt 14 and 15 Groveside Court had net equity of &#163;118,000. It is now said by H that the net equity has fallen to &#163;74,000, and this was not challenged by W. I do not know what the vehicles are worth collectively; even allowing for the fact that one Mercedes has a personalised number plate (LB01) I would be surprised if they were worth more than &#163;16,000. </p>

This power to vary is one of the oldest in the canon finding its origin in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/22-23/61/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s5</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/22-23/61" uk:canonical="1859 (22 &amp; 23 Vict.) c. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1859</ref>. The trustees are entitled to be heard (FPR 2010 rule 9.13(1) and (4)) and any children beneficiaries must be represented (rule 9.11). The variation powers extend to making outright provision to the applicant, and may even be exercised where the trust is offshore, although, following well-established principle, the court will be unlikely to make a variation order where both the trust and its assets are overseas unless it is satisfied that the order would be implemented by the court exercising effective control over the trust (<span style="font-style:italic">Goff v Goff </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1934] P 107" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1934">[1934] P 107</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Hamlin v Hamlin</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] Fam 11" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] Fam 11</ref>). If, however, the Court is satisfied that the variation order will be effective against the husband in personam, then the order is more likely to be made (<span style="font-style:italic">Razelos v Razelos </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1969] 3 All ER 929" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1969">[1969] 3 All ER 929</ref>)<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>&#8221;</p>

There was not even the faintest suggestion that the interposition of the bearer share Panamanian company amounted to an impediment to an effective variation of settlement, which included some outright provision to the claimant wife.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Dealing first of all with the post-nuptial settlement, the first consideration is the welfare of the children, and the second consideration, in my judgment, is that I should not interfere with it more than is necessary for the purposes of s. 25. At the moment the wife is a discretionary beneficiary of a settlement in which the discretion can only be exercised with the consent of the father. He will certainly not exercise it in favour of the wife. It is appropriate, therefore, that some portion of that settlement should be removed and made into a fund for the wife. The net value of the settlement is just over &#163;1m subject to any claims that the father may make on the trustees. It is appropriate, in my judgment, under s. 25, that &#163;250,000 should be pulled out of the trust and made into a separate fund for the wife. It would be right, in my judgment, although the Official Solicitor has made submissions to the contrary, that some of that should be given absolutely to the wife and some should be settled. I propose that &#163;50,000 should be given absolutely to the wife and the balance of &#163;200,000 should be settled on her for life with the remainder for the children. That fund, of course, will be taken away from the powers of the protector. The remainder of the fund will remain on trust for the husband and the children. It would be right, in my judgment, to remove the father as protector of that fund too and to arrange the fund in such a way that the balance will be available so far as it is needed to provide a home for the husband and the children.&#8221;</p>

I suppose a technically pure variation would have involved directing the corporate trustee (i) to take steps to wind up the Panamanian company, (ii) to distribute the company&#8217;s property to the trustee, (iii) to sell the property and (iv) to appoint &#163;50,000 to the wife absolutely and &#163;200,000 to the trustees of the new trust, and in default making a direct order for sale of the property in Hampstead and directing a  distribution of part of the proceeds to the wife and the new trust.  I suppose (although I cannot recall) that it is possible that the order actually provided for that. But even if it did not but merely reflected the actual words of Ewbank J&#8217;s judgment, I see no problem with that, it being an example of the &#8220;short-circuiting&#8221; (but which I prefer to call &#8220;telescoping&#8221;) approach rightly and legitimately (in my opinion) identified by Bodey J in <span style="font-style:italic">Mubarak v Mubarak </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 673" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 673</ref>.

In my view the present case comes nowhere near any situation in which a court has pierced, or will or may pierce, the veil or carapace. If a finding of impropriety or dishonesty is required, none was made by the district judge. It is of course true that she considered that the husband had treated the company as a &#8216;cash cow&#8217; (a finding which I fully accept) but she also, in the critical passage at paragraph 38 of her first judgment, clearly treated the money which the husband had extracted from the company to have been loans. Even if (which I do not need to decide) a less strict approach may be applied in the case of matrimonial ancillary relief, there is still a world of difference between the facts and circumstances of the present case and any of the formulations of Connell, Bodey or Mostyn JJ.&#8221;</p>

RAB had borrowed the funds to acquire the dairy companies from VTB. VTB alleged that it had been induced to enter into the facility agreement by fraudulent representations made by Nutritek that the dairy companies were worth more than their true value and that Nutritek was not under common ownership with RAB. The second defendant was Marcap BVI, a holding company that owned a substantial interest in Nutritek. The fourth defendant was Mr Malofev, said to be the ultimate beneficial owner and controller of RAB, Nutritek and Marcap. The facility agreement was between VTB and RAB. VTB sought to amend its claim to allege that Nutritek, Marcap and Mr Malofev were also bound by that contract by piercing the veil of RAP. At first instance, Arnold J declined to give permission to amend, holding that there was no cause of action with a real prospect of success.

However, the fact remains that different considerations do frequently pertain: the company approach, on the one hand, being predominantly concerned with parties at arm&#8217;s length in a contractual or similar relationship; the family approach, on the other hand, being concerned with the distributive powers of the court as between husband and wife applying discretionary considerations to what will often be a mainly, if not entirely, family situation.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I would echo the experience referred to by both Cumming-Bruce LJ and Connell J (above) as regards lifting the veil in the Family Division when it is just and necessary. In practice, especially in &#8216;big money&#8217; cases, the husband (as I will assume) will often make a concession that company/trust assets can be treated as his, whereafter the case proceeds conveniently on that basis. It is pragmatic, saves expense and usually works. Problems such as have arisen in this case are rare and anyway can be avoided where there are other assets against which the lump sum order can be enforced.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The difficulty remains in defining those situations when lifting the veil is appropriate by way of enforcement following such a concession in ancillary relief proceedings. I would suggest that the Family Division can make orders directly or indirectly regarding a company&#8217;s assets where (a) the husband (as I am assuming) is the owner and controller of the company concerned and (b) where there are no adverse third parties whose position or interests would be likely to be prejudiced by such an order being made. I include as third parties those with real minority interests in the company and (where relevant on the facts) creditors and directors. The reason for my including the latter two categories will become apparent later in this judgment.  </p>

It would amount to his property for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 24</ref> in the same sense that the law may look on that as done as ought to be done; whilst the mechanics of the order would be along the lines adopted by Connell J in <span style="font-style:italic">Green v Green</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] 1 FLR 326" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] 1 FLR 326</ref> at 341G: &#8216;&#8230; the respondent do sell, or cause G Ltd to sell, four plots of the blue land to &#8230;&#8217;.</p>

The true principle is that &#8216;equity looks on that as done which ought to be done&#8217; (emphasis added), this being one of the maxims of equity (see John McGee, Snell&#8217;s Equity (Sweet and Maxwell, 30th edn, 2000) paras 3&#8211;25) and not, so far as I am aware, a principle of the common law.

But I need not explore this aspect of his judgment any further for the present case does not on any view, given my findings on the other aspects of the matter, satisfy the conditions identified by Bodey J as being necessary if there is to be the &#8216;short-circuiting&#8217; he referred to.

In my judgment the company structure in this case was set up and has been used for conventional reasons including wealth protection and the avoidance of tax.  Mr&#160;Todd is right, for example, to point to the reference in the annex to the husband&#8217;s Form E to his transferring his shares in PRL Nigeria to the Nevis company because he was involved in litigation.  However, this does not result in the company structure being used to conceal or avoid liability.  It is seeking to provide a degree of protection for the wealth, which may or may not be effective depending on the nature of the rights retained by the husband.  He is also right to point to the company structure effectively being the husband&#8217;s money box which he uses at will.  This might be contrary to accounting or company law principles but any disregard of those principles does not, in my view, mean that the structure is being used to avoid or conceal liability.  From the husband&#8217;s perspective the wealth and the corporate structure is and remains his but at the same time he is able to take advantage of the tax and other benefits of holding it within a corporate structure.  </p>

Applying the test they had formulated it was held that it was not possible to disregard the minority interests as they were real interests of the husband&#8217;s business associates. Had the interests been inconsequential then the veil would have been pierced.

This was, among other things, based on the email referred to me at para 63(vi) from H to Chris King of RBS on 21 September 2009 that states &#8220;Damsonetti Holdings does not own any shares they were bought by trustees and beneficiary is my daughter. Damsonetti Holdings owns two cars motorbike yacht. I did not mention it as I did not think it important. Value approximately &#163;400,000&#8221;. Also, the trustees had confirmed that the yacht was registered to DHL in the Jersey Register. H had mentioned at the trial that the true beneficial owner of the yacht was the Holtkamp family of Holland, but no documentary evidence was produced to support this. In this round of proceedings H has produced a letter dated 4 September 2011 from &#8220;Fam Holtkamp&#8221; saying that they are the owner of the yacht and that DHL is the registered keeper and not the owner. In his oral evidence H explained that DHL continues to be the formal owner of the yacht because the Family Holtkamp did not want to pay Dutch VAT at 20% on the purchase and because it did not want to pay the cost of &#163;4,000 annually in setting up a separate Jersey company. The yacht continues to be used by H. This is just another example of the smoke and mirrors which I referred to earlier. When asked in cross-examination for an explanation for the email H stated &#8220;It was a letter of comfort to Chris King, who was panicking. It was an exaggeration&#8221;.</p>

As I have said these may be worth around &#163;90,000 in combination. If they are to be &#8220;pulled out&#8221; and vested in W then around &#163;283,000 of my award will remain unsatisfied. Should I order this sum to be pulled out also, given that W in order to get that money via the trust will (i) actually have to identify it in the trustee&#8217;s hands and (ii) to persuade the Royal Court of Jersey to make a reciprocal enforcement order? There is no evidence that the Royal Court could, or if so, would, make such an order, and thus the weight of authority is against making such an order (see para 11 above). However, where the settlement variation route is being used secondarily as means of satisfying my primary award, to which H has paid no attention whatsoever, I believe that the variation should nonetheless be made, even if that too proves to be an empty vessel in the hands of W.</p>

I believe that she only mounted her claim on becoming aware of the vast improvements in Damonsetti UK&#8217;s financial position as revealed in the 2007 accounts available in April 2008.

For H now to launch this satellite action is a plain attempt to seek to subvert my award, and to vex W twice in respect of matters that have already been fully adjudicated. It is noteworthy that in his witness statement H accepts that he could have pursued the disclosure he now seeks at the main trial before me, but chose not to. It is also significant that on the application for permission to appeal to Thorpe LJ H applied for this disclosure and it was refused. </p>

With effect from 6 April 2011 the FPR 2011 counterpart has been operative (see FPR 2010 rule 4.8 and PD 4B). Mr Brooks is in effect seeking a limited civil restraint order under PD 4B para 3. But the threshold requirement for making such an order is, per para 3.1, that a party &#8220;has persistently made applications which are totally without merit&#8221;. Thus far H has been found by Costs Master O&#8217;Hare on 27 September 2011 to have made an application which was totally without merit. So he has not yet crossed the threshold for a limited civil restraint order under PD 4B para 2 (which require two such findings) let alone the threshold for an extended one.</p>
