The order recites that the mother told the Guardian on 31st May 2023 that she did not intend to actively participate in the proceedings (save for sending a signed statement to the parties and to the Court). The Court recorded that it was &#8220;satisfied having considered the evidence, that it cannot make any of the findings sought by the respondent mother against the applicant father and that findings sought by the respondent mother&#8230;  are not found, on which basis the case will now proceed on the basis that [the father] does not pose a risk of harm to the child as alleged by her&#8221;.</p>

I ordered the mother to attend this hearing, and a penal notice was attached to the order, in an attempt to ensure that there was an effective hearing. My order recorded that &#8220;in the event that the mother fails to attend&#8230; evidence will be heard, and the court will determine the findings sought against the father and in the alternative, whether to find that she is deliberately seeking to frustrate his attempts to have contact with his daughter.&#8221; As both parties were litigants in person and this case was issued before the provisions of the Domestic Abuse Act came into force (so it was not possible to order that a Qualified Legal Representative undertake the cross examination), I further directed that both parents should submit their cross-examination questions to the court in advance. </p>

If the lie was for an innocent reason, it may be ignored; but otherwise it may be used to support the truth of allegations providing there is other supporting evidence.

I am aware that there may be relevant evidence that has not been included in the bundle, given the mother&#8217;s limited engagement with the proceedings. I did not have the full police disclosure, notwithstanding that police disclosure orders have been made. The mother wished to rely on a video which she said supported her case because it showed the father apologising to her. She did not produce this video however and I was unable to view it. </p>

It would not be proportionate to give her a third chance. The Court has to draw the line and conclude the fact-finding exercise now on the evidence available. These proceedings have been ongoing for two years and the disputed factual issues have been a barrier to contact moving forward. The mother was on notice that the Court was going to hear evidence and make findings at this hearing.</p>

She did not appear to understand that, because the burden of proof rests with her, it was her responsibility to obtain the evidence that she needed to prove her case. As Miss Broughton said in her closing, she appeared to assume that everyone was aware of the content of the documents that she referred to, even though she had not served them in evidence. </p>

She would not give any detail about to her most serious allegation of rape or as to the nature of the controlling and coercive behaviour that she alleged. I am aware that, if the mother has been raped, it would be a very traumatic experience for her to give evidence in Court about it, even in circumstances where special measures had been put in place so that she could not see the father and where the parents could not question each other directly.</p>
