If the issue for the tribunal to decide is whether to believe X or Y on the central issue/s, and the evidence is clearly one way then there will be no need to address credibility in general. However, if the tribunal looks to find support for their view, it must caution itself against treating what it finds to be an established propensity to dishonesty as determinative of guilt for the reasons the Recorder gave in [40]. Conversely, an established propensity to honesty will not always equate with the witness&#8217;s reliability of recall on a particular issue.</span></p>

It is a means of satisfying the attributable threshold condition that only arises where the court is satisfied that there has been significant harm arising from (in shorthand) ill-treatment and where the only 'unknown' is which of a number of persons is responsible. So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way. Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible. In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not. There is no room for a finding of fact on the basis of 'real possibility', still less on the basis of suspicion. There is no such thing as a pool of one. </span></p>

As is made clear in Lancashire at [19], O and N at [27-28] and S-B at [43], the person is not a proven perpetrator but a possible perpetrator. That conclusion is then carried forward to the welfare stage, when the court will, as was said in S-B, &#8216;consider the strength of the possibility&#8217; that the person was involved as part of the overall circumstances of the case.</span></p>

[MGM] made excuses for [Emma], suggested many of the young people [Emma] was involved with behaved the same, and seemed to minimise what [Emma] had done.

This was followed up by the strategy meeting at the end of August 2022, which led to [Felix] being placed on a child protection plan.  Throughout that period [Emma] was not staying at the unit all the time and was bringing visitors to the home.  She was facing risk of eviction.  She was not engaging with the family nurse partnership, nor with her keyworker at [the placement], and was falling out with her housemates.  The initial child and family assessment identified [Emma]&#8217;s chaotic social relationships, diagnosis of autism, long-standing mental health issues, history of self-harm, anxiety and becoming overwhelmed at times, which could lead to her acting impulsively.  At the same time, it was noted that she had sometimes lied about harming herself or being injured and would demand medical treatment through a need for attention or intervention.

As with a number of other witnesses, his statement was not prepared for these proceedings but was the statement given to the police, once it was known that [Felix] had sustained fractures. He seems to have been asked a number of questions leading to him saying very negative things about [Emma], and raising concerns about her handling of [Felix], which he had not apparently been concerned about at the time.  Other than describing a time when [Emma] had apparently lifted [Felix] by the front of his Babygro a short distance from the playmat and placed him gently on the sofa, he was not able to give any examples of rough handling or of seeing [Felix] being picked up by his arms or legs.</span></p>

This is not consistent with the evidence of [Ms M], who was living with them, or [Ms L], or [Luke].  The large volume of messages between [Emma] and [Luke] also paint a different picture from the one she has given.  She was inconsistent in her evidence about when she said there had been physical abuse, saying that it only happened at the end of the relationship, then saying the first incident had happened on [Luke]&#8217;s birthday in early November, and that there had been too many incidents of violence to recall. The weight of evidence suggests a relationship that, similar to previous friendships and relationships, had developed very quickly to something intense and creating a mutual dependence.  [Luke] and [Emma] were spending all their time with each other, and [Luke] was involved in [Felix]&#8217;s care from very early on.  It seems that [Emma] had a lot of power in the relationship, and would be asking [Luke] to do things for her, which he willingly did, but increasingly became frustrated about as time went on. They seem to have had intense arguments, that led to one or the other of them saying they should break up for ever, but within hours or sometimes even minutes, reuniting and enjoying the intensity and drama of that.</span></p>

There is a consistent thread throughout the evidence of [Luke] being the one to &#8216;handle&#8217; [Felix] when they were struggling to settle him, and to use the technique of swaddling him, not just to sleep at night, but as a means of stopping him from crying. There is evidence from [Ms M], [Emma] and [Ms L] that [Luke] could be quite firm in the way he did this, [Ms L] was shocked by how [Luke] attempted to swaddle [Ms M]&#8217;s baby.  [Luke] told the police that [Emma] didn&#8217;t like to do it because she was scared she would hurt him.  [Luke] said to the police, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;if he really won&#8217;t settle then we are swaddling him to put him down for a nap&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">  He said, [Felix] could be </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;a handful &#8230; &#8216;like, he just cries, won&#8217;t take his bottle, he &#8211; we try and put him in the bath and sometimes he don&#8217;t like it, he just screams even more.  So we take him out and as soon as we swaddle him, he&#8217;s fine.  He just &#8211; he just goes into a deep sleep&#8217;.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">What I take from this evidence is not that [Luke] could have caused harm to [Felix] through swaddling necessarily, but it is a repeating theme of the evidence that [Luke] seemed to find it difficult and sometimes overwhelming when [Felix] was crying and they could not settle him, and had a need in those circumstances for [Felix] not just to be comforted, but to be bound up tightly and made to sleep.  This seems to me to be indicative of a need to control, or a real difficulty when presented with a crying baby.</span></p>

On 1 December 2022 she was very distressed at the prospect of him being banned from [the placement] for two weeks and felt she would not be able to cope looking after [Felix] alone.  It was a known concern that [Emma] struggled to be on her own and may struggle to cope with the demands of a newborn on her own.  The response of [the placement], through [Ms L], and the local authority through MG, was to engineer a situation in which [Emma] was permitted to spend more time with [Luke], staying at his grandmother&#8217;s house.  This arrangement contributed to the instability of [Felix]&#8217;s routine, did not help [Emma] with keeping on top of her room, because she was moving in and out every two days, and confirmed in [Emma]&#8217;s eyes the professional view that it was appropriate for her to depend upon [Luke] to support her with [Felix]&#8217;s care;</span></p>

It seems that [Felix] was swaddled much more often than just at night time, and that swaddling was used as a means of controlling and settling him, indeed [Luke] told the police that [Felix] seemed to have learned that placement on the blanket for swaddling was a cue for him to stop crying and stop wriggling.
