They have three sons. In July 2008, ROO suffered a grade 5 subarachnoid haemorrhage - a stroke - with accompanying hydrocephalus which had a devastating impact on her life and on the lives of those close to her.

In particular she suffered from severely impaired function in her lower limbs but also in her upper body and upper limbs. Cognitively, she was severely impaired in particular suffering from receptive and expressive dysphasia. She suffered occasional grand mal seizures. From early 2009 until January 2018, ROO lived at Burdon Grange nursing home. Whilst there, although reliant on 24-hour nursing care and at risk of seizures, she was able to propel herself around in her wheelchair and appeared content. ROA believes that although her ability to communicate was impaired, he considered that her underlying intelligence and wit were not.</span></p>

At the root of this application is a dispute over whether the cause of that deterioration has been adequately investigated. ROA identifies low cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) pressure as being central to her condition, that arising out of the fact that on 30 January 2014 a lumbar puncture was carried out at the request of Mr Pople a consultant neurosurgeon, but no CSF was obtained. ROA believes that the cause of this has not been adequately investigated since.  I shall return to what has occurred later.</span></p>

On 4 September, a further attempt to insert a nasogastric tube was unsuccessful because ROO became agitated and resisted its insertion. She continued to accept food and drink on occasions orally.

ROO has been denied a lumbar puncture although there is no evidence that the situation has changed and there wouldn&#8217;t be the same result which was that CSF pressure was so low that none could be extracted.&#8221;</span></p>

On that occasion an interim declaration was made that ROO lacked capacity to litigate these proceedings or to make decisions about her ongoing care and treatment. An interim order was made that it was not in her best interests to receive artificial nutritional support. Permission was given to instruct an independent expert to report on her diagnosis, prognosis and best interests. The case was listed for an expedited final hearing with a time estimate of one day to include pre-reading and judgment. It is that final hearing that came before me. A transparency order was made which provided that the expedited final hearing be heard in public but subject to the usual reporting restrictions contained in a transparency order.</span></p>

He asked questions of the treating clinicians and the expert and with some encouragement made short submissions. He made clear that he felt at a disadvantage in court as a result of not having legal representation and preferred to rely on his written case. He is clearly an intelligent and articulate man and he was able to identify important questions to put to the witnesses although I do not underestimate the extent to which he may have felt overawed both by the situation but also by the intensity of emotions which are engaged in this application.</span></p>

She invited me to hear evidence from the treating clinician dealing with palliative care Dr Baines. Given that I was already due to hear from three medical witnesses and potentially ROA, and that no application seeking such declarations had been issued by the NHS Trust, I declined to go down that route having regard to the seriousness of the issues that were engaged in pursuing such a course and the lack of notice to ROA and the limited time available to the court. </span></p>

If it were provided and weight were gained and it were then withdrawn ROO would simply lose weight again.  In any event any weight gained would not in fact bring any benefit to ROO as it would not reverse the loss of muscle mass which underlies the risk of organ failure and reduction in the function of the immune system. Because ROO cannot undertake physiotherapy she cannot regain muscle mass and thus weight gain would be of no benefit. ROO is currently still taking food orally sometimes exceeding the calorie count needed to maintain her weight but often taking substantially less than is needed. Currently her electrolyte and blood glucose levels are within normal parameters and so artificial nutrition is not required to address these issues which are linked to the risk of organ failure. There is thus no benefit to ROO but there are risks relating to infection and refeeding syndrome and it is likely that ROO would object to the treatment and the resultant higher level of medicalisation that would be involved.</span></p>

The fundamental principle of the sanctity of human life is enshrined in Article 2 of the Convention: everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. Further in the present context, Article 3 (protection from inhuman or degrading treatment) is relevant. In addition it is an aim of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to secure the full enjoyment of human rights by disabled people and to ensure they have full equality under the law.  In cases such as Lambert-v-France (20160 62 EHRR 2) the European Court of Human Rights has confirmed that the withdrawal of life sustaining treatment engages a State&#8217;s positive obligations under Article 2 but that permitting withdrawal and the circumstances under which it was permitted and how the balance was struck between the right to life and the protection of their right to respect for their private life and autonomy were within the margin of appreciation of states. The ECHR retains a right to review whether in any particular case an individual&#8217;s Article 2 rights had been infringed or were within the margin of appreciation. </p>

That said, they will rarely, if ever, be determinative of P&#8217;s &#8216;best interests&#8217;.  Respecting individual autonomy does not always require P&#8217;s wishes to be afforded predominant weight. Sometimes it will be right to do so, sometimes it will not. The factors that fall to be considered in this intensely complex process are infinitely variable e.g. the nature of the contemplated treatment, how intrusive such treatment might be and crucially what the outcome of that treatment maybe for the individual patient. Into that complex matrix the appropriate weight to be given to P&#8217;s wishes will vary. What must be stressed is the obligation imposed by statute to inquire into these matters and for the decision maker fully to consider them. Finally, I would observe that an assessment of P&#8217;s wishes, views and attitudes are not to be confined within the narrow parameters of what P may have said. Strong feelings are often expressed non-verbally, sometimes in contradistinction to what is actually said. Evaluating the wider canvass may involve deriving an understanding of P&#8217;s views from what he may have done in the past in circumstances which may cast light on the strength of his views on the contemplated treatment. Mr Patel, counsel acting on behalf of M, has pointed to recent case law which he submits, and I agree, has emphasised the importance of giving proper weight to P&#8217;s wishes, feelings, beliefs and values see Wye Valley NHS Trust v B.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">The Court must take account of paragraphs 5.31 &#8211; 5.35 of the Code of Practice when making decisions about life-sustaining treatment:</p>

		  <num style="font-style:italic">&#8220;5.29</num>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.25in"><span style="font-style:italic">A special factor in the checklist applies to decisions about treatment which is necessary to keep the person alive (&#8216;life-sustaining treatment&#8217;) and this is set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(5)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. The fundamental rule is that anyone who is deciding whether or not life-sustaining treatment is in the best interests of someone who lacks capacity to consent to or refuse such treatment must not be motivated by a desire to bring about the person&#8217;s death. 5.30 Whether a treatment is &#8216;life-sustaining&#8217; depends not only on the type of treatment, but also on the particular circumstances in which it may be prescribed. For example, in some situations giving antibiotics may be life-sustaining, whereas in other circumstances antibiotics are used to treat a non-life- threatening condition. It is up to the doctor or healthcare professional providing treatment to assess whether the treatment is life-sustaining in each particular situation. 5.31 All reasonable steps which are in the person&#8217;s best interests should be taken to prolong their life. There will be a limited number of cases where treatment is futile, overly burdensome to the patient or where there is no prospect of recovery. In circumstances such as these, it may be that an assessment of best interests leads to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the patient to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment, even if this may result in the person&#8217;s death. The decision-maker must make a decision based on the best interests of the person who lacks capacity. They must not be motivated by a desire to bring about the person&#8217;s death for whatever reason, even if this is from a sense of compassion. Healthcare and social care staff should also refer to relevant professional guidance when making decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment. 5.32 As with all decisions, before deciding to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment, the decision-maker must consider the range of treatment options available to work out what would be in the person&#8217;s best interests. All the factors in the best interests checklist should be considered, and in particular, the decision-maker should consider any statements that the person has previously made about their wishes and feelings about life-sustaining treatment. Importantly, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(5)</ref> cannot be interpreted to mean that doctors are under an obligation to provide, or to continue to provide, life-sustaining treatment where that treatment is not in the best interests of the person, even where the person&#8217;s death is foreseen. Doctors must apply the best interests&#8217; checklist and use their professional skills to decide whether life-sustaining treatment is in the person&#8217;s best interests. If the doctor&#8217;s assessment is disputed, and there is no other way of resolving the dispute, ultimately the Court of Protection may be asked to decide what is in the person&#8217;s best interests. 5.34 Where a person has made a written statement in advance that requests particular medical treatments, such as artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH), these requests should be taken into account by the treating doctor in the same way as requests made by a patient who has the capacity to make such decisions. Like anyone else involved in making this decision, the doctor must weigh written statements alongside all other relevant factors to decide whether it is in the best interests of the patient to provide or continue life-sustaining treatment. 5.35 If someone has made an advance decision to refuse life-sustaining treatment, specific rules apply. More information about these can be found in chapter 9 and in paragraph 5.45 below. 5.36 As mentioned in paragraph 5.33 above, where there is any doubt about the patient&#8217;s best interests, an application should be made to the Court of Protection for a decision as to whether withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment is in the patient&#8217;s best interests.&#8221;</span></p>

In particular I must consider the values and beliefs of ROO as well as any views she expressed when she had capacity that shed light on the likely choice she would make if she were able to and what she would have considered relevant or important. Where those views can be ascertained with sufficient certainty they should carry great weight and usually should be followed; as they would be for a person with capacity who did express such views. </p>

The subarachnoid haemorrhage was principally on the left side of her brain and so affected her right-sided function to a greater extent. She was in hospital for 7 months and in a rehabilitation unit for a further 4 months before being discharged to Burdon Grange nursing home on 8 June 2009. Her physical condition improved between 2009 and 2012 and she was able to walk with the support of two nurses - ROA has produced photographs of her walking with support in 2011. She is recorded as being able to propel herself around in a wheelchair, was eating well and regained urinary continence.  She required 24 hour nursing care and was prone to seizures. Her PEG tube was removed. The later MRI scans showed that blood from the haemorrhage had tracked down into the spine and had left scarring which Dr Harrower considered explained the significant lower limb disability that ROO experienced.</p>

A MRI scan on 17 December 2012 showed a possible new right middle cerebral artery infarct. Her physical health and cognitive function thereafter declined. By 2013, ROO was unable to stand, required hoisting out of bed and required assistance with all activities of daily living, including feeding, medication and personal care. Her language remained extremely limited. She started to decline food and medication and her weight began to fall.</p>

She underwent psychiatric review but no depressive illness was diagnosed, although she was administered anti-depressant and appetite stimulation medication as a trial but no benefit was observed. No evidence of any underlying malignancy was found on whole body CT scan on 12 July 2018.  Her malnutrition was considered to be a consequence of her dementia.

It was considered that ROO&#8217;s weight loss was in keeping with her diagnosis of dementia. The MDT (multi-disciplinary team) felt that she could safely meet her nutritional requirements orally with support and encouragement. A 3 month trial of oral nutrition was recommended. Artificial nutrition in the form of a NG tube or PEG tube feeding was discussed. There is a dispute as to what ROA&#8217;s position was at this meeting.  RAO was recorded as stating that ROO would hate an NG tube or PEG tube but he disputes this. I do not think I am assisted in the determination of this case by needing to resolve that disagreement. The MDT concluded that artificial nutrition is not what she would wish.</p>

This procedure was recommended by Mr Ian Pople, consultant neurosurgeon at the Southmead Hospital, Bristol. Mr Pople expressed the view, having viewed a MRI scan from October 2013, that it was possible that her ventricles had become slightly larger compared to a MRI scan in 2008 and that the shunt was not adequately draining fluid. However, Dr Harrower, consultant neurologist, at the Hospital reported to Mr Pople that despite trying it was not possible to secure any sample of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). Dr Harrower remarked, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I am wondering whether that might be information in itself, indicating that possibly the shunt is working effectively</span>.&#8221;  Mr Pople advised on 14 August 2014 that he did not consider it appropriate to pursue the lumbar puncture saying, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I do not think it is appropriate to pursue the lumbar puncture and agree with a more conservative approach.&#8221; </span>I&#8217;m not sure what ROO&#8217;s weight was at this time but it does not appear to have been suggested that malnutrition played any part in the dry lumbar puncture result.</p>

He said that this is the only therapeutic manoeuvre that he could offer from a neurosurgical point of view but the chance of success in terms of improving her neurological condition is probably in the region of less than 50%, with potential risks and complications such as bleeding, infection and deep vein thrombosis in the order of 10% which could cause a significant deterioration in her condition. He invited the GP to discuss with ROA whether she should go through those procedures. &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The question is whether or not you and </span>ROA<span style="font-style:italic"> feel that she should go through these invasive procedures to give her a chance of improving, accepting that there could be a significant deterioration in her condition if she develops complications from the surgery&#8230;It would involve a new burr hole in the right frontal region to insert the reservoir and re-opening of the wound on the right side of the head to replace the ventricular catheter.

He said that the ventricles were of very reasonable size and do not show signs of under drainage. &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I do not think that CSF disturbance (shunt malfunction) accounts for her clinical picture of neurological deterioration.

This is not caused by a build-up of fluid (hydrocephalus) in the ventricles but rather is the brain itself diminishing in size. The build-up of fluid would cause pressure in the head and affect neurological function but that is not what the imaging shows. The ventricles are particularly large on the side of the subarachnoid haemorrhage where the neurons are dying back and have created space. If this were hydrocephalus then the architecture on the other side of the brain would also be affected. If the shunt were over draining the imaging may show the brain shrinking away from the skull or sinking down and radiologically there is no evidence of this.</span></p>

One third of patients who suffer a stroke experience post stroke dementia. Her general decline in physical and cognitive ability and the imaging both support this diagnosis. It is likely that her brain has suffered further damage as a result of the very serious infection and its consequences in August 2018 and the prolonged two hour epileptic seizure in September 2018. Both contribute to a reduction in the functioning of the brain.  The general progression of vascular dementia is a decline in abilities. This often is not a steady decline but a decline in steps. The severe illness in August and the epileptic seizure have reduced her abilities and she is unable to recover a previous level of ability. For instance her swallow is deteriorating although she is still able to but the risk of aspirating food into her lungs is increasing. </span></p>

Limited information is available but he appears to have conducted this assessment with specific reference to her ability to make decisions about medical treatment for her conditions including whether to have artificial nutritional support. Dr Rowlands, consultant locum psychiatrist, carried out a psychiatric assessment of ROO on 8 October 2018. Whilst she did not specifically assess capacity, she stated that ROO&#8217;s presentation was in keeping with progressive cognitive decline and physical frailty secondary to vascular dementia on a background of previous subarachnoid haemorrhage and ischaemic events.

The 2015 ESPEN guidance also advises against the initiation of tube feeding in patients with severe dementia. Mr Johnston referred to studies which were referred to by Dr Ahmad in his statement. In a large-scale study involving over 36,000 nursing home residents with advanced dementia and eating problems it concluded that there was no difference in survival rates between those who underwent artificial feeding and those who were maintained on oral nutrition. The 2018 ESPEN guideline on clinical nutrition and hydration in geriatrics advises against tube feeding or intravenous feeding when no benefits for the patient are expected and refers to patients with incurable disease which cannot be improved by any treatment including nutritional support (e.g. advanced dementia). The patient&#8217;s comfort is the highest priority.</span></p>

He also dealt in some detail with the insertion of a tube into the stomach or the small bowel. Given that neither are in issue in this case I do not intend to deal with them further. He was clear that the current line which is being used to deliver hydration could not be used to deliver nutrition. He said the risks of infection are too great. A further line would have to be inserted which would involve the insertion of the needle and line which would be fed up through the vein in the upper arm or chest wall into one of the large veins close to the heart. The delivery of nutrition by intravenous line has to be into one of the large blood vessels because of the effect it could have on smaller blood vessels. Following the insertion of the line the nutrient levels in ROO&#8217;s blood would have to be very carefully monitored over at least the next 10 days. High levels of nutrients can be as dangerous as low levels and can cause organ failure in themselves. Thus ROO would have to undergo blood testing on a daily basis as well is blood glucose testing. The testing would then guide the amounts of the component parts of the nutrition that were delivered. Without that testing ROO would be at risk of serious organ damage through imbalances in the nutrient levels in her blood. As I understand that this is re-feeding syndrome. In addition to this because of the nature of the nutrients infection is a serious risk. Whilst those who are able to manage their intravenous lines can minimise this risk and can lead ordinary lives it remains a risk. The presence of an infection in a person with intravenous nutrition being provided is a very serious matter given the placing of the line and the needle near the heart. It is an automatic blue-light admission to hospital. The administration of artificial nutrition through an intravenous line would require ROO to be attached to a line and bag for at least 12 hours per day. Although there is no reason why a nursing home cannot manage intravenous nutrition some are reluctant to do it and would need training. Although an intravenous line is not uncomfortable in the way a naso-gastric tube is and is less at risk of being pulled out by a patient there is still a risk of it being removed or more seriously being pushed into the arm with the consequent risk of infection. Dr Johnston noted that ROO had not interfered with the current intravenous line delivering hydration. Further complications can involve blockage.</span></p>

Removing her from an acute medical ward with all of the distractions that entailed and putting her in a more natural environment where her family and her nursing staff would be able to encourage her to eat and to take an enjoyment from it would be a more productive route forward.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">It emerges from ROA&#8217;s statement and his submissions that the central concern that he has is that in 2014 the dry tap lumbar puncture gave rise to concern that the shunt was not operating correctly and was either over draining or under draining and that this was impacting upon ROO&#8217;s neurological functioning.  He is concerned that at that stage Mr Pople had indicated that a further operation might be appropriate in order to investigate further and perhaps to replace the shunt. ROA&#8217;s position is that in effect Mr Pople was put off from doing that by interventions by the wider family and by perhaps Dr Harrower and thus that the opinion he expressed in 2014 remains a valid one and should be further considered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">However it is clear from the medical evidence that has emerged since 2014 and in particular the views of Professor Whitfield, who has considerable experience and expertise in this area, that the issue of a malfunctioning shunt has been explored by him as well as other neurology clinicians and has been discounted. His letters of May 2018 and September 2018 comprehensively address the question of the functioning of the shunt and whether any investigations remain outstanding in relation to concerns over whether it is over or under draining. The summary of the medical evidence that I have set out above makes clear that he is quite satisfied that the imaging including a recent CT scan as well as the MRI scan show brain volume loss as a result of the severe subarachnoid haemorrhage she sustained in 2008 and that the ventricles do not have the appearance of CSF over drainage or subdural collections consistent with over drainage. Dr Harrower also considered that there was no imaging evidence of hydrocephalus or suggestive that the shunt was blocked. The clear balance of opinion of all of the neurological clinicians is that ROO&#8217;s current condition is well explained by the subarachnoid haemorrhage and subsequent events and that a malfunctioning shunt is not a contributory factor and thus requires no further investigation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">The totality of the imaging evidence in combination with the clinical picture of a deterioration in physical and cognitive functioning is entirely consistent with a severe insult to the brain as a result of the severe subarachnoid haemorrhage which was subsequently compounded by the further ischaemic damage sustained in/further stroke in 2012 and which has progressed further through small vessel ischaemic damage. Thus the medical evidence overwhelmingly points to ROO&#8217;s current neurological condition being attributable to those causes which took place in 2008/2012 and subsequent further progressive changes compounded by acute events such as the infection in August 2018 and the epileptic seizure on 29 September 2018. Whether these are appropriately described as damage to the structures of the brain or whether they are described as vascular dementia does not alter the fundamental issue which is that the evidence clearly demonstrates that ROO is suffering from irreversible changes in her brain as a result of those incidents. She is not suffering from the consequences of a malfunctioning shunt either over draining or failing to drain CSF fluid from the brain. Her condition is therefore irreversible and has been in my view fully explored. Even Mr Pople who is central to ROA&#8217;s arguments has himself indicated that no further investigations or treatment are appropriate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">If that is the case then in medical terms ROO meets the diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia of a severe and progressive kind. Sadly it is irreversible and will continue to deteriorate. The clear evidence of the treating clinicians and Dr Johnston is that loss of appetite and consequent weight loss is a well-recognised feature of dementia. It is also sadly clear that ROO has already reached a stage where her physical functioning has deteriorated to such an extent that she is unable to undertake any physical activity. The severe pneumonia she suffered from in August 2018 and the severe epileptic fit she experienced in September 2018 further diminished her functioning. She is not able even to sit and cannot undertake either active or passive resistant physiotherapy. That being so she is unable to reverse the loss of muscle mass which she is experiencing as a consequence of not consuming sufficient calories and not being able to undertake any form of physical exercise. The nutrition that she consumes appears currently to be maintaining for instance her electrolyte and blood glucose levels within normal parameters such that she is not at immediate risk of organ failure. There is thus no need to provide artificial nutrition to redress imbalances in these respects. The provision of artificial nutrition might provide more calories than she currently takes by her oral intake but will not convert into a benefit for her in terms of an improvement in her muscle mass. It will therefore add nothing to her well-being. The evidence of Dr Johnston was very clear that ROA&#8217;s belief that an increase in calorie count will result in an increase in her energy levels and functioning is mistaken.  Although it might increase her BMI above the identified critical level at which organ failure or sudden death becomes an issue that is illusory because the BMI index itself does not accurately reflect what causes those risks to arise. Unless the BMI increase is reflecting an increase in muscle mass it is of no benefit to ROO. The evidence referred to by Dr Ahmad and Dr Johnston of the large-scale study of patients with dementia demonstrates that there is no benefit in terms of length of life to patients as between artificial nutrition and oral nutrition. Thus the evidence establishes that there is no benefit to ROO in administering artificial nutrition given that she is still able to take nutrition orally.</p>

The clear evidence of Dr Johnston is that this is simply not borne out by medical knowledge as I have set out above. He notes that when ROO was in hospital in the summer she gained 3kg in weight but there was no discernible improvement in her functioning and he says this supports his conclusions. I agree.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">What appears to be clear is that ROO does fluctuate in her presentation. A simple marker of this is contained in the record of the calories that she consumed as noted by the Official Solicitor in the period 4 - 9 October which ranged from 400 cal through to 1445 cal. The evidence also suggests that her level of engagement with even her sons and ROA varies as it does with the medical staff. That fluctuation in her presentation is not linked to whether she has consumed more or less calories as Mr Johnston identified. It is a feature of her underlying neurological condition rather than a function of nutrition. Therefore providing more nutrition will not have a causal effect upon her level of engagement. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">The evidence in relation to ROO&#8217;s wishes and feelings in relation to the application is very limited. She of course does not currently have capacity. She has not given any advance directive in relation to her treatment and there is nothing in writing elsewhere from her which would indicate what her views would be in respect of the treatment proposed. In respect of what she said to the hospital staff and the indication she gave to Dr Brooke I do not think it&#8217;s safe to place any reliance on that as her real indication of what she wishes to happen to her. The evidence suggests that at times when she is in a better condition she engages with her children and ROA and takes pleasure from that interaction. She may also still gain pleasure from eating or contemplation. At other times she may have an awareness of her condition and may wonder whether it is worth continuing. In particular if she is feeling unwell she might understandably express a wish to die but I do not think that much, if any, weight can be placed on this in the context of what else is known about ROO. She is described as a fighter, independent, a believer in the circle of life. There are also though indications that while she does not have capacity she is unhappy at intrusive medical treatment or other intrusions into her personal space. She removed the nasogastric tube. She declined medication, food, she does not want a nasogastric tube reinserted. That suggests that she does not welcome further medical intervention, and the more intrusive it is the less she would welcome it. I therefore do not think she would want to be subjected to intrusive treatment which would accompany intravenous feeding. It is clear that an intravenous line would have to be inserted and that it would require intensive medical intervention in terms of monitoring thereafter. I do not consider from what I&#8217;m able to glean of her wishes and feelings that she would want this to be undertaken particularly if she knew that the medical evidence was that it would not actually bring any benefit to her. Nor do I consider she would be likely to want to undergo further investigations such as a further lumbar puncture still less an operation when the medical evidence was that it was neither necessary or appropriate. The evidence is that she needed to be sedated for the 2014 lumbar puncture which indicates that she was not comfortable with that.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in">Due to the nature of her neurological condition ROO will not recover in a way which will lead to her eating enough to keep her alive. The nature of the progressive vascular dementia that she is suffering from is such that she will sustain loss of appetite and will wish to eat less and less as time passes. That is an inevitable consequence of her condition. There is therefore no prospect of her reaching a position where she can eat enough to keep herself alive in the sense that it appears in the application; namely that she will recover to a position where she will want to and will be able to eat anything approaching a normal diet which would be accompanied by exercise in a way which would sustain her life. Thus having regard in particular to the evidence of Dr Johnston and the guidance on artificial nutrition in patients with dementia there is no benefit to ROO of giving artificial nutrition and nor do I believe she would want to be given it having regard to the intrusive nature of it being administered and the risks of complications which accompany it. I therefore do not consider it to be in ROO&#8217;s best interests in the circumstances she currently is in to be given artificial feeding by way of intravenous nutrition.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.25in">The medical evidence clearly establishes the nature of ROO&#8217;s neurological condition. There has been a full investigation and insofar as medical science allows there is a definitive diagnosis. There is no need or purpose in further investigation or attempts to reach an alternative diagnosis. The only alternative identified by ROA namely the malfunctioning shunt has been comprehensively addressed and discounted by a number of doctors including Professor Whitfield. I therefore do not find that it is in ROO&#8217;s best interests to have further investigations in order to reach an alternative diagnosis. Dr Brooke told me, as I have referred to earlier, that ROO is still being given treatment for her condition. She is not being treated as an end-of-life patient at the current time. She has been given antibiotics and other medication for instance. In that sense she is not on what ROA describes as a palliative care regime. The evidence is that ROO is in a stable condition and fit to be discharged to a nursing home where she would continue to be nursed in a manner appropriate to her deteriorating condition. I therefore conclude that it is not in ROO&#8217;s best interests for her to be taken off palliative care until there has been a full investigation and definitive diagnosis of the cause of her deterioration since 2012. </p>

ROA says that she should remain in hospital albeit being transferred to the North Devon hospital nearer to ROA and her sons. The NHS Trust and Dr Johnston have concluded that there is no purpose to be served in her remaining on an acute medical ward and given my conclusions in respect of artificial nutrition and further neurological investigational treatment, I am in agreement with them. Dr Johnston in particular, having regard to the various guidelines, identified that to maximise the quality of life that ROO has and in particular to maximise the environment in which she takes oral nutrition and is able to interact with people a transfer to a nursing home close to her sons and ROA would appear to be in her best interests. The more relaxed and natural environment of a nursing home would be more conducive to her engagement with her family and other aspects of her life including feeding than the environment of an acute medical ward. I do not therefore agree that it is not in her best interests to be discharged from hospital in her present condition. As matters stand it would appear that her best interests would be met by transfer to a local nursing home.</p>

I did not have the evidence before me or the time available to do so. The issue of ROO&#8217;s future care therefore is a matter for discussion between the NHS Trust and her family. No doubt the contents of this judgment in relation to various aspects will inform those discussions but I have not sought to give any determination as to the future save in respect of the issue of discharge from hospital to a nursing home.
