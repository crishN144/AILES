Secondly, if there has been a change, the Court then has a discretion to decide whether leave should be given, and in exercising that discretion the children&#8217;s welfare is relevant but not paramount, and the question for the Court is whether, in all the circumstances, including the mother&#8217;s prospects of success in securing revocation of the placement order and the children&#8217;s interests, leave should be given.</span></p>

It was described in glowing terms by all the professionals who had observed the contact, but what was so puzzling about this mother was she was someone who on the one hand has such strength of feeling and empathy for her children with strong maternal instincts, yet she seems completely unable to acknowledge the history of what had happened and the future risks to her and the children. </span></p>

That work was undertaken by Ms G, the experienced social worker who had been allocated the case since March 2013, and Mr. Y, the children&#8217;s guardian.  It became clear during the work that was undertaken that when pressed about certain matters there had not been a full acceptance by the mother of the Court&#8217;s findings in September; she minimised them, in particular the father&#8217;s violence to her.  I reached the same conclusion in October after hearing the mother give oral evidence.  At the hearing in October neither the local authority nor the guardian supported any further assessment of the mother.  </span></p>

He said the mother is not yet in a position to fully protect her children; the level of protection these children require is not yet within the mother&#8217;s reach.  She needed to fully acknowledge and accept and take consistent action.  He believed the mother had developed a degree of emotional detachment as a way of coping, which is why, if the Court was minded to allow any further assessment, which he did not support, he said it should be done by a forensic psychologist, because Dr. R&#8217;s report is clear that the mother does not suffer from any mental illness.</span></p>

As is clear from that judgment it was a decision reached with great sadness because of the powerful evidence of the strength of the relationship between this mother and her young children.  At the hearing in November I&#160;made a final care order and a placement order, and endorsed the plan that was put forward by the local authority for the children to be adopted.  Following that hearing contact between the mother and the children was reduced in accordance with the plan I approved.  It was reduced to twice a week for six weeks and then once a week for the following three weeks, fortnightly from December till the end of January. Then one contact in February and since March there has been monthly contact.</span></p>

He reports that they are progressing well.  He describes the children as being well settled in their current placement, with a good routine.  He notes that the foster carer reports no difficulties following the mother&#8217;s contact, and he noted the contact records show that the contact between the mother and the children is reported to be very positive.  In his statement he notes that since the conclusion of the care proceedings FM has made changes to her life which suggest that she has contemplated the need for her children to live in an environment which is free from domestic violence and that she has moved to a place of safety.  At paragraph 31 he says:</span></p>

The essence of her evidence is that the assessment of the current carers has progressed well.  She has met with them on five occasions and plans more visits next week.  If the assessment, as is expected, continues to be positive, the plan is to present the couple for approval as adopters and match them with the children at the local authority&#8217;s Adoption and Permanency Panel on 24 July, so in less than four weeks&#8217; time.

The mother alleges in her statement that they were entirely controlling of her, she was under the constant threat from them that she should not say anything to the police that would cause any difficulties for the father. They threatened her if she harmed the father in any way.  She said she always knew she wanted to get out of that environment, but was unable to because she was frightened.  It is right to record that is a very different account from the account she gave Mr.&#160;Y, who visited the mother at Ms M&#8217;s house on Friday 20 September 2013. There is a detailed note by him of that visit in the papers.  Effectively, he was told that these were friends of the mother&#8217;s, that they were entirely supportive of her, and Mr. Y&#8217;s oral evidence to the Court at this hearing is that he was entirely satisfied at that time, even though he was aware of the concerns that there were about the controlling nature of the father and the father&#8217;s family, that this was an entirely supportive arrangement that supported the mother. Despite his considerable experience as a social worker and as a&#160;guardian, he detected no sign of this mother being in fear or being under threat from either Ms M or her daughter.</span></p>

When he gave evidence he said that he was not able to support the mother&#8217;s application.  He, like Ms G, has had the benefit of having been involved in these proceedings since the very early stages in March 2013.  Whilst he recognised the steps the mother had taken in leaving the property she had been living in before, he said she was at the beginning of that journey and he did not consider it was necessary for the Court to have any further assessment from Dr. R as he did not see that such an assessment was going to add to what was already known.  The work that was to be necessary for this mother to undertake would in his view take at least six months, and is more likely to require 12 months.

The mother has said in her statement that there were only two occasions of physical violence, yet that was not what she said to Dr. A, as I set out at paragraph 21 of my judgment in September.  The second matter that would need very careful investigation would be the precise circumstances of where the mother was living up until December 2013. Who she was living with, whether the people she lived with were in fact members of the father&#8217;s family, as she now says, or whether they were the friends who she persuasively presented to the guardian when he visited in September and who he observed the mother having such a warm and supportive relationship with.  Either way, there is a considerable level of deception, either by the mother or by the people she was living with.  The third matter that would need to be considered by way of a forensic process that would encapsulate the matters I have just set out is the position regarding the mother&#8217;s honesty as was set out at paragraph 98.4 of the September judgment. I accepted the powerful point made by the local authority of the need for those supporting the mother on the ground to have trust in her and confidence in her honesty and reliability.

She set out in her report in July, and in her oral evidence to me in September, what further assessments were required.  I agree with Mr. Y that a further report from her is not necessary, it would not add to what is already known about the work that is required and the broad timescales involved.  </span></p>

It is an application and a decision that the Court has made despite the changes the mother has made, for which she should be commended.  The conclusion is reached with a very heavy heart because I know how much the mother wants her children to be returned to her care, but I consider the prospects of her successfully revoking the placement order to be remote and in those circumstances refuse the application for leave to revoke that order.</span></p>
