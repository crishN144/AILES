An earlier application for permission to appeal the original fact finding judgment had been dismissed by Peel J on the basis that it was totally without merit.</p>

The appeal was dismissed but, in the course of the judgment, it was unfortunately necessary to express criticism of the approach taken by the Association of Clinical Psychologists [&#8216;ACP&#8217; or &#8216;the association&#8217;] which had been given permission to intervene in the appeal proceedings (see particularly paragraphs 51 to 56 of the appeal judgment).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8216;29. Nor in my view is it a good reason to depart from the general principle that this was an appeal rather than a first instance trial. Once again, the fact that it is an appeal rather than a trial may be relevant to whether or not a party has behaved reasonably in relation to the litigation. As Wall LJ pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">In re M (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/311" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 311" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 311</ref>, there are differences between trials and appeals. At first instance, &#8220;nobody knows what the judge is going to find&#8221; (para 23), whereas on appeal the factual findings are known. Not only that, the judge&#8217;s reasons are known. Both parties have an opportunity to &#8220;take stock&#8221; (para 24), and consider whether they should proceed to advance or resist an appeal and to negotiate on the basis of what they now know. So it may well be that conduct which was reasonable at first instance is no longer reasonable on appeal. But in my view that does not alter the principles to be applied: it merely alters the application of those principles to the circumstances of the case.&#8217;</p>

But, in terms of the mother having any prospect of success, her chances turned entirely upon the case being made by the intervenors. In terms of her own case, she had no prospect of success in the absence of any authority (in terms of statute, regulation or other provision) or evidence to establish the proposition that Ms Gill was not qualified.</p>

He is also correct that, had it not been for the court adjourning in order to receive further submissions from the ACP, the appeal hearing would have concluded on the first day.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Drawing matters together, I do find that the mother&#8217;s conduct in bringing and prosecuting this appeal was unreasonable as, in reality, she had no basis upon which to mount her argument that Ms Gill was not qualified to act as an expert. I also accept that the father was obliged to engage in the appeal as the key respondent. Against the litigation history of these proceedings, the warnings that she has been given, and HHJ Davies&#8217; earlier order for costs, the mother will have known that, should she fail, there was a real prospect of an application for costs, yet she persisted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court therefore has jurisdiction to make a costs order against her in favour of the father. I do not, however, consider that it is either fair or proportionate to order that she should pay all of his costs. For reasons that have already been set out, the appeal process took off and moved on out of the mother&#8217;s direct control. Taking a very high level approach, and without looking at any minute apportionment of responsibility, I consider that it is appropriate for there to be an order that the mother should pay one half of the father&#8217;s costs of the appeal , that being half of the father&#8217;s costs in the disclosed costs schedule for the appeal hearing. Approaching the issue in the manner described in <span style="font-style:italic">Arcadia Group Brands Ltd</span>, I do not consider that the mother&#8217;s litigation conduct has gone beyond promoting a hopeless case; there is no evidence of some ulterior motive. The position seems to be that she simply does not, and will not, accept the sound findings that HHJ Davies has made. The costs order will therefore be on the standard basis and the father&#8217;s application for costs on an indemnity basis is refused. (The mother has, since my draft judgment was provided to Counsel, now agreed with the father to pay the father&#8217;s costs in the sum of &#163;26,176,79 within 3 months of the date of this judgment rather than seek detailed assessment, and that will be reflected in my order).</p>

The mother&#8217;s attack on Ms Gill&#8217;s qualification as an expert was front and centre of the mother&#8217;s appeal yet, as I have held, the reality was that the mother had no means of establishing this central claim. It was entirely reasonable for Ms Gill, whose professional standing was on the line, to apply to intervene in the appeal and to be represented. </p>

The appropriate and proportionate order is for the mother to pay one half of Ms Gill&#8217;s costs which may either be fixed at the figure of &#163;20,000 including VAT which I summarily assess or taxed on a standard basis. Ms Gill accepts the court&#8217;s summary assessment of &#163;20,000 costs to be paid by the mother.</p>
