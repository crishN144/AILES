	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.08in">L, H's half-brother, was born in May 2020.  The Local Authority issued proceedings.  Historically, there had been significant interventions by the Local Authority in 2017 as a result of a number of aspects of the mother's lifestyle: drug-taking; sustained alcohol dependency; the mental health and depression of the mother, including attempted suicide and self-harm -  the mother had been diagnosed as having an unstable personality disorder; and finally the mother having a history of abusive relationships. As a result of the unresolved issue of the injuries found to H, and no doubt fuelled, although not a factor in this hearing, by his death, those were all matters raised by the  local authority. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.08in">The current matter was made no easier because in fact the mother's pregnancy only came to light three weeks prior to L's birth.  Initially the mother and L were placed together in  mother and baby foster care , and then subsequently in a residential unit.  It was whilst there, although the concerns had increased throughout the period, that the Local Authority - anxious that the conditions provided for L appeared to be replicating those apparently given to H, i.e., the mother was tired and emotional, and was unable to care for L properly - applied on 15 July 2019 for separation.  That was sanctioned by HHJ Clark on 17 July, since when L has remained in foster care. </p>

Then mother was a suspect, she being the primary carer, and the grandmother too was joined, she having provided supportive care given as one might anticipate.  In addition, somewhat later, two further people, A and B, were also added as intervenors. </p>

On the evidence, which was clear, I agreed,  and at the conclusion of that second week  gave judgment removing both from the ambit of  enquiry.  Having now heard all the evidence , I am fortified that that was  entirely the correct decision,  strengthening the conclusions that I reached then, even though it must be a rare case when such a course could or even should be taken. </p>

I do not propose to summarise every witness.  I shall simply point to some of the headlines of some of the witnesses, both the medical and the lay witnesses, but it should not be thought that I haven&#8217;t taken into account all the evidence .I have received some very helpful and thought-provoking written submissions.  In a case such as this, it illustrates the importance of specialist advocates who are able to focus on the issues.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.08in">In determining the issues at this fact finding hearing I apply the following well established legal principles. These are helpfully summarised by Baker J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v M and F and L and M</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/1569" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 1569 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 1569 (Fam)</ref>.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.05in;margin-right:0.07in">The burden of proof lies with the Local Authority. It is the Local Authority which brings the proceedings and identifies the findings that they invite the Court to make. The burden of proving the assertions rests with them.  I bear in mind at all times that the burden is fairly and squarely placed on the Local Authority, and not on either parent. Recent case law (such as <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>2013 UKSC and <span style="font-style:italic">Re BS </span>2013 EWCA 1146) reinforces the importance of proper findings based on proper facts; the principles are the same for whatever the proposed outcome. Here there is, as in many cases, a risk of a shift in the burden to the parents to explain occasions when injuries might have occurred. Whilst that can be an important component for the medical experts, it is not for the parents to explain but for the local authority to establish. There is no pseudo burden as Mostyn J put in <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire</span> v <span style="font-style:italic">R</span> 2013 EWHC 3064 (fam). As HHJ Bellamy said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re FM (A Clinical Fractures: Bone Density):</span> [2015] EWFC B26. &#8220;Where&#8230; there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible, alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the Court is not &#8220;has that alternative explanation been proved&#8221; but rather&#8230; &#8220;in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the Court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability.&#8221; </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.05in;margin-right:0.07in">The standard of proof of course is the balance of probabilities (<span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2008/35" uk:canonical="[2008] UKHL 35" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] UKHL 35</ref>). If the Local Authority proves on the balance of probabilities that baby A was killed by the mother or sustained inflicted injuries at her hands the Court treats that facts as established and all future decision concerning the future welfare of B, based on that finding. Equally if the Local Authority fails to prove those facts the Courts disregards the allegations completely.  </p>

In other words, there has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown. That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof. It is simply a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the causation advanced by the one shouldering the burden of proof is established on the balance of probabilities&#8230; a conclusion of unknown aetiology in respect of an infant represents neither a professional or forensic failure.

He was very clear as to the mechanisms, supporting mostly what Dr Watt had said, that in relation to the ribs there had been a forceful side-to-side squeezing, he thought at the severe end of force.  In relation to the gripping, he thought that it would be the cause of extreme distress.  In relation to the leg injuries, he did not consider that that may have been caused by what has been referred to as "flailing limbs&#8221;.  In fact, he supported what the other witnesses had found,  on the day-to-day presentation, I intend no disrespect , I prefer Dr Cartlidge, who as a consultant paediatrician,  has had more day-to-day clinical experience of the living. </p>

Firstly, in relation to osteogenesis imperfecta, some of the query in relation to Professor Mangham's opinion had arisen from the experts' meeting, and he, Dr Cartlidge, was astute as to the observance or otherwise of bone disease or fragility or some other condition.

Of course, with osteogenesis imperfecta there would be possibly less force, possibly very little force, but nonetheless he still considered that , despite submissions to the contrary,  there would have been some memorable event. </p>

In relation to the former, it was perfectly obvious that the mother was not telling the truth about that.  I simply do not accept her account about Aat all, but the mother was happy for the edges to be blurred, and for the waters to be muddied if it deflected focus and responsibility away from her, and it was illustrated equally clearly by her evidence in relation toB, who was at the time she was complaining about in reality just feet away from her.  Indeed, as was evident during the hearing, photographs were taken of what was taking place that day, and if something really untoward had occurred, it is inconceivable that the mother, who was trying very hard to be a good mother, would not have intervened, and have done and said something. </p>

It was, after all, the maternal grandmother who urged that the mother should have some urgent medical intervention because she was so anxious that she was suffering from post-natal depression.

Their evidence and my assessment of them in the witness box is strongly determinative of my conclusions.  There is no reliable account at all for any mechanism for causation regardless of the level of force.  The mother was the primary carer; the grandmother gave occasional respite care.

Witnesses: the health visitor; the social worker; the support worker; the maternal grandmother, all speak highly of the mother's attuned care, and of her strong desire to be as good a mother, indeed a perfect mother, as she could.  The maternal grandmother knowing of her difficulties in particular was proud of what she had achieved. </p>
