The absence of any history of a memorable event where such a history might be expected in the individual case may be very significant.  Perpetrators of child abuse often seek to cover up what they have done.  The reason why paediatricians may refer to the lack of a history is because individual and collective clinical experience teaches them that it is one of a number of indicators of how the injury may have occurred.  Medical and other professionals are entitled to rely upon such knowledge and experience in forming an opinion about the likely response of the individual child to the particular injury, and the court should not deter them from doing so.  The weight that is then given to any such opinion is of course a matter for the judge.</p>

While everyone knows that memory is fallible, I do not believe that the legal system has sufficiently absorbed the lessons of a century of psychological research into the nature of memory and the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people&#8217;s memories are unreliable and believe our <marker name="tab"/>memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; <marker name="tab"/>and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate.&#8221;</p>

Is the emphatic witness putting on an act to deceive me, or is he speaking from the fullness of his heart, knowing that he is right?

Still less does it follow that there is no value in oral evidence. But research confirms that people do not in fact generally rely on demeanour to detect deception but on the fact that liars are more likely to tell stories that are illogical, implausible, internally inconsistent and contain fewer details than persons telling the truth: see Minzner, "Detecting Lies Using Demeanor, Bias and Context" (2008) 29 Cardozo LR 2557. One of the main potential benefits of cross-examination is that skilful questioning can expose inconsistencies in false stories.&#8221;</p>

However, the observations of Lord Hoffmann and Lady Hale, quoted at paragraph 12 above, make it clear that the same approach is to be applied to the identification of perpetrators as to any other factual issue in the case. This issue shows quite clearly that there is no necessary connection between the seriousness of an allegation and the improbability that it has taken place.

The cases are littered with references to a "finding of exculpation" or to "ruling out" a particular person as responsible for the harm suffered. This is, as the President indicated, to set the bar far too high. It suggests that parents and other carers are expected to prove their innocence beyond reasonable doubt. If the evidence is not such as to establish responsibility on the balance of probabilities it should nevertheless be such as to establish whether there is a real possibility that a particular person was involved. When looking at how best to protect the child and provide for his future, the judge will have to consider the strength of that possibility as part of the overall circumstances of the case.&#8221;</p>

It is a means of satisfying the attributable threshold condition that only arises where the court is satisfied that there has been significant harm arising from (in shorthand) ill-treatment and where the only &#8216;unknown&#8217; is which of a number of persons is responsible. So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way. Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible. In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not. There is no room for a finding of fact on the basis of &#8216;real possibility&#8217;, still less on the basis of suspicion. There is no such thing as a pool of one.</p>

As is made clear in Lancashire at [19], O and N at [27-28] and S-B at [43], the person is not a proven perpetrator but a possible perpetrator. That conclusion is then carried forward to the welfare stage, when the court will, as was said in S-B, &#8220;consider the strength of the possibility&#8221; that the person was involved as part of the overall circumstances of the case. At the same time it will, as Lord Nicholls put it in Lancashire, &#8220;keep firmly in mind that the parents have not been shown to be responsible for the child&#8217;s injuries.&#8221; In saying this, he recognised that a conclusion of this kind presents the court with a particularly difficult problem.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The concept of the pool of perpetrators should therefore, as was said in Lancashire, encroach only to the minimum extent necessary upon the general principles underpinning s.31(2). Centrally, it does not alter the general rule on the burden of proof. Where there are a number of people who might have caused the harm, it is for the local authority to show that in relation to each of them there is a real possibility that they did. No one can be placed into the pool unless that has been shown. This is why it is always misleading to refer to &#8216;exclusion from the pool&#8217;: see Re S-B at [43]. Approaching matters in that way risks, as Baroness Hale said, reversing the burden of proof.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">To guard against that risk, I would suggest that a change of language may be helpful. The court should first consider whether there is a &#8216;list&#8217; of people who had the opportunity to cause the injury. It should then consider whether it can identify the actual perpetrator on the balance of probability and should seek, but not strain, to do so: Re D (Children) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/472" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 472" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 472</ref> at [12]. Only if it cannot identify the perpetrator to the civil standard of proof should it go on to ask in respect of those on the list: "Is there a likelihood or real possibility that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries?" Only if there is should A or B or C be placed into the &#8216;pool&#8217;.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Likewise, it can be seen that the concept of a pool of perpetrators as a permissible means of satisfying the threshold was forged in cases concerning individuals who were &#8216;carers&#8217;. In Lancashire, the condition was interpreted to include non-parent carers. It was somewhat widened in North Yorkshire at [26] to include &#8216;people with access to the child&#8217; who might have caused injury. If that was an extension, it was a principled one. But at all events, the extension does not stretch to &#8220;anyone who had even a fleeting contact with the child in circumstances where there was the opportunity to cause injuries&#8221;: North Yorkshire at [25]. Nor does it extend to harm caused by someone outside the home or family unless it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it: S-B at [40].</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">It should also be noted that in the leading cases there were two, three or four known individuals from whom any risk to the child must have come. The position of each individual was then investigated and compared. That is as it should be. To assess the likelihood of harm having been caused by A or B or C, one needs as much information as possible about each of them in order to make the decision about which if any of them should be placed in the pool. So, where there is an imbalance of information about some individuals in comparison to others, particular care may need to be taken to ensure that the imbalance does not distort the assessment of the possibilities. The same may be said where the list of individuals has been whittled down to a pool of one named individual alongside others who are not similarly identified. This may be unlikely, but the present case shows that it is not impossible. Here it must be shown that there genuinely is a pool of perpetrators and not just a pool of one by default.&#8221;</p>

It is certainly not unknown for judges to give a negative answer to that type of question and, by reference to it, to proceed to identify the perpetrator of a second non-accidental injury.

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the "lie" is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is "capable of amounting to a corroboration".

He stated that although it was very occasionally possible to get a fatal subdural haemorrhage accidentally in a domestic environment, in this particular case it was inherently unlikely as the reported fall was from a standing height of 85cm. The nature and extent of the damage to the eyes made this particularly implausible. Although retinal haemorrhages may be seen in accidental head trauma, the fall would have to have been from a substantially greater height. In his opinion, the totality of the medical findings was explicable on the basis of inflicted head trauma such as being thrown onto a carpeted floor.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In my opinion on the balance of probabilities a blood clotting abnormality does not account for the pathological findings in relation to head injury in this case. Over and above this the other findings such as facial bruising at presentation and past bruises are much more typical of abusive injuries, as described, than spontaneous bruising with an underlying blood clotting disorder. Furthermore, a blood clotting disorder could not account for the abrasion injury to the ear nor the area of historic trauma to the thoracic spine. The further statement of KL does not cause me to alter my opinions. Whatever did or did not happen prior to impact with the carpeted fall it would still constitute a low-level fall in a domestic environment.&#8221;</p>

Along with her husband, she saw the mother and EF on average 2-3 times a month, so she had relied on the mother to tell her what was happening with EF.</p>

The father was concerned about these injuries when he saw them and when he was told about them by the mother. He had had regular discussions with the mother about what steps they could take to prevent EF receiving so many bruises. He was deceived by the mother, as I find, into believing that the mother had sought medical advice (save I accept that EF was eventually taken to have blood tests to exclude an organic explanation for the bruises).

The expert medical evidence was clear that EF had sustained a very traumatic head injury which had led to his almost immediate catastrophic and ultimately fatal collapse. There was only one possible perpetrator, the intervenor. However, rather than accept he had had a sudden and momentary loss of control and had injured EF, he embarked on producing a false account. He changed his account from EF being well when he got home to EF being unwell and lethargic for one reason only, to raise the possibility that some abusive act had been perpetrated by the mother before he had returned from work and which was the cause of EF&#8217;s collapse later that evening in his care.</p>

Accordingly, I am satisfied and find that there is a real possibility the mother and/ or the intervenor caused some or all of the inflicted soft tissue injuries. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the context of EF&#8217;s death, it might be thought that the soft tissue injuries are relatively trivial. They are not. They are indicative of the abusive care EF had to endure in the last three months of his life. Many, for example, the abdominal bruise and lesion on his back, howsoever caused, are likely to have been extremely painful. </p>

The intervenor chose not to give the court an honest account of the events of the evening of 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2019 when EF was in his sole care. Accordingly, I do not know how he inflicted EF&#8217;s catastrophic head injuries but, on the basis of the expert medical evidence, I am satisfied his injuries resulted from impact onto a non-yielding surface with or without an element of shaking. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have no hesitation in accepting the father&#8217;s explanation for the four bruises EF sustained when in his care. The father had no reason to suspect or believe that the intervenor would fatally injure EF. He is now consumed with grief for the loss of his much-loved young son and with guilt that he had not done more to protect him. I am satisfied and find that there was nothing more he reasonably could or should have done. I make no adverse findings against the father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As set out above, many of the bruises sustained by EF between April and early July 2019 were seen immediately after he had been in the sole care of the intervenor. I had considered making a finding that he inflicted these injuries on EF or that some were sustained as a result of a serious failure to protect EF in the chaotic conditions of the mother&#8217;s home. However, I have found the mother serially and seriously lied to the court throughout her evidence. Many of those lies related to the bruises sustained by EF. Unusually I have not been able to discern any reason or reasons for her multiple lies, other than I am satisfied there is no &#8216;innocent&#8217; reason. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother, like the intervenor, was under enormous emotional, psychological and financial pressure. She plainly had the opportunity to inflict injuries to EF which resulted in one or more of the various bruises. In the premises I have found that there is a real possibility that she or the intervenor is the perpetrator of the inflicted soft tissue injuries sustained by EF in the period of April to early July 2019. To put the matter another way, I am not satisfied that I could or should exclude the mother from the pool of perpetrators of the bruises sustained by EF. Accordingly, I am satisfied and find that the mother and the intervenor are both in the pool of perpetrators for those bruises which I have found are more likely than not to be inflicted (i.e. non-accidental) injuries. </p>
