First, the local authority were required to serve a commissioning decision letter setting out what packages of care, if any, they would commission for the patient if the patient had capacity to decide to return to his home and chose to do so.  The letter was required to include consideration of direct payments to the patient.</span></p>

The gist and effect of that letter is that the local authority remain unwilling to fund a package of care in the patient&#8217;s home with two carers present around the clock at a cost of a little under &#163;500,000 per annum.  The decision maker did also consider a further quote that they had obtained from an alternative provider at the lower sum of &#163;338,000 per annum, but he decided that even that cost &#8220;is unsustainable in the long-term.  For similar reasons [to the earlier quote at just under &#163;500,000] the local authority would also decline to commission a care package at this lower rate.&#8221;  The decision maker went on in his letter to consider whether the local authority would be willing to fund less expensive packages, essentially involving less intensive provision of carers.  He concluded that they would not, essentially for two reasons.  One reason was that they considered that there were potential risks to a single carer caring for this particular patient alone and that the wellbeing of the carers required at least two to be present at all times.  The other reason was that, in any event, the local authority considered that the needs of this patient are so great and that he so frequently needs two people present to turn him or assist him in other ways that, realistically, two people would have to be funded and present at all times.</span></p>

The formal decision of the Independent Local Resolution Panel has not yet been received, although I have been told today that it is informally understood that the decision of that panel will be that the care needs of this patient should be funded by the NHS through the local CCG rather than by the local authority.  If, indeed, that does turn out to be the final decision of the Independent Local Resolution Panel and to be the last word on the topic of whether it is the local authority or the CCG who must fund this patient&#8217;s care needs in the future, then, of course, the decision of the Head of Adult Safeguarding and Learning Disabilities in the local authority will effectively fall away and future funding levels will fall to be decided by the CCG. </span></p>

As I recorded in paragraph 9 of my judgment of 25 October 2016, the then subsisting opinion of the jointly instructed independent expert, a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Michael Isaac, was to the effect that the patient &#8220;lacks the capacity to decide on his residence and on his residence and care&#8221;.  That was also the subsisting opinion at that time of the treating psychiatrist at the hospital where the patient currently resides, as I set out at paragraph 10 of my earlier judgment.  Further, as I described at paragraph 20 of my earlier judgment, the most recent and still subsisting declaration as at 25 October 2016 with regard to capacity to make decisions about where he should reside was that made by Peter Jackson J on 12 January 2016 that: </span></p>

As I said then, Ms. Bridget Dolan QC, instructed by the Official Solicitor on behalf of the patient, submitted at the last hearing that &#8220;there is a continuing necessity for the court to determine on a more informed and less interim basis whether or not the patient does lack capacity to make decisions with regard to his residence and care.&#8221;</span></p>

For my part, I now consider that [the patient] has (or has regained) the capacity to make decisions about his residence and care.  My reservations about [the patient&#8217;s] capacity to make decisions about his residence and care have been largely assuaged by my more recent interview and the material received.  While his overall cognitive function has probably not changed much since I met him about four months ago, [the patient] appears more reflective and realistic about his options, and I consider that he has been enabled to exercise capacity by his efforts and by those involved in his current care.  None of this conveys immunity from foolish or ill-advised decisions; but these are not issues of capacity.&#8221;</span></p>

He was able to outline the essence of the situation without any prompting from me, indicating that he was able to retain necessary facts in coming to a decision.  However, my main concern in July 2016 was whether [the patient] could properly weigh the pros and cons of particular courses of action in relation to residence and care.  For in July, I felt that he had a rather fixed view of what he wanted and could not properly weigh not only the advantages and disadvantages of his wish, but could not, it seemed to me, understand the existence or nature of obstacles or limitations of his desires.  The picture is different now.  The issue of [the patient&#8217;s] residence and care is clearly a complex one and the various sums quoted seem to differ almost by an order of magnitude.  [The patient] appears to have a lively appreciation of the various cost concerns&#8230;&#8221;  </span></p>

After consideration, he suggested two solutions which may not be implementable but are reasonable alternatives to consider.  In so doing, he demonstrates an ability to think systematically and problem solve.  He understands that he requires high levels of professional care and that if it is only available in hospital that is where he will have to remain, even if it is not his preference.  He demonstrates an understanding about the concept of capacity and how it applies to him in relation to the court hearings.  He is able to understand and retain new information in the context of a conversation and to construct meaningful responses that show an ability to consider, weigh up and appropriately modify his responses and understanding.&#8221;</span></p>

The solicitor visited the patient yet again on 3 November 2016 and I have his attendance note and account of that meeting.  Of course, I am not a psychiatrist, nor is the solicitor, but it certainly appears from that attendance note that the patient was able to discuss his situation and this case and the funding and other issues with the solicitor in an articulate, informed and rational manner.</span></p>

First, she submits that both chronologically (since her application was issued last week) and logically, consideration of whether or not to give permission to withdraw the proceedings requires to be considered first, and before I give consideration to the oral application made today by Ms. Dolan that I make a formal positive declaration as to capacity under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref>.  The second strand of the submissions of Miss Etiebet is that, in any event, the local authority do not accept, despite the recent evidence from the two psychiatrists, that the patient does indeed have capacity to make decisions with regard to his residence and care.  She says that before I were to make a formal declaration to that effect, there should be the fuller hearing that has already been earmarked for 28 November 2016, at which, she says, the local authority and she, herself, would seek to &#8220;test&#8221; the evidence of the psychiatrists by cross-examination.  It should, however, be made clear that the local authority are not, so far as I am aware, in possession of any positive evidence contradicting the opinions of the two psychiatrists.</span></p>

Further, she submits that as he has been the subject of an interim declaration by this court for many months that (on an interim basis) he lacks capacity, it is only fair to the patient that there should be, and he is entitled to the benefit of, a formal declaration pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> that, in fact, he currently does have capacity.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">My view on these competing arguments is as follows.  I am faced today with applications that I should exercise discretions arising both under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and rule 87A of the rules.  I do not accept that I need, chronologically or logically, to exercise my discretion under rule 87A before giving any consideration to the discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> itself.  Both these applications are currently before the court at a single hearing, and it seems to me that I should give composite consideration to my exercise of the discretions under them.  I accept the submission of Ms. Dolan that when there is clear evidence from two consultant psychiatrists, who formerly both considered that a patient lacked capacity but now consider that he does have capacity, the court must be very cautious about improperly leaving the proceedings in being.  The existing jurisdictional foundation for these proceedings is the earlier interim orders that the patient lacks capacity, which themselves subsisted on the basis of the earlier opinions of both Dr Isaac and the treating psychiatrist.  Those psychiatrists having now changed their opinions, I could not leave those interim declarations in place.  In the absence of an interim declaration, the presumption of capacity under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> would, in any event, revive.  But it does go further than that.  The clear opinion of these two consultant psychiatrists, both of whom have now known this patient over a period of time, is to the effect that he does have capacity with regard to his residence and care.</span></p>
