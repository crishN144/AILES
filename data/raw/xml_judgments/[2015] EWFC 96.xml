Those findings were in a judgment I gave at the end of a contested fact finding hearing in three related care cases, known as the D, E and F case. The proceedings concern six children, whose ages range between 3 to 15 years. The previous hearing considered the factual basis upon which the Local Authority (LA) alleged the threshold criteria had been established in each of the cases. </span></p>

As part of the police investigation Z was the subject of a number of preliminary meetings with the police and social workers, ABE interviews and section 9 statements. Z did not give oral evidence in the family hearing. I considered a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re W</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> application in early November and concluded that she should not give oral evidence, due to the harm such a course was likely to cause her.

That memory refreshing procedure was video recorded. The criminal proceedings concluded on 6 March 2015 when the criminal trial judge, HHJ O&#8217;Mahony, acceded to the application at the end of the prosecution case that there was insufficient evidence for the case to continue on the basis of the inherent unreliability of Z&#8217;s evidence.

Whilst this court recognises the enormous sensitivities involved in this type of investigation, it is clear that some of the decision decisions taken have seriously undermined the evidence. For example, the decision made not to challenge Z in relation to possible inconsistencies, the methods used to put her at ease and gain her trust seriously risked being seen by her as encouragement, with the consequence of undermining the quality of her evidence. When looked at in the context of her low IQ and the information regarding her tendency to confabulate (which information was only available after all the interviews and discussions with her had concluded) made the task for this court challenging when evaluating the reliability of the evidence to support any of the findings sought in January. The events since January, has undoubtedly made that task significantly more challenging.</span></p>

It is suggested to have been missed by all the parties in the family proceedings that buried within the papers was a separate reference by Z to her family selling her for sex. This arises from a question put in the criminal proceedings by Mr Saxby Q.C. (leading counsel for RB). At the time of the first family hearing it was thought this had only been said by her once (to PC Swift, which she subsequently denied). It now appears that the records show this was possibly done on two separate occasions, to two separate people. The second occasion was two days prior to the time with PC Swift to someone called N (although the records available do not specifically record her saying to this person she was sold for sex but that question was put in the criminal case without objection being raised). It is pointed out that this now lends more support to such behaviour by her own family, further supported by her reaction recorded in her meeting with KV on 26 March 2014 when asked if her parents had ever received money for her she </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;looked extremely sad and refused to provide an answer or make eye contact&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> This additional information resulted in both KV and KJ agreeing with Mr Storey in cross examination in this hearing that if they had known about these reports from City A they would have considered removing Z from her parents care, both for her own protection and so she was in a neutral environment.</span></p>

Against that is the fact that she had the opportunity to view all her ABE interviews prior to giving oral evidence and apart from placing an emphasis on Z going for sex with men on her own and that she was doing it for pleasure, she did not resile from what she said in her ABE interviews and confirmed they were true.

I have heard KJ give evidence about it. Whilst she was at times somewhat defensive about it, first saying that it did record all the questions asked and then recognising that probably was not the position. In her evidence she said whilst KD was initially reluctant to talk (as described in the note) her demeanour when they did discuss the names was described as calm, happy to talk and open. The note carefully records KD was able to say when she could not give information about people, or only limited information (for example she knew JC, knew she had children but did not know their names) which lends support to the weight to be attached to it. KJ was able to deal with any suggestion that KD may have been confused about the N she was talking about in the context of JE, she agreed there was a possibility it could be JE&#8217;s daughter but said it did not readily flow from KDs description of N being introduced to JE, who was her mother.

As she said </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;That is how it should have happened but it didn&#8217;t&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> This, together with her unconvincing account of hers and AD&#8217;s marriages, strongly supports that she had been involved in arranging marriages for herself and AD. When pressed about how KD could give a description of Z if she had only visited her home once, she said KD saw Z on the occasion when AK shouted at Z for making a noise outside her flat, when Z visited their neighbour and when she saw her in the town. She was again pressed about what the LA submits corroborates what Z says, AK denied some of the material in the intelligence reports and what was reported by SS&#8217;s father. She denied knowing RB prior to their arrest. When pressed about the recording in her custody record, the day after her arrest which stated she had more information to give but was afraid others might hear, she denied any suggestion that related to any gang or person. She denied she said she was afraid, only worried about her children and the further information she had was that Z&#8217;s family were selling her. When pressed again about why the phone records show Z phoning a number attributed to her she responded </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;I don&#8217;t know&#8217;.</span></p>

That now has to be looked at in the light of the further retractions and inconsistencies made by Z within the memory refreshing exercise, her oral evidence in the criminal proceedings and the fact hat this court has not had the advantage of hearing her give oral evidence.  Whilst I was aware of and took into account the retractions and inconsistencies known about before the previous hearing, they are now of such a scale and extent in relation to allegations of serious sexual abuse that her account of her allegations regarding AK&#8217;s involvement in her exploitation has been very seriously undermined. The schedule of inconsistencies and lies produced on behalf of JE accurately sets out the position. The withdrawal by Z of the allegations against the two defendants in the criminal proceedings, are clearly very important. As set out in para 253 of the January judgment Z&#8217;s credibility is a central issue; in the light of the new material her credibility is now even more seriously undermined.</span></p>

In the light of the fresh information the submission that she lies for the sake of it cannot now be readily ignored. There can be little doubt that Z has had the most difficult background, and has been grossly let down by those adults who have had responsibility for her care. I agree with the analysis by the LA in their closing submissions </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;that everything we know about Z, her background and experiences lend support to the fact that she has been sexually exploited.

Her wholesale denial of any difficulties in City A in her oral evidence, together with her subsequent admission to her mother that she told untruths in evidence about City A, illustrates the extent of her vulnerability and unreliability. She has made up serious allegations about her father as she was not allowed to go out and about a former boyfriend due to jealousy about his new relationship.</span></p>

It consists of hearsay accounts, unattributable intelligence records or inferences to be drawn from such evidence. Whilst this evidence leaves the court very suspicious of AK&#8217;s role in Z&#8217;s exploitation, supported by the court&#8217;s assessment of AK&#8217;s lack of credibility (which this hearing has not changed), I agree with the submissions made by Mr Storey that none of the witnesses that have been called to give evidence have directly implicated AK. The burden of proof is on the LA which, in my judgment, they have not discharged. Mr Storey also makes the point that the intelligence reports could arguably support AK in that over this period (2012/2013) her accommodation was being watched and monitored by the police, there were two police raids in 2012 yet no direct evidence has been called to support her involvement in prostitution or exploitation.</span></p>

It is more likely than not they were each aware Z was being sold for sex, and that she was under 16 years. That conclusion is not fatally undermined by the unreliability of Z&#8217;s allegations concerning AK. In her interviews Z was able to give details about AK, JE and JC that were consistent with her having had more contact with them than they suggest. For example, she was able to identify AK and JE&#8217;s addresses, their children and she attended JC&#8217;s address for a bath all of which supports far more contact between Z and each of these women. Mr Larizadeh places reliance on the inconsistency of Z&#8217;s descriptions of JE (e.g as being Albanian) but that has to be balanced with other evidence which supports JE&#8217;s contact with Z. Z&#8217;s account of her contact with them is supported by evidence from a number of different sources; for example the detail AK was able to give in her interview about what Z had alleged (i.e. injections in her back and gang rape allegations) and the meeting with KD on 3.7.14. Whilst I have carefully considered again the criticisms of this meeting and record, in my judgment it provides a coherent account to support the much closer relationship of these women to each other and Z than they have each accounted for. KD was able to give good descriptions and distinguish when she did not know anyone named. Further support is provided by the telephone records of contact between AK and Z, which AK had no explanation for other than a generalised suggestion that others used her phone. It is of note that this phone contact was during one of Z&#8217;s missing periods and AK&#8217;s number was noted to be stored on Z&#8217;s phone when she was seen at school. The evidence supports Z being closely associated with IE and SS, both of whom were respectively visitors to JC and AK&#8217;s homes and IE is JE&#8217;s daughter. </span></p>

In her interviews Z said she was sold. Whilst there are some references to Z selling herself I reject that. The weight of the evidence clearly points to her being sold by others. CC in her interviews gives a detailed account of what took place, which corroborates the core of what Z describes. Whilst it is right that there were breaches of the ABE guidelines in the interviews with CC (such as not dealing with truth and lies at the start of the interview and a lack of neutrality in some of the questions) she had the opportunity the day before she gave oral evidence to view her ABE interviews again. She did not detract from the detailed descriptions she gave in those interviews of Z being sold for sex, she maintained that evidence despite being pressed about allegations made by Z about her which she denied. This conclusion is further supported by what JC told the social worker on 11 April (when an interpreter was present). JC&#8217;s denials of this record were not credible. The reference in SS&#8217;s interview to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;whoever was (Z&#8217;s) boss or like that..they was using her&#8217; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">further supports Z being sold. It inconceivable bearing in mind my conclusions about the nature of the relationship and contact between AK, JE, JC and Z that they were not aware of Z&#8217;s age and that she was being sold for sex. It was something Z did not seek to hide and had clearly been reported by others (such as JC, IE and SS).</span></p>

However there is also evidence of Z saying she was selling herself to help her family, she was picked up by men from the family home and her reaction when asked by social workers whether her family were involved in her abuse.   </span></p>
