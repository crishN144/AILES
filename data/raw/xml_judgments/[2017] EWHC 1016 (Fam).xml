The wife gave her evidence clearly and with appropriate affect.  Her answers were fair and balanced, and she is weighed down with sorrow that her marriage was so unsuccessful and broke down.  Although the husband disputes or denies many aspects of her evidence, she was not demonstrated by objective or independent evidence to have been untruthful on any significant point or issue.  The wife is an educated person with a degree of BSc from a university in Pakistan, and she is intelligent.  But she is less highly educated and less highly intelligent than the husband.  </span></p>

He is, however, rigid in his attitude to his Muslim religion and in his expectations of a wife.  As so often when a party acts in person, I gained particular insight not only from the evidence which the husband gave, but from the manner of his questioning of the wife and his conduct during the hearing generally.  </span></p>

But he put long, forceful and argumentative questions to the wife and betrayed obvious frustration, if not anger, with her towards the end of his questioning last week.  I very rapidly and clearly saw his relentless and unyielding pressure upon her, even in the setting of a court room and even when they are fully divorced.  He admits that, during the course of last year, he lied to both the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the police with regard to the whereabouts of the passports and other identity documents of the wife and their son.  </span></p>

He gave me the following list of complaints.</span></p>

He agrees that he is strict in his own observance.  She is less strict, but he could not tolerate her lack of strict observance.  He complains that, although she was brought up in Pakistan, she turned out to be less strict than he had expected. </span></p>

The wife says that she did read the Koran and did say prayers, although she admits that she was often too tired to say the early morning prayer.  </span></p>

By this, he means that she did not sufficiently often and sufficiently scrupulously shave her pubic and underarm hairs.  He says that this is of less gravity than not saying her prayers five times a day at the correct times, but is nevertheless grave.  </span></p>

She walks without a limp; she can raise and move her left arm around freely; and her limbs are not withered or in any visual way deformed.  Second, she says, as he agrees, that all her medical records and x-rays were made available to him and, being a doctor, he was well placed to interpret them himself.  </span></p>

As to that, she says that she is competent at cooking Asian food and dishes.  She agrees that when she came to England she discovered that the husband prefers European food, such as pizzas and pasta, and that she struggled to cook such food well, having no previous experience of doing so.  </span></p>

It is not in issue that she had gained the degree of BSc from a university in Pakistan and that, until she came to England, she was studying for an MSc there.  He says that the wife or her family told him that her educational qualifications were sufficient for her to embark upon medical training as a doctor, which she said she wished to do.  </span></p>
