The issue covered in this judgment is the consequences of parental alienation and whether an Interim Care Order (&#8216;ICO&#8217;) in respect of Z should be continued in the light of her implacable hostility to her placement, and the highly detrimental impact that the interim care plan and her current situation is having on her welfare. </p>

After hearing submissions on 18 July 2022, I reserved judgment. The position of the Father, the LA and the Guardian is that I should continue the ICO in respect of Z and not seek to vary her current placement in foster care. The position of Z, who is separately represented having been determined to be <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competent (<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech AHA</span> [1985] UKHL 7) in respect of these proceedings, is that the ICO should be discharged, and she should be allowed to return to live with the Mother.

She was not allowed to spend time after school with her friends because of the concern that she might use friends&#8217; phones to contact her mother. The result of this was that she was isolated both from her sister, with whom she had necessarily lived since X was born, and from her friends.

Children have their own feelings and needs and where their parents are polarised they are bound to feel the effects. Situations of this kind, where the concerned parent is being no more than properly supportive, must obviously be distinguished from those where an emotionally abusive process is taking place. For that reason, the value of early fact-finding has repeatedly been emphasised.</span></p>

The court's first inclination will be to reason with parents and seek to persuade them to take the right course for their child's sake, and it will only make orders when it is better than not to do so. Once orders are required, the court's powers include those provided by sections 11A to 11O of the Children Act 1989 , and extend to consideration of a more fundamental revision of the arrangements for the child. We agree that whilst a change in the child's main home is a highly significant alteration in that child's circumstances, such a change is not regarded as "a last resort": Re L (A Child) [2019] EWHC 867 (Fam) at [53] to [59] per Sir Andrew McFarlane P.

It must, in short, take action when and where it can do so to the child's advantage.

The situation calls for judicial resolve because the line of least resistance is likely to be less stressful for the child and for the court in the short term. But it does not represent a solution to the problem. Inaction will probably reinforce the position of the stronger party at the expense of the weaker party and the bar will be raised for the next attempt at intervention. Above all, the obligation on the court is to keep the child's medium to long term welfare at the forefront of its mind and wherever possible to uphold the child and parent' s right to respect for family life before it is breached. In making its overall welfare decision the court must therefore be alert to early signs of alienation. What will amount to effective action will be a matter of judgement, but it is emphatically not necessary to wait for serious, worse still irreparable, harm to be done before appropriate action is taken. It is easier to conclude that decisive action was needed after it has become too late to take it.&#8221;</span></p>

Neither Z nor X are allowed social media apps on their phones, although WhatsApp was to be considered. Contact time between Z and X is now two hours per week, supervised at a contact centre. From 19 July virtual family time between the children and the Mother was commenced, again supervised by the LA. </p>

That does not mean that she is entitled to determine her own best interests as would an adult, but she is entitled to have her views given considerable weight under Article 8. </p>

However, in any Article 8 balance concerning the welfare of the child, the child&#8217;s rights must necessarily be those at the forefront of the Court&#8217;s mind. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In many care cases, children are required by the State to live away from their parents, that having been determined to be in their best interests. However, in this case there is a further interference in Z&#8217;s family life because Z is no longer living with her sister, with whom she is very close, and is allowed very limited contact with her.  As at 14 June, when I first became involved in the case, she was having no contact with her mother and only two hours per week, supervised, with her sister. She did not wish to have any contact with her father. Therefore, she was in essence having no family life whatsoever.</p>

There is no criticism of the foster carer and it might be said that the breakdown in the relationship was Z&#8217;s &#8220;fault&#8221;. But it must be remembered at all stages in this analysis that Z is a child and that the Court is supposed to be seeking to achieve her &#8220;welfare interests&#8221; (section 1 of the Children Act 1989). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It can be seen that the effect of the care plan as at that date was a very serious interference in Z&#8217;s Article 8 rights, by which she was completely personally and socially isolated, save when she was at school. I note that the restrictions on Z&#8217;s contact with her family were more draconian than would have been considered appropriate in many cases of serious alleged abuse by parents. I also note that the test for &#8220;separation&#8221; from a parent at an interim stage is that of the child&#8217;s safety requiring immediate separation, safety including psychological welfare, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re L-A</span> [2009] EWCA Civ 822, and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B and KB</span> [2009] EWCA Civ 254. </p>

The LA have done what they can to ease the situation for Z, but she still remains highly restricted in her access to family life, to a degree that is much greater than would be the case for most children of her age. The fact that she is only allowed supervised contact with her sister, and can have no contact with wider family members, such as B&#8217;s family, is an indication of the restrictions upon her. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, the impact on her in HRA terms might be said to have become worse because of the risks that she now incurs to her life and safety. She has run away from the foster carer at least three times.  On those occasions she travelled a considerable distance, on her own, with no adult supervision and no one knowing where she was. One of those incidents happened late at night.  This put her at real physical risk, whether by accident, assault or exploitation. This is relevant because the risk of harm created by the Court&#8217;s order has to be balanced against the harm which is the justification for the ICO. </p>

That harm, as set out in the LA&#8217;s Threshold document is the risk of emotional harm as set out in HHJ Watson&#8217;s judgment. The rationale for the ICO is that Z will be protected from medium to long term psychological and emotional harm caused by the Mother. The intention is that through the work proposed in the care plan, her long-term psychological wellbeing will be protected because a relationship will be re-established with the Father and she will understand that she has been encouraged in a false narrative by the Mother.</p>

However, ultimately that is irrelevant. She is currently at real and immediate risk of psychological and physical harm. The Court must be careful not to get into a battle of wills with the child and not to inadvertently find itself in the position where it is in effect punishing the child for &#8220;bad behaviour&#8221;.  The focus of this case is purely on the child&#8217;s welfare. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am also unconvinced that the ultimate justification for the distress that is being imposed upon Z is likely to be realised. The Therapeutic Reunification Plan has failed. Z has not been reunified with the Father. The Plan, with the ISW moving into the Father&#8217;s home, may well have been doomed to failure from the outset. But in any event, Z has made it abundantly clear that she is not prepared to cooperate with it. In terms of Z being &#8220;alienated&#8221; from the Father, that has already happened. I cannot see how forcing her to remain in foster care, where she is very unhappy and highly likely to blame the Father for her situation, is going to make her want to see the Father. In my view it is far more likely that she will see him as the author of her misfortune, even if that is part of a &#8220;false narrative&#8221;. In any aspect of human affairs, it is notoriously difficult to change &#8220;false narratives&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The current plan being put forward by the LA and supported by the Father is that there is a psychological assessment that will report at the end of November, that will then lead to a final hearing and presumably some further plan of therapeutic intervention. The Guardian&#8217;s proposal was to delay a decision on the Mother&#8217;s application for a limited period to allow time for LA recent proposals to bed in and potentially provide more stability for Z. It is highly unlikely on this timescale that the case will reach final hearing before Christmas 2022. Z will therefore have spent close to 12 months in foster care, being very unhappy, at immediate psychological and physical risk, for an outcome that is very far from certain. </p>

But it does not represent a solution to the problem.&#8221;  I accept this Court might be accused of lack of resolve. However, in some cases there is no solution to a problem, only a choice between two not good outcomes, and the need to choose the least worst outcome. What might be characterized as choosing the course which is less stressful for the child could alternatively be described as taking into account and giving appropriate weight to the child&#8217;s wishes and feelings. </p>

It may well be that in years to come Z will appreciate the harm the Mother has caused her and seek to re-establish a relationship with the Father. However, I do not consider the current care plan likely to achieve that objective. </p>

However, I do not see under the statute how I can make a decision which would not be in Z&#8217;s welfare interest because of the impact it might have on her sister. At the present time X is relatively settled with the Father and if I have to reconsider her case I will do so at a further hearing. </p>

However, I do not consider the tests for interim separation are met and taking into account the welfare checklist, I consider it to be strongly in Z&#8217;s best interests for her to live with her mother until a final order is made. If the LA do not consider they can amend the care plan with Z placed at home, then I will make an Interim Supervision Order with Z living with the Mother. </p>
