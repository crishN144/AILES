The documentation in the case is voluminous, running to some 6 lever arch files with an additional 3 lever arch files of authorities. I have had the benefit of extremely full opening and closing documents, produced through the industry of both legal teams, for which I am very grateful. I have read the court bundles and considered the authorities and academic material I have been referred to.

This is not a big money case; the assets are about &#163;7m (less tax) and the husband&#8217;s net income in the region of &#163;1m (including bonus). I would sincerely hope that, despite the interest in the legal issue I have outlined, once this jurisdiction issue has been determined serious attempts will be made to agree the financial aspects before there is any further damaging erosion of the relatively limited available assets through increased legal costs, which are already so alarmingly high. </span></p>

It transpired during the oral evidence that the parties (separately or together) had had marriage counselling and/or therapy for a number of years, either based here or by telephone or in person during holiday visits to New York. In her oral evidence the wife referred to marital therapy in 2005 in London and some that took place in 2003.

The wife said this is taken out of context, it was a general discussion about separation that could end in divorce; it was not a discussion about their circumstances. It was suggested to the wife that at this time she was feeling &#8216;semi-detached&#8217; from the marriage; she said she felt there was something wrong but she </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">&#8216;could not put my finger on what.&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">  It was suggested to her that seeking to meet an old college friend without informing the husband was symptomatic of the poor state of the parties relationship, she denied that.</span></p>

There is a dispute as to who took the lead on this. It is the wife&#8217;s case that she was tricked by the husband into returning to live in New York. She says if she had known that the husband was continuing his relationship with MD she may have made a different decision. He told her the relationship was over. She said in evidence that she hoped the move back to New York would be with a view to them getting back together; she said the husband had told her that he would secure a job that would be based in New York by no later than February 2009. She said if she had known about the continuing relationship between the husband and MD the position may have been different; she may well have stayed here and not disrupted the children&#8217;s education. She did not accept that she would have moved back anyway, that the children were moving schools anyway and she sought the support of her family who lived in New York</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">. </span></p>

He said when the husband commenced his action in June 2009, neither party had been resident for a year and he did not consider the domicile requirement was established.  It was his view that the failure to meet these requirements dealt a fatal blow to the husband&#8217;s divorce action, although he accepted, in answer to a question I put to him, that the proceedings remained valid until a motion to strike out was determined.</span></p>

The brief circumstances of that case was there had been extensive litigation over a number of years (the Defendant is recorded as having had 32 attorneys since the litigation began and there had been a number of previous appeals) with the Defendant seeking to vacate the grant of the judgment of divorce made in 1970. In this appeal the Defendant sought a late challenge to the judgment on the basis that the residency requirement in s 230 was not satisfied when the judgment was made 5 years previously. Section 230 had been amended during the course of the litigation; the amendment, as I understand it, introduced the 12 month residency requirement and permitted a grant of divorce upon proof of cruel and inhuman treatment; prior to that the law only permitted a judgment of separation in such circumstances. Mr Mantel relied on this case as being authority for the court to permit subsequent amendment of a complaint to cure any failures to meet the 12 month residency requirement at the time of issue. The end of the Opinion of the Appellate Decision First Department states </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">&#8216;Under the circumstances, therefore, the continued residency, after the action was brought, and prior to entry of a decree, gave the court jurisdiction to permit amendment of the complaint. Indeed, to hold otherwise, would exalt form over substance since plaintiff could have instituted another action seeking to dissolve the marriage at any time after he completed the one year residency requirement, was improperly given retroactive effect herein, i.e. to the date of the original action for separation and that there was jurisdiction to grant the divorce.&#8217;</span></p>

On the contrary there was considerable evidence of residence by the husband, and the court obviously determined that the husband had some residence even if not of the duration to satisfy the matrimonial statutes. The point is that the litigation having gone to final judgment, the right to review by appeal having been exhausted, this is and should be the end of the matter.&#8217;</span></p>

It appears that, at about the same time, he was giving the more critical emails written just before and just after this email to his New York lawyer for inclusion in the detailed complaint filed in the New York proceedings making allegations against the wife.

In the emotional turmoil during the final stages of the breakdown of the marriage both parties were making decisions in very difficult circumstances. In my judgment the wife was clinging to the hope that her marriage would continue and felt a move to New York may assist with that, as she understood the husband&#8217;s job was going to move there and she did not want to be left behind (&#8216;her one fear&#8217; she said in evidence), the husband confirmed his commitment to their relationship in late August 2008 and continued to stay with the family in New York until May 2009 attending therapy/counselling. However, the reality was, in fact, very different, the husband was continuing his relationship with MD without being honest about his intentions to his wife. In the middle of this emotional turmoil they, as parents, needed to make decisions about the best educational provision for their children. Looking at the evidence as a whole over the period 2007 to 2009 there is no doubt the husband was being deceptive about his relationship with MD and may well have considered the advantages in terms of his relationship with MD of the wife and children being away from London but I am not able to find that this was part of some wider plan connected with any jurisdictional arguments for the divorce proceedings at the time of the move by the wife and children to New York in 2008. </span></p>

The Brussels Convention was an instrument designed and drafted by civil lawyers for civil lawyers. It had already been in force among the original Member States in the EC (as it then was) for 18 years before <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/27" uk:canonical="1982 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1982 Act</ref> came into force in 1987. Since that time common lawyers have had to get used to a widening interface between English family law and EU law. In 2001 the Brussels II Regulation came into force. In 2002 the Brussels Convention was effectively replaced (as between Member States) by Regulation 44/2001, the Brussels I Regulation. In 2005 the BIIR came into force.</span></p>

The exercise of discretionary powers is much less common in civil systems. The need for predictability has led to the strict first past the post system which applies under both Brussels I and BIIR.

This is because the doctrine was alien to almost every other Member State apart from the United Kingdom, and such a particularly common law concept that would be incongruous with civil law systems.

Second, where a plea is raised on the basis that a foreign court is a more appropriate forum to try the action, it is for the claimant to establish that he will not be able to obtain justice before that foreign court or, if the court seised decides to allow the plea, that the foreign court has in fact no jurisdiction to try the action or that the claimant does not, in practice, have access to effective justice before that court, irrespective of the cost entailed by the bringing of a fresh action before a court of another State and the prolongation of the procedural time-limits. </span></p>

NB Jackson &amp; Others, supra, the ECJ decided that it was not open to the English court to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a claim for breach of contract against a defendant domiciled in England by application of forum non conveniens principles. The claim was brought by an English-domiciled claimant for breach of an implied term in a contract of letting of a holiday villa in Jamaica, owned by the defendant, to the effect that the adjacent beach would be reasonably safe and free from hidden dangers. The claimant was rendered tetraplegic after striking his head against a submerged sandbank while swimming. The claimant also joined other defendants in Jamaica, claiming against them in tort for breach of a duty of care. The defendants, including Mr Jackson, applied to the English court to decline to exercise jurisdiction on the grounds that Jamaica was clearly the more appropriate forum having regard to the location of the evidence and of most of the defendants. The trial judge declined so to order, holding that, having regard to the decision of ECJ in UGIC v. Group Josi [2000] ECR1-5925, if a defendant were sued in a contracting state in which he was domiciled by a claimant domiciled in a non-Contracting State, Article 2 applied so as to confine jurisdiction to the state of the defendant's domicile.

First, a defendant, who is generally better placed to conduct his defence before the courts of his domicile, would not be able, in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, reasonably to foresee before which other court he may be sued. Second, where a plea is raised on the basis that a foreign court is a more appropriate forum to try the action, it is for the claimant to establish that he will not be able to obtain justice before that foreign court or, if the court seised decides to allow the plea, that the foreign court has in fact no jurisdiction to try the action or that the claimant does not, in practice, have access to effective justice before that court, irrespective of the cost entailed by the bringing of a fresh action before a court of another State and the prolongation of the procedural time limits.</span></p>

The common law ultimately relies on an exercise of discretion to reach what in each case seems to the court to be the right result. The Convention and Regulation state rules designed to avoid inconsistent decisions, but if those rules fail in a particular case to avoid that danger, there can be no fall-back on discretionary powers: see Erich Gasser GmbH v.

In relation to the latter he distinguished priorities as between judgments from priorities as between pending proceedings; the real question, he said, was whether the fact that those matters were acknowledged in the Regulation was sufficient to warrant a departure from what he regarded as the clear mandatory language of Art 2 as interpreted in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Owusu</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">. He considered that one obstacle to such a departure was the clear statement by the ECJ in a number of cases to the effect that deviations or derogations from the underlying provisions of the Regulations must be found in the Regulation itself, which enumerates exhaustively the cases in which a person may be sued outside the State in which he is domiciled. Clarke J held that Article 27 applies only where the court first seised actually has jurisdiction. As a non- Member State will decide whether it has jurisdiction by reference to its principles of private international law it will not be bound by Brussels I. Thus, Clarke J held the reflexive analogy with Article 27 does not arise in the case of a non-Member State. On appeal from Clarke J the Irish Supreme Court did not criticize Clarke J&#8217;s reasoning in its judgment. It decided to refer an appropriate question to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling, but I was told during this hearing that had not taken place and the case had resolved.</span></p>

The Supreme Court of Ireland has made a reference to the European Court as to whether the ruling in Owusu v Jackson applies even where proceedings have been commenced in a non-Member State prior to the proceedings in Ireland (the so-called "reflexive effect" of Regulation provisions, which does not arise in the present case): Goshawk Dedicated Receivables Ltd v Life Receivables Ireland Ltd [2009] IESC 7, [2009] ILPr 26.</span></p>

We do not see why &#8211; there is an enormous difference between the two. For intra-EU events the Regulation is a carefully balanced piece of legislation. Its components are interrelated. Thus it provides for all the consequences of its allocation of jurisdiction rules &#8211; exclusive jurisdiction for court first seised, a lis alibi pendens rule in other courts, mutual recognition of judgments and so on. None of that balance or interrelation is provided by the suggested extra-EU jurisdiction. Nor could it be, for to achieve it you need to legislate for all the courts to which the rules apply and the Regulation has no effect on the courts of third countries.</span></p>

In my view it clearly can. There is nothing in either article 12.1 or article 12.3 to limit jurisdiction to children who are resident within the EU. Jurisdiction in divorce, nullity and legal separation is governed by article 3 of the Regulation, which lists no less than seven different bases of jurisdiction. It is easy to think of cases in which a court in the EU will have jurisdiction under article 3 but one of the spouses and their children will be resident outside the EU. A court in England and Wales would have jurisdiction if the petitioning mother were living with the children in the USA and the respondent father were living in this country. A court in England and Wales would have jurisdiction if the petitioning father had lived here for at least a year and the respondent mother were living with the children in the USA. A court in England and Wales would have jurisdiction if the spouses were living here but their children were living in the USA. In some of these cases the spouses might well wish to accept the jurisdiction of the English court to decide matters relating to parental responsibility so that their children&#8217;s future could be decided in the same jurisdiction as their status, property and finances. Professor Rauscher is quite clear that &#8220;the new rule not only applies to children residing in a Member State which is not the forum State (as Article 3 Brussels II did) but also to children residing in Non-Member States&#8221; (T Rauscher, &#8220;Parental Responsibility Cases under the new Council Regulation &#8216;Brussels IIA&#8217;&#8221;, The European Legal Forum, 1-2005, 37 &#8211; 46 at p 40). There is nothing to differentiate article 12.3 from article 12.1 in this respect.&#8221;</span></p>

None of the academic commentary asserts that any discretion would be retained if the proceedings in the Member State were seised first in time. The &#8216;analogy&#8217; is made with Articles 27 and 28 Brussels I, which only allow &#8216;any court other than the court first seised&#8217; to stay proceedings.

The Regulation provides no exception in relation to forum non conveniens, at least in relation to matrimonial proceedings. It is highly probable that application, in a case such as has been conjectured, of the doctrine of forum non conveniens by means of the operation of a discretionary stay, would be deemed to undermine the desired objectives of certainty and predictability, which are inherent in the Regulation, as well as to jeopardise the legal protection of persons established in the European Community&#8217;.</span></p>

If&#8230; a provision awarded is designed to enable one spouse to provide for himself or herself or if the needs and resources of each of the spouses are taken into consideration in the determination of its amount, the decision will be concerned with maintenance. On the other hand, where the provision awarded is solely concerned with dividing property between the spouses, the decision will be concerned with rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship and will not therefore be enforceable under the Brussels Convention. A decision which does both these things may, in accordance with Art 42 of the Brussels Convention, be enforced in part if it clearly shows the aims to which the different parts of the judicial provision correspond. &#8216;</span></p>

If the non-Member State judgment is first in time the subsequent judgment by the Member State would not be recognised (by virtue of Article 34(4)).

It is submitted that (interpreting Brussels I purposively) Article 34(4) is compatible with the proposition that there is a power to stay in favour of a non-Member State; two fundamental and related objectives of the Brussels scheme are: (i) to avoid irreconcilable judgments between Member States; and (ii) to ensure recognition of judgments between member states. The Brussels scheme should not be interpreted in a way which leads to the proliferation of judgments that are likely to come within Article 34(4).

This certainty is undermined by the discretionary power of forum non conveniens. It is submitted that this reasoning does not apply where there are competing proceedings between the same parties as it is the defendant domiciled in the Member State who will be bringing the competing proceedings in the non-Member State. Article 2 of Brussels I is all about providing certainty to the defendant but as he will be bringing the proceedings in the non-Member State he obviously will know where he is bringing them and will not be deprived of any certainty.</span></p>

As in (i) above if the defendant is bringing the proceedings in the non-Member State his protection is obviously not undermined. In relation to claimants, first, if a plea of forum non conveniens is raised the claimant has to establish that he will not be able to obtain justice before that foreign court or, if the plea is successful, that the foreign court does not have jurisdiction or that the claimant does not have access to effective justice, irrespective of cost. The claimant would only have to do this if the defendant were to establish that the competing forum were more appropriate. Article 2 of Brussels I is principally about protecting defendants who are domiciled in a Member State (there is no reference to claimants in Article 2), if a defendant who has successfully established in his own Member State that another non-Member State where he has commenced proceedings is more appropriate, is it so onerous to require a claimant to prove that he would not obtain effective justice in that non-Member State? Secondly, there will already be proceedings which the claimant will have knowledge of and have to defend either substantively or as to jurisdiction, thus there is unlikely to be much, if any, additional cost. If the wife&#8217;s arguments prevail and there is no power to stay the costs are likely to increase as there could be two sets of proceedings in two jurisdictions continuing to final judgment.</span></p>

There are situations where national conflict of law rules (i.e. forum non conveniens) are permitted to operate in cases involving the Convention. It is submitted that if the Convention provides no mechanism for how to resolve a particular situation (here competing proceedings between the same parties with the same subject matter) there is little alternative but to resort to national law. To provide no solution in such situations produces worse results. </span></p>

Article 2 is described as &#8216;mandatory&#8217; by the ECJ. It not only confers jurisdiction on the court of the Member State in which the defendant is domiciled but it requires the exercise of that jurisdiction once the court is seised. Moreover, if the claimant is to sue the defendant there is a mandatory obligation imposed upon him to sue the defendant in the State of the defendant&#8217;s domicile. This is clear from the words &#8220;shall&#8230;be sued&#8221;. </span><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Article 3 of BIIR is different. Although it too contains the word &#8220;shall&#8221;, it is used in a different context. It states that &#8220;jurisdiction shall lie&#8221; in various situations. Thus Article 3 merely regulates the circumstances in which various Member States are to have jurisdiction. It merely facilitates jurisdiction. There is no corresponding obligation upon a Court to exercise that jurisdiction or on the applicant as to where he or she must bring proceedings. There is a very good reason why there are no such obligations: Article 3 of BIIR envisages a multiplicity of Member States having concurrent jurisdiction. Article 2 of Brussels I envisages only one.</span></p>

If a court is disabled from applying domestic law to stay a petition founded on Article 3, it must also be similarly precluded from staying under domestic law a children&#8217;s case of which it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 8. If that is the state of the current law, two consequences follow: (a) Article 15 permits in certain circumstances a court of a Member State to transfer the case to another court where that is in the best interests of the child. There is no express provision to deal with the situation as between a Member State and a non-Member State. There is no justification for depriving courts of that power.

In that situation Article 19 of BIIR applies &#8211; the first in time provision where two Member States are both seised. In order to give effect to Brussels II &#8211; the purpose of the amendment &#8211; it was necessary to make it clear that the discretionary powers conferred by Paragraph 9 were ousted in cases where the mandatory provisions of Article 19 were engaged: cases where the competing jurisdiction is another Member State (other than Denmark). On this basis proper deference is given to the Regulation without changing the law more than is necessary for that purpose.</span></p>

The husband submits that the wife&#8217;s claim is ancillary to the divorce suit. Therefore, the issue of where the divorce is to be tried must logically be determined first. To seek to do it the other way can produce very undesirable consequences. An English ancillary relief order is capable of being either in the nature of maintenance (in which case it is enforceable under Brussels I) or a claim relating to rights of property arising out of a matrimonial relationship or a hybrid of the two. By the time the order is ready for enforcement, its nature can be discerned from the judgment under which the order is made. Such part of the order as consists of maintenance is enforceable under Brussels I; any order arising out of rights in property is not: see Article 1 (2)(a) of Brussels I and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Van den Boogard v Laumen</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 2 FLR 399" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 2 FLR 399</ref>.</span></p>

For example, a wife may be claiming a percentage of the overall assets on the basis of the sharing principle but such claim may fail, so that she only receives an award based on maintenance. Alternatively she may have pitched her claim on alternative bases, and have succeeded only on one. This can only be analysed with hindsight, not prospectively. Moreover the distinction between a maintenance-based award and a rights in property award does not depend on terminology. A lump sum may consist of either; it may have an element of both. So the form of the claim for ancillary relief within a divorce petition does not reveal whether it is in the nature of a claim for maintenance or for rights in property.

The question there was whether the court could stay proceedings in a case where the same point was being litigated between the same parties in the courts of a third country. He held that Owusu prevented that, essentially because the lis pendens rule is to some extent a facet of forum non conveniens. We do not have decide whether that was correct, though we note that, if he his right, there is this oddity: that there is a clear lis pendens rule, with associated court first seized rule, for parallel cases within the EU but none for parallel cases where one is running within an EU Member State and one without.

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:2in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">The question is whether, by this amendment, Parliament intended to abolish the power to grant stays in the majority of divorce proceedings (save those limited cases caught by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45/section/5/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 5(2)</ref>(b) and Article 7). If that were the intention Parliament could have been clearer and stated that the power to stay is only available where jurisdiction is founded on <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45/section/5/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 5(2)</ref>(b) and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45/section/5/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 5(3)</ref>(b). In that context it could be said that the natural and preferable construction of &#8216;proceedings governed by the Council Regulation&#8217; refers to the position where there are competing proceedings in another Member State. Article 19 BIIR applies in that situation and it was necessary to make clear that the discretionary powers conferred by Paragraph 9 were ousted in cases where the mandatory provisions of Article 19 were engaged. On this (narrower) construction the power to stay remains in place where the competing proceedings are in a non-Member State. Such a construction is not incompatible with EU law as it provides for the express provision in Article 19 and leaves a mechanism in place to deal with competing non-Member State proceedings.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">In his closing submissions, Mr Scott QC developed an argument based on the distinction between personal jurisdiction and subject-matter jurisdiction. Article 2 of Brussels I confers personal jurisdiction. Article 5(2) confers subject-matter jurisdiction in certain circumstances. Article 3 of BIIR is different from Article 2 of Brussels I in that it confers subject-matter jurisdiction in respect of divorce proceedings, but not in respect of maintenance or rights in  property. In the present case, Article 3 of BIIR confers personal jurisdiction over the husband and subject-matter jurisdiction in respect of the divorce suit, but jurisdiction over ancillary relief is not conferred by Brussels I since personal jurisdiction is conferred by Art 3 of BIIR and there is an extra-EU dimension. Neither is it conferred by BIIR since it is expressly excluded from the ambit of BIIR. Therefore, it is submitted that jurisdiction over ancillary relief is conferred by national legislation and the wife&#8217;s attempt to apply </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Owusu </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">directly via Brussels I is misconceived (since neither Article 2 nor 5 are engaged) and the attempt to apply </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Owusu</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt"> to BIIR indirectly via Brussels I is equally misconceived (since Brussels I is not engaged in the first place).</span></p>

If he does that then the court will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be granted. It is a two-stage test. The court has to consider the interests of both parties and the ends of justice. Accordingly, provided substantial justice can be done in the available, more appropriate forum or in both forums, the court should not have regard to a particular juridical advantage for one party in one forum rather than the other. Although not canvassed in any great detail during the hearing I note in Mr Sheresky&#8217;s report (page 22 &#8211; 23) he summarises the approach to financial issues on divorce in New York.</span></p>

It is the combination of those factors (and the points made in response to the factors in paragraph 157) that drive the court to conclude that New York is the appropriate forum.</span></p>

A significant part of Mr Marshall&#8217;s submissions, on behalf of the wife, has focused on the husband&#8217;s behaviour during the breakdown of the marriage and leading up to the move to New York. In essence he submits that in those circumstances the justice of the case tips clearly in favour of the proceedings continuing here and the stay being dismissed. In effect, he says, the husband should not be allowed to profit from his manipulative behaviour; he makes the same point about the tactical nature of the husband&#8217;s divorce proceedings. </span></p>

I do not consider that the wife&#8217;s Article 6 rights have been interfered with by the husband&#8217;s behaviour, as has been suggested by Mr Marshall. The husband&#8217;s application has taken a conventional route in this jurisdiction and interim orders have been made and the wife has had access to the courts pending this court being able to determine the application. </span></p>

Both parties accept the marriage has broken down and from what I have heard there is no issue that the children should remain in the full time care of their mother with regular contact to their father.</span></p>
