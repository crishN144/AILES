She has a significant global learning disability, &#8220;moderate&#8221; to &#8220;severe&#8221;: her condition is innate, but her function may improve somewhat.   Her IQ is assessed at 49.  Her capacity to marry, to consent to sexual relationships, and to decide on her own place of residence are in issue. She does not have the capacity to litigate. The Official Solicitor acts as her litigation friend. </p>

I gave my decision on 10 April 2013: it  included interim views of the evidence and some conclusions  on it: and also my view that I should grant the declarations as sought, and that I could not sanction PM living with MZ.  This will be painful for PM, possibly extremely painful, it is not clear; and will deprive B of his mother&#8217;s company save for contact.  I said that I have found these extraordinarily difficult decisions.  I intended to deliver judgment within a week, but was unable to do so.   I had to consider lengthy and detailed submissions and 23 authorities. But most of all, I have reflected long and hard about whether   there was any room to revisit my conclusions, which I said on 10 April I reached with a very heavy heart. I cannot do so, given my findings.  </p>

Although she is said to have converted to Islam, there are inconsistencies as to whether this was when she was a child, or in 2001, or 2005: and all previous documentation, including at the time of her second marriage in 2005, describes her as Sikh.  This may be relevant as to whether the marriage is regarded as valid in Islam.  It seems to me doubtful that she has any understanding of any religious affiliation.  </p>

She has lost contact with her own father and two siblings. Very conflicting statements have been made by Mrs M about PM&#8217;s capacity and understanding, and about PM&#8217;s history. Take up of support services has been sporadic and inconsistent: compliance with social services has been superficial but with an underlying obstructivness, and interspersed with complaints against the LA. </p>

The reasons for those marriages and their dissolution are not clear: it is said that the first was to Mr S&#8217;s nephew but ended in divorce or was annulled due to non-consummation after he was not able to get a visa to join her. The second was to her maternal cousin: he is said to have been a heavy drug and alcohol user: he alleged that he was not told about her learning disability and  after he came to England to join her he was beaten and abused by her mother and stepfather. There was a divorce in India.</p>

The application was refused (with a right of appeal) on 11 October 2011: the Secretary of State determined that his proposed course of study at the College of Venereal Disease Prevention did not represent academic progress.  MZ lodged an appeal which had the affect of allowing him to stay pending its resolution. On 30 April 2012 he applied for further leave to remain on the grounds of his marriage. He was asked to elect whether he wished to pursue a fresh application as a student or the application based on his marriage. Before he could do so the Venereal Disease College had its licence withdrawn. He would have had to re-apply for leave to renew on the basis of a new college place. He therefore issued a fresh application based on &#8220;the outstanding family court proceedings and rights of access to his son&#8221;.  He has been refused further leave to remain on the basis of the &#8216;student&#8217; application since he had not put forward new college details. He has appealed. </p>

MZ&#8217;s role in caring for B or contact with him will be crucial.  He is likely to be granted limited leave to remain and eventually indefinite leave to remain. If he is found to have participated in a forced marriage that will be taken into account, but the court still has to consider the best interests of B.  </p>

They had been told that PM had attended the Register Office with Mr S but could not remember any details about MZ nor that she had been married and divorced twice. An anonymous informant had telephoned to state that Mr S had received &#163;20,000 in consideration of the marriage. The family is said to have altered divorce documentation in respect of PM&#8217;s second husband once a defect was pointed out to them at the Register office.</p>

Evidence had been provided by the CLDT and by the family and the Registrar General had given advice.  The Superintendent Registrar was not able to share this information with the LA.  There was no right of appeal by an objector. Also, the police thought that no crime had been committed because the sexual activity seemed to be consensual. </p>

At that meeting they said that the stress of the investigations was having a negative effect on PM, because of her pregnancy.  At a meeting which later took place on 2 May PM could not recall being slapped by her mother on her wedding day or feeling sad and said that she was happy, was not forced to have sex, and enjoyed the experience.  On 17 May she said that she loved her husband and had not been forced into the relationship. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">YLA was concerned about PM&#8217;s capacity to undergo pregnancy and childbirth and to care for a child.  Assessments were carried out.  At that point Mrs M put herself forward as carer: although her accounts swung drastically from saying that PM was competent, and that she could do nothing for herself.  MZ disputed that PM could not care for a child. He described her as &#8220;clever&#8221; and a &#8220;fast learner&#8221;.  He has since said that this is because the concept of learning disability is not recognised in Pakistan. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In July 2012 PM and MZ presented themselves at children&#8217;s services. PM stated that she had been physically and emotionally abused by her mother and stepfather (I note that MZ alleges abuse by Mrs M but does not make any complaint against Mr S).  He talked about these problems to another social worker but did not mention physical abuse.  On 2 August shortly before B&#8217;s birth was due, they left PM&#8217;s family home, and were rehoused on a temporary basis.  MZ alleges that Mrs M and Mr S have since made death threats against his family in Pakistan.  Mrs M and Mr S deny all allegations against them.  PM is now estranged from them. </p>

She is functionally illiterate with a reading age of 7.7 years and has a global learning disability. MZ falls within the entirely average spectrum.  He formed the view that PM could not safely and consistently parent a child. She might be able to parent in a secondary role, with support. She could not be left in sole care of a child. </p>

I note that Roderic Wood J at a previous hearing declined to approve a parent and child foster placement because it would have entailed sharing a bedroom amongst other reasons.  I listed a hearing of the capacity issues (without also listing the care proceedings).  Within the care proceedings I approved a plan for PM, MZ and B all to go together to a parent and baby foster placement: they were not to share a bedroom and this has been monitored.   I directed that a further capacity assessment be carried out by jointly instructed Dr Joyce.  It was agreed at that hearing that no planning could take place for B until capacity issues were decided: at the forefront of the court&#8217;s concerns was the question of whether PM could live with MZ. </p>

I was particularly concerned from what Ms Giz wrote that I was being asked to form my own assessment of the strength of her wishes and feelings: and indeed capacity.  In children&#8217;s cases the court sees the child for the purpose of allowing wishes and feelings to be expressed and to allow the child to feel part of the proceedings: the meeting is not to be used for gathering evidence. I have met adults without capacity in other proceedings for that purpose.  I thought that there was risk that I might form a view which I was (i) not entitled to take and (ii) might be adverse to PM in the sense that I formed the view that her views were repetitively expressed, the subject of influence, or did not convey understanding. YLA disagreed with my seeing PM being particularly concerned as I was that there was a confusion in the communications on behalf of the Official Solicitor between permitting PM to feel that she is part of the proceedings, and forming an evidential view as to her wishes and feelings.  I had at that stage in fact forgotten that PM had been in court in November and was to be in Court at the hearing.

When asked  what happened if a man did not use a condom she referred to &#8216;white stuff, gets on your hands, feels sticky&#8217; but she did not in any way relate this to conception, or infection, nor tie this in to the question  posed immediately before about how a baby was made. Dr Joyce said in evidence that she did not relate seminal fluid to conception, and had no concept that it could pass on disease.  </p>

He had been in England since 2009.  She is older than him.  She had been married before.  She can barely read or write.  She needs support in all areas of her daily life.  I find it very difficult to accept in the light of all I know about PM, her passivity and compliance, that she first spontaneously raised the question of marriage and proposed to MZ or that she independently pursued the relationship. I also note that MZ was told (according to Mr Teverson) that PM lacked capacity in January 2012 but denied that there was a problem and that he said that she was capable of caring for a child. In his statement he said that with love and care she is able to live a normal life. He painted a very different picture in his evidence: he said that she was not safe to be with the baby at all. Ms Bazley told me (she did not in fact lead this from him in evidence but I take this as part of his case) that the reason why he needs a substantial amount of help is because PM interferes with his care of the baby and he cannot stop her. </p>

Indeed his requests (and it may be that they are more properly regarded as demands) for assistance, indicate to me that even now he is not able and perhaps not prepared to shoulder the demands of caring for B as well as for PM.  He cannot expect YLA to and nor will they fund daily support in order to cover the times when he wants or needs to do other things. His care of B in the community cannot be monitored.</p>

I agree with the social worker, that even taking MZ&#8217;s case at face value, the frustrations of his role are likely only to increase, particularly as B becomes an active toddler. It may be that he truly cannot imagine what the future holds. And if it is true that he truly was misled and has only just come to realise the truth, then his feelings of resentment and anger are likely only to increase. The foster carer&#8217;s observations and his own evidence indicate strongly that he finds PM a burden, whatever words he may utter about his duty.  </p>

I find his statement that he does not want to have sexual intercourse with PM now she understands her limitations hard to reconcile with what I know about the past.  Also, if MZ is to be taken at face value PM  wants to have sex with her husband: and the evidence that she parrots rather than understands the prohibition on so doing is shown by the fact that she comes out with the statement &#8220;I am not allowed to have sex with MZ&#8221;, inappropriately, sometimes on first meeting, and wholly out of context.   </p>

It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person. It can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual's physical and social identity. Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8. Article 8 also protects a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. Though no previous case has established as such any right to self-determination as being contained in Article 8 of the Convention, the court considers that the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees."</p>

In some cases, in some situations, they may carry much, even, on occasions, preponderant, weight. In other cases, in other situations, and even where the circumstances may have some superficial similarity, they may carry very little weight. One cannot, as it were, attribute any particular a priori weight or importance to P's wishes and feelings; it all depends, it must depend, upon the individual circumstances of the particular case. And even if one is dealing with a particular individual, the weight to be attached to their wishes and feelings must depend upon the particular context; in relation to one topic P's wishes and feelings may carry great weight whilst at the same time carrying much less weight in relation to another topic. Just as the test of incapacity under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> is, as under the common law, 'issue specific', so in a similar way the weight to be attached to P's wishes and feelings will likewise be issue specific.</p>

So MM is not authority for the proposition that the court should not make a capacity declaration because it will then have to make a best interest declaration.

The case was sent to the GRO (office of the Registrar General for advice).  The Superintendent Registrar felt that PM did understand the concept of marriage.  It is not clear from the documentation whether she in fact saw PM herself.  She was concerned about being seen not to have taken into account the cultural background and PM's right to marry and found a family.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;This case has thrown up the role of Registrars and of the registration service when a borderline-incapacitated individual presents wanting to marry.  It is not a Registrar&#8217;s job to assess mental capacity and plainly he or she would be wholly unqualified to do so.  If there is doubt in the Registrar&#8217;s mind when an individual responds to the standard questions put at the notice-attestation meeting, then the procedure is for the doubt to be referred upwards, first to the local Superintendent Registrar and thereafter, if necessary, to the Office of the Registrar General.  In a really tricky case, this could end up with a decision to call for a psychiatric report into capacity.  That said, the standard handbook provided to Registrars presently says nothing about the need for mental capacity to contract a marriage and does not mention the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  It may be that those responsible for the handbook would wish to consider the advisability of incorporating a paragraph on this, perhaps referring to the basic <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S3</ref> requirements and summarising the information necessary to be understood and weighed up, with a note on what to do where an individual&#8217;s mental capacity to marry may be in real doubt.  The experience of this case also suggests that greater emphasis should be laid on the need for the aspiring spouses to be seen separately, not together as happened here&#8221;</p>

The documents provided by the Registrar&#8217;s office are peppered with concerning comments about Mr S&#8217;s aggression and persistence, and PM&#8217;s demeanour and vulnerability.  The overwhelming concern was that MZ was marrying PM for a visa, thus communication with the UKBA, yet the Registrar accepted without challenge almost helplessly it seems, the bare assertion that this was not the motive for the marriage. </p>
