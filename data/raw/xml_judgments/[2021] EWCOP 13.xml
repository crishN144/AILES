	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This is an application brought by the Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust. It concerns TW, who suffered catastrophic brain injury, arising from a stroke. The court has been asked to declare whether it would be in TW&#8217;s best interests to continue to receive life sustaining treatment, ventilation and blood pressure medication or alternatively, whether it would be lawful to withdraw it.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Over the course of the day, I have heard extensive medical evidence. In summary, on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December last year, in the early hours of the morning, TW was admitted to hospital complaining of general dizziness, blurring of vision, a headache, and sensory changes on the left side of his face and in his legs. Having regard to the wider canvas of the evidence that has been made available to me, I suspect that TW had recognised that he was in trouble. He did not, however, communicate his anxieties to the doctors. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">Indeed, he explained to them that he had recently had dental work to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;fix cracked teeth&#8221;</span>, he speculated as to whether that might be the problem. A medical record made by a nurse at the time, noted  TW was unsteady on his feet and that this might be due to the blood pressure medication he was receiving. His medical records reveal a reasonably long-standing concern about TW&#8217;s blood pressure. He was assessed by a consultant and discharged with medication. Because he had come into a hospital, he was also advised to self-isolate, having regard to the challenges presented by the pandemic. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, TW became unwell and telephoned his brother asking for help. When his brother went to the flat, there was no response, so it was necessary to force entry and ultimately to call an ambulance. When TW was admitted to hospital, he was in a very agitated state. He was unable to respond to directions and commands from hospital staff, but he was able to be roused by voice. The degree of his general agitation was such that it was not possible to assess his neurological status with any accuracy. He was treated for a general encephalitis. There was some concern that his drinking in the past might have been a factor, and initially, it was felt by the treating clinicians, that his presentation might be related to this. A CT scan was arranged and appeared to be normal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">With this history, and in different times, TW may very well have been admitted to a specialist stroke hospital. But I have been told, given the significant clinical pressures consequent on the 2019 Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible. It is important to note, that TW has, nonetheless, received care and attention of the highest quality and from those specialised in treating stroke patients. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, i.e. the following day, TW&#8217;s treating clinicians noted that, whilst his level of consciousness had not changed, he was moving his left limb less frequently than the right side, a significant indicator of stroke. He had also developed involuntary eye movements, known as nystagmus. Nystagmus, I have been told, can be caused by central nervous system abnormalities, or by problems associated with drugs or alcohol. Additionally, TW was seen to be experiencing altered speech. An MRI scan was commissioned, and he was started on the basic medication for a stroke. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">An MRI scan indicates neurological abnormalities which may not be perceptible on a CT scan. Sadly, the MRI brain scan of 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2020 indicated that the tissue in multiple areas of TW&#8217;s brain had been severely damaged due to deprivation of blood. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">More particularly, the scan revealed multiple infarcts, i.e. seriously damaged brain tissue, present in the cerebellar hemisphere, the right middle hemisphere, the peduncle, the pons and the midbrain. The cerebellum, pons and the midbrain are responsible for the brain&#8217;s core functions.  </p>

The following day, 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2020, TW tested positive for Covid-19. Whilst he had a significantly raised temperature, he did not have cardiopulmonary problems. He also appeared to have improved a little since being admitted, and at times he became less agitated, and was able to follow some of the commands that had previously escaped him. He was able to communicate his basic needs by way of pointing and gesture. He was not able to speak. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Tragically, on the morning of 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, TW suddenly and dramatically deteriorated, with a high temperature. He fell into a severe coma, on the Glasgow Coma Scale he scored 3 (the most serious level), he became unable to clear his saliva, he had no cough or swallow reflex. He was quickly admitted to the ICU where he had a breathing tube inserted into his windpipe. A further CT scan was taken, revealing that TW had suffered a major stroke. His scan also revealed, what is termed, a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;slight uncal herniation&#8217;</span> which is a slumping of the brain as a result of the impact of the stroke on the brain stem. Those indicators in relation to the brain stem were sadly going to prove to be catastrophic in terms of TW&#8217;s neurological status. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dr A, a consultant neurologist employed by the applicant Trust, has explained that TW&#8217;s injuries to the brain stem are not only irrevocable, but that there is no prospect of any recovery. The slumping of the brain, he noted, had caused further damage to those parts of the brain which regulate respiration, as well as more general awareness. Notwithstanding the pressures that have been on the NHS and intensive care generally, it is obvious that TW received scrupulous and attentive treatment. On 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2021, there was a yet further CT scan, which once again, showed deterioration and worsening of the injuries, most specifically, to the brain stem. There were further EEG&#8217;s, on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>and 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2021, for prognostic purposes, without sedation. The consensus revealed that TW had suffered a brain injury so significant that the electrical waves generated by the normal, healthy brain at the most basic level of human functioning, were no longer present. In the intervening weeks, that has not changed, other than perhaps, to deteriorate further. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is important to highlight that in addition to the assessments of the treating clinicians, there has been a wide range of second opinions. Ultimately, there has been complete unanimity both as to the extent of the brain damage and in respect of the prognosis. Mr E was asked for a further opinion, he confirmed that TW had suffered a devastating or catastrophic stroke in his brain stem from which he will not recover in any meaningful way. Mr E&#8217;s view was that treatment aimed at prolonging TW&#8217;s survival was futile and as such, could not, any longer, be described as being in his best interests.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, Dr A further assessed TW. By this time, TW had been in a coma for in excess of two weeks. He noted that TW&#8217;s pupils remained fixed and dilated, and entirely unresponsive. He observed that he no longer blinked reflexively, he tested his awareness to light to find that he had no response to it. He concluded that TW had no voluntary eye movements and exhibited no response to pain. His only responses were involuntary. It is self-evident that the assessment indicated a tragically poor prognosis. TW is only 50 years of age. It is a level of coma at the most serious end of the spectrum of gravity and there is damage to the brain stem which, though not amounting to brain stem death, is also at the most serious end of the spectrum of gravity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The multidisciplinary team treating TW considered that ventilation and other life sustaining treatment was irreconcilable with his best interests, and that those best interests might more effectively be promoted by a palliative regime. On the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, TW&#8217;s heart rate fell to levels that were regarded as dangerous, triggered by an episode of coughing, which itself was an involuntary reflex. On that occasion, CPR was administered, and TW&#8217;s heart rate was restored.  </p>

TW&#8217;s condition later returned to what is assessed as his baseline. Dr B recognised this clinical pattern as indicating temporary changes which signalled the instability of TW&#8217;s condition, arising from the severity of his brain injury.  </p>

On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January this year, Prof D, a professor of intensive care medicine, assessed TW with the objective of focusing on prognosis. Professor D&#8217;s conclusions, both in his report and in his evidence to me, can accurately be described as bleak. He told me that TW&#8217;s brain stem infarction had destroyed the key functions that are intrinsic to supporting life. This included conscious awareness of his surroundings, voluntary movements, protective reflexes, normal heart function and the ability to breathe without support. He was clear in his assessment and in his report that TW will never recover. By this Professor D explained that TW <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;would never recover a life that was worth living&#8221;</span> in the most basic sense of being aware of his surroundings or recognising whether people were with him or not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Brownhill, who appears on behalf of TW&#8217;s brother, pressed Professor D on the prospects of recovery. Professor D engaged with the questions to a degree that indicated both his level of experience and his integrity as a doctor. But he did so on the basis that he was addressing what he described as being a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;theoretical counterfactual&#8221;</span>. Even if, on that basis, there was a prospect of any recovery, it would only be to a level of consciousness that could properly be described as minimal and in those circumstances, because it would lead to awareness at some level, might objectively, reflect a deterioration in the quality of TW&#8217;s life. Professor D was asked whether TW might be able to breathe for himself for a limited period. Though he did not consider this likely, Professor D noted that even if he did, TW might develop pneumonia from his inability to respire, or infection from inhaled gastric contents, causing him to deteriorate, and ultimately to die. Again, the theoretical counter factual posited by Mr Brownhill, only permits of a different trajectory but is similarly bleak. Accordingly, Professor D recommended that supportive treatment should be withdrawn, and that </p>

What is plain, Dr B explained, is that there is now evidence of deterioration due to the complications associated with this critical, catastrophic injury, and prolonged immobility. Dr B anticipates cardiac, respiratory and urinary infections. He was pressed as to how long he thought TW would survive were he to have his ventilatory support withdrawn. In his report, he outlines three possible outcomes.  </p>

Although he did not highlight it in his oral evidence, it is recorded in Dr B&#8217;s report that TW would be returned to the ward area.

In simple terms, it is very unlikely that he has the capacity, any longer, to experience pain. Nonetheless, respiratory distress has the potential to be upsetting to those observing. An extensive care plan providing for the cessation of ventilation has been set out. Within the plan there is provision for video calls from the family, along with directions in respect of palliative care medications designed to achieve as much comfort for TW as possible and to placate symptoms of respiratory distress. It is perhaps the most important feature of the plan that it provides for direct visits from the family, where that is possible, in line with the present Covid-19 infection regulations.  </p>

That it has occurred at the height of the second wave of the pandemic when physical contact with the family has simply not been possible (for all but twenty-five minutes in total), is heart breaking. It is impossible not to be moved by the circumstances of this family particularly TW&#8217;s wife, his brother, his three daughters, as well as his former wife, who has been present at this hearing. The grief of TW&#8217;s daughters is almost palpable and viscerally painful to witness.

They interacted spontaneously and supported each other in giving evidence which was full of care, reflection and maturity. They are aged 22, 20 and 17 years. I have said, during the course of this case, and in other judgments, that the evidence of family members is every bit as important as the medical evidence. This has been strikingly true here. I found the evidence of these three young women to be eloquent and powerful. The eldest daughter (M), who is 22, is, everybody agreed, most like her father. She read a prepared note to me at the beginning of her evidence, which I think she said had been put together over lunchtime, and maybe to some degree the night before. It was a structured, thought-through and powerful statement which represented not only her views, but those of her sisters. In it, she focused upon her profound wish to be with her father when he was at the very end of his life, and to be present, if possible, when he died, or alternatively, just to touch him, to be able to say goodbye.  </p>

It is what most families would want. It is what any doctor would want to be able to facilitate, and it is what any judge would want to be able to achieve. I was struck by the way N put it: it was not merely what they wanted, she told me, it is what they knew their father would have wanted. It was, as she described it, a facet of his rights, and his dignity, at the end of his life, that she wanted to be able to deliver. Even in these unbearable circumstances the daughters focused not on their own needs but on what they believe to be their father&#8217;s needs. I have no doubt that TW would have been immensely proud of his daughters&#8217; courage and, if I may add, rightly so.  </p>

Their attention to TW, their commitment to their patient, their sensitivity to his welfare and privacy, revealed to me that even in these most distressing of circumstances, they had provided not only for his medical care, but had been vigilant to preserve his dignity as a human being.  </p>

His sympathy to the family was manifest. It was equally clear in the evidence of the other doctors, though expressed in different ways. Dr A impressed upon me the extent to which those working in ICU encounter death on a daily basis and in isolated circumstances. He told me that he had seen more deaths in the last twelve months than in the rest of his career put together. I gave a great deal of thought to N&#8217;s carefully phrased request and to the equally powerful evidence of M and S. I wondered if it might be possible to achieve that which they desired.  </p>

Dr B told me this was rare. TW was also regurgitating food because of the delay in the functioning of his bowel. Additionally, there was bleeding from the mouth due to TW biting his tongue during periods of involuntary movement and muscle seizure. The nutrition team were required to insert a naso-jejunal feeding tube and a mouth guard was recommended. All of this was distressing to watch, and the medical effort achieved only minimal effect given the seriousness of TW&#8217;s condition. It follows from what I have said that TW cannot feel the pain of that, but for it to occur in circumstances where treatment can achieve nothing, I consider that Dr B is right to recognise this as a compromise to his patient&#8217;s dignity. The precariousness of TW&#8217;s situation means that it is likely that he will sustain cardiac arrest and other infection which will require invasive treatment. In gentle and sensitive terms both Dr A and Dr B intimated that to require them to provide treatment in these circumstances, which they assess as contrary to TW&#8217;s interests, comes perilously close to, if not crossing, an ethical boundary. </p>

Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) to a patient in TW&#8217;s circumstances has now become inappropriate, in the sense that it serves only to compromise his dignity whilst achieving nothing by way of treatment. I am ultimately satisfied that any plan artificially to sustain TW&#8217;s situation to enable his daughters or wife to come over from Canada would be inimical to his best interests at the end of his life.  Although I have been deeply moved by the evidence of these three impressive young women, I am ultimately unable to yield to their request, whilst fulfilling my obligations to their father.
