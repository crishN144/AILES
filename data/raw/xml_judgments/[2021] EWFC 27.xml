On 21 December 2020 I heard a contested interim care order application.  There was no dispute that the interim threshold criteria were met; the issue was separation of baby from mother.  I decided that upon discharge from hospital M and Ruth should move to a mother and baby foster placement (which was the submission of M, F and the Guardian) rather than be separated (which was the submission of the LA).  That placement broke down on 8 January 2021 when M left the foster carer&#8217;s house and returned home.  By 11 January 2021 she had changed her mind and sought to return to the placement. The LA (supported by the Guardian) opposed a resumption of the placement. I convened an urgent hearing on 13 January. For reasons set out in an ex-tempore judgment, I approved the LA&#8217;s position. Ruth continues to live with the same foster carer, but without her mother in the same placement.  </p>

He had been the subject of a psychological report dated 14 January 2020 which recommended the use of an intermediary to assist him.  As requested by F&#8217;s counsel, I made two directions (one before the hearing and one during the hearing) enabling him to be assessed by Communicourt. Unfortunately, F did not attend either of the assessment meetings.  Although F was largely in attendance (albeit remotely) at the start of the hearing, his presence reduced as the hearing went on.  By the second week his legal team were unable to obtain instructions from him. He ceased communicating with them on Monday 25 January. On Thursday 28 January I made orders requiring him (i) to attend a Communicourt assessment on 1 February and (ii) requiring him to attend court in person (rather than remotely) on Wednesday 3 February.  Fortunately, that same afternoon he made contact again with his solicitors. He attended a Communicourt assessment and made himself available to give his evidence as previously planned; the order requiring him to attend court was varied to provide for attendance at his solicitors&#8217; offices for the purpose of giving evidence by the videolink.

Some Covid issues arose, and M&#8217;s counsel informed me that in the circumstances she was willing to give her evidence remotely from home on Tuesday 2 February.  After she began giving evidence, it swiftly became apparent that the connection was unsatisfactory. She kept on breaking up and questions had to be repeated. I paused the hearing to allow attempts to be made to remedy the problem.  By that stage her examination in chief had ended and she was being cross examined by leading counsel for the LA. I was then told by M&#8217;s counsel that M had become distressed by giving evidence and could not resume.  I allowed M more time to compose herself, and invited her counsel and/or solicitors to discuss with her whether she would prefer to continue giving evidence remotely from another venue such as her solicitors&#8217; offices, or in person at court if a Covid test so allowed.  After taking an early lunch, the hearing resumed at 1.15pm and I was told that M felt unable to continue giving her evidence.  In the circumstances, and with no opposition from any counsel, I made an order for her to attend at court on Thursday 4 February.  On 4 February (having tested Covid negative that morning) she was present at court with her leading counsel to resume her evidence at 11.30am.  Within a few minutes, at 11.43 she walked out of the court room saying she had had enough and couldn&#8217;t go on. </p>

She told me that although M has had limited education, her reading and writing skills are functional.  Her comprehension is reasonable, with basic reasoning skills.  She had explored with M the possibility that she might regret not giving evidence.  She told me that M was willing to resume giving evidence the next day (5 February), and would be assisted by the presence of Ms Backen, regular breaks and clear questions.  It seemed to me that, with those steps taken, there was no reason why M could not resume her evidence. I bear in mind that no application for special measures had ever been made, and M&#8217;s opposition to giving evidence was taking place at the very end of the hearing with no prior warning.  </p>

In so doing I made it clear that this would very likely be the last chance for evidence to be given by M. I was mindful that she had started evidence on Tuesday 2 February and had had ample time to reflect on her position and find, with her legal team, a way forward enabling her to complete her evidence.  In short, a line had to be drawn.  I considered it unfair on all parties, including the children, not to set a deadline.  Nobody demurred from this course of action.   </p>

That position was subsequently confirmed by her counsel orally. No applications for an adjournment were made, or for any other steps to be taken to enable the giving of her evidence.

Initial concerns revolved around (i) poor home conditions and personal hygiene, (ii) John occasionally presenting as poorly clothed and fed and (iii) failure by the parents to engage with the professionals, in particular not keeping to pre-arranged meetings. As time passed, the parents came to trust the social workers more, and all aspects appeared to improve.

The LA was not aware that in fact the parents were habitual cannabis users. There were no signs of cannabis when social workers attended and nothing to alert them to this possibility.  Outwardly, all was well. Had they been aware, the assessment process would have been very different, focusing on drug dependency and its consequences including protective issues and whether the parents were able properly to prioritise the children.  Sleep safe advice would have carried even greater urgency.  </p>

Indeed, the parents asked Rachel and Jack to leave when social workers attended. This was deliberate concealment. One reason, as the evidence established, is that the parents thought the presence of Rachel and Jack might impact on their care of the children. Another reason, I suspect, is also that they too were regular cannabis users (M&#8217;s mother confirmed that Rachel has regularly smoked cannabis since before Mark&#8217;s death, and Jack is a long-standing drug user).   </p>

An open box containing a large quantity of cannabis was found on the windowsill.  A baby bottle was on the adult bed.  The duvet was a winter 13.5 tog. The room was hot, with the window closed and the heating on. The thermostat was set at 27.5 degrees and the boiler was set to maximum. DS Cooper (part of an attendance at the house by 4 police officers about half an hour before) described that she was overwhelmed by the heat.

But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect. In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority's case was that the father 'lacks honesty with professionals', 'minimises matters of importance' and 'is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance'. Maybe. But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect? The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise. The local authority's evidence and submissions must set out the argument and explain explicitly why it is said that, in the particular case, the conclusion indeed follows from the facts. Here, as we shall see, the local authority conspicuously failed to do so. </span></p>

That this is the case goes hand in hand with the well-established law that suspicion, or even strong suspicion, is not enough to discharge the burden of proof. The court must look at each possibility, both individually and together, factoring in all the evidence available including the medical evidence before deciding whether the "fact in issue more probably occurred than not" (Re B: Lord Hoffman). </span></p>

It is also a tautology: the true distinction is between an accident which is unexpected and unintentional and an injury which involves an element of wrong. That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and/or an intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction. While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction from, say, negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely, findings of fact that at least satisfy the significant harm, attributability and objective standard of care elements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref>.  </span></p>

[21] The threshold is not concerned with intent or blame; it is concerned with whether the objective standard of care which it would be reasonable to expect for the child in question has not been provided so that the harm suffered is attributable to the care actually provided.

They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or recollection of the person hearing or relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others. As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process that might inelegantly be described as "story-creep" may occur without any necessary inference of bad faith."</span></p>

The approach to lies in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:10pt">Lucas </span><span style="font-size:10pt">requires a more measured approach. At one end of the spectrum, there will no doubt be cases where the court is satisfied that a person has deliberately refused to come to court to support their written statement and where there is no excuse or explanation. In that scenario, the court might take a bright line approach and refuse to place any weight on any of their evidence and draw inferences against them that any allegations are true. In other cases, the court will need to consider the circumstances of their failure to give evidence, any explanations offered or which present themselves and the evidence itself and the issues it goes to. Where there is compelling evidence explaining an inability to attend full weight might be given and no inferences drawn.  In between will be cases where the court might determine it is appropriate to rely on and give weight (even full weight) to some evidence but not to other evidence and to draw some but not necessarily all possible inferences.    </span></p>

He pointed out that in the study of 1,446 pre-term infants, 26 (1.8%) were identified as having rib fractures during what might be termed routine X-rays, and 47% of those fractures were posterior. Of the 26 infants all but three had underlying medical problems known to affect the skeleton, the remaining 3 being attributed to NAI, the point being that the study &#8220;does not describe any rib fractures in premature infants who had a benign clinical course&#8221;.  He concludes that the paper &#8220;provides no evidence that rib fractures do occur in infants where prematurity is the only risk factor (as is the case for Mark)&#8221; and that &#8220;rib fractures do not occur (or at least are not radiologically detectable) in cases of uncomplicated prematurity (as in Mark&#8217;s case)&#8221;. He referred to another study where low birth weight was the modelling, and only 0.3% of the cohort of infants with body weights lower than Mark&#8217;s at birth, were found to have rib fractures.  Professor Fleming in turn replied that the Glasgow study dealt only with fractures identified on chest X-rays, whereas here the small fractures were not visible on X-ray.  Accordingly, he said, the study does not directly assist in cases of microfractures. </p>

I accept also that she has been under enormous scrutiny from many quarters since then. Her three children have been removed from her care. The pressures on this young woman have been intense. Nevertheless, she understood that her evidence was important to the process of establishing what happened to Mark, and I would have expected her to want to assist. She had plenty of time to prepare for the trial.  During the hearing she had the assistance of her immensely conscientious and experienced legal team. Various measures were suggested to assist her in giving evidence. She was given considerable latitude by me as to how, where and when to give evidence. Her outbursts were prompted by questions pointing out contradictions in her evidence (e.g. about how much drink was consumed at the club) and the inference that she was not telling the truth.  The questioning was entirely appropriate, and I felt that her reaction was somewhat petulant.    I am satisfied that she was well able to give evidence (she had no functional or capacity issue) but refused to do so. In my judgment, her refusal was caused by a mixture of (i) the distress of reliving the events of 12/13 June 2019 and (ii) not wanting to answer questions which might expose inconsistency.   </p>

The LA has, rightly in my view, not sought such a finding. The medical evidence, although not completely ruling out some sort of deliberately inflicted trauma, in my judgment points overwhelmingly towards unintentional events.  None of the features commonly associated with deliberate causation of fractures is present in this case, such as haemorrhaging or bruising.  There is nothing to suggest that the parents ever physically injured any of their children or had a propensity for aggressive behaviour towards them. I have noted that, after some initial concerns, there was much that was positive about the parents&#8217; care of Mark as described to me by social workers, family partnership nurses and the manager of the neonatal ward.    </p>

The experts agree on a great deal.  The particular area which has caused difficulty is the three posterior fractures.  These did not show on the early imaging because they were too small to be seen by the naked eye on conventional radiographing.  They were identified as a result of the Micro-CT scan.  Such small fractures have only become more readily apparent in the past 5 or so years.  All experts agree that there is limited research and published literature on fractures as small as these.  That said, I generally preferred the approach of Professor Mangham who concentrated more on what is known or can be reasonably inferred, based on decades of experience in his field of expertise as a forensic histopathologist, rather than the approach of Professor Fleming who was more inclined to concentrate on what is unknown.  </p>

Understandably, they were less inclined to comment on what acts or omissions, if any, by the parents (or any other person) might have set in train the pathological outcome.  </p>

I acknowledge Professor Fleming&#8217;s reservations about the term overlay in a medical context, but it has been widely used by other experts in this case, and in this judgment, I use the word in a lay person&#8217;s sense to mean a process by which an adult, while sleeping, lies across or over the infant with whom he/she shares the bed. </p>

I am confident that the parents co-slept on occasions with Mark between 21 May and 13 June including on the night of his death.  It is impossible to say precisely how often, but more than once or twice. The likelihood is that on occasions, when Mark woke up, he was brought into their bed and kept there for much of the night. It is probable that this occurred principally when one or both parents were under the influence of cannabis, which they habitually smoked at night, and were less able or willing to ensure that Mark did not sleep in their bed. The evidence in support of these conclusions comprises (i) their failure to tell me the truth about the events of 12/13 June 2019 and (ii) the following facts, as I find them to be: </p>

Given that in evidence, F told me he smoked cannabis 3-4 times a day at this time, usually in the evening and usually sharing spliffs with M, it seems probable to me that this was not the only time F and M had used drugs that day.  Although the Guardian suggested that the presence of the open cannabis box on the windowsill may indicate that they were smoking drugs in their room that night, this was not a finding pressed strongly on me by the LA and I decline to go this far. It is suspicious, but suspicion alone is insufficient. More concretely, the toxicology report refers to &#8220;heavy&#8221; cannabis use by both parents which in my judgment accurately describes both parents&#8217; usage that day. F had in addition consumed one pint of alcohol, an amount which combined with the cannabis is likely to have reduced further his sensory responsiveness; he acknowledged that </p>

It seems likely to me that Mark was fed and then placed in his Moses basket in the bedroom at about 11pm; I was not persuaded by F&#8217;s account that Mark was not placed in his Moses basket and instead was fed by F in the bed. At some point, probably in the next 2 hours or so (I was told that he generally required a feed every 2 hours), Mark awoke and was brought into the bed by F who then fell asleep having fed him.  I consider it likely that M woke up and found Mark in bed with them.  I do not accept, as M says, that she was woken by Mark kicking her.  She did not give oral evidence on this point and her written/interview evidence conflicts; I see no reason why I should simply accept this at face value. Having woken, she did not herself put Mark back in his Moses basket.  She may well have told F to put Mark back in the Moses basket, but she did not ensure that he did so.  On the contrary, it is clear that Mark was not put back.  Both parents were drowsy and unconcerned by the consequences. Mark remained in the bed for the rest of the night, unable to move. The lividity presentation strongly suggests that at the time of death, and probably for at least an hour after death, Mark was lying on his front or side. It is likely that this was his position before death as well, probably for a lengthy period of time.   </p>

I cannot say for sure how much of his body was covered but it seems likely to me that it was the upper part of his body and over or across his head.

The accounts given by M and F to hospital professionals, to the police and to this court have concealed the truth, namely that Mark died while in bed with them, as they discovered in the early hours on 13 June 2019.  Their false narratives are borne out of a mixture of shame and fear of the consequences.

Both parents, Rachel and the paramedics administered CPR.  Although rib fractures are an uncommon consequence of CPR (8.5% in the study to which I was referred), and no expert was able to rule out entirely that the anterior fractures were caused by overlay, or by intentionally inflicted trauma, the balance of the medical evidence is to the effect that CPR was the most likely cause of the anterior fractures, or at the very least a plausible explanation.  Professor Fleming was definite; he felt it was hard to suggest any other cause. Professor Mangham put it no higher than to say &#8220;the anterior fractures could have been caused by CPR&#8221;, and Dr Lockyer considered that &#8220;it&#8217;s more likely that these were caused by resuscitation&#8221;. On balance, I am satisfied that the anterior fractures were caused in this way and the finding sought by the LA is not made out. </p>

A degree of force was necessary to cause it. Professor Mangham was clear that it probably took place at about the time of death, or afterwards and could have been a separate episode from the anterior fractures.  His evidence is that CPR can be causative of anterior fractures, although not commonly so, but there is no evidence of it causing posterior fractures.  Posterior fractures are generated by at least an element of side-to-side force rather than exclusively chest to back force which is the CPR process. There is no evidence that the sort of left/right force required to produce a posterior fracture occurred during CPR in Mark&#8217;s case. In the study where 8.5% of CPR cases led to anterior fractures, the possibility of posterior fractures during CPR was expressly considered and researched, but not a single such fracture was found, although again the study related to visible fractures rather than the small fractures found in this case. Professor Mangham, in my view perfectly soundly, did not accept that the lack of research into micro-fractures means anything is possible, which was part of Professor Fleming&#8217;s note of caution. I preferred the emphasis by Professor Mangham on decades of experience about the causation of bony injuries to the emphasis by Professor Fleming on that which is not known. Dr Lockyer thought that there was some evidence of posterior fractures occurring during CPR (although he did not identify any research) but viewed it as an unlikely cause. Further, the type of fracture is identical to those in the posterior 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> left ribs which occurred some days before and were not the result of CPR.  Dr Lockyer felt this was a significant feature of the case and I agree.  It is more likely that these almost identical fractures had the same cause.  In assessing this particular event, I have also had regard to my finding that Mark was on his front, probably tilted slightly to the right in accordance with the lividity evidence, which means that any overlay will have been across his left posterior ribs. It is far more likely that this fracture was caused during the night by compressive force accidentally perpetrated by one or other of the parents lying on Mark&#8217;s back/left side.  And, of course, I have already concluded that Mark was in bed with the parents on the night of his death and was overlaid by one or both. The overlaying which I describe is in my view the probable cause of this very small fracture. </p>

They too were caused by some form of compressive force. There is no evidence of underlying propensity to fracture, nor any identified natural anatomical explanation for the fractures, nor any relevant physiological abnormality. CPR as a cause is not a possibility. The fact of prematurity does not of itself offer an explanation absent some related condition; the Glasgow study does not support that thesis, and at best the presence of microfractures rather than visible fractures brings the prematurity feature into the category of inadequate research-based knowledge. I also tend to agree with Professor Mangham that had there been some underlying unknown, but innocent, explanation for Mark&#8217;s posterior rib fractures, there would likely have been evidence of further such fractures dating back in time, instead of the limited presentation shortly before and at the time of death. My findings about cosleeping, including on the night of Mark&#8217;s death when the almost identical left posterior 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> fracture occurred, support my conclusion that the left posterior 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> fractures were caused on one, or possibly two, occasions by a similar process.

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">been made in the family courts and the criminal courts.  Professor Fleming decried the term &#8220;overlay&#8221; and pointed out that published evidence, and his own experience, is that parents do not sleep over or across infants.  Parents and children instinctively find ways to find more comfortable positions.  That said, he acknowledged the theoretical possibility and commented that alcohol and drug use could reduce the acuity of parental instincts in such a situation.  That, in my judgment, is what happened here. In the end, the fractures were caused by a degree of force in a particular direction. Respectful as I am of the cautious expert evidence about overlay, I have considered all the evidence from all sources which was presented to me in some detail, and I have concluded that the 3 posterior fractures occurred in the manner described, by a process of accidental application of force by one or both sleeping parents.  </p>

A number of risk factors identified by the experts were present here; co-sleeping, smoking, alcohol and drug use, relatively poor socio-economic and home conditions, prematurity, the baby not lying on his back and the presence of white matter in the cranial area.  At some point during the night Mark died.  It is my task to establish why, without straining the evidence to do so. </p>

He was lying on his front, face down, tilting on his right side.  The parents had consumed cannabis (and in F&#8217;s case a limited amount of alcohol) and were less responsive to Mark&#8217;s needs than they should have been. The room was very hot and airless. A smell of cannabis pervaded the atmosphere, and the bed was small. A micro-environment rich in carbon dioxide and poor in oxygen was created.  During the night, for a number of hours, the upper part of Mark&#8217;s body (including part or all of his head) was covered by one or both of his parents&#8217; bodies.  He was unable to roll away. He was unable to lose heat through his head, and probably absorbed more heat. His airway was obstructed, and the flow of oxygen interrupted. The cranial damage may have contributed to a rapid deterioration but was not the primary cause. Respiratory and/or cardiovascular failure followed; as a result, he lost consciousness and died.  </p>

Cannabis and alcohol use that evening dulled their sensory responsiveness.  They should have ensured Mark was at all times, other than when being fed, in his Moses basket lying face up.  They should have ensured that he did not come into their bed. They should have ensured that the room conditions were suitable for a baby, with heating either off or set at a low level, no cannabis in their room and plenty of air. They exposed Mark to a risk of significant harm which, tragically, is what transpired. Although I have found that it was F who brought Mark into bed on that fateful night, I am confident that M was aware in general terms that from time-to-time Mark came into their bed for lengthy periods and tolerated the same. On 12/13 June M did on one occasion during the night tell F to put Mark in the </p>

In the end this was a tragic event, not caused deliberately by the parents, but a direct result of their failure to protect in particular by (i) bringing Mark into their bed and exposing him to co-sleeping and risks of overlay (ii) consuming alcohol and cannabis which reduced their capacity to care for Mark and respond to his needs and (iii) allowing a hot, airless and cannabis filled atmosphere to envelop the room. Their actions fell far short of the standard of care to be reasonably expected of them. </p>

I bear in mind that M in particular was young, with two children, had herself been taken into care, and found herself the subject of intense scrutiny.
