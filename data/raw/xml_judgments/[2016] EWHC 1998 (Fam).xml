It is argued that the court should make protective orders, continuing the wardship and the all ports warnings, at least for the time being.  Work should be carried out by the guardian during supervised contact, despite the mother&#8217;s anxieties (which are significant and real) by some limited unsupervised contact, but for some significant period of time; it is suggested perhaps as much as six months.  The mother submits that it is too early to contemplate contact with the paternal family.  </span></p>

It would, the guardian argues, have significant advantages to the father, in particular, who it is said is fragile and has difficulty in separating from the influences of his family to show that he can, in fact, stand on his own two feet and, in fact, truly meet the best interests of his children.</span></p>

Indeed, it is self-evident that, she not only supports it, but is happy to do so.  The children, when they saw their guardian, were able to talk about contact openly and freely.  That is independent evidence which demonstrates entirely the mother&#8217;s approach to the children&#8217;s relationship with their father.  It is, having regard to the appalling events and consequences wrought upon her by the father and his family, a remarkable position to take.</span></p>

It is easy to see why.  Intellectually, she is able to understand its value, but it is clear (notwithstanding that the children do from time to time talk about their cousins) nonetheless that she is afraid, as she puts it herself, to take a step forward.  She does not ever think that she will be able to do so.  Is that so surprising a stance in the context of this case?</span></p>

It seemed to me that that raw and understandable loss is one which the mother is going to nurse for a very long time to come, and with significant justification.</span></p>

He is pressing for more time with the children and better contact.   In relation to the current regime, he told me that he would like to be able to take the children from the contact centre by taxi into the town centre and be able to do activities with the children.  It is a modest and an entirely sensible aspiration.  He is keen to make a fresh start to put the past behind him.  It is clear that he saw this as an opportunity to demonstrate to the mother that she could, in fact, trust him.  It was, therefore, necessary that there should be some real acknowledgment of the terrible things that have been perpetrated upon her and both his daughters by his family.  Unfortunately this was not to be.  </span></p>

It was not, he said, his fault.  So, when asked that fundamental question (of that vital combination of trust and truth) I was dismayed that his response to that was that, in fact, it was the mother that had to lay the foundation stone and that, in fact, it was she that should start from scratch so that they could move forward.  It was unimpressive.  It was self-centred (as indeed has been his evidence over many months about the issue of finances).</span></p>

He is very much the product of his background.  He is totally dominated by his mother, in particular, and by his sisters.  I especially noticed his demeanour whilst his mother was giving evidence.  He was extremely affected, she has spent a lifetime manipulating and dominating her only son.  So, as I have said before, the father is essentially a decent man, but he always will lose the unequal struggle between the history and influences of his family and the powerful and overwhelming influences that they have upon him, and the love and affection he has for his children.  He is essentially vulnerable and weak.  I still hope, not just for his, but particularly for his daughters&#8217; sake, that he will be able to move to independent living.  There has been some talk of him moving to an area closer to where the children live.  If he did, it would be very much to their advantage.</span></p>

That was then clarified by the interpreters.  As I understand it, the translation could have meant either &#8220;his&#8221; or &#8220;her&#8221; decision.  The grandmother then corrected herself when she said &#8220;his&#8221; decision she meant &#8220;her&#8221;, the mother&#8217;s decision, not his.  I do not consider there was any misunderstanding either by the grandmother, or the interpretor.  The grandmother knew exactly what she was saying, and simply took advantage of the uncertainty in translation.  However, I do not rely on this passage of evidence.  When the grandmother was giving evidence, it was clearly to the father that she referred physically.  If there was some doubt about the interpretation, I leave that where it lies.  It makes no difference to my evaluation overall of the evidence or of my conclusions.</span></p>

She was, for example, asked about the passage in her recent position statement that her attitude towards the mother had changed.  Leaving aside the fact that it was self-evident that it had not, and indeed she made clear that it had not, she did her level best to avoid the question.  She kept saying &#8220;I am not understanding anything&#8221;, whereas, not only did she and does she, but the evidence demonstrated very clearly that she understood the question, and understood the question in English.  I am entirely confident that the grandmother remains at the centre of this web.  She is the loadstone around which her children are powerless; the father, I find, in particular.</span></p>

The father (and I do not blame him for this), unable to confront the truth, was at a loss as to how that could be explained.  The guardian advised that she would be best placed (a) to discuss it; and (b) to record something that the girls could refer to in the future.  Whether that takes one or two occasions, I will leave entirely to her, and whether it involves the father to some extent, I will leave to her.  Whilst I am aware that this involves, not least because of the geography, a considerable imposition on the guardian, I believe that it would be of great assistance if the father was able to be part of at least one meeting between the guardian and the children.</span></p>

The court does not wish to reduce the chance of their cooperation around the future life of the child by casting one, as it were, as a successful party entitled to his costs and the other as the unsuccessful.  It is, after all, important for the parties to be able to work together in the interests of the children both during and after the proceedings, both during their minorities and conceivably beyond.  Children&#8217;s lives do not stand still and stigmatising one party as the loser and adding to that the burden of having to pay the other&#8217;s costs is likely to jeopardise that future cooperative relationship.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">When the grandmother last gave evidence before me in October last year, she was extremely clear about the ownership of her own property, and indeed how it had been acquired and funded.  She told me about her house, and indeed how it had come about; a woman of modest means on income support, as she repeated again today.  She was vague about the contributions to the house (having regard to all the evidence now, I am sure deliberately), but was clear that the house was hers, as the father and his sister confirmed.  She told me that she purchased the house many years ago, that she lived there, and had reared her children there.  She made it clear that together with the rearing of her family single handed it was an achievement.  It will be necessary for a transcript of the grandmother&#8217;s evidence to be obtained.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Today, for the first time, she told me in evidence that the property had been transferred into the sole name of a daughter.  Initially she made clear to me that the transfer had occurred some years ago.  It contradicted what she had told me in October last year.  I was concerned about what she had told me and, therefore, required that both she and her daughter should give evidence.  Meanwhile a Land Registry extract was then obtained by the mother&#8217;s solicitors.  The property was, in fact, transferred into the daughter&#8217;s name in January of this year (2016).  That is a matter to which I shall return in a moment.  The grandmother&#8217;s evidence was unsatisfactory.  She was bluntly &#8220;blustering&#8221; in the witness box.  It was perfectly clear that she had been &#8220;caught out&#8221;.  The daughter (a sister of the lady to whom the property was transferred) was hostile and unrepentant.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I am entirely satisfied that any transfer of the property was entirely as a result of this litigation.  I am very mindful that any orders should not jeopardise the future relationship between the father and the children.  I have already commented on the unbalanced and unequal dynamic of the relationship between the grandmother and her son.  In allowing the parties time to prepare their arguments on costs since October last year, that was not to allow the grandmother to try to move assets from the Court&#8217;s reach.  The grandmother&#8217;s conduct is as crass and unsophisticated as it is cynical and dishonest.      </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I am entirely clear that the grandmother, in particular, has not only just behaved unreasonably before these proceedings (in deliberately stranding, disposing of the mother) but during these proceedings she has also behaved reprehensibly.  Her conduct in relation to her daughter-in-law and her granddaughter was cruel, and has not changed.  It was sustained with a determined will.  The family made sustained efforts to ensure that the mother would remain in Pakistan and never return.  The family, once the mother came back to this country, have made every sustained effort to control and crush the mother.  </span></p>

That has not been so in this case.  In my view, whilst the father has tried really quite hard to cooperate, I do not underestimate the enormous climb ahead of him, especially in the light of his mother&#8217;s iron determination.  </span></p>

I am satisfied that this case has been entirely led by her trenchant behaviours and perspective.  I am satisfied that it was her conduct that led to this disgraceful, extraordinary, mediaeval conduct.  Her approach today in evidence was as obviously and self-evidently evasive and untruthful as it has been on previous occasions.  As is clear, her evidence in the witness box today significantly contradicted what she said on important matters on previous occasions.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Is it fair and proportionate that I should consider making any order for costs?  I see absolutely no reason why the taxpayer should, in fact, bear the burden of these costs when the grandmother&#8217;s conduct has been so reprehensible, so unreasonable, so inimical to the welfare of these children.    Indeed, the message needs to go out to all such families that, in circumstances such as this, disposing of a wife, stranding her in Pakistan will not be tolerated.  The High Court of England and Wales will insist that the mothers and/or their children are returned to this jurisdiction, but the price may be a heavy one, for the family, condemned in costs.  I see no reason why the family should not pay for the circumstances which their conduct has caused.  Why on earth should the public pay for it?</span></p>

I am not sure that I am taking the right course, but it seems to me, having regard to everything that he has said and his undoubted confusion even when he was giving evidence yesterday (he being torn between his mother and his children), that, not without some hesitation, I take the view that, even now, any independence of thought which he has, is so far entirely suborned by his mother.</span></p>

Any order that I make is a matter which requires investigation.  I take the view that the evidence that I have had before me demonstrates clearly active, recent and pressing activity to avoid the court&#8217;s decision.  It is a matter that the Legal Aid Agency will have to pursue, self-evidently, there will be further litigation; and it is entirely likely that that transaction will have to be set aside.  I see no reason why the dishonesty, as it appears to be, of the grandmother is such that she or the family should benefit in these circumstances.</span></p>
