After living initially in H&#8217;s parents&#8217; home the newly married couple moved to BP in early 2001.  H alleges that it was acquired on the agreed basis that he and his sister SZA would share the beneficial interest equally, which agreement was later incorporated in an express written declaration made in Zenda in November 2004. </p>

Since then the parties have engaged in attritional warfare which has been both unedifying and shameful. I will find later that within the litigation each party has behaved exceptionally poorly. Neither party showed much if any contrition for their own conduct; rather, furious and rancorous blame was cast at the other. The parties have exhaustively litigated issues of occupation, residence and contact to the children and ancillary relief.  In all they have been in court on about 40 separate days and have spent about &#163;2m in costs of which &#163;560,000 has been spent on W&#8217;s attempts to force H to leave WH; in disputing whether there should be a sole or shared residence order; and determining the question of H&#8217;s contact to the children. </p>

H also entered into put and call option agreements on 3 April 2008 to acquire an interest in one of the main players in the Zendan technology sector.

The Z:$ rate fell into steep decline: this had a detrimental effect on the progress of the terminal construction given the increased costs. </p>

The raids by W of H&#8217;s private computer data between May and July 2008 must be seen in the context of W having instructed solicitors in March 2008. Miss Bangay QC described W as having conducted a &#8220;beauty parade&#8221; in this period, but it is clear that it was much more than that. She paid &#163;5,000 to Manches on 24 April 2008 and &#163;2,500 to Mishcon de Reya on 27 May 2008. That would correspond to about 15 hours&#8217; work by those firms.  In fact neither of these solicitors subsequently acted for her. W has employed Sears Tooth in the ancillary relief proceedings and Hughes Fowler Carruthers in the occupation/residence proceedings. Why she has felt the need to have separate firms of solicitors acting for her on the different fronts is hard to understand: that decision alone must have caused a degree of wastage of costs.      </p>

It is worth my expressing the view that in the short time that I have been sitting as a full-time judge I have been shocked at the volume of spurious ex parte applications that are made in the urgent applications list. It is an absolutely elementary tenet of English law that save in an emergency a court should hear both sides before giving a ruling. The only recognised exception to this rule (apart from those instances where an ex parte procedure is specifically authorised by statute) is where there is a well founded belief that the giving of notice would lead to irretrievable prejudice being caused to the applicant for relief. I have the distinct impression that a sort of lazy laissez-faire practice or syndrome has grown up which says that provided that the return date is soon, and provided that the court is satisfied that no material prejudice will be caused to the respondent, then there is no harm in making the order ex parte. In my opinion this is absolutely wrong and turns principle on its head. </p>

H copied these allegations to the Foreign Minister of Zenda and to the Zendan High Commissioner to the UK. H also made a complaint about F UK to the UK Charity Commission. H told me that these steps were taken only in order to find out the facts. This is obviously absurd and untrue &#8211; the questionnaire process was only just beginning. These were malicious acts which were all of a piece with the gathering storm.  H followed these steps up on 5 March 2009 by commencing proceedings in Zenda against W&#8217;s mother for return of &#163;325,000 being money allegedly loaned by him for building &#163;100,000, furnishings &#163;200,000 and a car &#163;25,000.

I reiterate that ex parte relief, so much at odds with age-old legal principles, should only be granted where there is evidence that the giving of notice would irretrievably prejudice the position of the applicant. Equally, I completely fail to understand how this case came anywhere near, even taking W&#8217;s evidence at its highest, to the state of affairs that justifies the grant of the draconian and exceptional order that is an ouster. It seems to me (and this view is backed by ample authority) that before making an ouster order the court has to be satisfied, with the burden of proof being firmly on the applicant, that internal regulation or partition of the property will not supply the necessary cordon sanitaire to enable the parties to co-exist peaceably until the ancillary relief hearing can take place. If that simple principle had been understood by W then a great deal of the subsequent heartache would probably have been avoided.</p>

H&#8217;s accountant, Miss Wallace-Walker argued that he was worth only &#163;843,792. Part of the &#163;50,670,771 was a sum of &#163;9,109,090 which was described as &#8220;unsubstantiated expenditure&#8221;. Following the joint accountants&#8217; statement of 11 May 2010 the &#8220;unsubstantiated expenditure&#8221; figure fell to &#163;6,044,312 and the overall figure to &#163;40,475,278. This was the position when the matter was opened. I inquired what precisely W&#8217;s case was in relation to this &#8220;unsubstantiated expenditure&#8221; figure of &#163;6,044,312. Was it being said that this had been recklessly spent and should be added back? Or was it being alleged that the sum actually existed and had been salted away in some secret undisclosed repository? Mr Moor QC made it quite clear that it was the latter. So the case began with H facing an allegation of dishonesty of the gravest nature. The claim was however abandoned on day three of the trial. By the end W was asserting that the total assets in fact amounted to &#163;31,767,715. Almost &#163;20m had evaporated from the way she put her case right up to 11 May 2010. It was on the basis of, inter alia, an averment that &#8220;Mr Nedas has stated that the true figure is &#163;51m <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and possibly much more</span>&#8221; (my emphasis) that W obtained an ex parte freezing injunction on 4 February 2010. </p>

In his report Mr Nedas recorded this and indorsed &#8220;no statement disclosed&#8221;. The technique of Mr Nedas in relation to expenditure has been to say that if an assertion by H is not backed up fully by corroborative evidence then he will not accept it and will go on to argue that the sum must still exist somewhere in some undisclosed repository. Obviously this is highly suspect as a process of logical reasoning, but it is consistent with the very high index of suspicion that has pervaded W&#8217;s case from the start.</p>

H&#8217;s alleged dishonesty was said to be a &#8220;searchlight&#8221; on his credibility generally and particularly as regards the authenticity of the option agreement referred to above and below. On its face this was a deed signed by H and his sister SZA, whose signatures were purportedly witnessed on that day in Zenda. W always doubted the authenticity of this document. H positively asserted on affidavit that to the best of his recollection he signed the document on that day in Zenda before the witnesses. Late in the day, as a result of a disclosure order made by me, W obtained evidence from BA which showed that on 4 November 2004 H was on an aeroplane flying between New York and London. H then obtained an affidavit from his Zendan lawyer AR who explained, having recovered the file from storage, that what had happened was that H had approved the deed when in New York; had signed it there on &#8220;white paper&#8221;; had returned it by fax; and had later, in December 2004 signed it on the &#8220;stamp paper&#8221;, which the witnesses had already signed back on 4 November 2004.  He produced a copy of the file which bore this out. The original of the file was couriered over from Zenda. Faced with this W&#8217;s allegation became that the entire file had been professionally forged. Later, this allegation was dropped, and by the time that closing submissions came to be made it was accepted that even though the witnessing of H&#8217;s signature was defective the Zendan deed comprised a valid express declaration as to the co-ownership of BP by H and his sister.    </p>

This has plainly been done to produce my award to a minimal level and to protect it from distribution in these proceedings. S has produced a vast quantity of paper, purportedly in support of his assertions. However, as Mr Nedas has observed, within the many pages few are materially relevant to the assessment of his worth.</p>

There is no doubt that these are proceedings where upon the account of H and his forensic accountant, H&#8217;s businesses are in decline and, if that is so, there is a clear risk that H may prefer to seek to use finances readily available to him for business purposes rather than meeting W&#8217;s ancillary relief claim. It is also clear to me that proceedings have reached a stage of considerable bitterness between the parities with hostile proceedings in Zenda which W asserts but H denies are associated with these proceedings. It is also clear that H has received encouragement from his family to minimise his exposure (see the oft-quoted letter of 16 October 2008), whether or not he has succumbed to such advice. What is clear on the other hand, however, is that H denies any intention further to deplete the pension fund or seek to alter the terms of the Rules prior to the final hearing in June. </p>

Provided the C companies, their assets and trading activities are in no way encumbered or adversely affected and provided the relief granted is worded in a form which in no way inhibits free operation of their business and bank accounts, I think it right to grant to W the protection which she seeks.</p>

I do not adjust this sum of &#163;2,182,111 to reflect the effect of inflation over the last 10 years, for two reasons. First, in that period the FTSE 100 has in fact gone down. It is debatable whether that sum if invested would now be worth more than &#163;2.182m. Second, given the degree of merger that has taken place over the period of the marriage I take the view that any investment return on these monies should be regarded as matrimonial rather than non-matrimonial property.</p>

H and GA were required each to enter into personal guarantees to cover half of 125% of the sums borrowed. H was unable to supply his. Therefore he and GA entered into agreements whereby in consideration of sums to be paid by H to GA, GA would assume sole responsibility for the guarantees. A similar arrangement was entered into in relation to the P Business. In all H owes GA &#163;2,253,621 under these arrangements. I shall revert to the sums due to GA later.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In March 2009 the ships were all professionally valued by Mr C of A Inc of A,  USA. These valuations were served with H&#8217;s replies on 3 August 2009, and had lain unchallenged thereafter. They formed the basis of calculations in both of the accountants&#8217; initial reports and in their joint statement. On the very eve of the trial Mr Nedas produced, unblushingly, a controversial report from an shipping specialist, Mr O G of I in M, USA. Somewhat to my surprise H did not object to its admission. In that report Mr G suggested that the value of the machines had gone up since March 2009. He stated that &#8220;values presented were measured at the market&#8217;s lowest point in mid-2009 and the values have increased 5 &#8211; 20% depending on regions and ships features&#8221;.  During final submissions Miss Bangay told me that in the light of this very late evidence H&#8217;s solicitors had reverted to Mr C who was of the view that one ship&#8217;s value was unchanged since his report, another ship was down 12% and the third ship was down by 17%. This is all highly unsatisfactory. I propose to use the March 2009 written valuations.</p>

First, he disputes that simply because a business is exhibiting negative equity and faces cash-flow problems it is, by definition, worthless. Second, he takes an approach similar to his approach concerning unsubstantiated expenditure. Unless H can produce right up-to-date financial information for the businesses then a proper commercial valuation is impossible and so I should take H&#8217;s investment as the true metric of current value. The former argument has similarities to the wholly unsuccessful submissions made by me to the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Marano</span>, which I will deal with more fully below.</p>

Instead he argued that a present snap shot of value was inapt. This was a project that would acquire its value over time. A more appropriate valuation date lay years in the future. The present state of affairs represented a temporary diminution in value. Therefore the better measure of value is the &#163;2.8m invested by H in it.</p>

Of course, viewed narrowly and strictly, there can be no doubt that the value on a sale today must be the value calculated by reference to the most up-to-date property valuations. But, is that the end of the matter?  Does that really inform the court about the company&#8217;s true value in the context of this family litigation? I am quite sure it does not.  I need to look at the whole background and picture. When I do that, I note the husband&#8217;s clear evidence that in his view the company was well-placed to move forward; that it was supported by five blue chip clients; that it had an excellent relationship with its bankers; and that it had recently taken on more staff and was attracting new business.  All the evidence points to the fact that this is a strong, well-managed, diversified company with a track record of producing profits which, one way or another, provided a very high standard of living for the husband and the wife.  Nothing has changed, except of course that the business environment is presently very rocky.   I essentially agree with Mr. Levitt that there is a &#8220;temporary diminution in value&#8221; so far as this company is concerned, but it is likely in the fullness of time to come back strongly when the environment improves, which, on balance, I believe will happen.  If I have to put an actual figure on the value of the company, I prefer the wife&#8217;s approach as providing a more realistic appraisal of the true value to this man and for the purposes of my exercise. I, like the husband&#8217;s bank manager, am confident about its future. </p>

Insofar as Mr Pointer suggests that the judge's attribution of value to the Axis instruments was a finding of primary fact, and thus particularly hard to disturb on appeal, we disagree with him. We accept nevertheless that the question for us remains whether it was open to the judge to prefer the approach to valuation on the part of PricewaterhouseCoopers. We conclude without hesitation that it was. It contained no methodological error. On the contrary, it reflected, more than did the approach of KPMG, the need for the divorce court to adopt valuations which are realistic and which, in particular, proceed from a premise that the present value of an asset in the hands of a party may sometimes differ both from its value in other hands and from such price as might be achieved in the event of its immediate sale.  </p>

The greater the volatility in value, or the potential for a wide range of valuation, the greater the problem. In respect of private companies, and shareholdings therein, the difficulties and potential unfairness of a 'snap shot valuation' clearly arise and can do so in a stark form. Such valuations turn in large part upon opinions as to prospects, and what multiple and discount should be used in the valuation method adopted. They suffer from the background difficulty that there is generally no open market for the shares. This can regularly give rise to large differences between highly reputable valuers even when they are using the same methodology and these can be compounded by differing views on prospects and methodology. All this, and other problems, flow from the nature of the asset. </p>

That in turn can give rise to the problem that the court is not sufficiently informed as to the possible alternatives to order what it thinks might be the fairest solution and can be left in a position of having to adopt an approach dictated by the solutions advocated by the parties which the court thinks may not include the best result. </p>

	      <p class="QuoteChar" style="margin-left:1in">Until the end of 2007, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) only sanctioned one definition of value known as 'market value' (MV). Put simply, this required a valuer to arrive at a level of value which it was reasonable to suppose might be arrived at by a willing seller and buyer in an open market transaction. In the majority of cases this approach is suitable and the figure it produces is fair and appropriate for settlement in divorce proceedings. However, there are situations, particularly when it is intended that a property is to be kept by one of the parties after the divorce, when MV could be thought to be both inappropriate and unfair. Take, for example, a property which has been owned by the parties for many years, is in a poor state of repair and is laid out in an idiosyncratic style. The MV may well be depressed by these factors, yet to the owners they are irrelevant. This means that if the 'displaced' party wanted to replicate their home they would be unable to do so at the MV ascribed, because no such identical property would be obtainable in the marketplace. They would be obliged to purchase a more conventional property, probably in better condition, at a higher price and then alter it. This would mean that they had had to expend additional funds on a condition on which they personally placed no value, meaning that they would be 'out of pocket' on the transaction. When contrasted with the position of the party who retains ownership, the relative position of the parties to one another might well be thought of as unfair.</p>

Some improvements may add value in excess of cost, but not all. New kitchens, bathrooms and decorations may well fall into this category. Others, such as swimming pools, tennis courts and stables, may only add value in line with cost, while others such as specialist paint finishes, sophisticated wiring systems, extensive landscaping and the renovation of outbuildings might add as little as say 25 pence in the pound. If a divorcing couple have willingly spent &#163;3 million on a property which was bought for &#163;4 million 2&#160;years ago (since when values have appreciated by 25%, ie it is now worth &#163;5 million), is it fair that the husband should be allowed to keep it at its market value of say &#163;6 million when, to them, the property must be worth &#163;8 million, because that is what it would cost them to replace it?</p>

This is because the family justice system depends on the majority of ancillary relief cases settling. There are enough vagaries attaching to the distributional stage of the exercise without introducing similar vagaries to the computational phase. It is hard enough for judges to advise at FDRs what the result should be without having to grapple with different measurements or concepts of value of the assets in question. If the adoption of present market value results in rough justice in some cases then that is a price worth paying in order to achieve predictability and consistency. My view is therefore that present market value should be the usual measurement of value and that fair/hope/economic values should only be used in the exceptional case. I think that serious injustice would have to be demonstrated before departure from the usual rule was justified.  </p>

I do not agree. I consider that the yardstick is by reference to 50% of the matrimonial property, and that the non-matrimonial property is excluded, and only brought into consideration if needs dictate. However, if I am to measure my conclusion against that yardstick, then the total figure I award to the applicant (exclusive of the payment off of the &#163;500,000 debt) would fall from approximately 40% of the matrimonial, to approximately 35% of the total of matrimonial and non-matrimonial, property. This latter, lesser, percentage would be, in my judgment, more than justified by virtue of the fact that the respondent's financial contribution would then have to be considered to be all the greater if it included, not only his financial contribution to the matrimonial property, but his deemed contribution of the entirety of what is otherwise non-matrimonial property. In either event, against whichever yardstick my award is measured, there is, in my judgment, and by reference to the factors in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>, ample good reason for it.</p>

The answer might well have been that it applies only to matrimonial property, namely the property of the parties generated during the marriage otherwise than by external donation; and the consequence would have been that non-matrimonial property would have fallen for redistribution by reference only to one of the two other principles of need and compensation to which we refer in para [68], below. Such an answer might better have reflected the origins of the principle in the parties' contributions to the welfare of the family; and it would have been more consonant with the references of Baroness Hale of Richmond in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span> at paras [141] and [143] to 'sharing ... the fruits of the matrimonial partnership' and to 'the approach of roughly equal sharing of partnership assets'. We consider, however, the answer to be that, subject to the exceptions identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span> to which we turn in paras [83]-[86], below, the principle applies to all the parties' property but, to the extent that their property is non-matrimonial, there is likely to be better reason for departure from equality.
