	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 5 August 2005 the Plaintiff father, Mr J, a 30 year old United States citizen living in Connecticut, issued an application under the Hague Convention.  He seeks an order that his 4 year old daughter, AJ, born on 12 September 2001, be returned forthwith to the United States.  That application is opposed by the mother, 29 year old Mrs J, a UK citizen.  AJ has lived with her mother in Wales since October 2004.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter came before me on 9 September 2005.  Miss Catherine Wood appeared for the father, and Mr Stephen Parker for the mother.  I heard evidence from the father, the mother, and a maternal uncle, Mr P.  There was insufficient time for counsel to make closing submissions at the end of a vacation sitting.  I was due to go on Circuit at the beginning of term.  It was agreed that submissions would be made in writing.</p>

I limit this to the extent necessary to understand the issues raised by the Respondent mother.  They are in brief that AJ was not habitually resident in the United States at the relevant time.  Next the father consented to or acquiesced in AJ remaining here.  Finally it would expose AJ to grave risk of harm if she were not ordered to be returned.  I shall refer to the parties as the mother and father.</p>

It had not been completed by the time that the parties separated in December 2004.  AJ&#8217;s status was different from that of the mother as she is a dual American and British citizen.  She is entitled to reside in the United States.  This was not known until after these proceedings were started.</p>

As a result she was only entitled to remain in the United States for a maximum of 90 days at any one time.  Because of this and with the father&#8217;s agreement, the mother and AJ left the United States 5 times between September 2003 and October 2004.  They were in Wales with the mother&#8217;s family between the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of November 2003, the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> of February 2004, the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of May and the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> of June 2004, the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of July 2004, and after 23 October 2004.

As is well known, it governs the position where a parent takes a child wrongfully from Convention country A to Convention country B or retains the child wrongfully in country B.  It is an essential precondition that the other parent in country A has rights of custody and that the child was habitually resident in country A at the time of the wrongful act.  If so then the courts of country B must on application return the child forthwith to the jurisdiction of country A for the courts of country A to decide where the child shall live.  However the parent who has taken or retained the child can raise limited defences which they must prove.  If they do so, the courts of country B have a discretion whether to return the child or not.</p>

In re S (Abduction: Acquiescence) (1998) 2 FKR 115 a mother abducted the 1 year old son from Australia.  The father&#8217;s first solicitor did not discuss the Hague Convention with him and appeared not to know about it.  He contacted a second solicitors four months after the abduction who did discuss the Hague Convention but told him that the Australian courts would be likely to allow the mother to return to the UK, it would therefore be a waste of time.  It was only after contacting third solicitors in September 1997 that the father issued proceedings.</p>

In earlier decisions of this court the lack of knowledge and misleading legal advice have been considered relevant factors to which the court should have regard &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. In re AZ (A Minor) (Abduction: Acquiescence) 1993 1 FLR 682 this court held that it is not necessary, in order for the defence under Art 13 to succeed, to show that the applicant had specific knowledge of the Hague Convention.  Knowledge of the facts and that the act of removal or retention is wrongful will normally usually be necessary.  But to expect the applicant necessarily to have knowledge of the rights which can be enforced under the Convention is to set too high a standard.  The degree of knowledge as a relevant factor will, of course, defend on the facts of each case.</p>

Once the father was given the relevant advice in April/May 1997 and did acquiesce in the retention of M by the mother, as I believe he did, his subsequent change of heart for whatever reason in September 1997 is irrelevant, since acquiescence had already taken place.  Acquiescence is not a continuing state of affairs and, once given, cannot be withdrawn, see re A above.</p>

Further, it has never been suggested in any of the documents before us that the father has asked or will ask to take over the care of M himself.&#8221;</p>

The first, Mr Graham said in a letter September 2005 that the father had consulted him in early January.  &#8220;Mr J was experiencing marital problems and the wife had taken his daughter from the residence at which they were staying in Wales for the holidays.  Initially I advised that he not aggressively pursue legal action, to allow time to attempt a reconciliation&#8221;.</p>

It was that he was not going to assert any right to claim AJ&#8217;s summary return.  It would be in my judgment inequitable now to permit him to do so, especially when he had encouraged the mother to implement plans for her and AJ&#8217;s continued stay in Wales.</p>

He knew the facts.  Though he had consented at the time he did nothing to inform the mother.  He positively led her to believe the contrary though he knew it was a wrongful retention by her.</p>

Even if it was not, his failure to communicate his change of mind and his active encouragement of the mothers stay means that justice requires the court to hold that he has acquiesced.  And I do so hold.</p>
