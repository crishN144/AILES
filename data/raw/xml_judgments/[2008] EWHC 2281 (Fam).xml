	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Not so long ago, whilst sitting on circuit, I found myself on successive days listed to hear cases which proved abortive because of the failure of those acting for a parent in private law family proceedings properly to engage themselves with and to ascertain what was going on in the parallel immigration proceedings in which their client was involved. In each case the outcome of the immigration proceedings was highly material to the decision I was supposed to be making. In each case the consequence of what had happened was delay for the child, waste of public money and the prejudice of other litigants whose cases were ready and who would no doubt have been delighted to be offered an earlier hearing.</p>

And since there are, I fear, lessons to be learned I am giving this albeit deliberately anonymised judgment in public. The judgment is anonymised in the interests of the children and because it would be unfair to single out for public criticism and humiliation the particular solicitors involved when my experience is that the failings which these particular cases exemplified are far too common. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">In the one case, a mother whose immigration status was precarious was seeking a residence order although she had no accommodation of her own and was living in accommodation being provided on a temporary basis by friends. She was present in the United Kingdom with the benefit of a visa which however precluded her from having any recourse to public funds. So she was not in a position to apply to the local authority for housing of the kind she would probably need if a residence order was to be made in her favour. </p>

The solicitors acting for the mother in the family proceedings had seemingly had difficulty in obtaining information from the other solicitors who were acting for her in relation to the immigration matter. And no-one on either side had thought to invite the court to invoke the <span style="font-style:italic">President&#8217;s Protocol: Communicating with the Home Office</span> of 28 February 2006. Nor was there any evidence as to what the attitude of the local authority might be if the restriction on her visa were to be removed. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[35]<marker name="tab"/>In order to comply with its statutory obligation, the family court is obliged, where an order is opposed, to have regard to the accommodation available to both parents at the time the s 8 order is under consideration. Accordingly, in order to have regard to the capability of a parent to meet the needs of a child in circumstances where that parent has no available accommodation in which the child could reside, in the statutory sense of &#8216;living&#8217; with that parent, the court is obliged to consider the likelihood of such accommodation becoming available. To satisfy that inquiry it seems to me that a family court is bound to inquire of the relevant local housing authority as to what accommodation is currently available and what is likely to become available in the future. In answering such a necessary inquiry, a local housing authority may take the opportunity to place before the family court those matters relevant to the local housing authority&#8217;s own consideration in pursuance of its statutory obligation under s 193 of the 1996 Act.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[36] <marker name="tab"/>Thus, where a s 8 order is opposed, it will not be sufficient for a parent merely to assert that he or she wants a child to come, for at least part of the time, to live with him, that parent must expect to be faced with the local housing authority&#8217;s own representations on the issue.&#8221;</p>

Neither parent was British. The father was an EU national; the mother was not. Basing herself upon her former husband&#8217;s rights under Community law, the mother claimed to be entitled to reside permanently in this country pursuant to paragraph 15(1)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006. It was made clear to me, as it had been made clear to Roderic Wood J at an earlier hearing on 11 February 2008, that the mother would not be pursuing her application to return with the child to her own country in the event of the Home Office acknowledging her right to permanent residence in this country. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">On the occasion when the matter had previously been before Roderic Wood J there was a letter before the court from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office dated 30 January 2008. It had been written in response to a letter from the President&#8217;s Chambers sent in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic">President&#8217;s Protocol </span>on 14 January 2008. The letter from the Home Office, which was detailed and helpful, included a passage which, as I read it, indicated that, on the basis of the facts as they were understood by the Home Office, the mother had acquired permanent residence and that she could apply, on form EEA4, for what was described as &#8220;confirmation that she has become permanently resident.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">In these circumstances Roderic Wood J directed that the mother was to make the appropriate application to the Home Office by 4 March 2008. His order went on to specify the date (over four months later) on which the matter was fixed for final hearing before me. In accordance with that order the application was made to the Home Office on 3 March 2008. When the matter came on before me I was told that no substantive response had been received from the Home Office and that it might not be obtained until early September 2008.</p>

I demanded that inquiries be made.

Such further information as could be obtained threw very little additional light on what had happened.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">From what I could gather, what had happened was this: On 3 March 2008 the mother&#8217;s immigration solicitors sent the completed form EEA4 to the Home Office. The covering letter failed to bring to the attention of the Home Office either the contents of the letter dated 30 January 2008 or the date for which the final hearing of the family proceedings had been fixed. On 25 March 2008 the Home Office sent a formal acknowledgment in obviously standard form indicating that applications of this nature &#8220;should be resolved within six months&#8221; &#8211; a timescale manifestly likely to frustrate the timetable which had been set by Roderic Wood J. On 28 May 2008 the mother&#8217;s family solicitors wrote to her immigration solicitors. Since I have not been shown a copy of that letter I do not know what it said. It generated a response from the immigration solicitors dated 30 May 2008 which enclosed copies of the form EEA4 and of the letters dated 3 March and 25 March 2008 and pointed out the indication from the Home Office that the application could take up to six months. </p>

In consequence, the family solicitors were, until it was too late to do anything effective in time for the hearing before me, unaware of the fact that the immigration solicitors had failed to bring those two vital matters to the attention of the Home Office and unaware of the fact that the Home Office was most unlikely to produce a decision in time for the hearing.</p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">Protocol </span>was reissued with only the most minor alterations on 1 December 2003: see the text as set out in [2004] Fam Law 151 and <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 1 FLR 638" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 1 FLR 638</ref>.

The <span style="font-style:italic">Protocol </span>was supplemented in January 2006 by <span style="font-style:italic">Guidance from the President&#8217;s Office: Communicating with the Home Office </span>which also provided a sample court order to be used in conjunction with Form EX660. (Earlier versions of the <span style="font-style:italic">Protocol </span>had a preface which, in slightly different terms, is set out in the Family Court Practice, 2008, at page 2747 and in Rayden and Jackson at para 55.55.) Form EX660 was amended in February 2006. The entire body of material was reissued on 28 February 2006: see the text as set out on-line on the Family Law Bar Association&#8217;s website.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">First, there is sometimes a failure to appreciate the difficulty in inviting a family judge to decide some issue without the court first being made aware of what is going on elsewhere. The decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Holmes-Moorhouse v Richmond-Upon-Thames London Borough Council</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2007/970" uk:canonical="[2007] EWCA Civ 970" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWCA Civ 970</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 1061" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 1061</ref>, has, I suspect, potentially much wider implications than its narrow subject matter might at first suggest. For it is likely that an analogous approach will be adopted wherever the &#8216;capability&#8217; of someone to look after a child is in issue, whether the issue arises in private law proceedings or in public law proceedings (for example, where a family member is putting themselves forward as a carer). And in the same way it is likely that an analogous approach will be adopted whether the issue as to that person&#8217;s &#8216;capability&#8217; arises, for example (no doubt other examples can readily be imagined) because of the would-be carer&#8217;s lack of accommodation, precarious immigration status, precarious physical or mental health, or involvement in criminal proceedings or in a police investigation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">In all such situations the family court will need the fullest and most up-to-date information. And where the outcome is dependent upon or is likely to be affected by the decision of some third party, whether, for example, a local authority housing department, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Crown Prosecution Service, or a NHS Primary Care Trust, or whoever, the family court will also need the fullest and most up-to-date information as to where exactly that decision-making process has got to, what the decision is, if it has been given, or when it is expected if it is still awaited. Consideration will also need to be given &#8211; and at the earliest possible stage &#8211; as to whether and if so how that third party decision maker should be brought into some appropriate form of direct engagement with the family proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Secondly, there is the fact that, partly because of the way in which the modern legal profession increasingly tends to be structured, and partly because of the way in which Legal Services Commission contracts are arranged, it is common &#8211; indeed, usual &#8211; to find different solicitors and counsel acting for the same client in the family proceedings, in the asylum/immigration matter, in the criminal proceedings and &#8211; sometimes &#8211; in the housing matter. This necessary division of labour comes at a price: the fragmentation of knowledge and responsibility, But at the same time it imposes additional burdens and responsibilities on family practitioners: in particular, the ongoing duty to remain <span style="font-style:italic">au courant </span>with what is going on elsewhere even if the matter there is being handled by other professionals.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Thirdly, there is the sheer failure of too many family lawyers to appreciate the need to be <span style="font-style:italic">au fait</span> with what is going on in relation to such other matters and the need to be in a position to answer the kind of questions which, in the nature of things, a family judge may well ask about them. I never cease to be astonished at the frequency with which the only answer to perfectly obvious and very simple questions (for example, has the Crown Prosecution Service yet decided whether or not to prosecute, has the trial date been fixed, and if so when is it, has the Secretary of State yet decided the asylum application, has an application for housing been made, when is the operation going to take place &#8211; I could give many others) is that the advocate to whom the question is addressed does not know and is unable to find out from anyone in court or readily contactable by telephone. This is simply not good enough.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The fact that, typically in such cases, the other matter is being dealt with by a different firm of solicitors and almost invariably by different counsel, is absolutely no excuse. It is the duty of those involved in family proceedings to take adequate steps <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>each hearing to find out, from the solicitors or other professional advisers acting for their client in any other relevant matter, what has been going on, where the other matters have got to and, in cases where some formal decision is anticipated, when that decision is likely to be given. And, bearing in mind the ongoing duty of full and frank disclosure on the part of parents in family proceedings &#8211; their ongoing obligation to be frank and open with the court &#8211; it is the parents&#8217; duty to instruct those advising them in any other relevant matter to keep their family solicitors informed of what is going on, just as it is the duty of those advising them in the other matter, having received such authority, to keep the family solicitors informed accordingly.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Fourthly, there is the fact that many family practitioners lack anything more than a fairly rudimentary knowledge of immigration or asylum law and practice (or for that matter housing law and practice). Too often, therefore, when answers to even quite basic questions are forthcoming it is painfully apparent that what one is being told simply cannot be correct. I make the point not to criticise practitioners, who in the modern world of specialisation and sub-specialisation cannot be expected to keep themselves up to date with or to understand the minutiae of other areas of law, but to emphasise a practical point. Copies of the correspondence and other documents on the immigration/asylum or housing solicitors&#8217; files are usually much more helpful in showing exactly what is happening than attempts by the family lawyers in correspondence with their immigration/asylum or housing counterparts to find out by means of questions and answers which may, through lack of understanding, miss the point or be misunderstood. (The problem works both ways: the family lawyers may not fully understand precisely what the immigration/asylum or housing lawyers are doing and the immigration/asylum or housing lawyers may not fully understand precisely what the family lawyers are doing or what it is they are trying to find out. So the scope for misunderstanding and confusion is increased.)</p>
