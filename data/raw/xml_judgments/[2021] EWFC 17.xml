His father is a national of that state and his mother is Russian. The parties met whilst at university and started cohabiting in 1999. They married on 25 March 2006 and separated in September 2020. The children are AA<span style="font-weight:bold"/>(born on [a date in]<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt"/>2006 and so aged 14) and BB (born on . [a date in]<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt"/>2016 and so aged 4). AA is a day pupil at Z school having started at the school in 2016.

The mother does not accept this, although it is a fact that the mother&#8217;s principal business interests are in Russia, and the children&#8217;s schools are in London. The girls&#8217; habitual residence is a major issue between them, having as it does significant jurisdictional consequences.  </p>

A former family home is in London, which was   purchased in February 2016 for &#163;6.25m in advance of AA&#8217;s starting at her London day school. A neighbouring flat bought for &#163;7.55m in September </p>

This is the property where the children&#8217;s nanny currently stays. The family also have a home in Russia, where they stay when they are in that country. There are numerous factual issues in dispute in this case, including as indicated the question of which parent was the primary carer for the children until their separation last year.  </p>

Further, there is a dispute about jurisdiction in relation to both these two separate family law issues. I have already dealt with interim financial matters in a judgment which followed a hearing between the parties on 18 January 2021. The issue in relation to the divorce and financial proceedings is listed for a determination over 7 days from 11 June. </p>

However, whether it should remain so is now the subject of the current dispute, which I heard over 1 day on the basis of submissions only from leading counsel on 17 February 2021. Between those two hearings, and since, I have been required to deal with a plethora of other short notice applications and drafting disputes about a number of different financial and welfare issues. </p>

Furthermore, the accurate state of affairs in the Russian Court, where there are competing proceedings in train, was not actually determined until the SJE in the case (whose impartiality was not accepted at the hearing by the father, but in respect of whose evidence there has been no subsequent challenge) was able to reply to a question of mine drafted over lunch on the day of the hearing, which established that the Court in Russia has not yet determined the question of the children&#8217;s habitual residence and so accepted jurisdiction in the welfare proceedings, even though that was the basis upon which Mr Gupta QC for the mother had addressed me that morning. </p>

That court held that divorce proceedings in France should be stayed in favour of prior divorce proceedings in Iceland (which is not a member state) on the ground of lis alibi pendens; and that to order a stay on that ground was not an infringement of BIIR. The conclusion I have reached cannot, therefore, be regarded as the peculiarity of an island race of common lawyers.

Little turns on the timing of the mother&#8217;s two later applications, the first of which was rejected by the judge and not appealed, the second of which was allowed and is now proceeding toward a hearing on jurisdiction. On any view, that last application was lodged after the father&#8217;s application, and on the basis that the 1996 Convention applied, would have to have waited behind the father&#8217;s application had it stood alone. All will therefore turn on the status of the first Russian application. </p>

Otherwise there would be the prospect of further confusion and delay at a later stage once the disputed questions of habitual residence have been resolved, in the very possible event that both candidate countries claimed jurisdiction. </p>

It is true that a judgment for the purposes of Brussels I is final even if an appeal is pending: e.g. Articles 37 and 46. But the object of Article 27 is to prevent irreconcilable judgments, and as a matter of policy it would be very odd if proceedings in the court second seised could continue even if on appeal the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established. Consequently, we consider (contrary to the view of the judge) that Article 27 applies until the proceedings in the court first seised are finally determined in relation to its jurisdiction. That would mean that the expression in Article 27.1 "until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established" should be interpreted to include the case where the court first seised has declared that it has no jurisdiction, but an appeal is pending against that decision, and that it would be unsatisfactory for the matter to be dealt with through a discretionary stay in the court seised second. </span></p>

To construe the Article in any other way is potentially to make a nonsense of it by a court being seised of a matter about which it can do nothing unless a party revives it... For Article 19 to bear real meaning, in my judgment, it is essential that there be proceedings which can be properly described as "existing" before the court at the relevant date.' </span></p>

Under Article 13 of the 1996 Convention, the commencement of the proceedings in the country being asked to abstain is a key point. By then, there must have been a request for corresponding measures in another contracting state, which state had jurisdiction under the Convention when the request was made to it. Of course, that last element has yet to be determined. But assuming that the measures originally requested can be seen to be under consideration now, is there still room for a window, whilst the court&#8217;s initial determination has been made but its rejection of the proceedings is still within the time for appeal but not yet appealed, during which the proceedings could not properly be described as existing &#8211; the words of Hedley J in <span style="font-style:italic">C v S</span>?

If that time had expired, then no proceedings would exist from that point, and the circumstances of a prior request still being under consideration would not be met. The next step then must be to determine whether jurisdiction existed at the time of the original request, without which Article 13 will not apply. </p>

I do not accept that. It would have amounted to such a declining, once the time for appeal had passed. Before the time for appeal had passed, and then once the appeal process was in train, the measures initially under consideration remained so and continue to be to date.

As Mr Gupta himself asserted, rightly, the issue dealt with under Article 13 is not the establishment of jurisdiction itself. Article 13 expressly anticipates that two different courts have jurisdiction. It is a mechanism which allows a stay<span style="font-weight:bold"/>to be ordered &#8211; so it is concerned with which court should be allowed to exercise<span style="font-weight:bold"/>jurisdiction, rather than being concerned with whether jurisdiction exists at all. Before the Russian Court has determined that it considers itself to have jurisdiction, I am clear that it would not be appropriate for this court to declare now that it will abstain from exercising jurisdiction, especially as its own jurisdiction is contested and has not either been established. Equally, there is no apparent reason for this court to seek to prevent the Russian court from determining the question according to its own timetable. </p>
