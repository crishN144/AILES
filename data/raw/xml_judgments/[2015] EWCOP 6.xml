She told her that she had &#163;85,000 on her account and client didn&#8217;t know she had that much money. Her daughter asked her if she would give that much money to her and her &#8216;boys&#8217;, to which client replied: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have anything left if I did! &#8230; I&#8217;d have to think about it!&#8221; Clearly EG is unaware of her finances and it seems she might not agree to a gift such as the moneys that have been drawn out of her account. My opinion is that the decision to pay 4 lump sums of money to her 4 children amounting to &#163;75,000 was not in her best interests. In light of GB and her financial difficulties, and EG&#8217;s dementia, I am passing this matter to the Office of the Public Guardian for full investigation.&#8221;</p>

She had to let them know by 5th May. We also discussed with her my predicament and asked if she could help me out. She was shown her bank statements which she always has access to anyway.

She has always been adamant that she wished to continue living in her own home and my sister gave up her job and became her full time carer to accommodate this. Due to this and other personal circumstances this led to financial hardship for my sister. Because of this we asked our mother if she would consider lending some money. We showed her the bank statements and she agreed to the request but said she thought all four siblings should be treated equally. This would have been in early April 2014 and before her behaviour became considerably more erratic. In accordance with this, gifts of &#163;20,000 were made to myself, my sister and my two brothers. I would like to reiterate that our mother&#8217;s welfare and happiness have always been our primary concern and I feel that she has received and is continuing to receive an exceptionally high level of care.&#8221;</p>

Such restriction would operate even if the EPA purported to give the donor greater authority in this respect. These restrictions were designed to protect the donor&#8217;s interests but we see no reason why the Court should not be able to relax them and give the attorney greater authority to benefit others (including himself) provided that such greater authority was not prohibited by the instrument.&#8221;</p>

It is likely that the court would have been sympathetic towards GB in view of the fact that she had given up her job to care for her mother, and it would probably have awarded an allowance to her from the donor&#8217;s funds. Because this allowance would have been made by order of the Court of Protection, it would have been treated for tax purposes as a voluntary payment and not as income in the hands of the recipient: HM Revenue &amp; Customs Employment Status Manual, ESM4016.</p>
