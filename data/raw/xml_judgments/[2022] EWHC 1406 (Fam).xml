	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This matter concerns the application by the local authority for an order under the inherent jurisdiction for declarations authorising the deprivation of liberty (&#8216;DoL order&#8217;) of a young person, X age 14, in circumstances where there was no suitable residential therapeutic placement to meet her needs. The application was made on 8 February 2022 in the context where X was in hospital after the expiry of a period of detention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>) on 4 February 2022. The relevant NHS Trust is the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Respondent. The other parties are X&#8217;s grandmother, B, her mother, C and X, through her Children&#8217;s Guardian.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_2">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application was issued on 8 February 2022 and first came before this court on 15 February 2022. At that hearing the court expressed concern at the delay in the application being made and the consequences of that for X in circumstances where her restrictions included physical and chemical restraint and up to 6:1 staffing levels. The court made a DoL order at the hearing on 15 February 2022, which has continued to date. That order has the support of X&#8217;s mother and maternal grandmother (who is X&#8217;s Special Guardian), as well as the Children&#8217;s Guardian.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case has returned to court on five occasions since that initial hearing whilst the search for a suitable placement for X has been made. The local authority commenced its search on 14 January 2022 and was only able to confirm it had identified a placement at the hearing on 18 March 2022, some two months later. The fact that a placement has been found is due to the considerable efforts made by the local authority, particularly the allocated social worker, but demonstrates, once again, the acute shortage of suitable residential placements to meet young people with X&#8217;s needs. The placement is an unregulated placement, with applications having been made for Ofsted and CQC approval. It is described as a bespoke placement and X will be the only child living there. X moved there on 23 March 2022. This move has the support of the mother, maternal grandmother and the Children&#8217;s Guardian.</p>

If there were not, it would still be lawful to confine patients in the shackles and other mechanical restraints which were commonly employed in the madhouses and asylums of the past. The abolition of legal regulation in the 1959 Act did not mean there was licence to return to the past. The criterion must be one of reasonable necessity judged against the purpose for which the restraint is employed. Hence, a detained patient may be kept in the hospital with no more force than is reasonably necessary in the circumstances to achieve this. Any patient may be restrained from doing harm to others with no more force than is reasonably necessary in the circumstances. An incapacitated patient may be given such treatment as is reasonably necessary in his own best interests.&#8217;</span></p>

The reality was X&#8217;s confinement had not changed and consent via the exercise of parental responsibility in the circumstances of this case should not be substituted for the exercise of this jurisdiction that considers the nature of the confinement and the best interests of the child in circumstances where the child&#8217;s position is separately considered.
