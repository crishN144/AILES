	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Public Guardian, represented before me by Mr David Rees, has taken the view that it is invalid because it purports to appoint attorneys in the alternative. Even if that is not prohibited, a valid enduring power of attorney cannot appoint successive attorneys where (as here) the power contemplates that one of the attorneys might begin to act before subsequently ceasing to act. Mr J&#8217;s wife, W, represented before me by Ms Sandells, says that there is nothing wrong with the enduring power, and that now that Mr J has ceased to have mental capacity the power should be registered. She considers herself unable to act, and wishes the power to be registered so that her sons can act as Mr J&#8217;s attorneys.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At common law a power of attorney is an agency created by deed. The agency thus created was terminated by the subsequent loss of mental capacity of the donor of the power. This consequence of loss of mental capacity was widely perceived as a defect in the law; and the Law Commission proposed changing it. Following the publication of both a working paper and a report (<span style="font-style:italic">The Incapacitated Principal</span> Law Com No 122) the Enduring Powers of Attorney Bill was introduced into Parliament and was enacted as the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/29" uk:canonical="1985 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since 1 October 2007, when the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> came into force, it has no longer been possible to create an enduring power of attorney. Now the way of creating a power of attorney which survives the mental incapacity of the donor of the power is by the creation of a lasting power of attorney. However, enduring powers of attorney created before that date continue to have effect. The law applicable to such powers is now contained in Schedule 4 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, which substantially re-enacts the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/29" uk:canonical="1985 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985</ref>. The relevant parts of that Schedule are set out in Appendix 1 to this judgment. One of the main changes, however, is a change in procedure. Before 1 October 2007 the Court of Protection dealt with both the legal and administrative aspects of enduring powers of attorney. Since then the Court of Protection continues to deal with the legal aspects; but the Public Guardian deals with administrative aspects, and in particular the registration of powers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Some of these essential features of the scheme call for further comment at this stage. First, the instrument creating the power must be made in the prescribed form. Various forms have been prescribed over the years. The operative parts of the form prescribed by the <span class="legdslegrhslegp3text" style="color:#000000">Enduring Powers of Attorney (Prescribed Form) Regulations 1990 are reproduced as Appendix 2 to this judgment. Regulation 2 (1) of those Regulations states:</span></p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this regulation and to regulation 4, an enduring power of attorney must be in the form set out in the Schedule to these Regulations and must include all the explanatory information headed "About using this form" in Part A of the Schedule and all the relevant marginal notes to Parts B and C. It may also include such additions (including paragraph numbers) or restrictions as the donor may decide.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus, subject to the specified provisions, regulation 2 (1) positively allows the donor to make additions to the prescribed form. Regulation 2 (2) deals with certain other aspects of the form of the instrument. In particular there must be excluded one (and only one) of any pair of alternatives. One pair of alternatives is &#8220;jointly&#8221; and &#8220;jointly and severally&#8221; in Part A of the form. Thus one of these alternatives must be omitted or deleted. Regulation 2 (3) is not relevant for present purposes. Regulation 4 provides:</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Where more than one attorney is appointed and they are to act jointly and severally, then at least one of the attorneys so appointed must execute the instrument for it to take effect as an enduring power of attorney, and only those attorneys who have executed the instrument shall have the functions of an attorney under an enduring power of attorney in the event of the donor's mental incapacity or of the registration of the power, whichever first occurs.&#8221;</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, the power may contain conditions or restrictions. There is no limitation on the nature of the conditions or restrictions, except that they must not conflict with anything that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/29" uk:canonical="1985 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> positively forbids. A condition may, for instance, be a condition precedent to the coming into operation of the power (e.g. &#8220;This power shall not be exercisable unless two medical practitioners have certified that I lack mental capacity&#8221; or &#8220;This power shall not be exercisable unless I have lacked mental capacity for more than three months&#8221;). It may be a restriction on the kind of asset with which the attorney may deal (e.g. &#8220;This power does not extend to any sale charge or other disposition of land in which I have an interest&#8221;); or may place limitations on the manner in which the attorney may deal with a particular asset (e.g. &#8220;My attorney may not sell or charge any dwelling in which I reside without the written consent of my spouse&#8221;).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Third, since there is no limit to the number of enduring powers of attorney that a donor may create a donor may create one enduring power of attorney governing his bank account and another governing his home; or one enduring power of attorney dealing with his property in England, and another dealing with his property in Wales.  Given the ability to place temporal conditions or limitations on the operation of an enduring power of attorney it is also possible to create powers which will have alternative operation. Thus a donor may create one power in favour of his wife and another in favour of his children, the latter being subject to a condition that it is not to come into operation unless his wife disclaims under the first power. The same technique may be used to create enduring powers of attorney that have successive operation. Thus a donor may create one power in favour of his wife and another in favour of his children, subject to a restriction that it is not to come into operation during his wife&#8217;s lifetime.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourth, the duty to apply for registration applies to every enduring power that a donor has created. Thus if the donor has created one power in favour of his wife, and another in favour of his children, the latter not to come into force during his wife&#8217;s lifetime, both his wife and his children must apply to register their respective powers if they have reason to believe that the donor has become or is becoming mentally incapable. As mentioned, the Public Guardian must register the power unless one of the specified grounds of objection is made out. It is not a specified ground of objection that a condition precedent to the operation of the power has not yet been satisfied. In the case just mentioned, therefore, the Public Guardian must register both powers. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/29" uk:canonical="1985 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The Act</ref> makes provision for what is called &#8220;qualified registration&#8221;. This arises only under paragraphs 20 (6) and (7) of Schedule 4. It applies only in the case of joint and several attorneys where a ground of objection is made out against one or more of them but not all. In such a case the entry in the register must be stamped with the words:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifth, because the duty to register only arises when the donor has become or is becoming mentally incapable, the power of attorney is likely to be scrutinised for the first time by the Public Guardian at a time when, if it is invalid as an enduring power of attorney because of some technical defect, it is probably too late for the donor to execute another one. This, in turn, means that the donor&#8217;s affairs will have to be administered by a deputy, which is likely to be more cumbersome, more expensive and more public than administration by attorneys of the donor&#8217;s choice. One of the important policies of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> is that, so far as possible consistent with his best interests, a protected person&#8217;s wishes should be taken into account and respected.</p>

If a donor can achieve a particular legal effect by two pieces of paper, why can he not achieve the same effect by one? The Public Guardian says that the answer to this question is that paragraph 20 (1) of the Schedule precludes that. Paragraph 20 says:</p>

Thus the instrument must state whether all those named are to act jointly or whether all those named are to act jointly and severally. There can be no mix and match, because one of the two alternatives must be deleted or omitted; otherwise the instrument will not satisfy the statutory requirement that it must be made in the prescribed form. It therefore follows that a purported enduring power conferring power of attorney on W (acting alone) or failing her on A, B and C (acting jointly) or a purported power conferring power of attorney on W (acting alone) and subsequently to A, B and C (acting jointly and severally) fails to comply with paragraph 20 (1) and thus cannot be an enduring power of attorney.</p>

Our main reason for this is that the benefit to be gained by including successive EPAs in our proposals would be out of all proportion to the complexity that such powers would create in relation to some of the more detailed areas of our scheme. In any event, successive EPAs are rendered largely unnecessary because a joint and several EPA would permit the continuation of the EPA in the event of one of the attorneys ceasing to act. It would, however, be possible to create the effect of successiveness by a donor granting EPAs in separate instruments so that the authority of an attorney under one power could commence only upon the termination of the authority of an attorney under another power.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The prescribed forms would have needed to be differently worded. This is, in essence, the point that the donor must choose between the two alternatives of &#8220;joint&#8221; on the one hand or &#8220;joint and several&#8221; on the other. There are, I think, at least two answers to this. First, although regulations made under and contemporaneously with an Act of Parliament are part of the context, they cannot add to or detract from the proper interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/29" uk:canonical="1985 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. A recent example of a case in which the draftsman of a prescribed form misunderstood <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/29" uk:canonical="1985 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> under which the form was prescribed is <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish &amp; Newcastle plc v Raguz</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 WLR 2994" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 WLR 2994</ref>. Second, regulation 2 (1) expressly permits additions to the prescribed form. I cannot see why that would prevent a donor of an enduring power of attorney from specifying two sets of attorneys, provided that it is made clear in relation to each set whether they are to act jointly on the one hand or jointly and severally on the other.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The legislation and rules would need to address the question of how such a power should be registered. If an instrument  appoints A to act alone and then B and C to act jointly and severally, how is registration to be effected?  Does the court simply register the instrument without qualification? If so, if an objector wishes to object to the registration of B as being unsuitable, does he need to object at this stage even though B cannot act whilst A is acting?  If the registration is unqualified, how is a person dealing with B or C to know whether A&#8217;s powers have come to an end?&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.91in">The answer to the first question is that since a qualified registration may only be made in very limited circumstances (of which this is not one) the registration must be unqualified. To that extent I can see no warrant for the practice developed by the Court of Protection of registering such powers as enduring powers of attorney but with qualifications. But the consequential problem that Mr Rees identifies is equally present if (as the Law Commission expressly contemplated) the donor executes two enduring powers of attorney, one in favour of A and the other a contingent power in favour of B and C. Both must be registered as soon as the donor loses mental capacity. An objector would have to object to the registration of the power in favour of B and C, even though B and C cannot act while A is acting. If the objection fails, then both enduring powers would be registered without qualification. So far as third parties are concerned, once again the same problem exists even if two powers are created by two separate instruments. Indeed the problem may even worse for third parties, because there will be two separate original instruments, each bearing the Public Guardian&#8217;s stamp. If there is only one instrument, the attorney acting for the time being will have the original. In addition, since non-fulfilment of a condition precedent contained in an instrument is not a valid ground for objection, a third party may still face the difficulty of knowing whether a conditional registered enduring power of attorney has come into operation, whichever construction of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/29" uk:canonical="1985 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> is the right one.</p>

But that problem (if it is a problem) would exist in any case where more than one attorney is appointed to act concurrently, and (if it is a problem) would be particularly acute where the attorneys may act jointly and severally, because one attorney, acting alone, might not have the original instrument. And, as I have pointed out, the existence of only one original stamped instrument may itself guard against potential abuse of a registered enduring power of attorney where two or more powers would otherwise have been registered without qualification.</p>

So paragraph 20 is engaged where an enduring power purports to appoint successive attorneys. Ms Sandells, for W, submitted that paragraph 20 should be construed as meaning that a valid enduring power of attorney must state whether, <span style="font-style:italic">in the event that they exercise the power</span>, the attorneys must exercise it jointly or jointly and severally. That, she said, was the correct meaning to be given to the phrase &#8220;appointed to act&#8221;.  Provided that an instrument makes this clear it complies with paragraph 20. If and in so far as additional words need to be added to the prescribed form to repeat the designation of each set of attorneys, this is permitted by regulation 2. In my judgment this is a permissible reading of paragraph 20, and I hold that it is the correct one. I further consider that this construction applies whether the power of attorney purports to appoint attorneys in the alternative or in succession. What is important is that the power makes clear whether, while they are acting, the attorneys are to act jointly, or jointly and severally.</p>
