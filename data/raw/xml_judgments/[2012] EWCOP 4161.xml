It is important to note that this offence was committed by him during a supervised contact session. He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment wholly suspended for 12 months; a six-month curfew; disqualification from driving for two years; and a requirement that he not drive again until he had passed an extended test.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The vehicle driven by Mr B at the time of the offence had been registered in K&#8217;s name.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The contact arrangements set out in the order of 25 January 2011 were varied in respect of Mrs B, who was permitted to have interim contact with E and K at the discretion of the local authority, taking into account E and K's wishes and feelings.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">An interim order was also made prohibiting Mr B both from talking to E and K on the telephone and from contacting or attempting to contact either E or K without the express written permission in advance of the local authority. Any such contact must also be in accordance with E and K&#8217;s properly articulated wishes and feelings at the time such contact was proposed to take place. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Interim injunctions were made preventing Mr B from coming within 100 metres of E or K without the prior permission of the local authority and prohibiting him from coming within 100 metres of the principal entrances of H House, E's work place and K's work place. A penal notice was attached.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">This order was required because the police had written to K on 10 April 2012 to inform her that she was the registered keeper of the vehicle involved in the incident on 7 April 2011.

In some cases, in some situations, they may carry much, even, on occasions, preponderant, weight. In other cases, in other situations, and even where the circumstances may have some superficial similarity, they may carry very little weight. One cannot, as it were, attribute any particular a priori weight or importance to P's wishes and feelings; it all depends, it must depend, upon the individual circumstances of the particular case. And even if one is dealing with a particular individual, the weight to be attached to their wishes and feelings must depend upon the particular context; in relation to one topic P's wishes and feelings may carry great weight whilst at the same time carrying much less weight in relation to another topic. Just as the test of incapacity under the 2005 Act is, as under the common law, 'issue specific', so in a similar way the weight to be attached to P's wishes and feelings will likewise be issue specific.</span></p>

But respect for our human condition, regard for the realities of our society and the common sense to which Lord Oliver of Aylmerton referred in In re K &#8230;, surely indicate that the starting point should be the normal assumption that mentally incapacitated adults will be better off if they live with a family rather than in an institution &#8211; however benign and enlightened the institution may be, and however well integrated into the community &#8211; and that mentally incapacitated adults who have been looked after within their family will be better off if they continue to be looked after within the family rather than by the State.</span></p>

We need to be careful not to embark upon 'social engineering'. And we should not lightly interfere with family life. If the State &#8211; typically, as here, in the guise of a local authority &#8211; is to say that it is the more appropriate person to look after a mentally incapacitated adult than her own partner or family, it assumes, as it seems to me, the burden &#8211; not the legal burden but the practical and evidential burden &#8211; of establishing that this is indeed so. And common sense surely indicates that the longer a vulnerable adult's partner, family or carer have looked after her without the State having perceived the need for its intervention, the more carefully must any proposals for intervention be scrutinised and the more cautious the court should be before accepting too readily the assertion that the State can do better than the partner, family or carer. </span></p>

Indeed that sets the requirement too low. If the State is to justify removing children from their parents or vulnerable adults from their relatives, partners, friends or carers it can only be on the basis that the State is going to provide a better quality of care than that which they have hitherto been receiving: see Re F, F v Lambeth London Borough Council <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 FLR 217" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 FLR 217</ref> at para [43]. </span></p>

The jurisdiction is to be invoked if, but only if, there is a demonstrated need to protect a vulnerable adult. And the court must be careful to ensure that in rescuing a vulnerable adult from one type of abuse it does not expose her to the risk of treatment at the hands of the State which, however well intentioned, can itself end up being abusive of her dignity, her happiness and indeed of her human rights. That said, the law must always be astute to protect the weak and helpless, not least in circumstances where, as often happens in such cases, the very people they need to be protected from are their own relatives, partners or friends: NS v MI <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/1646" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 1646 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 1646 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 444" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 444</ref>, at para [8]. </span></p>

The court, as I have said, is entitled to intervene to protect a vulnerable adult from the risk of future harm &#8211; the risk of future abuse or future exploitation &#8211; so long as there is a real possibility, rather than a merely fanciful risk, of such harm. But the court must adopt a pragmatic, common sense and robust approach to the identification, evaluation and management of perceived risk.&#8221;</span></p>

The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit &#8230; Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counter-balancing disbenefits to the applicant &#8230; Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses.

That is not bias or prejudging the outcome &#8212; obviously the court will examine the precise facts and any mitigating circumstances carefully &#8212; It is simply giving Mr and Mrs B fair warning of how seriously the court regards the breach on 7 April, and all breaches of that kind. Persons supervising contact in pursuance of a court order do a difficult and at times risky job and they must be protected by the courts. It is not in E&#8217;s and K&#8217;s best interests that contact orders and arrangements sanctioned by the court as being in their best interests are breached.</span></p>

Her conduct in 2011 was out-of-keeping with her known previous conduct. JB&#8217;s forensic history is somewhat different. In addition to his serious breaches of this court&#8217;s order, he has a record of persistent offending stretching back over half a century. His criminal record of 164 offences (many for dishonesty) has been compiled under 24 different names and three dates of birth, and includes failures to answer to bail and breaches of court orders. He has served over 20 terms of imprisonment, which indicates that imprisonment has often not deterred him from committing further imprisonable offences. This reinforces the impression that he struggles to comply with legal requirements and orders, and suggests that a penal notice, with the risk of committal, may prove not to be an effective deterrent.</span></p>
