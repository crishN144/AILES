I directed that the applicant local authority shall arrange for a substantive review of the contact arrangements; this shall take place (with a view to considering an extension of the duration of contact) within one month of AC&#8217;s move to LM.

At the outset of the hearing and, indeed, foreshadowed by a COP9 application form lodged some weeks earlier, BC made an application to adjourn this final hearing.  She indicated that she had not had time to prepare adequately for it.  She referred to having suffered a range of medical issues, particularly experienced since a roundtable meeting had taken place on 11 April.  Specifically, she referred to an allergic reaction to caffeine which had laid her low from 11 to 19 April.  She complained of having suffered a cough and a cold, a clicky jaw, and routine problems with her autoimmune disease.  She referred to two medical appointments with consultant physicians which were to take place in the week following the final hearing, one of which was routine and the other for her emerging jaw problem. </p>

I heard the evidence of SW5, the learning disability team manager employed by the applicant, and from BC herself.  I read the documentation.  I saw photographs proffered by the local authority and by BC, and saw maps of the locations of the various homes under consideration.  As I said earlier, the issues need to be seen in the context of my earlier judgment and I specifically draw attention to the following paragraphs of that judgment for emphasis: paragraphs 5, 81, 98, and 166. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">AC is currently a resident at Placement 3 which offers residential care. AC has been at Placement 3 for much of the period since the 5 February 2019 hearing when I authorised that placement.  She moved to Placement 3 on 8 February and is well settled there and seems to have made good progress.  She has formed positive relationships with staff and has displayed improved communication skills with others.  Her bowel management has been successful, and she has been eating and drinking well.  I have seen a particularly positive report from AC&#8217;s litigation friend about AC&#8217;s stay at Placement 3 which highlighted the good quality care offered by the social worker who was referred to in the attendance note as &#8220;M&#8221; and also by AC&#8217;s key worker CP10.  At Placement 3, AC has been able to enjoy a range of activities, including sailing, horse riding, sports, wildlife, music, physiotherapy, and others.  It is reported that she looks well and healthy. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Shortly after AC arrived at Placement 3, difficulties arose in the relationship between senior staff and BC.  BC was reported as having been rude and argumentative with staff and not prepared to listen to their advice or requests.  On 13 February (notably, not more than five days after AC&#8217;s arrival at Placement 3), BC reported the staff at Placement 3 to the police maintaining that the home was not meeting AC&#8217;s needs and she had concerns and suspicions about the service.  I have had the opportunity to hear BC&#8217;s explanation for that call to the police and have seen relevant records relating to it.  I pause here to observe and indeed to find that this was, in my judgment, a wholly disproportionate response to early difficulties in communication and, in my finding, a disgraceful action on the part of BC whether deliberately done with the intention of upsetting the staff at the home or not, and was calculated by BC to upset the arrangements for AC in her new accommodation.  It almost had the effect of sabotaging the placement at Placement 3.  That, as it now appears, would have been a wholly deleterious outcome for AC as is acknowledged by everyone including BC. </p>

In fact, BC has seen AC rather less than I had hoped.  First, the arrangements took some time to establish and then BC refused to attend arrangement contacts as they had been set up to be supervised by a care agency, Care Agency 3, an agency with whom BC had &#8216;issues&#8217;.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The focus of enquiry at this hearing have been future arrangements for AC&#8217;s care.  The local authority tells me that it has conducted a thorough search for suitable accommodation since October 2018.  The search has incorporated a review of all of the supported accommodation in the area and its environs.  I remind myself that even at the time of my substantive judgment in November 2018, the provision at LM was one of the possible outcomes for placement for AC (see paragraph 5 of that judgment at <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2018/34" uk:canonical="[2018] EWCOP 34" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWCOP 34</ref>).  The social worker told me that there is a dearth of suitable supported living accommodation in the area.  By &#8220;suitable&#8221;, the social worker specifically refers to AC&#8217;s specific needs.  AC has particular and, indeed, extensive living needs which are likely significantly to reduce the available options.  For instance, she needs level access for her wheelchair, space within a home for navigation within her wheelchair, the facility for a hoist, and there is a shortage of such accommodation in the area.   </p>

In the end, on the applicant&#8217;s case, it boiled down essentially to two options: SM and LM.  In respect of both sites, each of the accommodation placements have been filled and there are waiting lists for both.  Unusually, and fortuitously, AC&#8217;s name has been included on lists on both sites and has the option of accommodation in either.   </p>

First, I have considered whether AC could stay at Placement 3.  On many levels, I am satisfied that this would meet her needs.  This is a view which is shared by the professionals.  However, Placement 3 has indicated that it will not offer her a long-term home.  This is not because it cannot meet her needs but because of the difficulties caused at management level by BC.  </p>

AC currently visits MH for some of her activities.  However, MH is run by HT, as is Placement 3, an organisation which has declared that it will not entertain AC in its care given historic difficulties with BC.  The staff at HT have indicated they are not optimistic that they would be able to cope with allegations being made by BC in relation to the delivery of care provision for AC.  I may add that in the wider review of care provision, other care agencies, including TP and HH, have also declined to offer AC accommodation because of the concerns surrounding BC.   </p>

A specific flat earmarked for AC is a ground floor flat.  SM is a little further from the area than LM and would be more difficult for BC to access.  SM has a communal room which is thought to be appropriate for AC as she likes to interact with others.   </p>

AC would not have access to core support onsite and would require bespoke one-to-one support.  From LM, it would be easy for AC to access CF, a day centre, which she has previously enjoyed.  The local authority propose to use one of two care providers, either Care agency 3 or Care agency 5 to provide the care at LM but it has not been easy, says the local authority, to identify one care provider confidently given that there has been some uncertainty (and there remains some uncertainty) about a start date and indeed the location of the care provision.  The local authority would marginally prefer to engage Care agency 5 as BC has not yet had any experience with them.  There is no history with Care agency 5.  Care provider arrangements have been explored were AC to move to LM, i.e. what are the core needs, what is the individual need of AC and the other residents; there is still a small degree of uncertainty about precisely how the care package would be developed and delivered. </p>

I have had regard, as indeed have the parties, to the helpful balance sheet benefits analysis which are to be found at pages G19 and G20, and G259 to G260 of the bundle.  I have read the competing care plans with care, the care plan at G264 in relation to the delivery of care at SM and at G276 in relation to the delivery of care at LM.  There is a more current and helpful balance sheet analysis at G287.  I do not regard it as either necessary or particularly edifying to reproduce that balance sheet in this judgment, but I can confirm that I have not only reviewed it but found it helpful. </p>

Although on a main road, there are traffic calming measures along the road.  It is an obvious concern that there is no core team identified though I am satisfied, as the local authority plans advance, that a bespoke service will be provided for AC through Care agency 3 or Care agency 5.  Historically, the local authority had expressed its reservations about sexualised behaviour of other residents at LM but, on enquiry, this appeared to refer to activities historically within the apartment accommodation at LM which is discrete from the bungalows. </p>

It is untested and there is still a deal of uncertainty about the care model.  For that reason, Mr O&#8217;Brien, on behalf of the litigation friend, rightly challenged the local authority to provide more detailed information about the care provision and support that would be available to AC.  It was felt that there would perhaps be more socialisation available at SM but AC&#8217;s experience at Placement 3 reveals that she enjoys engaging with staff and, indeed, had formed, it appears, a very positive relationship with M.  At LM, she will have an intensive relationship with carers which, indeed, she may prefer.  She will, of course, also be visiting CF which will give her an opportunity to socialise at least two days a week.   </p>

The senior management did not envisage any delays in the completion of phase two which was expected by 17 June and that could be, on one analysis of the information, a realistic moving date for AC.  She had identified the landlord of LM as LL1 and confirmed that AC would benefit from an assured shorthold tenancy.  She verified that the local authority would be prepared to sign the tenancy agreement on her behalf.

It is vital that those who are going to be working with AC get to know her, her habits, her foibles, her means of communication, her strengths, her weaknesses, and her likes and dislikes.  This is the key to the successful delivery of the care package.

BC told me that she does not accept the content of CP11&#8217;s letter which I have earlier cited.  She told me she does not accept my factual findings in relation to working with professionals in the past.  She told me in her evidence that there was nothing in her behaviour which needs to change.  She did not recognise the description of being &#8220;hostile and aggressive&#8221; during telephone calls with Placement 3.  She told me in her evidence that she had never fallen out with any care provider (directly contradictory to my earlier factual findings). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">BC was clear that SM was not suitable for her sister.  It was not a safe environment, the location was not suitable, and BC would not get &#8220;peace of mind&#8221; if AC were to be resident there.  She felt that the communal space was not an advantage but was a disadvantage because she felt that AC would become neglected in a communal environment.  BC reluctantly but, in my assessment, sincerely accepted that LM whilst &#8220;not ideal&#8221; was nonetheless preferable to SM.  She accepts that there would be more outdoor space than she had thought for AC, that there may be some socialisation with her neighbour though this depends, I accept, on who the neighbour will be.  BC acknowledged the privacy which the bungalow at LM would offer her sister and accepted the appropriateness of two-to-one 24 hours a day care which should keep her safe.  BC felt that the property may need adaptation for AC&#8217;s needs and would like to contribute to the discussions around that.  In the final analysis, she made clear that her preferred option as between SM and LM was clearly LM.  She recognised the benefits of LM being a new and environmentally designed accommodation and that it would become a &#8220;home&#8221; for AC. </p>

The litigation friend has been concerned about the robustness of the search and of the plan and expressed a concern that little more information was truly available at this hearing in May 2019 than had been available in October 2018.  That said, the litigation friend is realistic that resources are limited acknowledged the suitability of the two options presented to the court.  In the event, the litigation friend concluded that LM is a placement which is more likely to meet AC&#8217;s best interests and needs coupled with her access to her day service. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In relation to contact between AC and her sister, the local authority proposes a defined order for contact which should be supervised by a third party, currently Care agency 4.  It is asserted that the current arrangement is reasonably satisfactory.  The local authority is of the view that because of BC&#8217;s behaviour, it is essential that the contact is supervised by a thirdparty agency which is not connected with the delivery of care in AC&#8217;s home.  There have been historically too many fallouts with the professionals to jeopardise that key relationship.  Ms Thomas invited me to accept the concern of the local authority that if BC were given unrestricted access to AC in her home, this would be likely to result in clashes with the staff and alienation of the support team which could have serious implications for the continuity of accommodation provision. </p>

Mr O&#8217;Brien reminds me that findings which support this argument have already been made and that there has been no mitigation or amelioration of BC&#8217;s approach.  Mr O&#8217;Brien cautioned the court that it cannot afford what he described as &#8220;the exorbitant consumption of professional time&#8221; in managing BC which is &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; to the care needs of AC.  BC&#8217;s stance has a tendency, he said, to propel care agencies into defensive caring services which is not in AC&#8217;s best interests. </p>

The litigation friend would like there to be a substantive review of contact with a view to increasing it if it is felt to be in AC&#8217;s best interests.   </p>

Her litigation friend observed that AC &#8220;appears to be engaging more than she has done on previous visits&#8221;.

She has been reluctant to give out her mobile telephone number but in fact did so in the hearing and accepted, for the first time, that the social worker could indeed contact her on this number.  She indicated that she would not be prepared to correspond with the social worker by email.  She said the issue is in relation to the use of encrypted emails and she was resolute about this.  She accepted that the legal department would not be involved forever and maintained it was the social worker not her that was &#8220;being difficult&#8221;.  She was asked whether or not she felt that there was still a &#8220;vendetta&#8221; being waged by the Social Services Department against her and she confirmed that that was still her view.

This placement provides her with, in my judgment, a true home, a bungalow on a supported living site with the facility for bespoke care.  AC will benefit from regular, dedicated two-to-one carers, which provides a significant advantage over many of the arrangements which she has benefitted from in the past and about which I heard as options for her future.  A bungalow at LM is environmentally suitable for her needs.  She will have the opportunity to continue to attend her day care centre which she has so enjoyed in the past, and it is a placement which is not only proposed by the local authority as the most suitable but it attracts the support of AC&#8217;s litigation friend and a sufficient degree of support from BC.  That, in itself, is a point of significance. </p>
