Frankly, the entangled complexities of the relationship between these parties and their litigation could be the subject matter of a book.

They are in fact now divorced by decree absolute, and the husband has remarried.  This was a second marriage for both of them.  They first met through some form of online agency.  They began to live together in early 2007.  They finally separated in 2013.  They both have children from their previous marriages but none jointly of their own.  The husband is now aged 66, and the wife is now aged 59.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It is quite clear that during the course of much of this marriage the wife continued to be engaged in litigation against her previous, first husband, Mr&#160;Harrison.  As will emerge, that has had a profound effect upon their subsequent financial situations.  In judgments in the present proceedings District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess has, in a number of places, described the approach of the wife both to that litigation against her first husband and this litigation against her second husband as obsessive, or obsessional, and indeed irrational.  By way of example only, District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess said at paragraph&#160;87 of his judgment dated 9&#160;September&#160;2014 that &#8216;&#8230;in this litigation, and in the previous litigation, the wife has&#8230;been obstinate, unrealistic and obsessive&#8217;.  I stress that those are his words after hearing evidence over several days.  They are not my choice of words; I merely repeat as part of the background what that judge concluded.</span></p>

At that time, effectively, the wife had no remaining assets or funds of her own at all.  Prior to this marriage she had owned the property in which in fact she still lives, called Inglenook in or near Guilford.   But during the subsistence of the present marriage that had been transferred into the joint names of the wife and the husband, on trust, as to 99% to him and 1% to her.  Therefore, at the time of the hearing last September that was effectively his house, not hers, although she remained, and does remain, in occupation.   He in fact lives in Singapore.  Therefore, she had no assets.  She had no income.  She owed an enormous debt standing, at that date, at about &#163;414,000, as a judgment debt, together with interest thereon, to her previous solicitors, Withers LLP.</span></p>

The way that District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess avoided that was to say that the wife must vacate Inglenook so that it could be sold, but that the husband must purchase a property, chosen by her, to a value not exceeding &#163;250,000, in which she must be permitted to live for the rest of her life.  Insofar as maintenance was concerned, he considered, and this is a matter to which I will return again later, that the wife did have an earning capacity, but that she still had a need for maintenance at the rate of &#163;1,000 a month, or &#163;12,000 a year.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The wife was dissatisfied with that outcome and applied to the High&#160;Court for permission to appeal.  That application came before Roberts&#160;J.  It became linked also with an application firmly rooted in the proposition that there had been non-disclosure by the husband, and deception by him of District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess.  Roberts&#160;J ruled upon those applications in two written judgments which she handed down during February&#160;2015, although I am unclear as to the precise date of the principal one.  At all events, there is a typed judgment by Roberts&#160;J extending to some 34&#160;pages, and 89&#160;paragraphs, dating from February&#160;2015 and an &#8216;addendum&#8217; judgment extending to some further seven&#160;pages and 20&#160;paragraphs, which does bear the date 20.2.2015.  If I may say so, in those carefully crafted, written judgments Roberts&#160;J clearly considered both the relevant law and the factual matrix and circumstances of this case with very great care.  Her conclusion was that there had not been any significant non-disclosure, or lies, or misleading of the court.  She refused permission to appeal.  It is important to stress that I, sitting at the same level as Roberts&#160;J, cannot of course in any way sit on appeal from her decision to refuse permission to appeal.</span></p>

Therefore, so far as I am concerned, and this judgment is concerned, I incorporate them by reference.  Anybody wishing to have a full appreciation and understanding of this case, and indeed this judgment, must first read those judgments.</span></p>

In this regard it is relevant to mention that at preamble, or recital 2(a) of the order of 9&#160;September&#160;2014, District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess had recorded the following:</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">At the hearing on 2&#160;June&#160;2015 the wife, who on that occasion appeared in person, first made an application that District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess should recuse himself from hearing her application.  The essential basis of that seems to have been that the wife believed that District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess and leading counsel, who from time to time acted for the husband, namely Mr&#160;Patrick&#160;Chamberlayne&#160;QC, had some sort of familiarity with each other, and specifically that they had both spoken together at some seminar a few months earlier.  It appears that the truth with regard to the seminar was that on the same day they were both speaking at seminars organised by the same company, Jordans, but that one of them was speaking in Newcastle and the other in London.  More generally, District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess was to explain in his ruling on the recusal application that it was probably true of every single barrister practising in this field that there may be casual social encounters between the barrister and judges, either after the judge became a judge, or indeed earlier when the judge was still a practitioner.  As District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess said in paragraph&#160;10 of his ruling on this point:</span></p>
	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.77in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;This is probably true of every single barrister in this field.  These social events have many hundreds of people at them at any one time.  To suggest that a judge should recuse himself, or herself, on the basis of having attended an FLBA event at the same time as a barrister appearing before him/her is a completely inappropriate suggestion and totally without merit.&#8217;</span></p>

I refuse permission to appeal.  I absolutely agree with every word that District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess said in his judgment on that topic.  Frankly, if every time a judge had had some passing encounter, social or otherwise, with a specialist barrister in a specialist field the judge had to recuse himself, there would be few cases that could be effectively heard.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The essence of the wife&#8217;s application to vary at that stage was effectively a renewed assertion that the husband had failed to disclose material, and had lied to and misled District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess at the main hearing when the maintenance order had been made.  At the hearing on 2&#160;June&#160;2015 the wife was permitted to cross-examine the husband at very considerable length over, as I understand it, about three&#160;hours.  Notwithstanding the sustained cross-examination by the wife, the district judge clearly concluded in his substantive judgment of 2&#160;June&#160;2015 that he still considered the husband to be essentially an honest person who had been frank with his overall disclosure as to his financial circumstances.  In the upshot, the district judge refused the application by the wife to vary upwards the maintenance order that had been made as recently as the previous September.  In the course of his judgment that day he said, at paragraph&#160;30:</span></p>

Paragraph&#160;16 of his order dated 5&#160;June&#160;2015 provides as follows:</span></p>

In other words, the total amount payable by the husband until the ultimate termination of the maintenance order would have started out as &#163;72,000.  However, pursuant to costs orders already made, it was being asserted that (subject to detailed assessment) the wife already owed the husband costs of around &#163;70,000.  Therefore, District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess obviously took the view that it was wrong and unjust that on the one hand there should be an unsatisfied debt by the wife to the husband for costs of the order of &#163;70,000, and on the other hand the husband should continue to be expected to pay, month in, month out, &#163;1,000 a month to an ultimate total of about &#163;70,000.  Of course, one does understand the rough justice and thinking behind that approach.  The other side of it is that the purpose of maintenance is to enable the payee, month in, month out, week in, week out, day in, day out, to provide a roof over her head, clothes on her body, and food and other necessities of life.  It was indeed clear from paragraph&#160;28 of the judgment of District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess of 2&#160;June&#160;2015 that his maintenance award had been designed simply to meet what he described as the &#8216;basic need&#8217; of the wife, for he said at paragraph&#160;28:</span></p>

Clearly, in another case, and in different circumstances in which a maintenance order may have been made to meet more than merely &#8216;basic need&#8217; but also a more generous standard of living, then there would be scope to restrict the payee to &#8216;basic need&#8217; whilst there was an outstanding significant costs debt.  However, given that the award itself was limited &#8216;basic need&#8217;, I have some reservations (I put it no higher) about the appropriateness of the order in paragraph&#160;16 on the facts and in the circumstances of this case.</span></p>

As I understand it from the first page of her own &#8216;position statement/skeleton argument&#8217; for the present hearing, dated 25&#160;June&#160;2015 (as revised 24/7/15), there are now the following applications, broadly, before the court, in the order in which she lists them.  First, an application to set aside altogether the order of District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess of 9&#160;September&#160;2014.  Second, an application to strike out the cross-application that the husband has made for a civil restraint order.  Third, an appeal against the order for possession that District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess made in relation to Inglenook on 15&#160;April&#160;2015.  Fourth, her appeal against the order of District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess, dated 5&#160;June&#160;2015, which is a reference, I think, to paragraph&#160;16, which I have just quoted above.  Fifth, an application that she has issued for permission to use documents from these proceedings in proposed proceedings in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division, and also in any prospective criminal proceedings.  Sixth, an application to transfer all these matrimonial matters from the level of District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess to the Royal Courts of Justice.  Although not expressly set out on that page of her position statement, there is also, undoubtedly, a current application for permission to appeal from the decisions of District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess not to recuse himself (which I have already refused) and his decision of 2&#160;June&#160;2015 not to vary upwards the maintenance.</span></p>

It is clear that the wife has a very, very longstanding complaint and belief that there has been repeated non-disclosure by the husband and the withholding of documents.  The hearing on 2&#160;June&#160;2015 began, as I understand it, at the beginning of the normal court day, and during the course of the morning Mrs&#160;Welch (who was acting in person) was cross-examining her husband.  She was very keen to see certain Singapore tax documents,  and, in particular, his tax return in form B1, and the Singapore form IR8A for the calendar and tax year 1&#160;January to 31&#160;December&#160;2014.  The form IR8A is the Singapore equivalent of a UK P11D in which taxable expenses are returned.</span></p>

Initially there was indeed a reference to &#8216;the tax return&#8217;.  It is, however, quite clear that the document which he produced was not the tax return but was the Singapore revenue authority&#8217;s notice of assessment, dated 2&#160;May&#160;2015, with respect to the tax year 1&#160;January to 31&#160;December&#160;2014.

A little later, around bundle page&#160;42, internal page&#160;12, Mrs&#160;Welch started asking about the IR8A, to which Mr&#160;Welch said: &#8216;I&#8217;ve got a copy of that document on my iPhone&#8217;.  He appears to repeat that in an answer in the middle of bundle page&#160;43, internal page&#160;13.  Also on that page Mrs&#160;Welch asked: &#8216;Let&#8217;s have a look at your phone again, shall we, to see if we can find the B1?&#8217; to which Mr&#160;Welch replied: &#8216;This is the B&#8230;I&#8217;ve done a search of the documentation that I&#8217;ve received from my accountant.  I&#8217;ve got the IR8A&#8230;&#8217;.  It thus appears that, at any rate by that point of the cross-examination that afternoon, Mr&#160;Welch, who clearly had his mobile phone with him, had turned up, on the phone, both the B1 and the IR8A.  Unfortunately, the questioning somewhat drifted away from those documents at that point and they do not appear actually to have been produced.  Therefore, the first very strong point made by Mrs&#160;Welch during the course of this hearing is that there was continuing non-disclosure and deception by the husband in his failure at that hearing to produce the actual tax return, form B1, and the form IR8A.  </span></p>

There was a hearing before myself on 25&#160;June&#160;2015.  On that date all these matters raised by Mrs&#160;Welch were listed, I think, for final hearing.  Very, very tragically her own mother died about 24&#160;hours before that hearing.  Common humanity required that I should not embark upon a hearing of this kind when, understandably, Mrs&#160;Welch was deeply affected by grief, and extremely busy with organising the funeral.  She did, however, appear before me that day.  In court on that day she asked again to see the B1 for the year ending 31&#160;December&#160;2014, and the IR8A for that year.  She said that she believed that the husband&#8217;s solicitors were in possession of those documents.  On that occasion Mr&#160;Patrick&#160;Chamberlayne&#160;QC was appearing on behalf of the husband.  He said, on instructions, that Gordon&#160;Dadds, the husband&#8217;s solicitors, did not have those documents, but to put the matter beyond doubt I made an order at paragraph&#160;8 of my order that day as follows:</span></p>

That letter is relatively lengthy and I cannot quote from it at length in this judgment.  It sets out, at the bottom of the second page, and going into the top of the third page, a number of tax-related documents in their possession, which they then attached to the letter in a bundle of documents which, during the course of this hearing, we numbered from pages 1 to 35.  Mr&#160;Ruck categorically stated towards the bottom of the third page of the letter that Gordon&#160;Dadds have not come into possession of any other documentation relating to Mr&#160;Welch&#8217;s tax affairs than those.</span></p>

It is now accepted by and on behalf of Gordon&#160;Dadds that that was an error.   No documents at all were given to Mrs&#160;Welch during &#8216;the lunch hour&#8217;.  Rather, what happened was that the two categories of documents that I have mentioned, namely the Singapore notice of assessment and the financial statements for One&#160;World&#160;Maritime, were produced in the courtroom (and copies obviously handed at that moment to Mrs&#160;Welch) when the hearing resumed after lunch.  In a case in which conspiracy theories abound, and Gordon&#160;Dadds know very well indeed that Mrs&#160;Welch is highly mistrustful of her husband, of any lawyers who act for her husband, and indeed of at least two judges, namely District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess and Roberts&#160;J (both of whom she has asked to recuse themselves), it was deeply regrettable that Mr&#160;Ruck did not take more care before drafting or signing off that letter to ensure its scrupulous accuracy.    It has inevitably raised the index of suspicion by Mrs&#160;Welch during this hearing that Gordon&#160;Dadds asserted that that sheaf of documents were given to her during the lunch hour at the final hearing when in truth no documents were given to her during the lunch hour. Further, only a small part of the documents listed by Mr&#160;Ruck in the letter were actually handed to her at all during the day of the final hearing of the variation application.</span></p>

That is the third category of documents.   As it happens, those two sheets really do not take the case any further at all.  They are essentially the statement of account as between Mr&#160;Welch and the tax authorities showing how much he has paid by monthly instalments, and how much he still owes at any one time, and they add nothing to Mrs&#160;Welch&#8217;s knowledge and understanding, or that of the court, of the overall financial circumstances of the husband.</span></p>

Inevitably, this has raised in Mrs&#160;Welch a huge suspicion that, as she would say, &#8216;once again&#8217; the husband and/or his solicitors are gravely misleading the court.

For that reason I offered her the opportunity, which she rapidly accepted, to cross-examine and ask questions of Ms&#160;Emma&#160;Morris, the solicitor (though not a partner) in Gordon&#160;Dadds who has had considerable conduct of this case, and has been present in court throughout this hearing.</span></p>

However, time has not, frankly, permitted me to go into the kind of intense and enormous detail that Mrs&#160;Welch would wish.</span></p>

Frankly, it may be no more than Withers feeling a sense of absolute desperation, having learnt the manner in which the district judge fashioned his order, which was highly benevolent to the wife in the circumstances, and highly disadvantageous to Withers.   But in any event the email from Stephen&#160;Butcher is clearly on the basis that the sum of &#163;150,000 &#8216;is readily available&#8217;.  I am afraid that today Mrs&#160;Welch cannot put her hands to a pound, let alone &#163;150,000.

In view of the fact that the husband has already paid out very large sums towards the costs of the catastrophic litigation with the first husband, it may be that the district judge would take a great deal of persuading to make provision from the assets of the husband for &#163;150,000 to pay to Withers.

The first three items were received in or before August&#160;2006, so Mrs&#160;Welch makes two points: first, those items, which total just over &#163;40,000, could not have been funded by Mr&#160;Welch since she did not even know him at the time.  Second, the bottom-line figure is &#163;166,000, which is far short of the half&#160;million pounds referred to by the district judge.</span></p>

This is not something occurring subsequent to the decision and order of September&#160;2014.  Indeed it relates to matters occurring during 2006 and 2007, namely the making of the payments.  Mrs&#160;Welch says she has only just received this ledger document from Withers.  She says that solicitors who at one stage acted for her in the present litigation tried to get this information from Withers earlier, and that Withers, being themselves locked into litigation with her, were not forthcoming.  Actually, I am not willing to accept that as an answer, since ultimately speaking the accountant, or a similar person, at Withers could have been required to attend the hearing on subpoena and bring his ledger with him, although patently it would never have come to that.  The fact of the matter is that this material is not only not </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Barder</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> material, but does not begin to satisfy the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Ladd v Marshall</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> criteria for adducing fresh evidence (I interpose that Mrs&#160;Welch is also very familiar with the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Ladd&#160;v&#160;Marshall</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and that area of the law in relation to the admissibility of fresh evidence).</span></p>

First, as the district judge himself said, he was including within that figure payment of indemnity costs of Manches, who I assume are solicitors acting at some stage for the first husband, Mr&#160;Harrison.  The figure of those indemnity costs was apparently &#163;221,000, so a total of the costs actually received by Withers of &#163;166,000, and the costs paid to Manches of &#163;221,000 is itself &#163;387,000.  Additionally, however, Mr&#160;Richard&#160;Bates, who appears today on behalf of Mr&#160;Welch (for him, like me, this is I believe a first appearance in this litigation, apart from my brief walk-on part on 25&#160;June), has told me that additional payments were &#163;126,000 to Charles&#160;Russell, and &#163;93,000 to Mishcon&#160;de&#160;Reya.  A total of all those figures is in fact &#163;606,000, that is, over &#163;100,000 more than the half million pounds assessed by District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess.  Therefore, this is not a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Barder</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> event.  The document from Withers is not admissible under </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Ladd&#160;v&#160;Marshall</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> principles since the evidence was reasonably obtainable long before September&#160;2014, and in any event it does not ultimately prove what Mrs&#160;Welch asserts.</span></p>

At paragraphs&#160;62 to 64 of his judgment of September&#160;2014 he dealt with the working position and earning capacity of the husband.  He quoted a passage in a statement in which the husband had said that he was trying to get work, that he had been unsuccessful and was fearing he might be at the end of his career, but went on to say that it may be that he will get work, and he is hoping he will get work to keep him going in Singapore, at least until next year.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The document which Mrs&#160;Welch has produced at this hearing is a letter dated 20&#160;July&#160;2015 from Cosham Benefit Centre in Wolverhampton.  This refers to &#8216;a recent change&#8217; and &#8216;a decision on your capability for work&#8217;.  It continues, &#8216;You meet the eligibility criteria for support group.  This means you are not required to take part in any work-related activity&#8230;&#8217;.  As a result of that, she is granted what is described as &#8216;extra money&#8217; bringing her total weekly entitlement up to &#163;123.70.  The letter is certainly concise and I do not know what material or evidence was available to the benefit centre when making that assessment.  That said, it appears, at least superficially, that the state (which is very sparing with spending money at the moment) has determined that the &#8216;capability for work&#8217; of the wife is such that she is &#8216;not required to take part in any work-related activity&#8217;, and that the state will pay to her &#8216;extra money&#8217;.  If all that be right (and it may require a great deal of further investigation) it is of course possible that the conclusion of District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess in both September&#160;2014 and June&#160;2015 that Mrs&#160;Welch is fit enough to work, and capable of working, although correct then, may require reconsideration now.  I stress that that is not a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Barder</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> event.  However, whilst the very last thing I would wish to do is to encourage any further litigation at all, these new facts with regard to her health and work &#8216;capability&#8217; may (I stress may) justify some reconsideration on a variation application, both of the level of periodical payments, and also of that provision in paragraph&#160;16 of the order of 5&#160;June&#160;2015, which I quoted above.  With regard to the level of periodical payments, District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess clearly thought that this lady requires approximately &#163;2,000 a month to meet her basic needs.  He assumed that she could herself earn at least &#163;1,000 a month, and therefore required the husband to contribute only the other &#163;1,000 a month.  It may (I stress may) now appear that she cannot be expected herself to contribute &#163;1,000 a month, and indeed that the most she can contribute is the monthly equivalent of &#163;123.70 a week which she receives from the state.  That would leave a quite significant shortfall.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The other point is that District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess reached the decision in June that the maintenance payments should be &#8216;suspended&#8217; in view of the large amount of costs that the wife owes to the husband.  As I observed earlier, in a case in which the maintenance order makes provision which has some &#8216;generosity&#8217; within it, then it may well be an appropriate and acceptable approach to say that payments of maintenance should be suspended until the costs debt has been erased.  In this case, however, we are now talking about subsistence.  At the moment, the lady is apparently not capable of working.  At the moment, she has a mere &#163;123.70 a week, or &#163;6,432 a year coming in, against an assessed &#8216;basic need&#8217; of &#163;24,000 a year.  In those circumstances it may (I stress may) be that the provision of paragraph&#160;16 of the order of 5&#160;June&#160;2015 requires reconsideration.  Maintenance in a case like this is about subsistence.  The lady has no capital assets whatsoever.  She appears currently to have no income, or source of income other than &#163;123.70 a week.  It may be that there simply is not room in this case to suspend the maintenance any longer, leaving her on the breadline, however great her costs debt to her former husband.  I stress these are not </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Barder</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> events, but they do mean that I am not prepared in this case to make some kind of all-embracing extended civil restraint order that would preclude even the making of a further application to vary the level of maintenance.</span></p>

In view of the hour, and the serious risk that this judgment may shortly cease to be being recorded because all recording machinery in the Royal Courts of Justice may get switched off, I must deal with this extremely shortly.  She remains absolutely convinced that there has been serious non-disclosure in this case, notwithstanding, first, that District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess, although well aware of the contention, was quite satisfied that the husband was being open and honest.  Second, that Roberts&#160;J, who scrutinised with the utmost care a great deal of further information introduced by Mrs&#160;Welch, concluded, most obviously at paragraph&#160;18 of her addendum judgment, that, &#8216;I did not, and do not, consider that this evidence is sufficient to justify a wholesale reopening of wife&#8217;s financial claims against the husband&#8230;&#8217;.  That, as I say, is a conclusion by a judge who is renowned for her ferret-like capacity to get to the truth of non-disclosure after a very careful scrutiny of the documents.  She had said also, in paragraph&#160;78 of her primary judgment:</span></p>

Contrary to the wife&#8217;s assertions, in my view this &#8220;fresh evidence&#8221; proves very little, apart from the fact that the husband has been consistent in his efforts to secure further employment&#8230;I can find no cogent or reliable evidence to substantiate her allegation that he has placed funds out of the reach of the wife or the court, or that he continues a &#8220;champagne lifestyle&#8221;, which would suggest that he has access to significant and (as yet) undisclosed funds&#8230;&#8217;.</span></p>

First, there is the question of whether or not there was undisclosed employment by a company called Ampelmann.  At paragraph&#160;14 of her addendum judgment Roberts&#160;J said, &#8216;I have gone back to analyse the evidence which has been put before me on this issue and nowhere do I find corroboration for the wife&#8217;s assertion that he was employed by this company prior to the hearing in September&#160;2014&#8230;&#8217;  Mrs&#160;Welch has returned to the fray and her profound belief that even before that hearing the husband was employed by, and in receipt of income from, that company.   However, this was the subject of cross-examination and evidence during the hearing on 2&#160;June&#160;2015.  At an answer at the bottom of the red bundle, tab&#160;4, page&#160;51, internal page&#160;23 of the transcript, the husband said, in relation to that company:</span></p>

They had made some enquiries, then they went away.  I heard nothing more until they had actually spoken to two of the ex-directors of IHC in Holland.  It is a Dutch company.  They didn&#8217;t come back to me until I think it was November, and the first pay cheque that I got from them was in December, the middle of December, and I didn&#8217;t get paid the full amount that we&#8217;d agreed in terms of my daily rate because I&#8217;d only worked half of the month&#8230;&#8217;.</span></p>

This is very young company.  The person I report to is 34&#160;years old, and I have been told variously by him to get my act together, and more recently that he was disappointed because I didn&#8217;t have the killer instinct in terms of going for future business&#8230;&#8217;</span></p>

The husband was cross-examined.  He gave that evidence, all of which is to the effect, as Roberts&#160;J had herself concluded, namely that he was not employed by that company prior to the hearing in September&#160;2014.  I am not in the least persuaded that there is now some basis for challenging and setting aside that order because of non-disclosure as at early September&#160;2014 of some hidden employment with Ampelmann.  In short, the employment with Ampelmann came later.</span></p>

At page&#160;118 of tab&#160;3 of her red bundle she produces a document downloaded from the Internet, headed &#8216;Welcome to GasPartners&#8217;.  This states that GasPartners is a joint partnership between various named people, one of whom is Denis&#160;Welch.  A little further on there are photographs and brief biographies of the various so-called partners, and these include a photograph, which I am told is a photograph of, and a description of Denis&#160;Welch.  Therefore, Mrs&#160;Welch has a deep conviction that this is a prosperous partnership from which the husband has been, and is, extracting a good income, and in which he may indeed have substantial capital.  This also was the subject of cross-examination before District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess in the June hearing at bundle pages&#160;20, 21 and 28, internal pages&#160;38, 39 and 46 of the transcript, in tab&#160;4 of the red bundle.  In summary, Mr&#160;Welch described that GasPartners was a group of individuals, including himself, with whom he was trying to do business.  He said, at bundle page&#160;21, that he had had no income whatsoever from GasPartners, although he did not deny the existence of GasPartners.  He explained that the purpose of the partnership was to try to develop an opening in Asia for the application of liquid natural gas as a fuel for vessels.  The district judge asked, &#8216;So have you earned any money from GasPartners since the September hearing?&#8217;  Answer, &#8216;None whatsoever.  None whatsoever&#8217;.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mrs&#160;Welch has also made plain that she would like to engage the police or other prosecuting authorities in an investigation of whether or not Mr&#160;Welch has committed perjury or other crimes.  I do not of course in any way whatsoever prevent her from doing that, but, consistent with the making of the extended civil restraint order, I will refuse, or dismiss the application that she made for permission to rely upon documents disclosed in these proceedings in support of an action to commit Mr&#160;Welch to prison for contempt of court, false imprisonment, non-disclosure and any associated damages claim in the Queen&#8217;s&#160;Bench&#160;Division, but that order will contain the following important words:</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">That, I think, now rules upon all the applications that are before me by each of Mrs&#160;Welch and Mr&#160;Welch, save only the application by Mr&#160;Bates that I should make some order against Mrs&#160;Welch as to the costs of and incidental to this hearing, yesterday and today.  I have already indicated that I refuse to do that.  It may be that that decision of mine is not entirely in accordance with principle, this being an appellate stage, and ordinarily costs at an appellate stage follow the event.  However, it is a decision sometimes necessary in family proceedings of this kind which reflects realities.  The fact of the matter is that this lady has absolutely no funds and no assets.  Currently, the only income available to her is &#163;123 a week, payable by way of benefits.  She already has phenomenal debts.  She owes &#163;441,000 to Withers, which she has not the slightest prospect of paying.  She owes, it is said, &#163;70,000 already to the husband under costs orders made to date.  To my mind it is simply futile, and in the circumstances of this case, purely punitive, to add to that a yet further costs order for the costs of and incidental to this hearing, yesterday and today.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Further, there is an acute problem which now arises in these situations since the virtual total withdrawal of legal aid in private family law litigation.  Formerly, a lady with absolutely no means such as Mrs&#160;Welch would most probably have been eligible for legal aid.  That would have had two effects.   One effect is that she would have been protected by provisions of the legal aid legislation against enforceable costs orders being made against her.  The other effect was that people in the position of Mrs&#160;Welch were able at any rate to benefit from objective legal advice.  It is, I am afraid, a problem which is increasingly faced now that litigants in person are denied any publicly-funded legal advice.  They do their very best, and undoubtedly Mrs&#160;Welch has become a very proficient lawyer herself, but they are denied the advantage of objective legal advice.  That has the effect that far too often we are now faced with days like yesterday and today in court.  It is largely the responsibility of Mrs&#160;Welch, and in the words of District&#160;Judge&#160;Hess, her obsessive and irrational approach to these proceedings, but it may also be in part due to the denial to her of any publicly-funded legal advice.</span></p>

I now record that it is 7.15pm, and on that note, I draw this hearing to an end.</span></p>
