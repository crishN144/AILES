		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In the Family Court in an appropriate case a judge will not infrequently directly refer to the authority of R v Lucas in giving a judicial self-direction as to the approach to be taken to an apparent lie.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">One highly important aspect of the Lucas decision, and indeed the approach to lies generally in the criminal jurisdiction, needs to be borne fully in mind by family judges. It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the "lie" is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is "capable of amounting to a corroboration". In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Middleton [2001] Crim. L.R. 251.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt&#8221;.</p>

In these circumstances, I venture to suggest that it would be good practice when the tribunal is invited to proceed on the basis , or itself determines, that such a direction is called for, to seek Counsel's submissions to identify: (i) the deliberate lie(s) upon which they seek to rely; (ii) the significant issue to which it/they relate(s), and (iii) on what basis it can be determined that the only explanation for the lie(s) is guilt. The principles of the direction will remain the same, but they must be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the witness before the court.&#8221;</span></p>

I think the father does not fully understand the serious emotional implications of the mother&#8217;s behaviour (I am not thinking about the allegations of physical harm right now but more about the emotional relationship between CS and her mother) for CS. He has underestimated the mother&#8217;s grip on CS, and CS&#8217;s need for him, her father.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The mother&#8217;s pathology is one in which she needed CS to be close to her; and for CS to be the way she wanted her to be. Although the mother was able to make some links with her own mother, I think she does not understand her behaviour and is emotionally abusive by suggesting that CS has been set up by her father to behave the way she does, stating that CS is an abusive child and that she is in collusion with her father. The mother was wholly unable to attune to CS&#8217;s highly distressed state when she wanted to leave the house (in the video, but also in the interviews when we spoke about CS), did not understand the reasons for her daughter&#8217;s volatile behaviour, and used the video clip to vindicate her own behaviour. In this process, the mother emotionally abused her son, DS, by making him witness these distressed and violent states of mind.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The conflict between the parents is also fuelled by the mother&#8217;s inability to separate from the father. Despite her apparent independence, she continues an argument with the father in order not to have to feel abandoned. This dynamic is precisely the behaviour that is also seen in CS, whose violence to break away from her mother can also be seen as a way of holding on to her mother, especially when she perceives herself to have power of her mother. CS, however, is a child, she is dependent on her mother and seeks to free herself from the constraints her mother puts on her. CS, too early in life, is in a position in which she wishes to remove herself from her mother. She needs to be helped with that separation and be encouraged to have contact, at this stage. It is clear that she cannot now be with her mother.</p>

However, he is exposed to the mother&#8217;s attack on the father when she told him to video, for example, and when his mother told him that Dr Willemsen won a Nobel prize (presumably referring to my CV), and that a chocolate medal could have been the physical reward. DS would not have understood these comments.</p>

I consider, however, that the mother makes frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment (for example the continuation of the allegations which puts her in a position of conflict with the father, a conflict she holds on to, to avoid abandonment); the relationship with the father is described as unstable. The mother has a lack of sense of self. Her internal world is based on what she perceives other people to be without being able to consider her part in complex relationships. Certainly, on account of the father and CS, the mother is impulsive, angry and has a temper. I consider the mother may have chronic feelings of emptiness. There is stress-related paranoid ideation and difficulties regulating her anger, again as reported by the father and CS.</p>

I raised concerns about the parents&#8217; inability to co-parent in light of the continued conflict between them but also about the very different understandings the parents have of the children&#8217;s behaviour. There are, however, concerning examples of the mother pulling DS into her conflict with CS, from which DS, at this stage, cannot be adequately protected.</p>

I thought a great deal about there not being any contact at all, between DS and his mother, but that option appears to be harmful too, in that there are also good aspects of his relationship with her. I consider that once the financial and child proceedings come to an end, there might be less conflict, at least overtly, between the parents.</p>

If the mother does not (sufficiently) change, there is a risk that DS will remain subjected to the mother&#8217;s behaviours which could cause him further emotional harm, by speaking to him about her thoughts about the father and CS, for example. Or by seeking information from him. DS might remain exposed to the mother&#8217;s conflict with the father but also to the mother&#8217;s demands of him, as DS alleged.</p>

His father said it helped him digest better; it was a Wellkid tablet. DS never saw the box; he only saw the tablet. He did not see the box. It felt like the medication was making him dizzy. He had opened one, cracked it open and there was some white dusty powder inside; it tasted disgusting.</p>

First, on the third day of the mother&#8217;s evidence the children&#8217;s guardian was so concerned about the mother&#8217;s evidence and presentation and its potential adverse impact on DS, that she made a safeguarding referral to the local authority. In the whole of my judicial career I have never known a guardian take such a course of action. I say this not as a criticism &#8211; on the contrary she was entirely right to act as she did &#8211; but to illustrate the grave concern of those in court who were listening to the mother&#8217;s testimony.</p>

When, after a short adjournment, I resumed the hearing Ms Kavanagh said that in light of the mother&#8217;s &#8216;paranoid and delusional&#8217; behaviour in the witness box, she, her solicitor and Dr C (a renowned expert in high conflict family cases who had been counselling the mother) had reached the view that the other had lost capacity to litigate.

In a distressed state CS telephoned the father who drove over to the mother&#8217;s home. There then followed the most appalling and distressing scene in which CS, who was by now hysterical, was trying to leave the mother&#8217;s home to see her father but her way was blocked by the mother. Not only was DS present throughout but the mother told DS to video record events on her mobile telephone. She said she did so to prove she had not hit CS. This stand off lasted for several minutes.</p>

CS was very slow in getting herself ready, so the mother took DS. There then followed an argument between CS and the mother when she refused to take CS to see ES. The mother filmed the scene on her mobile telephone. CS was kicking and lashing out at her mother. A short time later the mother covertly recorded CS speaking to ES on her mobile telephone. The mother interpreted ES&#8217;s comments as being negative about her and intended to wind up CS. I have listened to a very poor quality recording of this conversation between CS and ES and I have had the benefit of reading a transcript of it. I fail to understand how the mother could have interpreted ES&#8217;s comments as she did. What I heard and read was a young man trying to calm down his desperately upset younger half sister.</p>

She alleged that when DS returned from his father&#8217;s care he would have headaches or feel dizzy or be comatose and sleep for considerable periods of time. In February last year rather than discussing her concerns with the father, she subjected DS to hair strand testing which was undertaken by the family&#8217;s general practitioner. This was done without any reference to the father. The substances tested for included illicit drugs (eg cocaine, heroin and cannabis etc.). The test results were negative.</p>

I am not persuaded that there are cogent grounds for me to make this serious order. Instead, I will order that any future applications made in respect of CS or of DS are listed before me and that any application made by the mother should be listed before me without notice to the father in the first instance.</span></p>
