The threshold is not high, but is higher than &#8216;serious issue to be tried&#8217; or &#8216;good arguable case&#8217; found in other contexts.  It is perhaps best expressed by saying that in this context &#8216;substantial&#8217; means &#8216;solid&#8217;.&#8221;</span></p>

I say &#8220;seemingly contradictory&#8221; because in the first sentence which I have quoted it is obvious that Lord&#160;Collins intends that the bar established by the filter mechanism to be set very low to filter out the cases that he describes as wholly unmeritorious.  In the next sentence however, and in seeming contradiction, he states that whilst the threshold is not high it is higher than the familiar tests used in judicial review proceedings or in appellate proceedings, namely a serious issue to be tried or a good arguable case.  This seems to me to suggest that a case that is just a good arguable case would nonetheless not meet the threshold, but by the same token it is difficult to see how a case that is a good arguable case would be anything other than meritorious.</span></p>

In </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">CG v IF</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> I suggested at para.8 that there was, in fact, in terms of linguistics little to choose between the concept of substance and solidity and went on to suggest that a case would not pass the threshold of either substance or solidity unless the court could confidently state that there was, on the available evidence, a better than evens chance that the applicant would ultimately succeed in obtaining a substantive order.</span></p>

In my opinion it is very difficult to say that a case that has a less than evens chance of success is either substantial or solid; indeed, I would go on to say that a case that has a less than evens chance of success is, in terms of applying elementary logic, both insubstantial and tenuous.  However it is plain that the phrases here (and this is probably a defect in my understanding for not appreciating it) are, in fact, terms of art; that &#8220;substantial&#8221; does not, in fact, mean substantial; and &#8220;solid&#8221; does not, in fact, mean solid.  </span></p>

In the first place, a &#8216;substantial&#8217; or &#8216;solid&#8217; case, contrasted with a case which is &#8216;wholly unmeritorious&#8217;, is not a case requiring a 50% chance of success, and with all respect to Mostyn J's view Lord Collins said nothing to suggest it is.  The second point is that the kind of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">inter partes</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> hearing apparently contemplated by Mostyn J is simply outside the scope of what Lord&#160;Collins had in mind.

During their marriage the parties lived predominantly in Saudi Arabia although they had properties in France and in London.
