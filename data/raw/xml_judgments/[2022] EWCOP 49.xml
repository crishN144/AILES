The hearing bundle contains in particular statements by R&#8217;s parents, F and M, both dated 25 August 2021.  I have read a position statement on behalf of the Applicant, dated 27&#160;July; and two position statements on behalf of R himself, who is represented by the Official Solicitor acting as litigation friend, those position statements being dated 27 July and 1 August.  I have also had the considerable benefit of submissions by counsel for the Applicant and for R, for which I am very grateful.</span></p>

Therefore, of the total of &#163;60,293.48 per year of state benefits which he receives, some &#163;52,381.60 is means tested. </span></p>

Moreover the Applicant has put his own money on the line by offering an indemnity in respect of any tax disadvantage; and any limits of the effectiveness of that indemnity are not significant because the situation of the trust would not be likely to last long.

It is not an idea which is positively advocated by the OS as being in R&#8217;s best interests. Rather it is a suggestion of a better mechanism for achieving the Applicant&#8217;s goal if that is what the Court is minded to do.  It is a fairly technical approach, depending on <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/32/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 32(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trustee Act 1925</ref>, which provides that:</span></p>

On the contrary, it is clear to me, on the Applicant&#8217;s own account, that T was informed about the possibility of a trust, and nonetheless in his will gave R the inheritance by absolute entitlement.  I accept that there is nothing in the documents provided from the will file which indicates that T&#8217;s advisors expressly raised with him the possibility of a trust.  However, I do not accept that anything in those documents demonstrates any concern on the part of T, with the protection of eligibility of benefits.  Rather he was quite happy with the prospect that management of any bequest would be by R&#8217;s parents as deputies (although I note that that was incorrect at the time as the deputyship appointment postdates the will file.) I am not satisfied that T&#8217;s intention was in fact to benefit R by preservation of benefits.  (I note in passing that another third of the residue goes to a publicly funded hospital.)</span></p>

I am concerned that the proposed trust, as formulated for this application, has no or insufficient mechanism to ensure that sums would actually be applied for R, as opposed, for example, to accruing for ultimate beneficiaries.  Insofar as the Applicant was asked to agree to a professional trustee which might mitigate that concern, I think he did agree, but reluctantly, pointing out, to use his words, &#8220;the insertion of a stranger charging fees&#8221; is really to be outweighed by what he claims as &#8220;a track record.&#8221;</span></p>

Frankly, I cannot see how any other interpretation can be sustained.  The Applicant&#8217;s own statement and position statement use words of causation to link the application with the effect of preserving benefits (for example, &#8220;as a result&#8221; at paragraph six of the position statement.)</span></p>

In my judgment, there is significant risk that this proposal will not be effective in its own terms.  Such possibility as exists that it could be effective is not sufficient to outweigh the other disadvantages of the proposal, as compared to absolute entitlement and management under the general usual rules of deputyship.  </span></p>
