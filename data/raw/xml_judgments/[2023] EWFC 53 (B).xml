During the court of that hearing I heard evidence from Dr X. I had cause to raise a number of queries in the course of that expert&#8217;s evidence, which are set out in my first judgment (</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt;color:#212121">M v F &amp; Anor</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt;color:#000000"> [2022] EWFC 186)</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">. In large measure I accepted that expert evidence and found it helpful. However, Dr X took exception to the contents of my judgment (having been sent a draft of it) and to the suggestion that it should be published with their name included, as would be commonplace when a judgment is published in the Family Court.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">There were two limbs to the safety risk that Dr X raised. Firstly, it was suggested that &#8216;any mention of honour abuse, including forced marriage, should be considered highly culturally sensitive and with the potential to lead to a hostile response from family members and the community more generally&#8217;. Dr X accepted that work in this field already puts an expert at some risk, but argued that publication of a judgment identifying such expert presents unnecessary additional risk. Secondly, it was suggested, there was a more general issue for psychologists working as expert witnesses in the family courts, who (it was said) are regularly subjected to harassment and vilification, based on the false belief among the general public that academic psychologists and/or chartered psychologists are not qualified to act as expert witness in the family courts. Dr X attributed these &#8216;false beliefs&#8217; to certain unnamed investigative reporters covering the issue of parental alienation. Although of course this was not a field in which Dr X had professed any expertise and it was not the subject of their report, it was said that this recent (social) media attention &#8216;has &#8230; led to misunderstanding among the general public who&#8230; increasingly perceive psychologists to be acting against the interest of the families. The result is a toxic environment in which many legitimate expert witnesses are being publicly attacked, harassed and vilified&#8217;.</span></p>

Rather than it being the &#8216;gross waste of the court&#8217;s time&#8217; that Dr X suggests it was, I considered it part of the judicial function to be satisfied of both the expertise and the match of that expertise to the questions before relying upon expert evidence, and was therefore left in the uncomfortable position of having to ask a number of questions myself. The need to consider such matters is of particular current importance given (as identified by Dr X raised themselves), as regards public concern (sometimes misplaced) as to the credentials of experts the family court relies upon. These questions were prolonged because of the difficulty I had in obtaining clear responses, particularly around the nuanced point Dr X made as to the use of the term &#8216;forensic psychology&#8217; as a specialist academic area rather than a practitioner title requiring registration with the HCPC. The tone of Dr X&#8217;s criticism of the process adopted by the court is all the more baffling given that I concluded - and stated explicitly - that Dr X did have suitable expertise, that their evidence was helpful and I relied upon it.</span></p>

I was attempting to understand the boundaries of the evidence of the expert before placing reliance upon it &#8211; after all it was contended by one party that there was an unacceptable risk of really serious harm if I were to permit the child to move as requested. Dr X made recommendations for living arrangements that depended upon their assessment of the comparative risks. I simply asked Dr X if they were able to quantify that risk, for example in terms of high, medium or low. Dr X readily obliged and gave some broad indications. I have recorded in my judgment that Dr X subsequently told me that &#8216;Risk assessment is not possible, essentially.&#8217; It was this that made me question whether I should then rely upon what they had told me about &#8216;low&#8217; risk. Dr X then told me that they were &#8216;confident&#8217; and there was enough information to make an assessment. What Dr X describes as &#8216;coercive&#8217; and &#8216;passive aggressive&#8217; etc was no more than an essential exploration of their evidence. Any expert who expects their evidence to be relied upon by Family Court judges when making decisions which might place children and adults at risk of harm should expect - and should be able and willing to engage in - respectful exploratory or clarifying questions from advocates and judges. It would have been better and more comfortable had those questions come from the advocates, but I reject the criticisms made of the approach taken by me. Dr X may not have been expecting such questions, but they were not improper and were asked in the spirit of respectful exploration.</span></p>

It is in my view quite an extraordinarily defensive response to a judgment which contained legitimate but limited criticism of an expert, and it materially misrepresents what that judgment says and implies.

PD25B was appended, but regrettably it was not read.

Had PD25B been fully absorbed by Dr X I dare say their report might have been approached somewhat differently, but that does not take away from the fact I relied upon the expertise and advice of Dr X on the main issues.

It is of course quite acceptable for an expert to correct an error or misreport of an expert&#8217;s evidence in a judgment, but the criticism Dr X levelled went far beyond a respectful correction and trespassed into telling the judge that their conclusions were wrong, and doing so in a way which failed to appreciate the limits of the expert&#8217;s role in proceedings. &#8216;Experts advise, courts decide&#8217;, as the mantra goes.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I have had to consider whether the contents of Dr X&#8217;s post-hearing communications in themselves tip the balance so as to justify their identification. They certainly add weight to the Article 10 side of the equation. However, as Dr X themself points out, the greater the criticism the greater the likely vilification, so it cuts both ways. Whilst it is no part of the function of the family court to protect experts from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">justified</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> criticism (or indeed to use publication as a means of punishment), where that criticism is likely to intersect with pre-existing risks to their safety arising from the sensitive and controversial (in some communities) nature of the work undertaken, the position may in my view be rather different. There is a clear tension in this case between the demands of &#8216;transparency&#8217; i.e. the need for the public to know who is discussed in these two judgments (for example so that they can make informed decisions as to who to instruct in other cases, so they can be satisfied that the rules of the family court are rigorously applied, so they can form their own view as to whether I have been entirely fair), and the need to ensure that a professional is not harassed or placed at unacceptable risk as a result of doing their job (which may on occasion include getting things wrong, as we all do). </span></p>

That is regrettable. It is never the court&#8217;s intention (or my own) to cause unnecessary stress or upset for witnesses or professionals, but the court process does depend on a degree of probing, and judges often have to express views that someone disagrees with. Providing Dr X ensures that they are up to speed with and comply fully with the requirements of PD25B in future, providing they read with care the letter of instruction, and providing they work constructively with the court and parties, respecting the distinct roles of the expert and judge, I am sure Dr X will continue to make a valuable contribution as an expert within their field in future cases. There are some cases where conduct is so egregious or criticism so trenchant that it is essential to name the person talked about for the protection of others. This case is not in that category. Those involved with the instruction of an expert in this field or any other should scrutinise the CV with care, should ask questions about credentials before instruction, and should ensure compliance with PD25B at all stages. That detailed framework is the primary route through which parties can ensure they have the right expert for the job, and through which they are protected.</span></p>

I cannot sweep this criticism under the carpet and I must be careful not to be dissuaded from a course of action that I would otherwise consider appropriate because of squeamishness about the need to incorporate Dr X&#8217;s strongly worded criticism of my actions into any reasoned judgment.</span></p>

Firstly, because I have not been asked to do so (no recusal application has been made), secondly because in my view there is no need to do so given that the criticisms made are based upon wholesale misinterpretation of my judgment and inferred criticism. There is neither bias nor appearance of bias (if there were no judge would ever be able to decide on the publication of their own judgment which contained criticism of an expert or party). Thirdly, because how could another judge deal with the 8 pages of criticisms made?</span></p>

I have concluded that anonymity will not materially or at any rate will not disproportionately interfere with the court&#8217;s responsibility to work openly in accordance with the open justice principle. The workings of the court, it&#8217;s rationale and conclusions will all be made clear, the granular detail of the facts and process laid out. The aspects of the case which have exercised the court and Dr X in different ways are fully articulated and insofar as there are learning points for the court, for Dr X or for lawyers and experts more generally they are there to be seen. I have decided therefore, that in order to balance the competing demands of this case, I should publish both judgments and that I should anonymise the expert. </span></p>
