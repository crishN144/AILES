X was born in 2012 and, until her removal to this country, had always lived in Spain. Like her mother, she is a Spanish citizen. After separation, X lived with M but had frequent (if irregular) contact, including staying contact, with F.  On the evidence before me, there is no real sense of insurmountable parental conflict after separation and, to their credit, the parties reached an agreement, with the assistance of lawyers, which was incorporated into a written document on 20 March 2018. Although M informed the Family Court Adviser that she had entered into the agreement &#8220;reluctantly&#8221;, that did not appear in her written evidence, she had legal advice and the plain fact is that it was entered into. By the accord, X was to live with M and spend time with F on alternate weekends, one day during the week, part of the holidays and important festivals. They applied to the court for an order in the agreed terms. </span></p>

So it came as a considerable surprise to him, and no doubt great dismay as well, to attend for contact in late September 2018 only to find that neither M nor X were either living at home in Barcelona or, in X&#8217;s case, attending her school.  There was no warning of any of this. The letting agent for M&#8217;s property told him that M had gone abroad. The parties, for the purpose of this hearing, agree that F became aware on or about 28 September 2018 that M had left the jurisdiction, although at that stage he did not know to where. </span></p>

On 3 October 2018, the parties&#8217; March 2018 agreement was made into a formal court order; it appears to have been a rubber stamp exercise, the process having been initiated well before M&#8217;s departure from Spain. On 6 October 2018, relying in part on the order just made, F made a complaint to the Spanish police.  On 21 October 2018 he applied to the Spanish court for enforcement of the order of 3 October, an application which has been stayed.  He was not at this time told by his lawyers about the availability of the Hague Convention procedure and I am prepared to accept his evidence on this; it would be surprising if he knew of the Convention but chose not to pursue it, yet at the same time was pursuing other remedies. </span></p>

It appears that was the first time F became aware that M and X were probably living in the UK. Thereafter, some intermittent contact between F and X by telephone and social media took place. It is no great surprise that each accuses the other of behaving inappropriately during these interactions; the abduction of a child regularly leads to the heights of tension. Despite F&#8217;s assumptions about the whereabouts of X, M did not herself confirm the position and no address was given.  F was able to produce in this hearing transcripts of telephone recordings in which M told him that there was nothing he could do and he would not find her. M complains that the full context of these recordings (obtained without her knowledge) was not available to me but the clear impression is that M concealed her tracks to avoid being traced by F.

X was at the time 6 years old.  She had lived all her life in Spain and was in full time education.  She was and still is a Spanish citizen.  Her first language is Spanish.  Her extended families on both sides live principally in Spain. It is logical, in my view, that to become settled in a new country may be more difficult for a 6-year old than it would be for, say, an 18-month-old at the time of removal, as was the case in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">RS v KS [2009] EWHC 14. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Further, after her parents separated in</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">2015</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">X&#8217;s life appears to have followed a reasonably stable pattern whereby she lived with M and spent significant amounts of agreed time with F.  It is interesting to note that when speaking to the Family Court Adviser she did not recall her parents being angry with each other which, if correct, suggests that her own family emotions were reasonably warm and secure.  At the time of her departure there was in place a carefully put together written agreement governing welfare matters, principal among which was the division of time between the parents, an agreement which the parties knew would </span></p>

There was no precipitating event, such as an incident of domestic violence. She did not tell him where she was going.  He simply turned up to collect X for contact only to find her not at home.  Thereafter M made no meaningful attempt to tell F where she and X were, leaving it to him to attempt to discover which country they were in via Facebook.  At no time did M inform F of X&#8217;s address or school.  She sought to ensure that F could not track them down. Nor did she take any active steps to promote direct contact.

He initially instructed solicitors with no expertise in child abduction. By July 2019 he had applied to the Spanish Central Authority (2 months or so before the expiry of the 12-month period) and it was for internal administrative reasons, rather than his own shortcomings, that it took until 8 January 2020 for the application to be issued in this jurisdiction.  </span></p>

Although X knew both M&#8217;s partner and other members of his family living there, she shared a room with M and her partner and must have found this disruptive and unsettling. In my judgment it was only when she started her current school (having not been in education for the previous 3 months) and moved with M to her current accommodation that X began to experience a degree of stability.  These events can be measured in days (accommodation) or weeks (education), insufficient on the facts of this case to establish any permanence enabling me to conclude that she was &#8220;settled&#8221; in her new environment by 8 January 2020. </span></p>

As the Family Court Adviser put it, her views about her father were &#8220;ambivalent and conflicting&#8221;. It is also, in my judgment, of some relevance that X is reported as sometimes being worried when in bed at night.  I must be careful not to over emphasise the significance of this, but it does raise questions about how securely X is anchored into her current life. I take the view that the impact on X of not having reestablished proper relations with F and his family, which had been in place before removal, militates against the emotional and psychological stability envisaged within the meaning of &#8220;settlement&#8221;.  It is not in every case that absence of contact will have a material impact on the constituent elements of settlement, but this, in my judgment, is such a case. </span></p>

She thought that her report was probably about 60-70% of where she would have liked it to be if she had had the chance of observing X going to school and then settling back into home life at the end of the school day.  Inevitably, she could only rely on what she was told.  I thought she was very fair and sensitive in her approach, and in acknowledging the deficiencies imposed upon her by current circumstances.  She also told me that she felt the case was very finely balanced.  She found it difficult to get a proper pattern and to assess the whole picture.  In the end she tilted only marginally in favour of a finding that X is settled. I also bear in mind that she had based her settlement conclusion principally up to June 2020 (the hearing date) whereas the legal test takes the operative date as at January 2020. Plainly, the longer the period in play, the more likely settlement will be established.  She accepted that in the end it is a decision for the court, based on legal principles.   </span></p>

Her preference is to live in England rather than in Spain.  I do not take that to be an objection to a return to Spain within the Convention meaning. Unsurprisingly the Family Court Adviser remarked that the context surrounding her views about a return to Spain was unclear to X.  The legal test on settlement, the complexities of the nature of a return to Spain, the welfare exercise undertaken in either this jurisdiction or in Spain; all these are matters beyond a child not yet 8 years old (by contrast, the child in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">SP v EB and KP [2014] EWHC 3964</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> on which M relies was 14 &#189; years old and had well justified reasons for objecting to a return order).  It is obvious from the Family Court Adviser&#8217;s evidence that the real import of X&#8217;s views is an entirely natural wish to be with her mother.  It is not, in my judgment, specifically an objection to returning to Spain.  In my judgment her this defence must also fail and in closing submissions it was sensibly abandoned by M&#8217;s counsel. </span></p>

As is clear from the earlier discussion, the Convention was the product of prolonged discussions in which some careful balances were struck and fine distinctions drawn. The underlying purpose is to protect the interests of children by securing the swift return of those who have been wrongfully removed or retained. The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously. The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary. But the further away one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general Convention considerations must be.  </span></p>

It was not the policy of the Convention that children should be put at serious risk of harm or placed in intolerable situations. In consent or acquiescence cases, on the other hand, general considerations of comity and confidence, particular considerations relating to the speed of legal proceedings and approach to relocation in the home country, and individual considerations relating to the particular child might point to a speedy return so that her future can be decided in her home country.  </span></p>

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.  47.

It cannot any longer be assumed that that country is the better forum for the resolution of the parental dispute. So the policy of the Convention would not necessarily point towards a return in such cases, quite apart from the comparative strength of the countervailing factors, which may well, as here, include the child's objections as well as her integration in her new community.&#8221; </span></p>

She should not be permitted to deploy subterfuge to further her own ends, relying on a settlement defence which is generated in part by behaviour designed to thwart F. And although F might have pursued his legal remedies with greater urgency, in my judgment he did not sit on his hands and do nothing; he was hampered by a combination of inadequate advice, M&#8217;s concealment of whereabouts from him and cumbersome procedure in Spain. I accept that the further away one gets from a speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty the Convention objectives are but in the individual circumstances of this case, the balancing exercise comes down clearly in favour of a return. </span></p>

The child was much older and had clearly expressed autonomous wishes to which Mostyn J attached considerable weight. The father had taken no steps to secure a return for a lengthy period of time whereas here F did take steps and was hampered by (a) lack of knowledge of the Hague Convention and (b) M&#8217;s concealment of her whereabouts.  I have decided that the defences are not made out, and this decision is both in accordance with the Convention and a proportionate approach to the rights of the parties, in particular the child. Article 20 does not change the result. It follows that this defence, too, fails. </span></p>
