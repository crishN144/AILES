When X Group was incorporated, the shares were split equally into three, with each of the husband, J and K having been allocated one share.   It is now asserted by the husband, J and K that it was never intended that the husband be gifted these shares and they assert that the husband must pay them for the value of his one third, which they assert to be &#163;826,391.

I agree with this submission and no issue is taken with it on behalf of J and K.  Accordingly, I have treated J and K as the claimants. The burden of proof therefore falls upon J and K. The burden of proof is the normal civil standard, namely the balance of probabilities.  In essence, the wife asserts that the husband and his parents have closed ranks and have pretended to fall out with their son in order to prevent the release of any funds from Y and in order to defeat the wife&#8217;s financial remedy claims.  She says that the timing of this is remarkable, that just as she makes a financial remedy claim against the husband, suddenly the husband is no longer the owner of these valuable assets and instead owes his parents the sum of &#163;1.853m set out above. She asserts that the whole thing is a sham to defeat her claims against the husband. </span></p>

It seemed to me that this was classically appropriate for a preliminary hearing.  Plainly the husband&#8217;s parents have no part to play in the financial remedy claims between husband and the wife, but of course they have the right to come to court to assert that the wife is mistaken or, worse, greedy and misguided, to try to bring a claim against assets which do not belong to the husband but to them.  Moreover, of course, if I find in favour of the wife, I shall need to make orders that will directly impact J and K since I would be likely to be making orders regarding assets which they say belong to them.</span></p>

Without doing anything more, for the moment at least, than assert some well understood principles, the wife will obviously be likely to run a sharing claim in respect of the marital acquest, by which I mean the acquisition and growth of capital during the course of the marriage.  Doubtless some of the growth in Y since its incorporation at nil value in 2004 will have pre-dated the marriage, but much of the growth is likely to have taken place since the parties married.  I would expect that those acting for the husband will seek to persuade me that much of that growth was passive, rather than as a result of something done by the husband that would make it more likely to form part of the marital acquest.  These are arguments that I expect will form part of the next hearing when I am asked to assess the wife&#8217;s financial remedy claims.</span></p>

Nevertheless, the parties and their two children had continued to live with husband and his parents at the FMH. It is a substantial five-bedroom property.  The children have become tragically caught up in the battle that rages between their parents and between their parents and K and J.  At an early directions hearing, I was told about deeply offensive remarks which the children were said to have made to their mother.  When I saw what had been said, and written, it seemed to me that the kind of deeply offensive language that they had used was adult in nature, although I must stress that this was a view and not a finding.  At that point the children were effectively estranged from their mother and living with their father. </span></p>

So significant were the findings that the Judge made at that hearing that she ordered that the children should move immediately from the father to the mother.  Furthermore, the Judge&#8217;s order prevented the children from having any contact at all with the father and with J and K for at least 12 weeks after her Judgment, with the matter to be reviewed thereafter.  The Judge was so concerned about the way that these children had been treated and the way that they were suffering, that the husband was required to engage in family therapy with the wife and the children as a pre-condition to any ongoing contact.  I am told, and accept, that J and K have not themselves engaged with any family therapy, although I am told that they would very much like to see their grandchildren.   This is plainly a very tragic situation for all.  This family is surrounded by wealth yet is tragically fractured.  I am told that the husband is engaging in the therapy required by the Judge and it must be hoped that, in due course, the husband will be able to have a warm and loving relationship with his children.  The failure of J and K to engage in therapy which would help them to persuade Judge Renvoize that they should re commence contact with their grandchildren is somewhat telling and I can only express the hope that, in due course, they will choose to put the needs of their grandchildren, whom I am sure they love, before their own hurt feelings.  However, I have come to the very clear view during the course of the hearing before me that J is a man who is very much motivated by money.  He has chosen to deprive himself of that wonderful relationship of grandparent and grandchild and, even worse, to deprive his grandchildren of that relationship.</span></p>

I can well understand why the wife asserts this.  However, as I said in court, and repeat now, whilst the Judge&#8217;s findings in the Children Act proceedings are an essential piece of the sad history of this case, I have to analyse this case on the basis of the evidence which is before me. But I am satisfied, having read and heard all that I have, that it would be wrong for me to ignore the fact that an experienced Judge has found that the children&#8217;s paternal grandparents were prepared to close ranks with the father against the best interests of their own grandchildren. Very often in these cases, Judges look to grandparents for some &#8220;common sense&#8221; and as a useful bridge between the parties to move forwards in the interests of the relevant children.  Here, the Judge found that the paternal grandparents had consciously and knowingly acted in a way which was detrimental to the best interests of their own grandchildren.  From all that I have read and heard, I think it likely that J has required this of K.</span></p>

Regrettably, because the time estimate for this case was inadequate, there has been significant delay in producing this Judgment. Doubtless the costs will have increased since the figures referred to above were given to me. Not for the first time, I find myself overseeing a &#8220;big money case&#8221;, saddened by the fact that, instead of using their wealth to enable them to negotiate a practical and decent settlement, the parties have chosen instead to spend what is, to most right minded people, a fortune on legal fees. I am told that the total costs bill, including the s8 proceedings, is close to &#163;4m, which is a staggering amount of money.  My comments are not in any way a criticism of the lawyers involved. The parties are, of course, entitled to spend their money however they wish, but it would be so much more sensible if litigants such as this could use their significant resources to accommodate a sensible compromise rather than to fight with the finest legal teams available in this field of work in England and Wales.  After all, the children, who are the first consideration of this court pursuant to section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, are the children of both the husband and the wife and the grandchildren of the husband&#8217;s parents. I venture to suggest that if more thought had been given to the children and less to self-interest, the parties would have arrived at a sensible accommodation and invited court to make an order by consent. It is, in my judgement, a tragedy for children to find themselves in a family gripped with such bitter dislike and bitter determination to win at all costs. The definition of win from the children&#8217;s perspective is, I suggest, entirely different from the definition of win that is assumed by the parties.  The notes and letters that were sent by these young children to their mother are some of the most abusive that I have ever seen from children of this age to a parent, and yet materially these children want for nothing.  I express the earnest hope that the adults responsible will end messages like these and that they will reflect on the damage that they have caused.  </span></p>

It is very difficult to understand why it was that the legal ownership of X Group was properly reflected by its shareholding whereas, according to J, K and the husband, the shareholding in Y did not represent the beneficial ownership. It is clear that J is a careful and sophisticated businessman and, I am afraid I have to say, that I find it hard to reconcile why the shares in Y would have been put into the husband&#8217;s sole name if that did not reflect the beneficial ownership.  Why do it this way?  Mr Machell&#8217;s answer that &#8220;family relations, particularly when they include small businesses, are often not neat and tidy or documented&#8221;.  That answer cannot, in my judgement, withstand analysis. We are not dealing here with a company purchased &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; by unsophisticated people.

Why would the husband be any more likely &#8220;to grab the business with both hands and really take pride in it&#8221; just because the shares were registered in his name if there was, as J asserts, an agreement that the husband would, in reality, hold two thirds of the shares in the company for his parents.  It is an assertion which I find very hard to accept. Whether J is deliberately lying to this court or has been able to convince himself of the truth of something because he has re-written history it is not currently necessary for me to conclude.  I am, however, satisfied that J&#8217;s evidence about the alleged agreement that husband would hold Y on trust for himself, J and K in equal shares is something that I am unable to accept.</span></p>

That presented a golden opportunity to bring E into the fold and for him to begin his journey towards taking over the family property business himself. But J did not want to hand over significant equity just yet to the inexperienced, unproven E. So a compromise was reached. The property portfolio would be put in E&#8217;s name so that he would know that he had to take some responsibility and be incentivised to work hard. Like X Group, the portfolio would be put in a limited a company that would acquire the portfolio using a 100% loan-to-value mortgage secured against the entire portfolio. E would feel the challenge and pressure of owning his own company, of being responsible for its assets, its debt and its profit, and would be motivated by the money making opportunity this presented.&#8221;</span></p>

J said in his evidence that he was not much concerned about IHT planning, particularly at his age.  I accept the generality of that evidence but I also remind myself that the incorporation of Y was a scheme created by accountants.  It clear that Y is a company which was created for the husband and that it acquired a portfolio of properties and that, from the outset, the company had no value. But it is a sensible and obvious starting point for me to record that in 2004 Y was a company with a substantial portfolio, but no effective equity, and that this company was legally owned by the husband. This would mean that if the properties increased in value and/or the husband was able to repay the NatWest lending, the equity in the company would belong to its shareholder, i.e. the husband.  It is a simple matter of basic tax rules that such a gain would be free from Inheritance Tax if in the husband&#8217;s name rather than that of his mother and/or father.</span></p>

It was L who had set up the scheme by which the new portfolio was transferred to Y and by which 100% of the Y shares were vested in the sole name of the husband.  It is their evidence that Y was treated as if it was part of X Group and also that it was J who made all the important decisions regarding both X Group and Y.  They say that it was to J that they looked for instructions regarding the company accounts and audit.  It does not surprise me at all that the experienced and successful J wanted to make the decisions regarding both X Group and Y.  It is obvious that he regarded himself as a better businessman than his son and I dare say that this was correct.  J refers in his written and oral evidence to his son&#8217;s inexperience.  It is entirely natural that he would want to help his son to learn how to run a property business. Moreover, I do not see that the fact that J made the decisions about Y derogates from the fact that Y was owned by his son.  It is entirely reasonable that J would want to assist his son and, having seen J give evidence, I doubt very much that he would have found it easy to leave the running of Y to his son, who had infinitely less experience.  I do not see that the issue of instructions and control is inconsistent with ownership being with his son. J is plainly immensely talented in the property world and why should he not wish to help his son&#8217;s company flourish?

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I take the same view in relation to the FMH. The husband was a student when this property was purchased and it is absurd for the court to accept that as an unemployed student, he was being landed by his parents with a debt of almost &#163;1 million. It makes altogether better sense to see this for what it was, which is a perfectly sensible solution which happened to have IHT advantages as well. Mr Machell complains that the wife is unable to advance a positive case in relation to the FMH.  Of course she is, because she did not meet the husband until long after the purchase of the property. Mr Machell asserts that, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the evidential backdrop is entirely consistent with J and K&#8217;s case E has a continuing liability to pay for his one third share in the FMH&#8221;. </span>I disagree. What were the terms of this loan? When was it repayable? Was interest due? Was the deal that, if the husband was &#8220;a bad boy&#8221; (J&#8217;s words), the loan would suddenly become due?</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, I have firmly concluded that J and K have failed to discharge the burden of proof resting upon them and I dismiss their claims. I shall, of course, hear argument in due course about the issue of costs but my preliminary view, which I feel it is only fair to articulate, is that this is a case where costs should follow the event the event is that the wife is the successful party. I believe that it would be wrong for me to start here on the basis of the &#8220;no order principle&#8221; and that the proper starting point is that the unsuccessful party should pay the costs of the successful party. As I have said, this is not my concluded view and I shall hear submissions on the subject in default of agreement.</p>
