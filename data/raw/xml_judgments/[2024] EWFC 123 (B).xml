	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Today I am concerned with H, born in 2015.  Her mother and father are both in court and she currently lives with her father and spends time with her mother.  The school holidays are shared equally and in term time H stays at her mother&#8217;s house every other weekend and sees her on the Thursday in the intervening week and is dropped back to school on a Friday.  This is an application by the mother for a shared care order.  Ideally she would like a week on and a week off, or alternatively an additional weekday overnight.  I also have the guardian&#8217;s application for a section 91(14) order.  I heard this case on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> and 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March and give judgment today, 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2024.</p>

The guardian recommends that a child arrangements order is made for H to live with her father and for H to spend time with her mother, as she is doing, alternate weekends and intervening Thursdays.  She suggests that holidays be shared but she says if I find that H was coached by her mother to make allegations about her father, her time with her mother should be limited to no more than five consecutive days. </p>

She supports F attending Calm Parents, Calm Children.  She  recommends a prohibited steps order in relation to overseas travel for the mother but she does not think one is necessary for the father.  She thinks the father should retain H&#8217;s UK passport and any other travel documents obtained in her name.  She recommends a section 91(14) order for three years to prevent further applications by the mother without the court&#8217;s permission.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father broadly agrees but seeks that section 91(14) order for five years and says that Thursdays should not continue because the mother does not take H swimming as she said she would.  He suggests attaching a penal notice to the order and is concerned that overnight should take place at the grandparents&#8217; house to avoid H needing to share or co-sleep with her stepfather.  He says that holidays should be 70-30 in his favour.</p>

In part, that is important because although the parents were clearly there for all of these previous court hearings, I as the judge was not.  By way of background in 2016 Edmonton County Court made a non-molestation order on application of the mother.  In July 2016 the father applied for a child arrangements order. </p>

Now, here I pause to remind myself that the breach of a non-molestation order is a specified offence, the evidence of which is evidence of domestic abuse for legal aid purposes but that is a separate issue as to whether the court later finds domestic abuse proved as a fact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was a fact-finding hearing in September 2017 by DJ Prevatt sitting in the family court in relation to the mother&#8217;s allegations of domestic abuse against the father.  No findings were made against the father and the court found issues with the mother&#8217;s credibility and inconsistency in the mother&#8217;s evidence.  The judge found the father to be very excitable and the relationship between the parents to be &#8220;volatile&#8221;.  It is not clear to me if she had evidence of the breach of the non-molestation order in front of her.  </p>

No record of this was found in the hospital notes.  A guardian was then appointed for H and the guardian applied for a psychiatric assessment of the mother and that application was granted in October 2019.  The mother applied in July 2019 to discharge the child arrangements order and made an application for a non-molestation order.  The father applied to activate the suspended unpaid work requirement.  The order of DJ Prevatt in 2019 in October seemed to activate that unpaid work order.</p>

This was not initially corroborated by H when she was interviewed by police and social services but she did make an allegation to the nursery on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2020 and then to her social worker.  A section 37 direction was made to the London Borough of Waltham Forest. </p>

H was subject to a child protection plan in February 2020 on the basis of emotional abuse and on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2020 the mother agreed that unsupervised contact could resume at a child protection conference but then it seemed that she objected and removed H from nursery before she was collected by her father.  On 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2020 the section 37 report from Waltham Forest was received and stated the social worker was of the view that H was experiencing significant harm in her mother&#8217;s care and recommended a move to her father&#8217;s care.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">DJ Prevatt had a final hearing in July 2020 and she heard from Dr C who was the instructed psychiatrist who diagnosed the mother with a severe anxiety disorder with post traumatic symptoms and overvalued ideas which resulted in a marked emotional misinterpretation of neutral events by the mother who had strongly held but usually temporary false beliefs.  DJ Prevatt records in her judgment that Dr C confirmed there were three ongoing concerns: (1) in relation to the mother&#8217;s ongoing false allegations of abuse; (2) her marked difficulty in accepting the fact there was no evidence for those allegations; and (3) her acting upon her concerns by preventing contact.  He confirmed that this was an ongoing condition and without treatment there was a risk of further deterioration in the future.  He thought that the mother might benefit from medication but she would be unlikely to accept it but would also benefit from therapy which might result in a marked improvement in the mother&#8217;s ability to contain her anxieties.  He said without this assistance it might take considerably longer to change her views.  He also suggested a reduction in stress would assist the mother.</p>

The judge, however, did accept the expert&#8217;s evidence.  The judge changed H&#8217;s residence and placed her in the care of her father and a spend time with order was made in favour of the mother.  A family assistance order was made to Waltham Forest for a period of twelve months and the judge urged the mother to obtain therapeutic help.  The judge set out in a recital to her order that in the event that further allegations were made, the child should not be moved to her mother&#8217;s care until the outcome of the investigation was known and any investigation should happen quickly.</p>

The father alleges that the mother has coached H to make the allegations against him in the summer of 2023.  Neither party thinks that the court should make findings in relation to whether the father did hit H or whether the mother and her husband did have the arguments that H reported.  The mother maintains that she is a victim of domestic abuse and provided evidence of that breach of the non-molestation order.  She alleges that the father is angry and confrontational with professionals and that this is in front of H and that he behaves this way at times at home.  She says this is reflective of her experience of him.</p>

It has not been successfully appealed and there is no application to re-open it.  She did not find domestic abuse on the balance of probabilities, so in law it has not happened.  I am not going to give a commentary or express a view on the social work practice of Waltham Forest.  Previous judges have clearly addressed this issue with Waltham Forest and the social workers were not put on formal written notice of the intention of the court to look at their conduct and, indeed, it is not necessary for me to express a view on social work practice in order to make decisions justly for H.  Insofar as I address the events of summer 2023 it is through the lens of the parents&#8217; reactions to them and to provide an analysis of the weight that may be put on documents from that period and the issues that I have to resolve.</p>

Mr&#160;Price-Rowlands cited cases in which the courts in the past had made share care orders.  It seems to me that each of these cases turned on their facts and did not create a presumption in law of shared care.

This, said Mr&#160;Price-Rowlands, established that parents are equal in the eyes of the law.  He said that sole residence orders could be misinterpreted and what was needed was cooperation and a shared residence order reflected this.  Having read the case of <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span>, this was a case in which the mother made allegations that the father was a risk to the child which were not substantiated but sought a sole residence order at the final hearing.  By the time of that final hearing the children were spending 50 percent of their time with each parent and the issue at that final hearing was what label to put on the arrangements.

I have had the benefit of the written bundles which have been provided, I have had the notes that I have taken in court which I have been able to refer to when crafting this judgment and I have had the benefit of submissions.  I remind myself that some of the evidence in this bundle is hearsay.  That means that the makers of some of these statements have not been called to come to court and give evidence and be cross-examined on them, so the weakness of this type of evidence is that it has not been tested by cross-examination and the weight to be attached to it is for me to decide.  Specifically, H has not been called and no one has asked for her to come to court.</p>

It may well be that the matter was not re-listed before DJ Prevatt because she sits now some distance away from where they live but I think it would have been better if there had been judicial continuity throughout and I am sorry that I am a new judge for this final hearing but by the time the matter reached me at pre-trial review, any delay in that final hearing would have not been good for H and, indeed, nobody asked me to adjourn matters and send it back to DJ Prevatt.  I am sorry too that it took us so long to get hold of DJ Prevatt&#8217;s original judgment.

She also struck me as balanced in her assessment of the father by saying he was a good parent.  She spoke of him being strict but she did not try and badmouth him.  She does not seek a finding that he hit H.

His evidence was suffused with a sense of injustice for the time he had not seen his daughter and the experience he had at the hands of Waltham Forest which was a theme that he returned to.  He was critical of the mother and repeatedly said she did not meet H&#8217;s needs in the time she already had and he did not trust her to return H after longer periods of time in her care.</p>

For example, he often used the words &#8220;never&#8221; and &#8220;always&#8221;.  For example, &#8220;The mother <span style="font-style:italic">never</span> takes her to any places.  I attend<span style="font-style:italic"> all</span> events&#8221;, and another example is Waltham Forest are &#8220;against him&#8221;.  Another example of this was that he said he <span style="font-style:italic">never</span> raised his voice to his daughter, which seems slightly unlikely to me.  Parenting is a really hard job and it would be surprising if a parent never raised their voice at times over the many hard years of raising a child.</p>

If the court ordered something, he made sure it happened and he understood exactly why it was wrong to breach the non-molestation order, for example, and he has not breached a court order since.</p>

Her father came to court in order to be able to see her and there was a gap of six months, I think, when he did not see her at all.  She was then reintroduced to her father and the court moved her to live with her father and on several occasions the court order has been breached meaning she has not seen her father when she should have done and so her early life has been hedged around by uncertainty and change and it is very important that she is now able to enjoy her childhood and have stability and predictability.</p>

DJ Prevatt analysed this in her 2020 judgment and looked at the risk of harm to H before she ordered that she go to live with her father.  She says: </p>

Although the mother now says she would encourage contact with the father, she has been given numerous opportunities over the last four years to show she can support contact and has failed to do so.  She has continued to make allegations against the father, none of which have been substantiated and I agree that once these proceedings are over, in the absence of any treatment as recommended by Dr C she will be likely to do so again.  It has been clear to me that she continues to feel that the father is a threat to [H] and she has misinterpreted events against him.  I accept the mother loves [H] and I also accept this decision is likely to cause the mother and [H] considerable distress in the short term but this is outweighed by the long term damage which would be caused to [H] if she remained in her mother&#8217;s care.&#8221;</p>

It is clear that Dr&#160;B did not have Dr C&#8217;s report until that final letter that he wrote.  Although to be completely even-handed, I would also note that Dr C did not have the documentation when he wrote his first report, so it is always difficult to make sure that everyone has everything but the evidence suggests that these treating clinicians had not seen what the court had said and acted in large part on the mother&#8217;s report and history and what is interesting is they do not point to those entries in her medical notes highlighted by Dr C in his report that suggests a degree of anxiety that predates H&#8217;s birth.</p>

The court clearly made a determination as to the diagnosis that Dr C on balance thought most apposite in paragraph 34 of DJ Prevatt&#8217;s judgment and no one has appealed that and I cannot go behind it and I have not heard evidence from Dr C or any of the treating clinicians but the position of a treating clinician is different to the position of an expert who is there to assist the court.  The treating clinician has no duty to the court, only a duty to their patient and the mother said she went to the GP and told them what had been said in court and they said she did not require medication and, of course, these treating clinicians are not bound by the views of the court or by Dr C.  They must exercise their own professional judgment.  </p>

She attributes any harm suffered by [H] to [F] and regards the change of [H]&#8217;s residence to his care as unjustified.  She does not accept the findings of fact and persists in her belief that [F] is an unsafe person and parent and she reports that she is afraid of him.  Ms&#160;[M]&#8217;s lack of acceptance of previous concerns means there is a risk she will make further attempts to reduce or marginalise [F]&#8217;s role in H&#8217;s life if she spends increased time with [H].  She is unable to offer any positive feedback about his parenting and I lack confidence about her ability to make an order for shared care work effectively from this position.  It would cause [H] harm if her relationship with her father is undermined or interrupted and, in my assessment, [H] is likely to suffer such harm if she spends increased time with her mother.&#8221;</p>

So for all his mistrust and criticisms of her behaviour, he has made sure that H has always seen her mother and his position for this final hearing is not punitive.  He is not saying there should be supervised contact, so he is able on one level to put his deep distrust of the mother and all that has happened in the past to one side and to make sure that he supports H spending time with her.  </p>

The guardian gave evidence that she visited both homes after Mr&#160;A&#8217;s reports and the father had taken on board what Mr&#160;A had raised.  There were art materials and H was colouring a Wendy house thing and so he had taken on board that observation.  He had heard it, she said, and acted upon it and made sure she had access to age-appropriate toys.  He is able to reflect and learn.</p>

The father has his brother and sister-in-law and the mother, of course, has her husband and her own parents.  These are people who are really important to H.  The guardian, of course, spent time expressly with Mr&#160;J and found him personable and able to speak fondly of H.  However, it was apparent he had given very little thought to the potential complexities and challenges involved in the unique role of the stepparent and I would just observe in passing in all of that period of confusion over the summer of 2023, it is not clear what role, if any, he had in analysing what was going on or, indeed, in supporting adherence to court orders. </p>

H has had so much change in her short life and it is not in her best welfare interests to navigate more.  She is used to this pattern.  It means there is not a long gap in her seeing her mother.  Her attendance at school has improved and so dropping her back to school is no longer, it seems, an issue that is interrupting her learning and there is no recurrent report of illness.  Although it is a relatively short period of improvement during these proceedings, there has been increased stability for H and H expressed to the guardian she did not want the pattern to change, she did not want to go back to her father on Sundays.</p>

It, in my view, would be better for H to have swimming on another day so she can go every week and build up her confidence in the water more quickly, or even do an intensive week course during the holidays to get her safe in the water.  Swimming is clearly a life skill and no doubt her parents want her to learn to swim so that she can be safe but I would ask the father to consider if he might find a weekly class on a different day when he can take her, or even invest in intensive summer or Easter courses to help H progress more quickly.  </p>

I do not put a cap on the number of days that H spends with her mother consecutively but it seems to me that long periods out of either parents&#8217; care may be difficult for H because she has no line of communication with the other parent during this time.  Maybe over time this will change and when she is older no doubt she will have her own phone or tech to communicate with the other parent as she wishes but it seems to me that the parents have actually managed to divide the holidays reasonable well bar the summer 2023 retention and so I do not think any more prescriptive order is needed to enable them to share the holidays as they have been doing.</p>

Lord Justice Ryder emphasised that a prohibited steps order is a statutory restriction on the parent&#8217;s exercise of their parental responsibility for a child and can have profound consequences.  It is not reflective of any power in one parent to restrict the other, that power does not exist.  It is a court order that must be based on objective evidence.  It can only be relaxed by the court, not by agreement between the parties and, accordingly, there is a high level of responsibility of the court not to impose such a restriction without good cause and a reason must be given.  Furthermore, where a prohibited steps order is appropriate, consideration should be given to the duration of the prohibition and the nature of the order, finite nature of the order must be expressed on the face of the order.</p>

It is a criminal offence, of course, to take a child out of the UK without the consent of everyone with parental responsibility.  So, in effect, the parents are already prohibited from doing so if the other parent disagrees.  Of course, the father now has a lives with order, so he may take H out of the UK for up to 28 days.</p>

If I made a prohibited steps order and the father did not consent to H travelling, it would mean that the mother would need to make an application to the court and that is undesirable because it opens the door to her returning the matter to the court sphere.

So, for example, if H is invited to go on a school trip to Iceland, the father should apply for any Iceland visa.  The mother should not be the one to apply and I will specify that on the face of the order.

In a suitable case and on clear evidence the court may impose the leave restrictions where the welfare of the child requires it even when there is no past history of unreasonable applications.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I remind myself the court cannot attach conditions to an order requiring a party to take a specific step before an application for permission will be successful, that is <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Permission to Seek Relief)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/1190" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 1190" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 1190</ref>, but it is permissible for a judge imposing a section 91(14) order to identify a particular issue and to suggest to the litigant that unless they show that that has been addressed, any further application for permission to apply to the court is unlikely to be successful.  It seems to me that if there are further unmeritorious allegations made, it is unlikely that any permission application would be granted. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Should any further allegations be made by H, I repeat DJ Prevatt&#8217;s view that these should not cause her to be moved to her mother&#8217;s care until the outcome of an investigation is known and that those investigating should read all the judgments in the case, both of those from DJ Prevatt and this judgment today and the guardian&#8217;s final analysis and the order which I make putting all of this into effect.  I would be really grateful if the order could be drafted at court so that the parents know that a line is drawn under matters and counsel do not have to have protracted discussions about exactly what the order should say.  If there is any debate about that, I would be very happy to settle it this afternoon. </p>

Ms&#160;Carpenter I expect you are in a difficult position because you were not here for all the evidence but is there anything I have missed or you wish to draw to my attention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  Your honour, just a few points, if I may?  The section 91(14) obviously does not relate to any application to enforce either.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  No, it is a new child arrangements order application or I think it does apply to variations&#8212;</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  Yes.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  &#8212;but not enforcement.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  Enforcement, I am grateful.  Secondly, in terms of the father has a lives with order so he can take the child out of the jurisdiction for up to 28 days without my client&#8217;s consent.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  That is right.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  Your judgment obviously accords with the law that my client has to seek his consent.  If he does not, then obviously she, the onus is on her to make an application for a specific issue order.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  Well, I have not banned that.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  Yes, exactly.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  But I did observe that [F] would be also able to make a prohibited steps order application if he thought there was a risk of the mother going without seeking the court&#8217;s consent.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  But could I ask just for &#8211; I am not sure if this was addressed.  If the father wants to take the child out of the jurisdiction, he does not need my client&#8217;s consent but just as my client is going to give him two months&#8217; notice, would the court be minded to say obviously he does not need her consent but could he at least provide some advance notice as to what is going on, where the child is going, least of all she will be able to talk to the child or looking forward to a holiday.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  Understood.  I will hear Mr&#160;Langford on that but it seems to be good parenting communication.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  Yes and also not just to provide the information obviously &#8211; sorry, I have lost my train of thought.  Not to provide that information, not just to provide that information in advance but I do not know if that but the travel to be during his time so that there is not a scenario where he is taking the child out of the jurisdiction&#8212;</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  I think that falls into the arrangements for dividing holidays equally because each of them will have a plan for how they want to spend the summer and therefore they will need to tell each other when they are arranging summer division of time what their plans are and if they are planning to travel in the time that they have got.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  One last point, your honour, if I may?  Easter holidays, my&#8212;</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  Which come up very quickly, do they not?</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  Yes.  I understand my client has the child on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.  She would seek to have the child Thursday the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> at 4pm.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  Has this been discussed outside at all?</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  No.  I am just raising it now so that we are going out to draft&#8212;</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  That is fine, so you can go and have a discussion.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS CARPENTER:  And I do not know if my learned friend for the father has details, so she would seek the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> to the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  So I will leave Mr&#160;Langford to take instructions about that.  Mr&#160;Langford, anything from you?</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MR LANGFORD:  No.  I will need to take instructions on both the points that have just been raised.</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">JUDGE SUH:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Ms&#160;Kang, anything from you?</p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">MS KANG:  No, thank you.</p>
