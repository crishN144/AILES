On 6 November 2020 at home he suffered a cardiac arrest.  In the course of it his heart stopped for at least 45 minutes before cardiac rhythm was restored.

Now, over five weeks later, RS remains in a coma in hospital.  It is, therefore, self-evident that he lacks capacity to make a decision for himself.  It is common ground amongst all the medical professionals and accepted by all the family that he at best will never recover beyond a low level minimally conscious state which I shall shorten to &#8220;MCS&#8221;.  He will, therefore, not regain capacity at any time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Against that legal background I turn to the undisputed evidence as to the condition and prognosis of RS.  RS remains in a coma.  He was examined on 5 December 2020 by Dr Bell, Consultant in Intensive Care and Anaesthesia at Leeds General Infirmary.  Dr Bell was instructed by the Official Solicitor and his assessment was carried out by way of a 45 minute video assisted by Dr W to whom I shall return.  Apart from short lived phases of partial eye opening, RS made no spontaneous movement. There was no response when his name was called or to loud hand claps.  When his eyes did open there was no evidence of focusing or tracking and no blink reflex to a visual threat.  There were no characteristic facial features of discomfort or distress during what would to a feeling person be a painful stimulation.  </p>

At the best, says Dr Bell, RS might progress to the lower end of MCS.  The fact that after one month there has been such limited emergence from coma means that there is likely to be very little more by way of recovery.  </p>

Dr Bell was dubious that this state would be reached as his low prognosis indicates.  He said that nothing will restore any level of functionality to RS. </p>

They are part of a spectrum.  So far as life expectancy is concerned, if preserved with his current treatment RS could survive up to five years or more.

Dr Bell referred to the test that he applies to define a &#8220;meaningful quality of life&#8221; at para.4.9 of his report which I shall read.  He says:   </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.95in">&#8220;I define the threshold of a &#8216;meaningful quality of life&#8217; as requiring three elements to be satisfied; namely (1) for the individual to have an awareness of the environment and their own existence or the realistic prospect of regaining such awareness; (2) for that individual to derive pleasure from some aspects of their life to a degree that was not overshadowed by obvious discomfort or distress; and (3) for that person to be able to consistently communicate feelings of pleasure or discomfort in some way&#8221;. </p>

Doctors would not and do not commit patients to a range of intrusive tests when they are making no improvement after such a catastrophic injury.  In this case the nature of the prognosis is such that no further investigations are needed and I accept entirely the evidence of Dr Bell and Dr W to that effect.  The Royal College guidelines are not for those who are still in a coma over a month after the event. </p>
