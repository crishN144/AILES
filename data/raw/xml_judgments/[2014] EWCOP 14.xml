	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">PB has a longstanding diagnosis of psychiatric ill-health.  She has been the subject of social services intervention for some time. Until 2006 she was living with TB in his one bed-roomed flat in a small Norfolk town.  The couple has a long history of travel round the country, and on some occasions presented as homeless.  On a number of occasions in 2006 TB left PB in various places around England from which she had to be rescued.   An adult safeguarding decision was made (by Social Services and her mental health team) that she should be placed at F House.  In May 2006 TB moved in with her but the placement broke down. A further attempt was made to accommodate TB there in June 2008 but he returned to his flat. PB visited him there, although there was increasing concern about exceptionally insanitary conditions.  Both are incontinent. By January 2011 at an after care review it was decided that TB&#8217;s health was becoming increasingly affected by conditions there.  She was asked to stay 6 nights a week at F House but did not comply. </p>

She reported that at the time PB accepted this, and that when taken to F House had no objection.  She expressed a wish to be with her husband, but in Dr Khalifa&#8217;s view was not able to see the risk involved. Catherine Thompson, her social worker, also assessed capacity and best interests. Both independently concluded that PB was unable to use and weigh information relevant to the risks to her heath at TB&#8217;s flat. Ms Thompson found in particular that PB was unable to provide direct answers to questions.  A Standard DOLs Authorisation was granted in April 2011. </p>

The standard authorisation was discharged.  She moved back to live with TB.  The care package included two carers&#8217; visits daily.  This was to assist with PB&#8217;s continence needs because she needs to have her pads changed regularly.  Two carers were required, but TB and PB would not allow more than one daily visit, and they often went out to avoid the carers.  When a visit was made it was apparent that conditions had not improved.  It is not necessary for me to describe them in detail: the premises were clearly disgusting and a health hazard. PB was often in a urine soaked bed. Industrial cleaners had to go in on several occasions.</p>

She was discharged on 10 March to F House.  TB took her on a train trip to Cambridge and abandoned her.  When she was found and returned she had wet and soiled herself but made no attempt to obtain assistance.  On 17 March 2012 she was found on the ground in the market place and taken back to F House by ambulance. The next day TB took her out again and she remained away for three days until TB left her at a bed and breakfast some way away where she was found by the police incontinent in bed.  She went back to F House but TB took her out.  He later telephoned to say that she was on the floor in the market and that he was taking her to London.  The next day he took her to the police station saying that she did not like the care home and that they needed accommodation.  On 2 April they telephoned to say that they were in Norwich but were intending to travel to Devon.  The next day TB telephoned to say that she was on her way to visit her sister in London.  By then she had an untreated urinary tract infection.  On 3 April she stayed in a guest house in Cambridge.  On 4 April she was found in TB&#8217;s flat.  She did not know how and why she had come to be in Cambridge.  She had an Addenbrooke&#8217;s Hospital tag on her wrist but could not explain how it came to be there.  It became apparent that she had been admitted as an emergency.  She agreed that she was &#8220;not really well enough&#8221; to go on these trips.  She said that she did not know whether she would go off with TB again stating, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I would&#8221;.  PB later returned to F House.

She asserted that she was not provided with care at F House.  That was not the case.  She said that she wanted to leave and that her husband would look after her &#8220;beautifully&#8221;.  She would not discuss the physical conditions at the flat.  Ms Masters considered that she lacked capacity since her assessment of the reality of her situation was &#8220;grossly disproportionate&#8221; to her situation.  A further capacity assessment in July 2012 found that PB &#8220;blocked&#8221; any information that impacts on her relationship with her husband and whether it was safe for either of them for her to live with him.  She was &#8220;simply unable to accept the facts,&#8221; and dealt with her history by a mixture of denial, deflection and distraction.  The assessor found herself &#8220;forced&#8221; to conclude that she lacked capacity.  As a result, Norfolk County Council, which had been on the verge of issuing proceedings since 2011, decided to do so.</p>

PB was discovered in TB&#8217;s flat  distressed and miserable, sodden with urine and with her trousers half-way down. (PB disputed this but I heard convincing oral evidence of the social worker&#8217;s direct observation).   TB&#8217;s flat was cold and there was no food or drink.  PB refused to return to F House for respite.</p>

He &#8216;leans&#8217; to the conclusion that she has capacity to make decisions about residence, care and contact in optimal conditions He wavered somewhat as to whether he thought that PB lacked capacity when not with TB, and eventually concluded that he  thought that she might do.  &#8220;I agree that PB lacks capacity in certain situations, for example because of anxiety, mental disorder or influence. I don&#8217;t know if she has capacity in optimal circumstances, but I have not seen sufficient evidence that she lacks capacity then&#8221;.

Furthermore, although they agreed that PB had &#8220;considerable capacity&#8221; when not subject to TB&#8217;s direct influence (adopting Dr Barker&#8217;s phrase, by which he seems to have meant something different) both in her report and the joint statement, she did not mean that PB ever had capacity.  She &#8220;would not separate influence and major psychiatric disorder.&#8221; In any event TB's influence is pervasive. Whenever PB has to consider decisions about living with him or spending time with him she either cannot recall or use and weight the information or is paralysed by anxiety, or both.</p>

He asked her why she had gone off with TB on long journeys and then got stranded, so that sometimes they were brought back by social services, and told her that this did not sound very wise.

She told Dr Barker that she always did what TB wanted because she didn&#8217;t want to lose him, and also that she did not feel able to stand up to TB because he is a very &#8220;forceful personality&#8221;.  When he asked her whether her behaviour was &#8220;reckless&#8221; she responded that she had been &#8220;acquiescent&#8221; and that this was because she had not insisted on carers coming in, and she tried to keep on good terms with him, because she loved him.  &#8220;He&#8217;d do things on impulse, I&#8217;d go along with him&#8221;.</p>

The inherent jurisdiction exists to protect, liberate and enhance personal autonomy, but any orders must be both necessary and proportionate. Miss Burnham submits that what is proposed is protective and necessary and proportionate and is not a coercive restricting regime.  I am inclined to the view that a regime could be imposed on PB if that is the only way in which her interests can be safeguarded.  To be maintained in optimum health, safe, warm, free from physical indignity and cared for is in itself an enhancement of autonomy. In Re L injunctive relief was granted against the parties&#8217; adult son.

All those who practice in the Court of Protection must appreciate that those who represent the vulnerable who cannot give them capacitous instructions have a particular responsibility to ensure that the arguments addressed are proportionate and relevant to the issues, to the actual facts with which they are dealing rather than the theory, and to have regard to the public purse, court resources, and other court users.

I hope it is not churlish to complain that it was created in landscape rather than portrait, that when answered the page references were omitted, and there was no space for the judge&#8217;s comments.  It would have been even more useful if there had been a chronology.  </p>

The experts are not a jury considering whether they can give a unanimous verdict.  There is no duty to &#8220;harmonise&#8221; views if in reality the experts do not agree.

I also note that in The Law Commission lecture given last year Lord Judge stated (as I was taught) that in principle no question should be longer than one line of transcript.  In any event, the judge is interested in the answer, not the question. </p>

But more focus on case management and case progression is essential. </p>
