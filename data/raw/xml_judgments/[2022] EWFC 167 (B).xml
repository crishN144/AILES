	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The complexity of the case is exacerbated by several factors. The ages of the children are significant. W is 7 &#189; years old; he has spent all his life developing and maintaining relationships with his siblings and currently lives with his four year old brother X. X at 4 &#189; is of an age that would commonly be considered as relatively advanced to be made the subject of a placement order and has, himself an ongoing relationship with all his siblings. The ages of Y and Z are perhaps more conducive to placement orders commonly being made although it must be noted that they have, themselves ongoing relationships with their brothers. </span></p>

It is impossible to consider any outcome without having due regard to the sense of loss (which may manifest itself as a bereavement) that the younger siblings will suffer in the event that W suddenly no longer forms a part of their lives and that W would have if permanently separated from his younger siblings, particularly X for whom he has taken a caring role.</span></p>

The facts of this case are remarkably similar to the current case in that HHJ Bellamy also had to grapple with various options for placement of a large sibling group. The judgment emphasises how complex the issues are and the need for the assessments upon the children&#8217;s possible separation to consider all the permutations and the effect the possible outcomes will have on each child. The learned judge concluded that the final hearing in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">ABCDE</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial"> had to be adjourned. In order to conclude the matter fairly, the judge took the view that it was necessary for further psychological evidence to be obtained dealing with the very issues that I have outlined above. In his case His Honour Judge Bellamy had the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">advantage</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial"> that the case had until the point of the final hearing been conducted only just outside of the statutory six month period and he was able to justifiably say that further delay was necessary to conclude the case fairly. The timetable in this case is very different. The local authority issued its application on 10 May 2021 which means that the case is now in its 82</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial"> week. Considering the ages of the children, it would be impossible to justify delay for any further assessment. None of the parties seek such a delay and therefore the case must be decided on the evidence that is available.</span></p>

Throughout 2016 and 2017 there was a high level of involvement by the local authority and involvement of the police arising from incidents of domestic violence between the mother and F2. W became subject to a child in need plan on 8 November 2017, as did X following his birth in January 2018. The plan remained in place until February 2018. W returned to be the subject of child in need planning on 18 March 2018 until 1 October 2018. In October 2018 just one week following the closure of W&#8217; child in need plan the police again became involved as a result of a domestic violence incident which involved drugs. Allegations were made by the mother against F1 in February 2019 and the mother reported to the maternity unit that F1 had kicked her in the back and caused bruising to her arm and elbow when she was seven months pregnant with Y.</span></p>

For example, in December 2020 the mother and F1 reported that they self-referred to CGL in an effort to address drug use. Despite the efforts of the parents the domestic violence and drug use continued. Outside agencies expressed concern. On 11 December 2020 the social worker received information from the nursery reporting concerns that the mother had been seen on a field opposite the nursery and appeared to grab Y in an aggressive manner whereupon she ran from her mother. The nursery staff raised concerns of the mother who was observed to shake hands with a male and appeared to pass the male a small package suggesting that the mother was then involved in either dealing or receiving drugs.</span></p>

As a consequence they may lack the rigour to &#8216;pull apart&#8217; and interrogate assumptions. This suggests that assessments are more often viewed as necessary evidence to support a prior decision to separate siblings, than as open-ended investigations to inform decision making. An inadequate sibling assessment, or the lack of one, was considered by some judges to constitute grounds for delaying proceedings beyond 26 weeks, but there was a perception that judicial attitudes varied considerably. </span></p>

This comprehensive work brings together social science research in the area concerned and highlights the factors to be considered when considering siblings together and apart. Chapter 2 of the guide examines the development and progression of sibling relationships and notes how these develop from the first two years of life onwards. Chapter 9 considers contact between separated siblings. There is emphasis on the importance of having the ability to explain to children the reasoning behind decisions affecting sibling contact. Regarding contact between adopted children and siblings in long-term foster care/with family members Beckett says:</span></p>

Social workers may focus on the possible risks of continuing sibling contact when older siblings remained in foster care and younger ones are placed for adoption. Typically, the older siblings will retain some level of contact with parents. However, continuing contact with parents should not be used as a blanket reason to terminate sibling contact. Ending contact between brothers and sisters involves risks and losses for children and their families, for example, young children may be distressed, resent contact ending and find it very hard to settle or trust their adoptive parents. There is a danger that risks and losses are insufficiently recognised and considered. Contact issues should always be fully explored, allowing for flexibility and openness. Potential risks and gains, benefits and losses should be assessed and carefully balanced. Some risks may be small and manageable. Safeguards and commitment to contact can reduce risks.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> [page 122].</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Over the last couple of years or so, there has been an exponential growth in use of social media. I note the most recent draft bill dealing with children&#8217;s access to social media platforms aims to limit the ability of a child to open an account to 13 years old. I make no comment on the merit or efficacy of this aspiration. I do take judicial notice however that my experience of conducting many children cases is that children much younger than this regularly access social media and have a detailed understanding as to how to make it work for them. The children involved in this case are very young, but W is 7 &#189;. It will not be long before W (if he doesn&#8217;t already) will have access to all sorts of means to contact his siblings. Who knows what methods will be available in a very short period? I do not know of any research in this area, but I do have judicial experience of adoptions breaking down where the child&#8217;s use of social media to make covert contact with birth parents has contributed to the breakdown. In one such case the contact was instigated by a sibling who located the adopted child via social media with disastrous effects. In that case it was the secrecy of the contact that caused the problem rather than the contact itself. I do wonder, therefore, whether in this case the issue of sibling contact is being treated in a blinkered way.</span></p>

Mr Butterworth describes the experiences of F1 which he says will have caused him anxiety and anger. It is stated that F1&#8217;s use of cannabis is described by him as the only way that he could feel normal and that is use has been ongoing for 10 years.

Whilst I&#8217;m sure that the mother&#8217;s indication that she would do whatever it takes to have the children home is sincere and well meant, I have formed the view that the mother does not understand the significance of the failure to provide a safe environment for the children.

In any event the mother&#8217;s history is sufficient for me to find that even if the mother did initially engage voluntarily in therapeutic help this would not be sustained.</span></p>

The police have been involved on two significant occasions. On one occasion the police forced entry into the home of the mother and F1 (where the children would have been living but for their removal) and a search revealed a list of contraband including drugs, drug paraphernalia and offensive weapons including a knuckle duster. I found F1&#8217;s explanation for his possession of these items to be unconvincing. Even if F1&#8217;s explanations that he was forced to hold the drugs for a third party, that the sword was purely an ornament and that the knuckle duster was simply found in a back alley were true, the fact of these items being found in the home, where the children would have lived, demonstrates the parents&#8217; inability to understand the importance of providing a safe home; it raises significant concern over the lifestyle to which the children could be exposed if they were to live with the mother and F1.</span></p>

As stated above this would mean that if W were to be the subject of long-term foster care and his siblings adopted W will have no ongoing direct contact with his adopted siblings and they would have no ongoing direct contact with him. This is expressed to the Court as a commonly held view. There is certainly no restriction (absent an order prohibiting such) against inter-sibling contact where one child is adopted and the other in long term foster care.</span></p>

Foster care would also result in the local authority having an obligation to promote contact between the parents and the children and it would enable the children to maintain contact with each other. This would maintain their sibling relationships the importance of which is spelt out above. Foster placement for the children would result in them receiving all the support that local authority will be obligated to provide now and for the foreseeable future.

I have more confidence in the local authority than the Guardian does, both with regard to the local authority&#8217;s ability to find the placement for all three children and then to support the placement. The advantages to X, Y and Z of being brought up together as a sibling unit, in my judgment, should not be denied the children simply on the basis of concerns that X may adversely affect the placement. It might be that the local authority takes a view further down the line that one of the children should be placed separately from the others be that X, Y or Z. The Court has sufficient confidence in the local authority to enable it to form its judgment and only to make an application for an adoption order when it is satisfied that such a step will serve the welfare of the children.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I turn now to the very difficult area of sibling contact. Looking at the welfare factors I have identified above, I note that the three younger children are not of a sufficient age and understanding to express an informed view as to whether they wish to maintain contact with their siblings. W, though, is approaching his eighth birthday. There is no record of W having been asked to reflect upon being permanently separated from his siblings. If sibling contact is considered upon an application for adoption being made, I would expect W&#8217; wishes and feelings to be obtained in an age sensitive way. For the purpose of these applications, it is therefore for the Court to assess the effect of sibling separation. Whilst the local authority has optimism that each of the children will be placed for adoption, albeit less so with W, neither the local authority nor the Court is able to predict with any degree of certainty what will be the children&#8217;s fate. This is a sibling group of two boys who have lived together since their separation from the parents and two siblings who initially lived with their brothers but then move to a placement together. Each of the siblings has a strong relationship with the others. The lack of good parenting and the effect of their parents&#8217; inadequacies have resulted in a dynamic between the children which the research informs will be long-lasting. As I stated I do not consider myself able to rely upon the findings of the inter-sibling assessment as being definitive.  I can also reasonably find that the effect of severing direct contact between the siblings or any one of them will have a dramatic effect.</span></p>

My concern extends to the local authority&#8217;s emphatic refusal to countenance sibling contact following placement for adoption unless all children are placed. Without an order the children would be destined, over a relatively short period of time to have their entire sibling-dynamic fundamentally changed. In my judgment this is unsustainable in the circumstances of this case.</span></p>

The placement order will, as is commonly the case, provide for any future applications relating to the children to be adjudicated by myself if available. If I am not available, however, I trust that the local authority will remind itself of my request stated within this paragraph and ensure that a copy of this judgment is available to the presiding judge.</span></p>
