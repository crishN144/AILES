	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">At 11.45pm last night I concluded an out of hours hearing that had commenced at 10.00pm with respect to GH, a 26-year-old woman who suffers from anxiety, depression and acute agoraphobia and who had gone into labour at home nearly 72 hours earlier but who had thereafter suffered an obstructed labour.  Within this context, it became apparent that GH required urgent in-patient obstetric treatment and a possible emergency caesarean section.  GH was, however, refusing to agree to that course of action.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">At the conclusion of that hearing I declared that, by reason of the operation of her acute agoraphobia and anxiety, GH lacked capacity to decide whether to agree to be admitted to hospital for obstetric treatment and a possible emergency caesarean section and that it was in her best interests to be conveyed from her home to hospital by ambulance and for the medical and midwifery practitioners attending GH to carry out such treatment as may in their opinion be necessary for the management of GH&#8217;s pregnancy and delivery, as outlined in the Obstetric Management Plan.  I now set out the reasons for that decision. </p>

GH is represented in these proceedings at short notice by the Official Solicitor, Ms Sarah Castle.  The court is extremely grateful to Ms Castle for attending the out of hours hearing to act as litigation friend to GH, testing the evidence of the Trust by way of cross-examination and making, by way of closing submissions, a considered recommendation to the court regarding GH&#8217;s best interests. </p>

However, I accept Mr Wenban-Smith&#8217;s submission that this case is distinguished by the fact that up until late yesterday afternoon GH was assessed to have capacity with respect to decisions concerning the management of her pregnancy and birth and indeed had agreed to admission to hospital in the event that admission was required during the course of her labour.  It was only during the latter part of the day yesterday that it became clear that GH&#8217;s anxiety and agoraphobia had become the dominant feature in her decision making and that a subsequent capacity assessment revealed that she lacked capacity to decide whether to agree to be admitted to hospital for obstetric treatment and a possible emergency caesarean section. Within this context, and as the Official Solicitor pointed out, there were options that might have been considered in order to endeavour to avoid the need for an urgent hearing following that assessment, I was satisfied that this case met the criteria for the urgent out of hours service.  I make clear however, that nothing said in this judgment should detract from </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">GH is 26 years old.  She has had one previous, uncomplicated, pregnancy followed by a normal hospital birth in 2017.  GH suffers from severe anxiety, depression and debilitating agoraphobia.  Those difficulties appear to have had their genesis in a particularly traumatic incident suffered by GH some years ago, the details of which it is not necessary to recount.  It is however, not without significance in the context of GH&#8217;s current difficulties that yesterday was the anniversary of that deeply upsetting event. As a result of her agoraphobia, anxiety and depression, GH finds it difficult to leave her local area and has not done this since the birth of her last child.  She considers her home to be her &#8220;safe space&#8221;.  Prior to yesterday however, GH&#8217;s mental health has been stable during her current pregnancy and is managed with Sertraline, Propranolol and Mirtazapine.    </p>

Within this context, GH declined all routine antenatal ultrasound scans and growth scans.

The evidence before the court makes clear that although midwives are trained to deal with emergency situations that arise during home births, where risks are already apparent then immediate access to obstetric and neonatal care is desirable and in-patient admission is therefore indicated.  Within the foregoing context, GH was informed that she did not meet the criteria for a home birth. </p>

At 3.45am yesterday morning, 2 March 2021, GH was diagnosed as having failed to progress in the first stage of labour and was advised of the risk of prolonged ruptured membranes and the need for her to be admitted to hospital.  GH declined to be admitted.  By 7.20am yesterday the midwife was concerned that GH&#8217;s labour was obstructed, a further recommendation was made for GH to attend hospital, which recommendation was again declined by GH.  A further assessment was undertaken at 4.30pm yesterday with no change in the clinical picture.  GH was advised that the risks to the baby at that point included significant infection, hypoxia, brain damage, birth injury and still birth.  GH was further advised that the risks to her at that point comprised those of sepsis and septic shock, uterine rupture, injury to the pelvic organs, significant risk of postpartum haemorrhage and possible trauma.  Again, GH declined admission to hospital. </p>

That capacity assessment is before the court, completed by Ms Yates late yesterday afternoon at GH&#8217;s family home.  It concludes that GH at present lacks capacity to decide whether to agree to be admitted to hospital for obstetric treatment and a possible emergency caesarean section.   </p>

Ms Yates considered that GH&#8217;s agoraphobia, anxiety and depression satisfied the diagnostic element of the capacity test under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  With respect to the functional element of the test for capacity, during the course of her oral evidence Ms Yates confirmed her assessment that GH currently lacks the ability to use and weigh information relevant to the decision in issue.  In particular, Ms Yates confirmed that whilst GH was able to recall and articulate some of the risks attendant on not being admitted to hospital, she was fixated on the idea that those risks would not come to pass with respect to her and could be avoided provided she was permitted to remain in her &#8220;safe space&#8221;, which action would, with the support of her partner, by itself </p>

Within this context, Ms Yates considered that the demands of GH&#8217;s agoraphobia and anxiety prevented her from properly evaluating the information concerning risk as a key element of deciding whether to agree to be admitted to hospital for obstetric treatment and a possible emergency caesarean section.  The Official Solicitor did not take issue with the assessment of Ms Yates that GH lacks capacity on the decision in issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As I have noted, with respect to the question of best interests, I heard oral evidence from Dr Sarah Davies, Consultant Obstetrician, regarding the risks and benefits to GH of remaining at home during the course of her labour and birth and the risks and benefits of her being admitted to hospital for obstetric and postnatal care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Dr Davies considered that it was now essential that GH be admitted to hospital in circumstances where the midwives at the family home were clear that GH&#8217;s labour had become obstructed.  Whilst GH remained stable at the current time, Dr Davies was clear that should GH&#8217;s condition or the condition of the baby deteriorate (which Dr Davies confirmed in oral evidence could happen very quickly) the facilities of the hospital would be required as a matter of urgency but with no guarantee, absent a pre-arranged transfer, that an ambulance could respond immediately in such circumstances.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In particular, in circumstances where GH&#8217;s waters broke over 72 hours ago Dr Davies considered that GH was at risk of deteriorating quite rapidly to a situation of infection and concurrent sepsis, which would be a significant risk to GH and which her unborn baby would not tolerate.  Further, Dr Davies considered that in circumstances where the risks of obstructed labour include uterine rupture that would lead to significant haemorrhage.  It is further clear from the documentary evidence before the court that in any event a uterine birth in the context of blocked labour now carries with it considerable risks, particularly if attempted at home, which risks comprise increased chance of uterine trauma and uterine tone following the delivery of the placenta with the attendant risk of significant postpartum bleeding, which could only be effectively treated with transfusions that could only be administered in hospital.  In the event such haemorrhage could not be controlled there is a risk the mother could collapse, suffer a cardiac arrest, hypoxic brain injury or die. Dr Davies considered that additional risks at this point included disseminated vascular coagulation, acute renal failure and the need for a hysterectomy.  Dr Davies was clear that the longer the delay in achieving the admission to hospital of GH the greater these risks. </p>

Dr Davies confirmed that the Trust had access to support from mental health professionals experienced in using reasonable force to transport patients. Dr Davies agreed when asked by the court that it would be important for her to provide advice to those professionals regarding particular steps that will need to be taken in order to ensure that reasonable force is assessed properly by reference to GH&#8217;s pregnancy and current obstetric condition. Dr Davies further agreed with the Official Solicitor that, subject to advice from the Consultant Anaesthetist on call, it may be possible to provide GH with mild sedation in order to lower her anxiety with respect to the journey to and the admission to hospital. </p>

Having regard to the evidence before the court, and in particular the evidence of Ms Yates, I am clear that GH&#8217;s current agoraphobia and anxiety is preventing her from using or weighing information in deciding whether to agree to be admitted to hospital for obstetric treatment and a possible emergency caesarean section.   </p>

Within this context, this is not a case in which GH has acknowledged the risk of serious injury or death, weighed that risk and then rejected that risk it in favour of an unwise course of action but rather a case in which GH simply does not acknowledge the risk of serious injury or death or accept that the risk of serious injury or death is relevant to her as long as she remains in her &#8220;safe space&#8221;.  I am satisfied that this demonstrates that GH&#8217;s agoraphobia and anxiety has overwhelmed her ability to use and weigh the information required to decide whether to agree to be admitted to hospital for obstetric treatment and a possible emergency caesarean section.  Within this context, I am further satisfied GH&#8217;s inability to use and weight information is clearly the result of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, GH&#8217;s mind or brain. </p>

On the evidence before the court, I am satisfied that it is in GH&#8217;s best interests to be conveyed from her home to hospital by ambulance, with use of reasonable force if necessary, and for the medical and midwifery practitioners attending GH to carry out such treatment as may in their opinion be necessary for the management of GH&#8217;s pregnancy and delivery, as outlined in the Obstetric Management Plan. </p>

If GH had retained capacity with respect to the decision in issue, I am satisfied that it is likely she would have remained in agreement with being admitted to hospital should that admission have become necessary during the course of her labour, which it now has.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I have of course borne in mind carefully the risks attendant on admission to hospital, particular in circumstances where one of the options contemplated is a caesarean section under a general anaesthetic.  A caesarean section carries with it the risks associated with a general anaesthetic and an increased risk of bleeding.  The transportation of GH to hospital will also inevitably increase her levels of anxiety at a time when her body is already stressed by her pregnancy and obstructed labour, particularly if it is necessary to use reasonable force to facilitate the transfer.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">However, set against these risks are what I am satisfied is the greater risk to GH&#8217;s health (and the health of her of her unborn baby) of not being now admitted as an inpatient for obstetric and postnatal care.  The documentary evidence before the court and the evidence of Dr Davies makes abundantly clear the fact that a uterine birth now carries with it considerable risks in any event, particularly if attempted at home, which risk comprise increased chance of uterine trauma and uterine tone following the delivery of the placenta with the risk of a hysterectomy being required.  As I have noted, other risks include disseminated vascular coagulation, acute renal failure and the need for admission to ISU for organ support.  Were GH to suffer significant post-partum bleeding she would require multiple transfusions which can only be effectively delivered in hospital. In the event the haemorrhage cannot be controlled there is a risk the mother could collapse, suffer a cardiac arrest, hypoxic brain injury or die. The longer the delay the greater the risk.  The risks present in this case are further exacerbated by the uncertainties caused by the impact of GH&#8217;s condition on the course of her antenatal care, with medics having no clear picture of the position of GH&#8217;s placenta, whether her unborn child has any foetal abnormality or the extent to which there are issues in respect of foetal growth.   </p>

Within this context, GH&#8217;s family are supportive of the application made by the Trust and of the relief sought in that application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It is important for me to consider the position from GH&#8217;s point of view.  In this regard, I am once again assisted by fact of GH&#8217;s consent to admission when she had capacity to consent to that course and before she was overborne by her agoraphobia and anxiety.  As I have stated, for the reasons I have given I am satisfied that this would remain her position if she had capacity in light of the fact this this view was taken by her as recently as a few days ago.  I am further satisfied that GH would also take counsel of relatives and family who seek for her to go to hospital and would likely place weight on that counsel, particularly in circumstances where it is plain that GH was desirous of a safe birth for her second child. Within this context, I have of course also borne in mind that, having heard the evidence in this case, the considered recommendation of the Official Solicitor, as litigation friend for GH, that it is in GH&#8217;s best interests now to be admitted to hospital for obstetric and postnatal care. </p>

During the course of the hearing, the Official Solicitor rightly drew the attention of the court to additional steps that can be taken to ensure that this course of action is carried out as sensitively and with as little distress for GH as possible.  In particular, I endorse the Official Solicitors view that the use of mild sedation should be explored with the assistance of advice from the on-call anaesthetist.  I further endorse the suggestion that in determining what constitutes reasonable physical restraint, should this be necessary, the views of Dr Davies in this regard will be important to ensure that such restraint is appropriate for a woman in GH&#8217;s position. </p>

It is a graver step still compel, possibly by means of the use of sedation and reasonable force if further gentle persuasion fails, the removal of a person from their home to ensure their attendance at hospital for such medical treatment.  Parliament has conferred upon the court jurisdiction to make a declaration of such gravity only where it is satisfied that the patient lacks the capacity to decide whether to undergo the treatment in question and where it is satisfied that such treatment is in that patient's best interests. </p>
