	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From 12 to 15 December 2006 and on 15 January 2007, I heard contact and residence applications made both by the Applicant father, 37 year old F, and the Respondent mother, 30 year old R.  They relate to their 2 sons, D and N.  They were born on 24 January 1998 and 19 April 2001, and are respectively 8 and 4 years of age</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties were together from 1996 until July 2005 when the mother effectively brought their relationship to an end.  The father had purchased a house in Mexico earlier that year.  In October 2005, after he had stayed there for a month or so, the father proposed that the children should spend half a year with him and half a year in England with their mother.</p>

	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother feared that the father would take the children to Mexico.  Both parties started proceedings in October 2005.  There were a series of hearings in the Northampton County Court before the case was transferred to the High Court in March 2006.  This was because of the international aspect of the case and quite possibly the aggressive and confrontational attitude of the father who has acted in person throughout.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The present position is as follows.  The mother lives with the 2 boys at an address which has not been disclosed and to which she moved in September 2006.  The father lives with his partner, a Mexican national, at his home in Mexico.  He has presently rented a property in Beckenham, Kent.  He has been working here as an IT consultant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He says that the best solution for the children is for them to spend half the year in Mexico with him, attending a local school.  The other half of the year they would spend with their mother.  This was his original plan in October 2006.  By this means they will have the benefit of spending a significant time with each parent and the advantage of both cultures.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is agreed that the boys want to see him and that he has a warm and affectionate relationship with them.  All this is clear from the supervised contact. There is therefore no need and no justification for supervised contact in the future.  He has no intention of taking the children from their mother.</p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no evidence which should prevent him having a full relationship with the boys.  The mother has repeatedly lied about him.  Any adverse remarks about him in the CAFCASS report, the assessment of the supervised contact, and  the Guardian report are based on those lies.  They are therefore misleading and not to be relied on.  The same applies to his plea of guilty to charges of harassing the mother.</p>

The first was a minor matter when he held N&#8217;s mouth closed to make him eat his food.  The second occasion in April 2005 was more serious.  He considered N had not cleaned his teeth properly.  He proceeded to scrub N&#8217;s teeth so hard that it made him scream and caused his gums to bleed.  That was a factor in her decision to end their relationship.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_17">
	  <num>17.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore there is evidence that he has tried to obtain passports for the children contrary to the court order. Together with what Ms Andrews-Trail heard him say as he left court, his proposal to remove the children as reported by his aunt, and his anger and frustration at being prevented from seeing the children means that there is a serious risk that he will take them to Mexico.  It is not met by his reliance on Mexico being a signatory to the Hague Convention, given the great distress that would be caused to them if removed and the difficulty for the mother in first tracing them and then having to take proceedings.  Such are the risks that contact should be strictly supervised.</p>

Apart from the mother, the evidence in support of the mother&#8217;s case backed by the CAFCASS Officer, Ms Andrews-Trail, Miss Iwi who witnessed contact sessions and the Guardian Miss Weldon is overwhelming.  The father&#8217;s animosity to the mother, and his aggression to and contempt of anyone who does agree with him is quite remarkably high.  He lacks almost all insight into the consequences of his behaviour.  Though he deeply loves his 2 children and could potentially have a relationship with them to their great benefit, he has single-mindedly put that at risk.  He has not accepted nor been able to understand why there should be a genuine risk that he will abduct the children.  It is difficult to see how there can be in the foreseeable future any ongoing relationship between him and the children until he has begun to come to terms with what he has done and how he has unintentionally caused harm to the children.  I shall approve an assessment of him with which the mother will also join in to assess the level of risk that he poses to the children.</p>

From early 2002 their home was in Northamptonshire. The father was an independent IT specialist, earning about &#163;60,000 a year.  The mother worked, latterly in a bank.  The relationship was one where the father largely controlled the mother. It ended in July 2005.  It was the mother&#8217;s decision.</p>

The father says it was so they could spend half the year there and half in the UK.  Following the breakdown of the relationship, the father went there in September 2005.  On his return at the beginning of October 2005, he told the mother he was going to live there permanently.  He wanted the boys to be with him for 6 months of the year, the other 6 months being spent with the mother.  The mother did not agree.  The father then said that he would take the children to Mexico anyway.  Fearing this, the mother took their passports to a solicitor.</p>

He had been angry about the pub, a bank books and the children's swearing, which he had raised with her.  The mother felt threatened by him.  She had spent months on someone else's floor, and then months in a refuge.  She had financial difficulties.  She'd had to travel to find accommodation.  She still had concerns about kidnapping.  She was aware of her brother being a drug addict, and that her mother had been ill, matters the father was keen to emphasize.</p>

I am satisfied that that is how it must have appeared when he visited the wife's first solicitors, in his numerous calls to the mother, in his visits to her home, in his reaction to the first CAFCASS report, and to the mother&#8217;s solicitors as they faced an unparalleled tide of abuse and aggression from the father with remarkable fortitude.</p>

The submissions of counsel set out above are well founded.  I have not accepted the evidence of the father where it has differed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I refer to the email messages.  It is rare to read such a sustained diatribe even in family cases.  I am satisfied that there is no hope of contact being negotiated between father and mother without the mother becoming once more the victim of the father&#8217;s aggression and contempt.  The children will not be immune from it.  Quite apart from the threat of abduction by the father, unless there is a well demonstrated change by the father, the prospects of successful contact without considerable difficulty and stress for the mother are remote. The father&#8217;s appalling behaviour has already harmed the children (see for example paragraphs 75, 88 and 113). He has not intended this.  But his contempt for the mother and his aggressive and abusive conduct has affected them.  It will do so again if his conduct continues.  He has shown no insight into it and when it has gone on as recently as November, I see no immediate hope of it now ceasing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father's sustained abuse, aggression, and criticism of all he sees as opposing him, and in particular the mother, is remarkable.  I note it, in particular, that, when he questioned witnesses, he had only 2 apparent objectives in mind. The first was understandably to show that he had a good relationship with Drayton and N. The second was to establish that either the witness was lying or that their evidence was based upon the mother&#8217;s lies.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He was able with some difficulty to see that some of his remarks and his attitude could not be sustained when he was asked about it.  That apart, his insight is severely limited.  He does not understand that unintentionally he has upset and distressed the children nor the extent to which he has undermined the mother and reduced her self- confidence.</p>

A remarkable feature of the history of the last year is that, despite all that has happened, this is not a mother who has sought to refuse the father contact.  She has acted on advice.  She went into a refuge when that appeared the only alternative.</p>

She still does provided that, as she has been advised, it is strictly supervised.  It is highly commendable that she has maintained this attitude in the face of such an onslaught from the father, who has so little regard for her either as a mother or a person.</p>

It is to show the father the unanimity of the conclusions reached by Ms Andrews-Trail, Miss Iwi, and Miss Weldon.  Furthermore the basis for those conclusions is all to be found in the summaries that I have made.</p>

Ms Andrews-Trail and Miss Iwi have pointed out how positive some of the contact has been and the qualities which the father has (see paragraphs 74, 83 and 97).  Equally they have pointed to the children being sad, confused and unsettled and that they are vulnerable.  Having been exposed to something of the father&#8217;s hostility, harassment and aggression understandably though very fond of him are also wary of him.</p>

He has found it necessary to make persistent and reckless allegations against all whom he perceives not to agree with him.  He is powerfully built; his aggression could readily be found to be frightening.</p>

My hope that the court process might by itself provide him with a means of seeing what his conduct was like and why it had caused so many problems has not been realised.  I can only hope that the further psychological assessment of the risks that he presents will also give him the opportunity to learn how he can have a mutually beneficial relationship with the children before it is too late.</p>

I do not propose to review it further.  I share the views of the experts that at this stage it is not possible to see how contact could continue unless it is strictly supervised.  I want that situation to come to an end.  It has been clear during the hearing that my wishes have gone ahead of the sensible careful and justifiable views of Miss Weldon.  I have wanted to find a way forward.  But I am at the end of the day quite unable to ignore the weight and validity of the views expressed by them and the realistic submissions of counsel.</p>

I shall direct that there is to be supervised contact by the father but in circumstances which provide sufficient safeguards.  It may well have to be at his expense.  I shall approve an order for psychological assessment of both parents.  I shall further order that there be a directions hearing on a date to be fixed after 2 weeks from the date that the report is received.  I shall give permission for the parties to file further statements in the light of the report.  I shall leave the Guardian to decide whether she considers a further report is necessary.  I shall at that stage consider whether it is appropriate or not for the court to make an order under Section 91(14) restricting any further applications without leave of the court.</p>

I shall reserve the case to myself if available.  I shall ask Miss van Spall to draw the order arising from this judgment.</p>
