I accept the evidence of the social worker and the children&#8217;s guardian that it is highly unlikely, however wonderful these foster carers are, that they would be approved as long-term foster carers for CD, given their ages and he is only 4.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.54in">The female foster carer has expressed a view, based on her experience as a foster carer in the past, that CD is eminently adoptable and, with the right support, would be able to move to a prospective adoptive family where he would settle and form secure attachments.  The children&#8217;s guardian told me that over the past 4 weeks, when CD has not had contact with his mother, he has been his most settled in all his time with these foster carers.   </p>

I was asked to continue that order on the basis that if the mother does not demonstrate commitment to contact with CD, it will be refused but if she does demonstrate commitment, and is prepared to travel to CD to have contact, contact with her once a month, reducing to a farewell contact, assuming the plan of the local authority to place CD for adoption is approved.  </p>

It has the very great considerable disadvantage of severing all legal ties between CD and not only his mother, but also his half-sibling, GH.  I am reminded by Ms Brannigan QC that up until the age of 3, CD had been cared for by his mother and lived with his wider family and he had suffered the tragedy of the loss of his brother EF.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.54in">Those being the only realistic options for CD, I have to balance one against the other.  I may only determine the balance falls in favour of adoption if I am satisfied that it is justified, it is proportionate to the circumstances of the case and that no other step will meet CD&#8217;s welfare needs throughout the whole of his life.  The local authority propose that a search is made for an adoptive placement for CD for a period of 6 months, failing which the plan would revert to one of long-term foster care.  The social worker, Ms Z, and the children&#8217;s guardian, are clear that this is the plan which best meets and </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.54in">I entirely agree.  I shared the concern as to whether adoption was the right order for CD, given the very impressive role that his current foster carers have played in his life, but, as I have said, I well understand the decisions they have reached and the views they have expressed. I am, therefore, entirely satisfied that it is in CD&#8217;s welfare best interests that I give him the opportunity to be placed for adoption by making him the subject of a care order on a plan of adoption.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.54in">When considering making a placement order, I have well in mind to the provisions of s.52 of the 2002 Act.  For the reasons I have given, I am entirely satisfied that CD&#8217;s welfare best interests require me to dispense with the consent of the mother and I so dispense with it and make a placement order. I do so in the knowledge, that I rather suspect the mother herself recognised, that this would be the inevitable outcome of this case and might very well explain why she had chosen not to attend today.  </p>

The evidence was overwhelming as to the extreme distress and upset the child has been caused when he believed his mother was coming to see him and she did not turn up.   In these circumstances, where I fear that the mother is not going to demonstrate that commitment, I consider it to be in CD&#8217;s welfare best interests that I continue </p>
