It took days for me to read the papers and has taken even more days to write this judgment. Because there are so many intertwined issues, it has been difficult to structure this judgment and so I use headings throughout it to help anyone reading it. My original judgment has been anonymised by counsel to their satisfaction and I am publishing it in that form., save that I have also anonymised the names of the two adult children of this marriage and removed the children&#8217;s dates of birth.</span></p>

She asserts, also, that the husband has a controlling influence in a business operated by a company, the shares of which are owned by another third party. The two properties that are subject to the trust claims are i) 50-52 High Street, Burnham on Sea, of which the legal title is held in the sole name of the Second Respondent, Rupia Begum and ii) 4 Morland Rd, Highbridge, which is now held in the sole name of the Seventh Respondent, Sume Begum. The business is the New Chandni Restaurant which operates from 50-52 High Street, Burnham-on-Sea. The company that operates the restaurant, nominally, is the Third Respondent, Bluebird Restaurant Ltd, of which the Fourth Respondent, Mohammed Haque, is the sole shareholder; during the hearing it was revealed that another company (&#8216;Chandni Catering Ltd&#8217;) has taken over Bluebird Restaurant Ltd.&#8217;s position in relation to the restaurant business, at least on a &#8216;trial&#8217; basis. If the husband does not have an interest in the two properties (50-52 High St and 4 Morland Rd), the wife contends that he will benefit from them by way of arrangement with the property owners. The issues in the case were narrowed during a pre-trial hearing before me on 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> April 2022 and therefore some of the civil pleading that is contained in the bundle is now otiose.</span></p>

I have also created a table, which I attach as an appendix, of some of the many other people whose names arise in these proceedings; I have given a brief description of each such person and placed their names in alphabetical order.

Apart from the trust claims (which, as I explain, are meritless and misconceived), this case should have been simple. The husband and wife own two properties between them, First, there is the former matrimonial home, where the wife and all five children live. It is held in the husband&#8217;s sole name. It is 37 St Michael&#8217;s Avenue, Clevedon. It is worth about &#163;500,000 net, if it were to be sold after repayment of a mortgage of &#163;10k. Second, the mortgage-free previous family home (a former council house, held in the wife&#8217;s sole name), 36 Beaconsfield Rd, Clevedon. Mr Miah, who has conducted the husband&#8217;s case with eminent professionalism, is right to say that Capital Gains Tax would arise on a sale of 36 Beaconsfield Rd and so a net sale figure of about &#163;230,000 is used for it in this judgment. </span></p>

His portrayal of himself in these proceedings as a mere employee of the business indebted to the owner, Mr Haque, has been dishonest.  I find that he has a net income of at least &#163;42,500 p.a. and can remain living rent and utility bill free above the restaurant. There was no examination of any alternative housing that he might wish to seek for himself, even though there are property particulars in the bundle. He did not give evidence of any intentions to buy a property or suggest that he had looked at any properties. The reality, I find, is that he will remain living and working at 50-52 High Street but has the use of accommodation elsewhere through his strong and united family and friendship circle. </span></p>

She needs a large house to accommodate them and her husband has very limited capital (about &#163;11,700).

Many of the issues that the wife has raised in these proceedings are speculative (at best), insufficiently analysed or are simply devoid of any evidential support at all. Since the wife has remarried, there are no issues in relation to periodical payments. She has no earning capacity, due to her commitment to the children and is not going to acquire one. The extreme divisions within this family, widened by this unnecessarily conflicted litigation, mean that the wife bears the major part of the parental responsibilities for the children, and will continue to do so.  Because of the way that the husband has structured his income (taking a low wage from the business and drawing additional sums through a fictional loan arrangement) his child maintenance support of this family is very modest and is likely to remain so. She is going to bear the main financial burden in relation to them. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">In addition to the wife&#8217;s overall potential costs liabilities, there would be the CGT payable by her on the sale of Beaconsfield Rd (estimated by Mr Miah, roughly, at about &#163;25,000) and she has credit card debts of about &#163;24,000. </span></p>

When his offer did come (in closing speeches) it had obviously been guided by Mr Miah and so, unsurprisingly, it was, of course (if I may say), a clever offer. The husband&#8217;s primary case is that the wife should move back to 36 Beaconsfield Rd with 37 St Michael&#8217;s Avenue being sold to pay off debts. Realising the limitations of that primary position due to its impact on the children, Mr Miah postulated that 36 Beaconsfield might be sold and the proceeds divided so that the wife&#8217;s cost liabilities might be met and the husband has some capital released to him at this stage. Beyond that, Mr Miah further postulated, in the unusual circumstances of this case and given the wide age range of the children, the court might make a Mesher - type order in relation to 37 St Michael&#8217;s Avenue (with only the children&#8217;s ages or further order being the trigger points for sale since the wife has already remarried). A division of 80/20% (my example, not Mr Miah&#8217;s) in the wife&#8217;s favour, would leave her with &#163;400,000 on sale at present values and the husband with &#163;100,000 at a time when the children were all adult. Further, if the wife and her husband wished to buy out the husband&#8217;s share, they would be able to do so, if the order were to be drafted in the correct terms (this would require care due to potential CGT implications for the husband that might arise from a charge based order). As Mr Miah submitted, a simple solution that the wife has 37 St Michaels Avenue and the husband has Beaconsfield Rd would be unworkable now, in any event, due to costs and CGT on Beaconsfield Rd.</span></p>

My conclusion is that the only fair solution that is left is to direct the transfer of St Michael&#8217;s Avenue to the wife, subject to the mortgage and on the Mesher basis set out above (80/20 in favour of the wife). I also direct the sale of Beaconsfield Rd. I have spent a great deal of time deciding upon the division of the net sale proceeds of that property.

Further, basic procedural requirements of financial remedy proceedings have been ignored. The wife has never filed a Form A.

There is no statement from the wife&#8217;s current husband and there was no evidence about his circumstances at all until I required him to attend to give oral evidence. There is no documentation at all in support of the evidence that he gave.  No mention at all has been made during this hearing about alternative accommodation for either party, even though evidence has been filed about it [J1-63]. The Forms E of neither party gave full or frank disclosure. The case has been in and out of court due to procedural infighting. In relation to the trust claims the wife has never set out in any meaningful sense how it is that she seeks to justify the claims or the shares that she seeks in the two relevant properties (High St and 4 Morland Rd); for instance, the case of Laskar v Laskar <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2008/347" uk:canonical="[2008] EWCA Civ 347" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWCA Civ 347</ref> (to which I refer later) has simply been ignored by her. </span></p>

In relation to both properties in issue (50-52 High St and 4 Morland Rd) there is no evidence that the husband made any direct financial contribution to the purchase of either property or to mortgage payments. There is no evidence of a common intention (express, implied or imputed) that he would have a share in them &#8211; quite the reverse, since it was the very clear intention that the legal title holders would be the beneficial owners of the two properties. From the start, the trust claims as presented bore the evidential difficulty of the wife (an outsider) seeking to establish that the holders of the legal title and the husband shared beneficial interests in properties that both title holders and the husband denied; that evidential reality has not been reflected in anything that I have heard on her behalf. </span></p>

During the course of this hearing I required the husband to give evidence that was sworn by him on the Koran to be true that: i) he has never been married to R7; ii) he is not the father of X; iii) he is not the father of Y; iv) he has never been in a sexual relationship with R7 and v) he has not been into a bedroom at 4 Morland Rd with R7. When I asked him to give that evidence on the Koran, he was extremely reluctant to do so, suggested that he was not a man of strong faith and was plainly very anxious. Although what is sometimes condensed into the description of &#8216;demeanour in the witness box&#8217; is a very poor basis for making an assessment of truthfulness, the way a person converses is part of the everyday assessment that everyone makes when analysing what another person says.  It is also part of the advice given to juries that, although they may take notes, they may find it particularly helpful to watch the witnesses and listen carefully to what they are saying. The husband did eventually give the evidence that I required of him on the Koran. R7 gave her evidence on the Koran and gave the same confirmation on those five points.</span></p>

The very fact that he was prepared to invest his only capital into a piece of land that was jointly owned by Sume Begum, is one example of how close the connection is. There has not been an explanation as to why her name appeared on the documents of title to that land, rather than the name of Ahmed Mosthaque. I was told that the purchase of this land was funded by the husband and Mr Mosthaque only. The husband&#8217;s evidence is that the land did not form part of &#8216;a dowry&#8217; for her. There is no suggestion that it was part of a dowry relating to her 2010 marriage to Mr Mosthaque. </span></p>

On the evidence of the husband and Sume Begum, X is the son of Ms Begum and Ahmed Mosthaque. Unlike Y, X is not said to be child of a sibling of the husband. I find that the husband does refer to X when speaking to the five children of this marriage by the Bengali word &#8216;bha&#8217;i&#8217;. I was told that the word &#8216;bha&#8217;i&#8217; might mean cousin or brother. So, when speaking to B, the father has called X B&#8217;s bha&#8217;i. A point not pursued by the wife&#8217;s counsel in evidence is that X is not the cousin or brother of the five children, on the account given by the husband and Sume Begum. The blood relationship arises because Ahmed Mosthaque is the cousin of the husband&#8217;s father; I have constructed a genogram of my own to visualise this and it leaves X as only a very distant relative. More importantly than terminology, is the considerable amount of evidence that X is involved in family occasions and is integrated within the husband&#8217;s family network. For instance, he attends birthday parties and family meals.</span></p>

If the wife should seek a transcript of that part of the evidence of Ms Begum and the husband so that it could be referred to the police or any others involved if such an assertion were to be made, she should so apply. As I warned Ms Sume Begum, if she was not telling the truth, she would either be effectively disinheriting her children in relation to the father or risking investigation for an offence of perjury. </span></p>

I do not accept that B will be a long-term dependent although he may live at home for the immediate future.

It is not the principal place of residence of the wife. It was bought about seven months after 37 St Michael&#8217;s Avenue was bought. Because of the low purchase price, there has been a considerable gain even after indexation is taken into account. The parties are now divorced and, therefore, any transfers between them would not be between spouses. I agree with Mr Miah that CGT would be payable if the property were to be sold and, also that there would be likely to be CGT payable if the property were to be transferred from the wife to the husband. The only figure that I have for CGT comes from the back of an envelope calculation that Mr Miah did in his closing speech. As I stated above, he used a net figure of &#163;230k for the sale proceeds of the property after CGT&#8211; costs of sale of &#163;5k and CGT of &#163;25k.

The husband says that the money to buy the property was not raised from various businesses, as the wife contends, but was raised from family members. The husband says that, at the time of the purchase, he did not own any businesses and he produces documents showing refusals of mortgages from NatWest and also Lloyds TSB [D6]. As I will set out later, the husband says that he owes his brother, Enu Tazul, &#163;40,000 for a loan received from Mr Tazul towards the purchase of Beaconsfield Rd. In the light of the husband&#8217;s dishonesty about the debt that he said that he had to Mr Haque, the intermingling of money within the husband&#8217;s family and business associates and the husband&#8217;s dishonest portrayal of his role within the business, I do not think that anything that this husband says about his indebtedness to his family is reliable.

It adds to the picture that is clear from many quarters of the evidence that the husband managed the business with his brother Almas. It does not mean that he owned the building or the shares in Rexvilla or Bluebird Restaurant Ltd. The business, the company and the building are separate. There has been no attempt by the wife to show an understanding that they are separate. Many restaurant managers (and, indeed, some chefs) will refer to restaurants where they work as &#8216;my restaurant&#8217;; it does not mean that they own the building from which the restaurant operates. Nor does it mean that there is no holding company. Many restaurants must operate on just that basis. </span></p>

How this family managed to receive that amount of state benefits, I do not know because I do not have the necessary documentation. The wife said that the benefits were paid into a bank account in her sole name but the husband made the benefits claims. With the sort of access to money through the business that I have now been able to identify, the benefits and the rent from 36 Beaconsfield, I consider that this family must have had a standard of living that was at least reasonable, if not more.</span></p>

For much of the time he has been paid his wage in the sum that I have stated (about &#163;18,500 p.a. currently). In addition he has been taking at least &#163;2,000 p.m. from the business up to the start of the pandemic. That would leave him with a combined income of &#163;24,000 + &#163;18,500 = &#163;42,500 p.a. Since the beginning of the pandemic there is a lack of evidence about what he has been taking out of the business. Having seen the accounts (as I set out later) I do not see why he should not have continued at least that level of drawing from the business.  The poor quality of his evidence makes that the best that I am able to say about his income.</span></p>

There is a geographical logic to that arrangement since the restaurant is in Burnham and Morland Rd is about 1.4 miles away in Highbridge, according to Google maps. For the father to have taken B back to the home in Clevedon (and to have picked up in the morning) would have involved a journey of 18.5 miles each way.</span></p>

Where a property is bought in the joint names of a cohabiting couple, even if that is as an investment, it does not follow inexorably that the "resulting trust solution" must provide the inevitable answer as to how its beneficial ownership is to be determined. Lord Neuberger did not intend to draw a strict line of demarcation between, on the one hand, the purchase of a family home and, on the other, the acquisition of a so-called investment property in whatever circumstances that took place. It is entirely conceivable that partners in a relationship would buy, as an investment, property which is conveyed into their joint names with the intention that the beneficial ownership should be shared equally between them, even though they contributed in different shares to the purchase. Where there is evidence to support such a conclusion, it would be both illogical and wrong to impose the resulting trust solution on the subsequent distribution of the property.&#8217;</span></p>

Further, she has not differentiated between: a) the ownership of the property; b) the ownership of the companies that, nominally, ran the business and c) the control of the business. She has assumed that the arrangements for the previous business were transferred to the new business. On balance I do not accept that the husband told her that he was a 75% owner of the new business, whatever may have been said about the business at Number 54. Further, she has not analysed with sufficient care the documents that have been produced. Those documents show that Rupia Begum (and, initially her aunt, Easmin) bought the property, the business was run, nominally, by Rexvilla Ltd and then Bluebird Restaurant Ltd but that the husband and his two brothers Enu (initially) and Almas have always been the controlling force behind the business. </span></p>

At L98 the document says, at paragraph 8, that no consideration was given for the transfer to her sole name other than the release of Easmin from the Nat West charge. Counsel for the wife put to her that it did not say that the consideration was the transfer by Rupia Begum to Easmin of property in Bangladesh. I have no reason to doubt Rupia Begum&#8217;s word that she did transfer property to Easmin at the time; whether that transfer should have been recorded as consideration for the transfer or whether it was something that merely took place contemporaneously, I cannot say. Certainly, I do not know nearly enough about that event to make a finding along the lines suggested to her that she had behaved in a way that was either fraudulent or improper.  What is crystal clear is that there is no basis for suggesting that the husband paid anything for the property to be placed in her name. Further, it is equally clear that there is no basis at all for suggesting that there was a common intention, either express, to be implied or to be imputed that the husband should have a share in the property. Rupia Begum&#8217;s evidence was that Alim Uddin was not involved with her in the discussions about buying the property. </span></p>

She said that Almas needed support at the time having gone through a &#8216;dire time&#8217; when he and Easmin divorced. That is why she gave the solicitors permission to write to the husband on her behalf at the restaurant. </span></p>

She said that the arrangement is that she owns the building and Almas acts as her &#8216;eyes&#8217; and looks after her interests. She was asked about the new company that has taken over from Bluebird Restaurant since October 2021, Chandni Catering Limited. She said that did not know who Chandni Catering Ltd are. She just knew that that there was a new company and she made an agreement for it to stand in the place of Bluebird Restaurant Ltd during a conversation with Almas on the phone. The extent of her dependence on Almas was plain when she said that she did not know whether the rent was paid at the full rate during the pandemic or whether there was an adjustment in relation to her interest payments; that would have been arranged by Almas, she said. Further, she was not clear who did own the fixtures and fitting &#8211; the cookers etc. She thought that she did, although the lease does not state that [and paragraph 26 of the lease &#8216;returning the property to the landlord&#8217; at L255 does not answer the question of ownership of the contents]. </span></p>

Whilst preparing this judgment, I have added together the figures for total wages etc paid for each month from September 2018 to August 2019 to see whether they tally with the figure for wages and salaries in the accounts (&#163;183,470); they do. Since that would have been a year in which Mr Haque says that he was paying the husband &#163;2,000 it appears unlikely that these so-called loan payments were hidden in the figures for salaries and wages. The &#8216;loan&#8217; payments were made by Mr Haque paying the husband from a personal account in Mr Haque&#8217;s name. As I set out below, that bank account was fed with considerable payments that were taken from the company bank account. How that featured in the company accounts I cannot say. I also cannot say whether the increase in wage payments since 2019 (the additional &#163;45,000 that is shown as having been paid in 2021 is accounted for by a continuation of the payments of &#163;2,000 p.m. or some other sum. </span></p>

Given the state of the accounts, I think that is highly likely that at least a similar amount will have been taken by the husband thereafter. There is no reason, given the state of the accounts, for that level of additional drawing to have stopped. If it was not taken, there is no reason to suggest that it could not have been. </span></p>

The Husband has never owned Bluebird but he has used it and his close friend Mr Haque to create a charade in which it is pretended that Mr Haque is the employer and the company runs the business. That charade can be seen at D24 where Mr Haque says: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">I am 30 years old this year [2020].

From part-time work at Tesco&#8217;s he had been earning &#163;400 p.m. From the restaurant he was taking &#163;893 net (this can be seen at, for instance, L301). When answering the questions he used a higher figure for his restaurant income (&#163;1200) based on a later rate of payment (see L305). The &#8216;loan&#8217; repayments started in March 2017, according to him; he was sure of that. He said that the payments did not start earlier.  He was asked, therefore, how he could have paid &#163;2,000 a month when he was only earning a corrected figure of &#163;893+&#163;400 = &#163;1293 p.m. and had no savings or assets of his own.

That, of course, is an absurd proposition given that Mr Haque was left in charge of the company bank account and was able to take so much money out </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt;color:#FF0000">of </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">it. Further, if that had been a concern, he and his company would never have been placed in nominal charge of the company and the business or given the responsibility for paying outgoings, including the rent to R2. The gambling point came at the end of Mr Haque&#8217;s unsatisfactory evidence which, by that time, had become farcical. </span></p>

I have set out the financial position of the parties in the judgment above. I have also considered their needs. They both have long-term obligations and responsibilities due to the number of children and G&#8217;s disabilities. The order that I have decided to make meets the needs of both of the parents and reflects the circumstances in which they find themselves. The standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage was reasonable. This was a long marriage. At the age of 47 and in the light of the work that he does, the husband has an earning capacity that he is likely to develop within the restaurant for many years to come. I reject his suggestion that he is at the pinnacle of his earning capacity. At the age of 42 the wife will be caring for G for a long time. Neither has any relevant mental or physical disability. They have both made significant contributions and I see no basis for differentiating between them under this heading. This is a needs case and, despite my findings about how they have both behaved, I consider that the issues of conduct are relevant to costs issues. &#8216;Conduct&#8217; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25 (2)</ref> (g) is not a punitive provision.

The wife must have credit for any capital payments to the mortgage. If it is considered that a charge would cause a liability to CGT for the husband and a trust arrangement would be more tax efficient, that must be discussed between the parties and I would expect them to agree on the most tax efficient method. The husband&#8217;s share is not to be realised until the youngest child attains the age of 18, the sale of the property or further order of the court. The precise terms of this arrangement will have to be discussed between the representatives for the husband and wife. If they cannot be agreed there will have to be an application but I strongly recommend that the parties sort out any issues without coming back to court.
