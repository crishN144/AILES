Further, given the gravity of the issue in dispute, it is not appropriate for the local authority simply to give its consent to immunisation pursuant to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 33(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> on the basis of its shared parental responsibility for SL under the interim care order (see <span style="font-weight:bold">A Local Authority v SB, AB &amp; MB) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 2 FLR 1203" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 2 FLR 1203</ref></span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Re Jake (Withholding Medical Treatment) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/2442" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2442 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2442 (Fam)</ref>)</span>.<span style="font-style:normal">&#8221;  </span></p>

It can only be said safely that there is a scale, at one end of which lies the clear case where parental opposition to medical intervention is prompted by scruple or dogma of a kind which is patently irreconcilable with principles of child health and welfare widely accepted by the generality of mankind; and that at the other end lie highly problematic cases where there is genuine scope for a difference of view between parent and judge. In both situations it is the duty of the judge to allow the court&#8217;s own opinion to prevail in the perceived paramount interests of the child concerned, but in cases at the latter end of the scale, there must be a likelihood (though never of course a certainty) that the greater the scope for genuine debate between one view and another the stronger will be the inclination of the court to be influenced by a reflection that in the last analysis the best interests of every child include an expectation that difficult decisions affecting the length and quality of its life will be taken for it by the parent to whom its care has been entrusted by nature<span style="font-style:normal">.&#8221; </span></p>

Vaccinations are not, in my view, properly characterised as &#8216;medical treatment&#8217;. They are a facet of public preventative healthcare intending to protect both individual children and society more generally. In the UK, the vaccination of children is properly reposited with parents, recognising that this is an aspect of parental responsibility rather than a decision of the State.

One in twenty with this type of meningitis will die and those who survive have long term problems such as hearing loss, seizures and learning disabilities. </p>

About a week to eleven days after injection some children get a mild form of measles which includes fever, rash, loss of appetite and being unwell for two to three days. About one in fifty children develop a mild form of mumps three to four weeks after the injection which includes swelling of the salivary glands in the cheeks and lasts for a day or two. Rare side effects include a small rash of bruise like spots about two weeks after vaccination which is known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and is due to a decrease of platelets (which aid blood clotting). This occurs around one in twenty four thousand doses. This side effect usually gets better without treatment and there is a greater risk developing this side effect from the natural virus infections. Seizures occurring around six to eleven days after vaccination occur in around one in every thousand doses and again it is less likely to develop this complication from vaccination than from natural virus infection. Very rarely severe allergic reactions may occur after vaccination. </p>

Addressing concerns that the parents have expressed in the past, Dr Douglas emphasises that vaccinations in the UK no longer contain thiomersal (a compound containing mercury). Neither, he states, is there any evidence that the small amounts of aluminium contained as an ingredient in some vaccines cause problems such as dementia or autism. Single vaccinations for the conditions that I have set out above were also not recommended in the NHS schedule, there being no evidence that they are either more effective or any safer in terms of the potential side effects. It is, to my mind, self-evident that for T, as a healthy, young infant, the risks contingent upon not vaccinating him significantly outweigh the benefits. The conditions identified include potential for catastrophic consequences which, as illustrated, involve paralysis, seizure, learning disabilities, visual loss and cancer. T&#8217;s Guardian comes to the clear conclusion that, &#8220;</span>as a healthy, well-grown baby<span style="font-style:normal">&#8221; there are &#8220;</span>no contra-indications for T for the vaccines proposed<span style="font-style:normal">.&#8221;  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-style:normal">Mr Bailey also pursues a Part 25 application for the appointment of Dr David Elliman, a highly respected immunologist, who for many years was a member of the British Paediatric Association (now the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health). He is one of the editors of the &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:bold">Manual of Childhood Infections</span><span style="font-style:normal">&#8217;, now in its fourth edition. The proposed piece of work, as I understand it, is that Dr Elliman should consider the entire medical histories of each of the children in this family, including T, to evaluate whether there may potentially be any link between their various conditions and childhood immunisations. This would seem to incorporate any link, even with a diagnosed congenital condition. Again, I repeat, Mr Bailey recognises that the research base said to underpin this application has not been disclosed to him by F or, I assume, by M.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-style:normal">I consider the application to be entirely without merit. Certainly it is not a &#8216;necessary&#8217; report, which is the test I have to apply. Moreover, it would of necessity import significant delay at a time when Dr Douglas considers it is important to proceed with the vaccinations. I accept his evidence. There is in reality no base to the application at all. The objections to vaccination fail to withstand scrutiny. Mr Barnes suggests that to elevate and amplify these objections merely serves to have a &#8220;</span>potentially deleterious effect on the broader public consideration of the question of vaccination.<span style="font-style:normal">&#8221; He may very well be right, but that it is not a matter that I weigh in the balance when considering this application. My focus is entirely on T and whether these immunisations are in his best interests. I am satisfied that he is a robust and healthy infant and as such requires this basic and essential preventative healthcare.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-style:normal">Having heard the submissions on behalf of the Local Authority and M, F, at this late stage in the hearing, made three applications. Firstly, he suggested that I recuse myself. This is an application that he has made on two previous occasions, though it requires to be noted that he has also, at different stages of the case, urged me not to transfer the case to another judge. At this hearing, he suggests that I have demonstrated a &#8220;</span>pro-adoption bias<span style="font-style:normal">&#8221; driven by what he perceives to be my &#8220;</span>liberalist Blairite agenda.<span style="font-style:normal">&#8221; This is entirely gratuitous and I need not engage with it. Secondly, F urges me not to appoint a guardian. Thirdly, F objects to any Cafcass involvement, preferring instead an individual appointed by the &#8220;</span>Youth Advocacy Service.<span style="font-style:normal">&#8221; As I understand it, the foundation for this objection lies in F&#8217;s assertion that Mr Edward Timpson, the Chair of Cafcass, is also part of the &#8220;</span>pro-adoption agenda.<span style="font-style:normal">&#8221; Given that the issue at this hearing is confined entirely to the question of immunisation, I asked how F considered the bias he perceives to exist would have an impact, in any event, on this particular question. F did not respond.  </span></p>
