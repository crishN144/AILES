They were brought by M without the knowledge or consent of their father. They have remained in this country ever since.  F sought their return to the Republic. The trial was heard on 24 and 25 May.  Having received evidence from the CAFCASS officer Mr. Lill, and submissions from counsel, the court rejected M&#8217;s two claimed Hague exceptions: (1) child&#8217;s objections (Article 13); (2) grave risk of harm/intolerability (Article 13(b)).  </span></p>

Judgment was formally handed down on the first available date, which was 30 June 2023.  The court ordered the children&#8217;s return to the Republic under the Hague Convention 1980.  However, on the advice of Mr Lill, it delayed the return until the end of the summer term at the children&#8217;s school, where the children have progressed well.  This was a purely welfare-based decision.  Return to the jurisdiction of the Republic was ordered to take place before 23.59 hours on 28 July 2023.</span></p>

The respondent F disputes those assertions.  This judgment rules upon her application.  I emphasise that I deliver the judgment ex tempore as on F&#8217;s case, time is very short and the children should be returned to the Republic of Ireland tomorrow, in accordance with the court&#8217;s previous order.  Indeed, even on M&#8217;s case, while she seeks the set aside, she asks that should her application fail, the return should be delayed for seven days.  Thus, time is of essence.  The court gives its decision today, very soon after the close of submissions, to assist all parties.</span></p>

As applicants are deemed homeless, it is a very quick turnaround so anyone who phones up will be seen as a matter of urgency.&#8221;</p>
