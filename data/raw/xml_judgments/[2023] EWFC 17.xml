They have devoted themselves to him since the day he came to live with them, giving him loving, consistent, attentive care.  He is thriving.  They love him, and long for his place in their family to be secured by an adoption order.</p>

She had discovered her pregnancy at thirty-one weeks.

Both domestic and European law in this area stress the importance of engagement of the wider family in the adoption process.  Any request for an adoption that excludes a father or close family members should be closely scrutinised.  The local authority could not compel C to disclose the birth father&#8217;s identity, but did have a duty both to critically analyse C&#8217;s reasons for refusing to disclose, and if considered appropriate, to make its own independent enquiries as to the birth father&#8217;s identity.  </p>

Although no statistics are available, many children must have been adopted over the years, outside their birth families, and with no knowledge by, or investigation of, other members of the birth family. Adoption exists to serve many social needs. But high among them has been, historically, the desire or need of some mothers to be able to conceal from their own family and friends, the fact of the pregnancy and birth. So far as I know, it has not previously been suggested, nor judicially determined, that that confidentiality of the mother cannot be respected and maintained. If it is now to be eroded, there is, in my judgment, a real risk that more pregnant women would seek abortions or give birth secretly, to the risk of both themselves and their babies&#8230; There is, in my judgment, a strong social need, if it is lawful, to continue to enable some mothers, such as this mother, to make discreet, dignified and humane arrangements for the birth and subsequent adoption of their babies, without their families knowing anything about it, if the mother, for good reason, so wishes.&#8217;</span></p>

The confidential relinquishment of a child for adoption is an unusual event and the reasons for it must be respectfully scrutinised so that the interests of others are protected. In fairness to those other individuals, the account that is given by the person seeking confidentiality cannot be taken at face value. All information that can be discovered without compromising confidentiality should therefore be gathered and a first-hand account from the person seeking confidentiality will normally be sought. The investigation should enable broad conclusions to be drawn about the relative weight to be given to the factors that must inform the decision. </span></p>

I have been told that C takes issue with some of the contents, which she says reflect times when what she has said has been misunderstood, misheard or misconstrued.  At the time she was having those discussions, she did not consider she had to give any explanation for her decision to keep the pregnancy secret, and she was not asked very detailed questions about her reasons, or much about the relationship.  She would have had no idea that the notes would be pored over by lawyers many months later.  In relationships which have been unhappy, unhealthy or abusive, the realisation of that and understanding of the dynamic can happen a long time after the event.  A person who is not describing a relationship negatively when first asked about it is not necessarily mis-describing the relationship, but may not yet have come to such a realisation.  For all these reasons, I approach the case notes with some caution.   </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nevertheless, these notes were made at the time or very shortly after the conversations.  The notes were made in respect of conversations designed to obtain the relevant information (granted there was not as much investigation of the relationship and C&#8217;s reasons for excluding the father as there should have been).  There are some inconsistencies in the notes about the length of the relationship &#8211; it is variously recorded that the relationship lasted two years, two or three years, or four years.  There are various records of her discovering pregnancy at 29, 30 or 31 weeks, she says it was thirty-one.  But I do not know whether these variations record different accounts from the mother, accurately recorded, or inaccurately record consistent accounts from the mother.  There is no actual evidence, let alone evidence that has been tested by cross-examination, from either the  mother or the notes&#8217; authors about their accuracy.  My view is that the extent to which I can go behind their contents is limited.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her witness statement, C recounts how she met the birth father at university.  She initially got to know him through a mutual friend and on social media.  They entered into a relationship in January 2019.  The relationship ended finally in November 2020.  She says that she never felt loved in the relationship, and felt that the birth father&#8217;s behaviour towards her was manipulative.  She said that he could put her down in front of friends, and make her feel worthless.  She said in her statement that she would describe his behaviour as coercive and controlling.  She said if she raised issues with him about his behaviour towards her, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;he would stop speaking to me, ignore me and refuse to engage with me&#8217;.  </span>She said that during the frequent occasions they would break up, the birth father would then have relationships with other women, and blame her for it.  She said that nonetheless she would beg him to take her back.  She says in her statement she is disappointed in herself for allowing him to treat her in that way, but she was only nineteen, and she thought that she was in love.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The description in the witness statement resonates with much of what is shown in the case notes, which are thumb-nail sketches of the relationship.  However, even allowing for the development of understanding of the dynamic over time, the description in the witness statement is more negative and accusatory towards the father than comes across in the notes.  The notes record that C has shown pictures of M to more than one friend, and intended to tell the father once the adoption has taken place.  This conveys a different picture than that put forward in submissions (but not in her witness statement) that she has not shared the information more widely than with her immediate family, and that she never said she intended to tell the father after the adoption.  </p>

It has enabled the adoption to proceed on a more solid foundation than before.  The gaps in M&#8217;s and his carers&#8217; knowledge and understanding of his history and heritage have been filled, and the potential for M to benefit throughout his life from a connection to his birth father as well as his birth mother has been established.</p>

This brings with it the prospect of upheaval, uncertainty, pain and distress for M, and potentially for the prospective adopters if eventually a decision were to be made that M should move live with his father.  Nonetheless, when looking at M&#8217;s interests throughout his whole life, if this were decided to be the outcome that met M&#8217;s welfare needs, then notification would have been justified, and desirable.</p>

In cases where a mother declines to identify a father she may face persuasion, if that is thought appropriate, but she cannot be coerced. In some cases the available information may mean that the father is identifiable, and maternal relatives may also be identifiable. The extent to which identifying information is pursued is a matter of judgement. Conversely, there will be cases where it is necessary to consider whether any confidentiality is likely to endure. In the modern world secrets are increasingly difficult to keep and the consequences, particularly for the child and any prospective adopters, of the child&#8217;s existence being concealed but becoming known to family members later on, sometimes as a result of disclosure by the person seeking confidentiality, should be borne in mind.&#8217;</span></p>

Or the search could be driven by M himself, a need to understand his own life story, to find his birth relatives, to know another person who shares his DNA.  </p>

The birth father has not got parental responsibility, C considers he is likely to support the adoption, and M has now lived his early years happily with the prospective adopters.

The duty is a discretionary one, and is a duty only to make such enquiries as are in the interests of the child.  The interests of the child in that context are to identify and explore the realistic options for the child&#8217;s long-term care.  There may well be circumstances where the enquiry starts and ends with the information provided by the mother.  The local authority is required to examine the information provided by the mother critically, and to decide whether there is any reasonable way by which the identity of the birth father could be established.  In the event of a question arising as to notification and an application being made, the local authority should have obtained for itself information that would enable notification to take place, if that is what the Court directs.</p>

I understand why the guardian says the enquiries should be made, but if I pursued this, I would be making an order not knowing to whom it was addressed, what specifically I was asking for, or how that would achieve the desired result.  Requesting the names and numbers of all [X]s who were studying at [Z University] in the relevant period is likely to give a large number of individuals.  We cannot narrow it down because we have not got [X]&#8217;s second name, date of birth, year of entry, or what he was studying.  It would be a significant exercise to pursue each of those names as a line of enquiry.  There would remain the concerns about breaches of RIPA.  The university may have issues around its own data protection obligations.  There is likely to need to be a hearing attended by a representative from [Z] University, to consider the power I would have to make an order, and its range.  </p>
