	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The wife is aged 27, very nearly 28. She is a citizen of X country and lives in X country.

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The husband is aged 28. He is a citizen of Y, currently living in England. He is a professional footballer, currently playing for Club ABC. He also plays international football for Y country. Prior to the events described below he had a relationship with MS, a Z national, with whom he had a child, LQ (now aged 5) and the husband has now reconciled with MS and is currently living with her and LQ in ABC. The husband also has a child by another earlier previous relationship in Y country, that is SQ (now aged 7). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The parties met and started a relationship in Spring 2019. At that time he was playing football for a team in Z country. The relationship quickly developed and they had a religious marriage ceremony in March 2020 and a civil marriage ceremony in X country on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2020. Very shortly after the marriage the husband was transferred to play for football team in V country. The wife remained living in X country and the parties therefore barely lived together, if at all, though met from time to time at different places around the world.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The wife then became pregnant with the husband&#8217;s child and a child was born of the marriage, that is BD (now aged 3). The wife has always been the primary carer for BD and the husband has thus far had little contact with him, although the wife is in principle happy for contact to take place. On her account, the wife&#8217;s childcare responsibilities have made it very difficult for her to take up remunerative employment since BD was born.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">In June 2022 the husband signed a two-year contract to play football for Club ABC and shortly after that moved to live in ABC in England in a flat funded by his employers. He continues to live in this flat in ABC. This arrangement will come to an end in June 2024, just weeks away. The husband apparently has no contract to play for Club ABC or any other club after June 2024, but it does not necessarily follow that his career is reaching its imminent end and I was told that he is still seeking a new contract somewhere (no details of where or at what remuneration were provided) and continues to aspire to play for Y country as an international footballer. Plainly, however, the duration of a top level football career is very time limited and it is well known that players rarely play beyond their early to mid-thirties at a high level.</p>

On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2023 the husband applied for a stay of these divorce proceedings on jurisdictional and <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens </span>grounds and I dealt with his application on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2024, dismissing his application and permitting the wife to apply for a Decree Nisi forthwith in the English divorce proceedings. There has been no appeal against this decision. Decree Nisi was ordered on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2024. It is reasonable to assume that an application for Decree Absolute will follow as soon as the requisite period of six weeks has passed.</p>

It will be open to the family Court to assess whether the terms of the divorce are unreasonable or not in the best interest of the parties involved, especially if it goes against legal guidelines or public policy (the cost of these proceedings is exorbitant), beyond the H&#8217;s financial affordability, ending in a situation where H can no longer pay his own legal costs and facing destitution within 39 days (2nd  June 2024 when his contract terminates). Additionally, H would no longer be able to stay in the UK since his visa will terminate in July 2024.</span></p>

I reached the conclusion that the husband had simply decided not to cooperate with the court, I sensed probably hoping and believing that by the time the case could be heard he would have left England and escaped the jurisdiction and enforcement powers of the English court.

Like Mr Paxi-Cato in January 2024, it appeared that the main thrust of Ms Cantor-Freedman&#8217;s effort was to get an adjournment of the final hearing. Noting that the wife had had to spend a good deal of money instructing Mr Viney and Solicitors to prepare for a final hearing (&#163;35,000, a very large sum in the context of the dispute, which would be wasted in the event of an adjournment), and fearing the same tactical manipulation that I had feared in January and March 2024, I sought some commitments from the husband to provide some security if I was to allow an adjournment, but nothing significant was forthcoming from him and I made the decision to continue with the final hearing. I recognised that the disclosure process had been sub-optimal, but considered that in all the circumstances, taking into account the overall objective under FPR 2010 Rule 1, it was appropriate to continue with the final hearing. For the purposes of this hearing the wife attended remotely from X country, but the CVP link worked well and cross-examination was not impeded. The wife&#8217;s legal team paid for an English/French interpreter to attend, who worked with skill and speed to interpret for the benefit of both husband and wife, who speak French, but limited English.</p>

The wife is the legal owner of an interest in an apartment (Apartment 437) in City P in X country. The arrangement with the local authority seems to be something between a shared ownership scheme and a local authority mortgage, but in broad terms the property is worth the X country equivalent of c.&#163;150,000, subject to a mortgage &#163;86,928. There would be an additional early redemption charge of &#163;26,063 if the property was sold now, but (to the best of my belief) this will not apply if the mortgage is redeemed now. It has not been suggested that this property does other than meet the needs of the wife and BD at a reasonable level. She needs to pay c.&#163;1,000 per month towards the mortgage in order to keep this accommodation available to her. Alternatively, she needs to reduce or eliminate the mortgage with a capital payment.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">The source of money to purchase this property has been a matter of controversy in this case. The wife&#8217;s case is that in September 2020 the husband gave the wife the equivalent of c. &#163;130,000, the purpose of which was expressed by him to be a gift to her to enable her to put a deposit down on a property in her name and also furnish it and purchase a car. She was suitably grateful and used the money for these purposes, hence the purchase of Apartment 437. The husband has challenged the wife&#8217;s ownership of Apartment 437 in an unusual way. His case in a nutshell is that he did advance money to her, but this was specifically intended to enable her to buy a property for him in his name and that she has fraudulently taken this money from him by purchasing a property in her own name. Not only has he asserted these allegations in these proceedings, but also he has commenced some sort of criminal proceedings in X country, presumably with the intention of displacing the wife from this property, both physically and in ownership terms, and possibly punishing her in addition. As part of this process it appears (perhaps surprisingly) that the X country criminal justice system allows a complainant, in this case the husband, to require a defendant to wear an electronic tag on her leg pending the determination of the dispute. The wife showed me the tag in the course of evidence and it is large and unsightly and no doubt makes many aspects of life difficult. Really the only positive part of the husband&#8217;s presentation before me on 17</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">th</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> April 2024 was that he agreed that he would forthwith make representations to the criminal justice authorities in X country to have this electronic tag removed, but I note that in Ms Cantor-Freedman&#8217;s submissions of 24</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">th</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> April 2024 that he has reneged on even this, now saying &#8220;</span><span class="within-new" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">H is unable to make any decision until he speaks to his solicitor in X country</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">&#8221;.

I am satisfied that the accommodation is needed by her and, in so far as the husband asserts any beneficial interest in the property, that interest should be transferred to the wife to meet her housing needs and I shall make an order to that effect.

I have always taken pride in being a hard worker and I made a good income before I met TQ. As I explained in my statement dated 20 December 2023, the television industry is very saturated in X country and so it is extremely difficult to get work, especially if you have any sort of break in your career. In any event, it is difficult for me to find any work because I care for BD full-time. There is no state benefit system in X country. Even on the days I can take BD to creche it is 3 hours each day in traffic getting him there and collecting him, which obviously impacts my ability to work, and I certainly wouldn't be able to work in my industry.&#8221;</span></p>

He gave no documentary evidence about what was happening in a transport company in Y country in which he had made investments and in one statement described the business in active terms (although later asserting that it was dormant). He misrepresented the number of bank accounts he has in England (the Revolut account information had to be extracted by Third Party Disclosure Order and some information on the available bank statements suggests that there may well be yet undiscovered accounts).

The answer, in my view, is that, when faced with uncertainty consequent on one party's non-disclosure and when considering what Lady Hale and Lord Sumption called "the inherent probabilities" the court is entitled, in appropriate cases, to infer that the resources are sufficient or are such that the proposed award does represent a fair outcome.  This is, effectively, what Munby J did in both Al-Khatib v Masry and Ben Hashem v Al Shayif and, in my view, it is a legitimate approach.  In that respect I would not endorse what Mostyn J said in NG v SG at [16(vii)].   </span></p>

This does not mean, as Mostyn J said in in NG v SG, at [7], that the court should jump to conclusions as to the extent of the undisclosed wealth simply because of some non-disclosure.  It reflects, as he said at [16(viii)], that the court must be astute to ensure that the non-discloser does not obtain a better outcome than that which would have been ordered if they had complied with their disclosure obligations.&#8221;</span></p>

I entirely accept that it is likely that the wife&#8217;s estimates in the early part of the case that the husband was earning or once did earn a figure of c. &#163;3,000,000 per annum were overstated, but it is likely (taking into account what he was doing) that he was a high  earner (running into the hundreds of thousands of pounds per year gross) before 2022 and it has been established that in the football season 2022-2023 the husband earned &#163;384,000 (gross) from Club ABC and that his income in the 2023-2024 season is estimated to turn out to be in the region of &#163;891,600 (gross). Whilst these figures are subject to significant tax deductions, this should have netted the husband a substantial surplus and we have little information as to where this surplus (both before and after 2022) went. His housing costs have been met by Club ABC since 2022 in addition to the salary so his basic costs would have been limited. It is reasonable in my view to infer that significant sums of money were transferred into as yet undisclosed bank accounts overseas and may remain there. It is reasonable to infer that sums of money measured in hundreds of thousands of pounds were used to buy real properties or other investments in Y country or elsewhere. It is reasonable to infer that the husband currently has assets running to a value of many hundreds of thousands of pounds. Beyond that, it is very difficult to make any specific findings about the husband&#8217;s assets. His limited engagement with the disclosure process has prevented this. I am left following the Court of Appeal&#8217;s suggested approach that &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic">the court is entitled, in appropriate cases, to infer that the resources are sufficient or are such that the proposed award does represent a fair outcome.&#8221;</span></p>

It is true, and objectively verifiable, that his appearances with Club ABC have been more limited than expected in the current season and that this will no doubt not be helpful in his ongoing efforts to find a new contract after June 2024, but it is does not follow that a footballer thought good enough to play for Y country internationally recently is finished and, on a balance of probabilities, it is reasonable to suppose that he will earn at a high level (perhaps a few hundred thousand pounds per year gross, but possibly more) for three or four years from now onwards. On retirement from playing football, there are often reasonably lucrative coaching or commentating opportunities, but I accept that it is difficult to make a meaningful assessment of this at this stage. In this respect I reject the husband&#8217;s case that he has virtually no future earning capacity.</span></p>

Beyond that I should make an award which enables the wife to deal with her mortgage without undue hardship by my making a lump sum award and/or a periodical payments award which is sufficient to her (in the context of her proposed spending budget of &#163;5,085 per month, which includes c.&#163;1,000 per month towards her <span class="within-new" style="color:initial">mortgage</span>), affordable to the husband in the context of his chosen profession and which respects the fact that this was a very short marriage in which the parties barely lived together, that the wife is still young, that the majority of the financial contributions were from the husband and that it is reasonable to expect the wife to move towards financial independence of the husband within a reasonable period of time reflecting her abilities and relative youth.</p>

The normal deduction rate was set at &#163;25,000 per month (&#163;21,000 towards legal costs and &#163;4,000 towards MPS) and the protected earnings rate is set at &#163;5,000 per month. This order has extracted payments at the normal deduction rate from the husband&#8217;s monthly salary for the months of January and February 2024. If it is left in place it should extract payments for the husband&#8217;s monthly salary for the months of March, April, May and June (and possibly July) 2024. What happens after that depends on what footballing contract (if any) the husband enters into beyond June 2024.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.25in">Provision should be made for the wife&#8217;s legal costs. I reach this conclusion, despite this being a case where the starting point of no order for costs applies under FPR 2010 Rule 28.3(5), because of the husband&#8217;s litigation conduct which falls within several of the conduct exceptions in FPR 2010, Rule 28.3(7). In calculating what costs order should be made I need to take into account the total costs incurred by the wife (&#163;178,153), but also the fact that I have already made two costs orders (&#163;15,549 and &#163;19,228) and also that I have made LSPO orders (totaling &#163;80,000). The interim costs orders and the LSPO orders still stand and can still be enforced and they therefore have to be deducted from any costs order I make now to avoid double counting. I also need to take into account that, had the husband&#8217;s conduct been appropriate, some level of irrecoverable costs might have occurred. In the circumstances I have decided to make a further inter partes costs order to the effect that the husband will contribute a further &#163;50,000 towards the wife&#8217;s costs, payable within 28 days.</p>
