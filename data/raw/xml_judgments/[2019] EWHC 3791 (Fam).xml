	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">This is an application, after a summary hearing, for the summary return to Zambia of two children who were abducted to England by their mother about seven months ago. Although Zambia has signed the Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction, that state has not been accepted by the United Kingdom as a reciprocating party to it.  Accordingly, the present application cannot be made under the Hague Convention and has been made under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.  All the directions stages of this case took place before the judgment of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">In Re NY (A child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2019/49" uk:canonical="[2019] UKSC 49" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] UKSC 49</ref> was handed down on 30 October 2019.  In the light of that judgment, it might have been more appropriate for the application to have been formulated as an application for a specific issue order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  But, in either case, I must, as I do, make the welfare of the two children the paramount consideration and must, and do, have regard to the checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. </p>

In the case of applications under the Hague Convention, the convention itself, and the jurisprudence in relation to it, applies a very specific approach which requires the return of abducted children to whom the convention applies, unless the limited so-called defences under Article 13 apply. </p>

Apart from the Cafcass officer, Ms Jacqueline Roddy, who is the children&#8217;s guardian, I have not heard any oral evidence at all from either parent or from anyone else. This hearing was not set up as a hearing at which oral evidence would be heard, and there was no time allowed in the listing slot to enable me to do so. So, apart from that evidence of the guardian, which is essentially based on her recent observations of the children during the last month or so, I have not heard a word of oral evidence.  I cannot make any reliable assessments of any of the highly disputed facts.  I cannot make any assessment of the personalities, motivation or integrity of either parent, although they are both personally present.</p>

He is British and was brought up in England, but has lived in Zambia for many years.  He has two elder children from a previous marriage, who currently attend boarding schools in England and whose mother currently lives in England.  The mother of the children with whom I am concerned is aged 40.  She is South African and was brought up there. The parents lived together in Zambia from about 2009, and married in May 2012.

Their younger child, a daughter, A, was born in July 2014 and is now aged about five and a half.  Both children (but not their mother) are British citizens.  It is beyond argument that until late May 2019 the children&#8217;s home all their lives was in Zambia. They lived there and went to school there and had circles of friends there.  Sadly, the parents separated in September 2015, and the mother and children moved from the rented matrimonial home to another home, also rented, very nearby.  The parents have since been divorced in Zambia. </p>

There is, if I may very respectfully say so, a thorough and well-reasoned interim judgment by Bowa J dated 31 August 2016 in which he awarded (on an interim basis) custody, care and control of the </p>

He thus suggests that there are now two fundamental aspects to the fact-finding process which must inevitably now take place, whether here or in Zambia.  The first is whether A has been sexually abused in any way at all and, if so, whether he is the abuser. The second is whether it is the mother, herself, who has influenced A to say the things that she is reported to have said and, if so, what her motivation was and whether, if she has done so, the welfare of the children requires that they now be removed from her primary care to live with him. </p>

Nor do I comment at all upon the quality or reliability of the available written evidence which I have summarised.  But I do observe that if, in this country, doctors had made reports in the terms of those made by Doctors Sampa, Musonda and Goma in July 2018, they would - or should - have triggered an immediate multidisciplinary investigation into whether the child had been in some way sexually abused or interfered with, and if so, by whom.  Very early consideration (within days) would - or should - have been given to whether the child should be ABE interviewed, not in October, but in late July or very early August.  I do not say that a child as young as just four would necessarily have been ABE interviewed, but consideration would clearly have been given to it.  If there was a decision to attempt an ABE interview, it would have been conducted by a specially-trained police officer and/or social worker.  It would have been attempted with the absence of the mother in the room or, at any rate, with no verbal involvement by her, and it would certainly have been video recorded.  None of this was done at that time in Zambia.  Further, it is virtually inconceivable here that unsupervised contact could have been permitted to continue until a thorough investigation and a judicial inquiry had taken place. The previous unsupervised overnight contact would have been restricted by one or more of the intervention of the social services, and/or a court order, and/or bail conditions if the father had been charged with any offence. </p>

They were abruptly abducted from it.  Although their language in both countries is English, there are obviously cultural, environmental and other differences between their home and way of life there and in England.  The rented home in which they were living in Zambia remains available to them and their mother. Their dog remains there. They could  resume their education there (although T would by now have moved to another school) and reconnect with their friends there.  Most importantly, if the children and their mother were once again all living in Zambia, appropriate arrangements could be made for regular contact between them and their father, even if initially supervised.  Further, the Zambian court, and specifically Bowa J, has been - and is - seized of this case and involved with it since 2016. The evidence of the instructed expert, Mandy Manda, indicates that Zambia applies a welfare-based jurisdiction in which the welfare of the child concerned is paramount.  </p>

The bottom line is that for months and months, after evidence was clearly emerging that A may have been the victim of some abusive act or acts by her father, his unsupervised overnight contact was permitted - or even required - to continue, despite strenuous efforts on the part of the mother to engage the authorities and to prevent it.  Despite the raft of undertakings offered by the father, and the proposal that there should be some form of mirror order in Zambia before the children actually return, I currently lack confidence in the robustness of the system there adequately to protect these children. </p>

I stress that I have not heard a word of oral evidence and I make no findings of fact. Threats were made which precede the abduction. As relatively long ago as his statement in Zambia dated 23 October 2018, the father was asserting that the mother &#8220;is not a fit and proper person&#8221; to care for the children and that, in preference to their own mother, they should live with his former wife. It is a hard-hitting statement.  In an email to the mother dated 10 November 2018, the father threatened that, should she continue with any breaches of any court rulings, he would start proceedings for contempt.  On 8 May 2019, the father&#8217;s lawyers in Zambia wrote a very threatening letter to the mother&#8217;s lawyers implying that, unless she unreservedly withdrew her allegations and strictly adhered to the court&#8217;s interim ruling, he would make a formal complaint to the police for offences committed by her and would issue proceedings against her for defamation.  On 24 May 2019, after the abduction, the father clearly caused a Facebook post to the effect that the Zambian police were preparing &#8220;numerous criminal charges&#8221; against the mother relating to her false allegations and mistreatment of her children.  Without making any express findings of fact, I share the mother&#8217;s concern that, if she were now to return to Zambia, she might face an onslaught from the father, both in court and via the police or other authorities, from which the proffered undertakings might not protect her and which she, with no assured availability of legal aid, might find it very hard to contest. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">Third, the mother&#8217;s Queen&#8217;s Counsel, Mr Mark Twomey, told me very solemnly yesterday afternoon that his express instructions are that, if the children are ordered to return, the mother herself is highly unlikely, personally, to return to Zambia. That is not a new position. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">I rose for a time yesterday afternoon and required Mr Twomey to take express up-to-date instructions, stressing the gravity of this whole situation.  After that pause, Mr Twomey repeated the instructions. The guardian, Ms Roddy, doubts that the mother would, in fact, refuse herself to return, and suggests, therefore, that it is no more than a bluff or a threat to manipulate the court.  But Ms Roddy did not specifically discuss these aspects of the case with the mother.  Of course, a court must be very circumspect indeed about assertions of this kind and, in the field of the Hague Convention, it is well established that a parent cannot shield behind their own asserted refusal to return.  But this is not a case pursuant to the Hague Convention.  The mother puts forward clear objective reasons why she considers that the risk to her safety and liberty, if she returns, is just too great. She points to the failure of the police to protect her children.  She points to the many threats made by the father.  She points to the fact that one of the triggering reasons why she fled, when she did, was the summons or invitation to attend the police station later that week, and the advice which was given to her that that may have been a trap and she should not attend. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">At this summary hearing, I cannot be dismissive of this stated position of the mother, and I cannot risk the potentially disastrous outcome of the children being forced to return to a  wholly uncertain and unprotected situation in Zambia without her.  I appreciate that it will be far, far less easy, and certainly more expensive, to conduct a fact-finding hearing here, but in modern times video links are available.  Both parents could, of course, personally attend here and, in my view, the obvious advantages of a fact-finding hearing taking place in Zambia do not begin to outweigh the above concerns.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">For these reasons, I am not persuaded that it is more in the interests of the children to return now to Zambia than to remain here, where they are now relatively settled and where I know them to be safe.  I propose, therefore, to dismiss the application for their summary return. </p>
