	    <p class="p17" style="margin-left:0.5in">Angela Roddy was born on 4 December 1986. In 1999, when only 12 years old, she became pregnant. The putative father was a boy of about the same age who I will refer to as X. The local authority &#8212; it is in south-west England &#8212; began care proceedings on the basis that Angela was beyond the control of her parents. Her pregnancy came to public attention amidst some controversy when it became known that the Roman Catholic church had, as the press reported it, paid her not to abort her baby. The local authority obtained from Bracewell J on 21 September 1999 an order which, amongst other things, protected the identities of both Angela and X. That did not, of course, prevent the Scottish media from publishing stories, albeit that neither Angela nor X nor the local authority were named. (I have been shown the articles published in <span style="font-style:italic">The Scottish Express </span>on 11 October 1999, in the <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish Daily Mail, </span>on 11, 12 and 13 October 1999 and in the <span style="font-style:italic">Daily Record </span>on 12 October 1999. The tenor of the debate at that time is encapsulated in the following headlines: &#8220;Church to pay girl aged 12 to keep her baby;&#8221; &#8220;Was Church right to offer her money?&#8221; &#8220;Prosecute the boy who made my girl of 12 pregnant;&#8221; &#8220;Cardinal&#8217;s cash will buy us pram &#8212; Dad of girl, 12, welcomes church aid.&#8221;) The order made by Bracewell J was replaced by an order made by Johnson J on 26 October 1999 which continued to protect the identities of all those involved.</p>

	    <p class="p18" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 27 January 2000 Angela gave birth to a daughter who I will refer to as Y. The same local authority thereupon began care proceedings in respect of Y. Angela was separately represented in the care proceedings because she did not agree with the guardian&#8217;s views. She was represented by an experienced children&#8217;s solicitor who I will refer to as B. On 25 May 2000 Bracewell J made care orders in relation to both Angela and Y. The care plan for Y was for her adoption; Angela was to remain in foster care. Angela opposed the plan for Y&#8217;s adoption, but on 28 September 2001 a circuit judge made an order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1976</ref> dispensing with her consent. Y was adopted. I know nothing of Y&#8217;s adoptive placement save that she and her adoptive parents live somewhere in England. There is continuing indirect contact between Y and Angela: as recently as 25 November 2003 Angela was sent an update and a photograph of Y.</p>

	    <p class="p18" style="margin-left:0.5in">The orders made by Bracewell J on 25 May 2000 did not long remain secret. On 7 June 2000 a local newspaper published a front-page story under the headline &#8220;School girl to have child put up for adoption.&#8221; The article identified the local authority. On 2 July 2000 the <span style="font-style:italic">Mail on Sunday </span>published a story under the headline &#8220;Distraught girl of 13 must give up her baby.&#8221; The opening paragraph reported that &#8220;A devastated 13-year-old mother went on the run last week in protest after social services took away her baby&#8221;, this being, according to the newspaper, &#8220;her desperate cry for help after she was forced to say goodbye to her five-month-old daughter for the last time&#8221;.

		    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:-0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>&#8220;The tragic story of this family, torn apart by social services and the legal process cannot be told in full: an injunction prevents the parents, who believe an injustice has been done, from speaking out. The future of three generations has been decided by the authorities behind a wall of silence. Social services, who took the girl into care last year, rightly insisted the young mother and teenage father should not be identified. But they have gone further, persuading a High Court judge to issue a draconian gagging order on everyone, including the girl&#8217;s parents.&#8221;</p>

I discharged my brother&#8217;s order and made an order contra mundum in standard form. That order, operative until 4 December 2004 (Angela&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday), was intended to protect the identities of both Angela and X but not &#8212; at least not explicitly &#8212; the identity of Y. But since it restrained the solicitation from a wide range of people of &#8220;any information relating to Angela (other than information already in the public domain)&#8221; it had the indirect, if unintended, effect of also protecting Y from media curiosity. My order provided that anyone affected by the injunction was at liberty to apply to the court on 48 hours notice to vary or discharge the order.</p>

I prefer the view that the jurisdiction is, as Ward LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">re Z </span>and Millett LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Central Television plc, </span>theoretically unlimited, but that as Waite LJ said in the latter case at page 207: &#8220;The courts have nevertheless found it necessary to set self-imposed limits upon its exercise.&#8221; It seems, to me, however, that the limitations so far imposed on its exercise have to be reconsidered in the light of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>. As there is a proper foundation for the court to exercise jurisdiction, the child&#8217;s rights under Article 8 must be taken into account by the court if it is to comply with its obligations under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. It follows that the court is at least entitled to consider the grant of an injunction in cases such as this even if publicity is not directed at the child or his carers and could not be shown to have an adverse effect on the care proceedings, although that will undoubtedly be a significant factor in deciding whether or not an injunction should ultimately be granted.&#8221;</p>

Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8. Article 8 also protects a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. Though no previous case has established as such any right to self-determination as being contained in Article 8 of the Convention, the Court considers that the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees.&#8221;</p>

For, as the Strasbourg jurisprudence recognises, the ability to lead one&#8217;s own personal life as one chooses, the ability to develop one&#8217;s personality, indeed one&#8217;s very psychological and moral integrity, are dependent upon being able to interact and develop relationships with other human beings and with the world at large. And central to one&#8217;s psychological and moral integrity, to one&#8217;s feelings of self-worth, is the knowledge of one&#8217;s childhood, development and history. So amongst the rights protected by Article 8, as it seems to me, is the right, as a human being, to share with others &#8212; and, if one so chooses, with the world at large &#8212; one&#8217;s own story, the story of one&#8217;s childhood, development and history. Man is a sociable being. Long ago Aristotle said that &#8220;He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god&#8221;. More recently, Blackstone observed that, &#8220;Man was formed for society&#8221;. And, somewhat earlier, John Donne had memorably written that, &#8220;No man is an Island ... any man&#8217;s death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind&#8221;. That is what distinguishes mankind from the brute creation. We are able to think and to communicate with each other. We have self-awareness. It is natural for us to want to talk to others about ourselves and about our lives. It is fundamental to our human condition, to our dignity as human beings, that we should be able to do so. This, after all, is why totalitarian regimes seek to silence those who will not conform not merely by taking away their right to speak in public but also by depriving them of human companionship.</p>

Article 8 thus embraces both the right to maintain one&#8217;s privacy and, if this is what one prefers, not merely the right to waive that privacy but also the right to share what would otherwise be private with others or, indeed, with the world at large. So the right to communicate one&#8217;s story to one&#8217;s fellow beings is protected not merely by Article 10 but also by Article 8.</p>

But, as Mr Arnot correctly pointed out, the personal autonomy guaranteed by Article 8 (and, I would add, by Article 10) is necessarily somewhat qualified in the case of a child. For, depending on the circumstances, decision&#8212;making power may rest not with the child but with the child&#8217;s parents or even with the court. I must return to this topic in due course. For the moment I observe only that there may well be cases where a child wishes to go to the media &#8212; wishes, in other words, to avail himself of what he asserts are his Article 10 and Article 8 rights to make public that which would otherwise be private &#8212; whilst his parents, or the court, may think that his interests are better served by asserting his right under Article 8 to keep such matters private.</p>

Hitherto they have been protected by the injunctions successively granted by Bracewell J, by Johnson J and by me. No-one has ever suggested that the order I made on 7 July 2000 is not adequate to protect X&#8217;s rights. No-one is suggesting that it should be varied insofar as it relates to him. Neither ANL nor Angela seeks its discharge or variation. The balancing exercise thus comes down in favour of maintaining the injunction. It suffices to meet X&#8217;s Article 8 rights; it does not impinge disproportionately on Angela&#8217;s rights under Articles 8 and 10, nor on ANL&#8217;s rights under Article 10. To preserve X&#8217;s anonymity, and to restrain the solicitation of information about him either from X or from his family, does not prevent Angela telling her story to the world in the way she wishes to.</p>

To that significant extent the injunction does not prevent there being some interference with X&#8217;s private life. Private matters that he might wish to keep private can enter the public domain, albeit without X being identified as the subject of what is published. There is also, of course, the reality which has to be faced that those who are within X&#8217;s &#8220;inner circle&#8221; will recognise that the story is about him, even if he is not named or otherwise directly identified.

This, as I recognise, means that there will be some interference with X&#8217;s private life: private matters that he might wish to keep private can enter the public domain, albeit without him being identified. But an injunction wide enough to prevent that happening would, in my judgment, interfere disproportionately with Angela&#8217;s rights under Articles 8 and 10 and with ANL&#8217;s rights under Article 10: it would prevent them telling, if they wish, a story which is, in important part, also Angela&#8217;s story and a story in relation to which there is a clear and important public interest. On the other hand, the refusal to grant an injunction in any wider terms, although it involves an interference with X&#8217;s private life, is, in my judgment, an interference with his rights which is in all the circumstances proportionate.</p>

In practice most wise parents&#8217; relax their control gradually as the child develops and encourage him or her to become increasingly independent. Moreover, the degree of parental control actually exercised over a particular child does in practice vary considerably according to his understanding and intelligence and it would, in my opinion, be unrealistic for the courts not to recognise these facts. Social customs change, and the law ought to, and does in fact, have regard to such changes when they are of major importance.&#8221;</p>

In a sense this is merely one aspect of the application of the test that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. It will normally be in the best interests of a child of sufficient age and understanding to make an informed decision that the court should respect its integrity as a human being and not lightly override its decision on such a personal matter as medical treatment, all the more so if that treatment is invasive. In my judgment, therefore, the court exercising the inherent jurisdiction in relation to a 16- or 17-year-old child who is not mentally incompetent will, as a matter of course, ascertain the wishes of the child and will approach its decision with a strong predilection to give effect to the child&#8217;s wishes.&#8221;</p>

Angela may not yet be quite 17 years old but she is a young woman with a mind of her own and, as her solicitor B has said, a mature and articulate young person. We no longer treat our 17-year-old daughters as our Victorian ancestors did, and if we try to do so it is at our &#8212; and their &#8212; peril. Angela, in my judgment, is of an age, and has sufficient understanding and maturity, to decide for herself whether that which is private, personal and intimate should remain private or whether it should be shared with the whole world. She is what Ward LJ described in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Z (A Minor) (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] Fam 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] Fam 1</ref> at p 30 as a &#8220;competent teenager taking [her] story to the press&#8221;.

This is not mere pragmatism, although as Nolan LJ pointed out, any other approach is likely to be both futile and counter-productive. It is also, as he said, a matter of principle. For, as Balcombe LJ recognised, the court must recognise the child&#8217;s integrity as a human being. And we do not recognise Angela&#8217;s dignity and integrity as a human being &#8212; we do not respect her rights under Articles 8 and 10 &#8212; unless we acknowledge that it is for her to make her own choice, and not for her parents or a judge or any other public authority to seek to make the choice on her behalf.</p>

Y,<span style="font-style:italic"/>of course, is too young at this stage to be directly affected by anything in the media. What basis is there for believing that Y may be affected in such a way as to justify, let alone necessitate, any more stringent protective regime? Looking to what <span style="font-style:italic">is </span>known about Y and her adoptive placement, he asks rhetorically what reason there is to be fear that her adoptive parents will be at all troubled by reading Angela&#8217;s story, let alone so troubled as to put the placement under any real stress or in some other, as yet wholly unarticulated, way, as to be even the unwitting cause of any harm or damage to Y. In the nature of things it is reasonable to imagine that they will, as part of the adoption process, already know most of what there is to know. Moreover, it is equally reasonable to suppose that they are familiar with the previous English media publicity.</p>

For even if the local authority was able to make good the factual assertion for which it contends &#8212; the risk to the stability of the adoptive placement &#8212; the balance in all probability would still come down in favour of Angela and ANL.</p>

	    <p class="p25" style="margin-left:0.5in">The last part of the local authority&#8217;s case is the assertion that the injunction which I accept requires to be granted if Y&#8217;s rights are to be adequately protected should be extended so as to prohibit the identification of the local authority. Correctly it disavows any desire to protect its own anonymity. But it says that identification of it as being the local authority involved may increase the risk of Y and her adoptive parents being identified, if not by the world at large then by those who if not part of Y&#8217;s &#8220;inner circle&#8221; are within what might be described as her &#8220;outer circle,&#8221; and may thus increase the risk of the adoptive placement being destabilised.</p>

	    <p class="p25" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was certainly not persuaded that this was so. But, somewhat against my better judgment I was persuaded that, notwithstanding <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12(3)</ref>, there was just enough in the point to justify the grant of an injunction for a strictly limited period so as to enable the local authority to explore this aspect of the case further. I have to say that the opportunity for further reflection on the point over the intervening weekend has made me doubt whether I should have adopted this course, not least bearing in mind the fact that, as I have already mentioned, the local authority has already been identified in a local newspaper. As at present advised I incline to the view that I should not in fact have granted the local authority even this limited relief. But since the matter may yet come back in front of me I propose to say no more about it.</p>

	    <p class="p25" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one final matter I must deal with. Mr Arnot invited me to make an order requiring ANL to file with the court and serve on the local authority a copy of each article that it proposes to publish. I would in any event have declined to do so. I am not aware of any case in which such an order has been made and I can think of no case other than <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (A Minor) (Wardship: Restrictions on Publication) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 WLR 100" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 WLR 100</ref> in which a newspaper has volunteered an article in draft.

A judge can assess what is lawful or unlawful, A Judge in the Family Division may be called on to assess whether some publication is sufficiently harmful to a child as to warrant preventing it. But judges are not arbiters of taste or decency. As Neill LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (A Minor) (Wardship: Restrictions on Publication) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 WLR 100" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 WLR 100</ref> at p 104:</p>

	    <p class="p24" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>It is not the function of the judges to legitimise &#8220;responsible&#8221; reporting whilst censoring what some are pleased to call &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; reporting. The days are past when the business of the judges was the enforcement of morals. A judge, although it may be that on occasions he can legitimately exercise the functions of an aedile, is no censor. And as the Strasbourg jurisprudence establishes (see <span style="font-style:italic">Harris v Harris, Attorney-General v Harris </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 895" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 895</ref> at para [373]), the freedom of expression secured by Article 10 is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received, or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any section of the community. Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed. It is not for the court to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists. Article 10 entitles journalists to adopt a particular form of presentation intended to ensure a particularly telling effect on the average reader. As Neill LJ recognised, a tabloid newspaper is entitled to tell the story in a manner which will engage the interest of its readers and the general public. If there is no basis for injuncting a story expressed in the temperate or scholarly language of a legal periodical or the broadsheet press there can be no basis for injuncting the same story simply because it is expressed in the more robust, colourful or intemperate language of the tabloid press.</p>

	    <p class="t72" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There remains the question of costs. Each side sought at least a partial order for costs against the other. Neither side has been completely successful. And the fact is that ANL would have been put to the cost of appearing before the court even if the matter had been wholly unopposed. Subject to any further submissions that either party may wish to make I propose to direct that there should be no order as to costs.</p>

	    <p class="p25" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 3 December 2003 the local authority informed ANL and the court that it was not seeking any further order. Accordingly the injunction contained in paragraph 6(i) of the order I had made on 28 November 2003 expired by effluxion of time at 4pm on 4 December 2003. It follows that there is no longer any reason why the local authority should not be named. It is in fact Torbay Borough Council.</p>
