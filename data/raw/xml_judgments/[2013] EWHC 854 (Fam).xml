She became pregnant again and gave birth to D on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2004. The father&#8217;s name was registered and appeared on D&#8217;s birth certificate.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The relationship between the parents was turbulent and they separated at the end of 2005. Following the separation, the mother&#8217;s two elder daughters, A and C, then aged about 10 and 9, told her that they had been sexually abused by the father but afterwards retracted the allegations. The parties were reconciled and the father moved back into the family home. Subsequently, however, after the girls repeated their allegations, the police were informed, and interviewed the girls under the Achieving Best Evidence procedure. The father was arrested and charged with a series of sexual offences involving both girls. </p>

He also noted that the medical records disclosed that the father had alleged he had been sexually abused by a member of his family. Dr Obuaya concluded, however, that the father did not suffer from any form of mental impairment.</p>

He subsequently received a custodial sentence of four years imprisonment. In passing sentence, the learned judge said inter alia:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;When children are harmed in this way within a family, a grave breach of trust is always involved. However, the circumstances relating to C involve particularly despicable exploitation by you of the situation in which you found yourself. At the time when you sexually assaulted C, her mother was coping with the demands of your new born son and suffering from depression. She was in no state to protect her daughters, a situation which obviously provided you with opportunities to be alone with C.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2011, the mother filed an application for an order terminating the father&#8217;s request for parental responsibility. Directions were given by District Judge Hurley on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2011. At that hearing, the father stated that he was innocent of all charges in respect of A and C. The District Judge listed the final hearing in November 2011 and made further directions. Shortly before the hearing in November, the father filed an application for a specific issues order requiring the mother to provide annual updating reports on D&#8217;s progress, including photographs, school reports and details of any medical problems and treatment. At the hearing on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, District Judge Weintroub decided that the matter should be transferred to the High Court because the application to terminate parental responsibility appeared to involve a new or unusual point of law. Thus the matter came before me in March 2012. I concluded that a further psychological report on the father was necessary to enable me to determine the application and I therefore gave permission to the father to instruct Mr Roy Shuttleworth, a consultant clinical psychologist, to prepare a report assessing inter alia whether the father posed any risk to D in the light of his criminal convictions and psychological profile. </p>

I shall consider this assessment, and Mr Shuttleworth&#8217;s oral evidence, later in this judgment. At this stage, I merely record that the father maintained throughout the assessment that he was innocent of all the charges involving A and C and that he only pleaded guilty in order to spare the girls the ordeal of giving evidence. When the matter came before me in July 2012, however, the father accepted through his counsel that the convictions &#8216;are true convictions and he does not invite the court to reconsider those convictions&#8217;. I therefore listed the matter for a further hearing before me in February 2013. </p>

In practice, an unmarried father cannot register the birth without the mother&#8217;s consent. Thus, the amended provision can be seen as an extension and simplification of the existing provisions which enable unmarried fathers to acquire parental responsibility under a parental responsibility agreement entered into with the mother. What is particularly notable, however, is that Parliament has chosen to leave in place the provision, now contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref> (2A), for an unmarried father who has acquired parental responsibility in any of the circumstances in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4 (1)</ref> to be deprived of that responsibility by order of the court. </p>

I think the continuation of a parental responsibility agreement in favour of the father in this case has considerable potential ramifications for future adversity to this child. I believe it would be a message to others that he has not forfeited responsibility, which to my mind it would be reasonable to regard him as having done. I believe that it might be deeply undermining to the mother and her confidence in the stability of the world surrounding (the child).&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In an attractively presented argument on behalf of the father, Miss Townshend submits that this court should be cautious about following this authority in this case for the following reasons. First, it is an authority at first instance dating from nearly twenty years ago which was decided before the amendment of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref> introduced by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. Miss Townshend submits that, as demonstrated by that amendment, the importance of extending parental responsibility to unmarried fathers has become much more widely accepted since 1995. In those circumstances, the court should be more wary about removing parental responsibility from those on whom it has been bestowed by law. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, Miss Townshend submits that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref>(2A) is incompatible with articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms since it discriminates against unmarried fathers in a way that infringes their rights to family life. On this point, Miss Townshend faces a difficulty in the form of a decision of the European Court of Human Rights, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Smallwood v UK</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1999) 27 EHRR 155" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">(1999) 27 EHRR 155</ref>. In that case, the European Court considered whether the termination of an unmarried father&#8217;s parental responsibility by an English court was in breach of Article 8 and Article 14. The father submitted that he was discriminated against by having his parental responsibility terminated by virtue of his marital status and by virtue of his sex since there is no power whereby an unmarried mother&#8217;s parental responsibility can be terminated. The court accepted that the father&#8217;s Article 8 rights were engaged but concluded that there was no breach of his rights either on the basis of his marital status or of his gender. As to marital status, the court commented:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In particular, the Commission notes that notwithstanding the apparently wide definition of &#8216;parental responsibility&#8217; in section 3(1) of the Children Act, it does not necessarily entail contact rights, as evidenced by the applicant&#8217;s position after those rights have been rescinded. The Commission recalls that in its 1986 report the Law Commission considered that, if courts were unable to rescind parental responsibility orders when this is found to be in the best interests of the child, they would be reluctant to make such orders and mothers would be more likely to oppose their provision. Moreover, the Commission recalls that parental responsibility may be granted again should a further request be made by the applicant. Having regard to the margin of appreciation according to Contracting States, the Commission therefore, considers that the difference in treatment between married and unmarried fathers with respect to the rescission of parental responsibility has an objective and reasonable justification. As a result, no appearance of a violation of article 8 in conjunction with article 14 of the Convention is disclosed. &#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Notwithstanding the articulate way in which Miss Townshend put her legal submissions, I am in no doubt that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re P</span>, whilst not strictly binding on this court, is a clear authority which points the way to be followed by the court considering its powers under what is now <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref>(2A). Singer J held that there is a presumption that, once granted, parental responsibility should not lightly be withdrawn, that the burden of proof rests firmly with the applicant mother, and that, in considering such an application, the court should apply section 1 of the Children Act and give paramountcy to the child&#8217;s welfare. Those principles seem to me to be unimpeachable. Furthermore, I endorse Singer J&#8217;s approach, when faced with an application to terminate parental responsibility, of considering the extent to which the well-established criteria for making parental responsibility orders would be satisfied. I am not persuaded that the statutory changes introduced by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> should be interpreted as narrowing the scope of the court&#8217;s powers under what is now <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref>(2A). On the contrary, it is, as I have already observed, notable that Parliament expressly extended the existing court power to terminate parental responsibility to include those fathers who acquire parental responsibility via registration. In doing so, Parliament clearly decided to put such fathers into the same category as other unmarried fathers who have acquired parental responsibility by agreement or court order, rather than into the same category as married fathers. Finally, I am wholly unpersuaded that the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Smallwood</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/>is no longer good law. On the contrary, it seems to me that its conclusions remain firmly in line with the current legal and social context of unmarried fathers. Accordingly, I reject Miss Townshend&#8217;s argument that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref>(2A) is incompatible with articles 8 and 14 of the Convention.</p>

In the papers, there is a reference to a comment which he is said to have made to a mental health nurse in the presence of his mother in 2008 in which he is said to have admitted at least part of the allegations made by A and C. When interviewed and later charged, however, he denied the allegations and maintained that denial until the third day of the trial when he pleaded guilty shortly before the girls were due to give evidence. In his two statements in these proceedings, he was silent about the truth of the allegations. During his assessment by Mr Shuttleworth, he maintained that he only pleaded guilty to spare the girls the ordeal of giving evidence. As set out above, at the hearing in July 2012, he indicated through counsel that he accepted the convictions were true convictions and that he would not seek to challenge them in these proceedings. At this hearing, however, he has reverted to his previous position that all the allegations are untrue. In cross-examination, he said that he believed the girls had made up the allegations because they were hurt that he had left their mother. He explained his earlier statement about not challenging the convictions by saying that he accepted that he was guilty &#8216;in the eyes of the law&#8217;.

I believe I am realistic in my expectations and I have never attempted to frustrate the decisions that [the mother] makes in relation to his every day life. At present, I know that I cannot have any form of contact with D as this would be a breach of my licence conditions but I would still like to have the opportunity to maintain a relationship of some form with him and I think this is important for him too. In particular, I want to know how he is doing in life, how his education and health and, for example, whether he needs any serious medical treatment. I would only ask for any updates on how D is doing in life and nothing more at this stage. If I was to apply for direct contact in the future, I would happily take advice from for example, the Local Authority or CAFCASS about what is in D&#8217;s best interests. My parents would also like to be able to maintain a relationship with him&#8230;&#8221;</p>

Of course, I am in no position to decide whether or not that statement is true.

I listened to that evidence with increasing concern. I regret to say that I have found his opinions na&#239;ve, complacent, unreliable and at times misleading. His reluctance to accept the convictions as the factual basis for his assessment was a dereliction of his duty as an expert witness. His statement in his report that there was no evidence of any &#8220;deviations&#8221; was simply untenable given the existence of the convictions for ten offences of sexual abuse. His various statements about paedophiles quoted above runs contrary to all the understanding about the dangerous and deceitful behaviour of paedophiles which this court has come across many times over the years. His assessment of risk was, in my view, worthless, and I reject it. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgement, the magnetic factors in this case are D&#8217;s emotional needs, the harm he has suffered, and the risk of future harm. As a result of the turbulence and disruption endured by this family during the mother&#8217;s relationship with the father, and the period leading up to the father&#8217;s criminal trial, all members of the family, including A, C, the mother and D have suffered harm of varying sorts and to a varying degree. So far as D is concerned, whether or not he witnessed the father perpetrating any abusive acts on A, I accept that he has suffered emotional harm as a result of the harm inflicted by the father on other members of his family. I accept that, because of his parentage, D&#8217;s position in the family is difficult and that there is a risk of his suffering further harm and stigma if he continues to be perceived and treated in any way as the son of this man who perpetrated acts of sexual abuse on his older siblings.</p>

Equally, given all the harm that the father has inflicted on the family, I accept that the mother would find it well-nigh impossible to send a regular report to him concerning D&#8217;s progress.

On the other side of the scales, I take into account the fact that, as part of his background, D is the biological child of the father, and that as an aspect of his emotional needs he, like every child, should grow up with some understanding of his origins and, whenever possible, a relationship with each biological parent. But in certain circumstances those needs must give way to more important considerations, in particular, the need for emotional security. I conclude that D&#8217;s emotional security would be imperilled were the father to continue to have any further involvement in his life. Equally, whilst acknowledging that as an aspect on their respective Article 8 rights, both D and his father have a family life together, that aspect is in this case outweighed by D&#8217;s overriding need, as part of his Article 8 rights, to security within his family.</p>

On the contrary, and notwithstanding the factual differences between the two cases, I find that it provides invaluable guidance. Following Singer J&#8217;s example, I look to see to what extent the well established factors for making parental responsibility orders would be satisfied in this case. I accept that, although the father showed a degree of commitment to D when living in the household, that was wholly undermined by his actions in perpetrating serious sexual abuse on A and C, and this has been compounded by his subsequent denials up to the third day of the trial and renewed assertions that he is not guilty. So far as attachment is concerned, whilst there was undoubtedly some degree of attachment between D and his father when he was a baby, there is no attachment now as he has not had any contact for several years. As indicated above, I find there is force in the mother&#8217;s concerns that the father is motivated by wishing to become more involved in D&#8217;s life, to the detriment of the family including D. As in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re P</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">,</span> I find that, if the father did not have parental responsibility, it is inconceivable it would now be granted to him, and that this is a factor I should take into account when considering this application to terminate his parental responsibility. Furthermore, like Singer J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re P</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">, </span>I find that in this case there is no element of the bundle of responsibilities that make parental responsibility which this father could in present or foreseeable circumstances exercise in a way which would be beneficial for D. </p>

Whilst I appreciate that [the mother] may feel a level of anxiety about the disclosure of such a letter at some point in the future, I think it important for her to both acknowledge and accept that D is likely at some point to seek information regarding his natural father and such a letter may assist him to understand and come to terms with the events his family have experienced.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, it has been suggested on behalf of the mother and by the CAFCASS officer that I should consider making an order under section 91(14) of the Children Act preventing any further applications by the father for any order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> without leave of the court. Although I am terminating the father&#8217;s parental responsibility, that does not prevent him from applying for contact because <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/10/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> provides that a parent is entitled to apply for any <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> order as of right.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have, however, decided against making such an order in this case. The authorities, notably the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re P (Section 91(14) Guidelines) (Residents and Religious Heritage)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 573" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 573</ref>, specify that the power to make such orders is to be used with great care and sparingly. Furthermore, the issue only arose in the course of the hearing and has not been fully argued before me. I do, however, direct that any application by the father for an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of the Children Act in respect of D should, in the first instance, be transferred to the High Court and listed before me if available to determine the course of any such application.</p>
