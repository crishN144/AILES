And I am asking the court to order FT  to confirm a correspondence address so that the section in the children act order that enables me to correspond with the children is fulfilled and I am asking the court to remind FT that he must offer the letters to the children, and if they do not want them, to save them for a future time when they wish to read them.&#8221;</span></p>

The circumstances of the separation involved a heightened discussion or disagreement between them.  Unusually, both parents recorded it and transcripts prepared by both appear within the bundle.  There is no doubt that as part of that discussion the father was insisting that the mother leave the family home in W.  She did so and in the following days there were various exchanges of messages between the parties in respect of child arrangements in particular.  The mother&#8217;s case now is that the father had started in earnest a campaign of distancing the children from her.</span></p>

That application was issued by the mother on 12&#160;July&#160;2019.  A hearing took place on 17&#160;July at which both parents were represented.  The court made a shared care order and set out dates when the children would live or otherwise spend time with each parent.  The terms of that order provided that both children should accompany the mother on a pre-arranged holiday to Canada.  The provisions in that order, including those relating to the holiday, appear to have been opposed by the father.  There is photographic evidence from that period at p.77 onwards of the bundle, including of the holiday to Canada.</span></p>

The mother arranged that.  They went to the father, however, the children were not returned.  In messages exchanged between the parents at the time the father sought to rely on what he asserted were the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings.  He sent the mother a text which indicated he had approached the police for advice.</span></p>

The children have been in his care since 5&#160;October.  He has failed to facilitate any direct or indirect contact with me and says to me through text message he will not do so.  This happened previously with B upon separation.  DJ Bosman heard FT&#8217;s case put by his lawyer&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;but made a shared and equal care order.  That order was continued by the consent of both of us at the last hearing on 4&#160;September.  The children have been living happily in a shared and equal care arrangement for the last nearly three months.  However, FT recruits the children to take sides in our marital breakdown, to feel responsible for him&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;and to reject and blame me.  He then says that they don&#8217;t want to see me and he won&#8217;t make them and they feel unable to go against his line.  This behaviour increased significantly last week.&#8221;</span></p>

During that period two police officers attended her property and, in summary, removed the children and took them to the father&#8217;s home.

Superficially, father appears more able to promote a positive relationship with mother and reports that he has repeatedly encouraged the children to have contact with her.  However, at times, his account of this promotion of mother appeared to take on the quality of a threat to the children.  Perhaps to an extent, father may make the offer of living with mother with the best of intentions, but it might be experienced as a threat that there is an alternative to living with him.  In this sense of course, the intended promotion of mother may in fact reinforce behaviours in which the children remain oriented towards and close to father and perhaps communicate to him some degree of their idealisation of him.&#8221;</span></p>

The information from the agencies is concerning that the level of fear that is described by Mr&#160;T, including the need to go into hiding and have support from an IDVA, is not balanced with the information given by [him] that [the mother] last sent H an online message at Christmas.

The section 7 reports that Ms&#160;T has claimed the children have been alienated against her, and [the father] suggests the children have been exposed to verbal abuse.  It is clear there are significant underlying issues within this family, however, having read the historical papers for the previous proceedings, I am worried by the level of distress and anxiety the children are experiencing regarding their mother, and question if this is proportionate considering the historical information and the current allegations.  The children&#8217;s involvement within proceedings is a further concern, and their perception of the situation is worrying . . . I would suggest the narrative that Mr&#160;T is providing for the children is not safeguarding them, but rather is exacerbating their mental health and causing them to live in fear and instability.  I am concerned the children remain very involved within the court process and are being continually exposed to adult matters throughout the court.  There are no findings of fact concerning Ms&#160;T&#8217;s alleged abusive behaviour, and both historic and current allegations are not suggestive of the family&#8217;s need to live in a refuge.&#8221;</span></p>

Most family judges have, for some time, regarded the label of &#8216;parental alienation&#8217;, and the suggestion that there may be a diagnosable syndrome of that name, as being unhelpful.  What is important, as with domestic abuse, is the particular behaviour that is found to have taken place within the individual family before the court, and the impact that that behaviour may have had on the relationship of a child with either or both of his/her parents.  In this regard, the identification of &#8216;alienating behaviour&#8217; should be the court&#8217;s focus, rather than any quest to determine whether the label &#8216;parental alienation&#8217; can be applied.&#8221;</span></p>

There is, in my view, something of a disconnect, and a need to explain the difference, between what the mother actually said and why H understood or perceived it in the way he clearly did.  Importantly, Ms&#160;F also said that the children, this time around in particular, do not feel listened to and they have perceived this application by their mother as one for direct contact.  Pausing there, that is, as Ms&#160;F fairly acknowledged, an error that appears both in her main report and in the safeguarding letter: the mother has not, I record in clear terms, at any time in this application sought or suggested any direct contact.  These matters are important because, as I have indicated, the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings are a factor.  It is also important, in my view, because they are the sorts of matters that a primary carer that genuinely wanted to support and allow some form of relationship with the other parent might be expected to be able to correct, explain or clarify, and otherwise deal with.  </span></p>

There was considerable analysis around various different explanations for the children&#8217;s very troubling presentation.  It is, in my view, telling, that of the five options she referred the court to one of the reasons for family therapy being rejected was the father being unlikely to engage, or engage meaningfully.  It is clear that her view at that time was that in various respects, and evidenced by a number of comments made by the children themselves and the father, that alienating behaviours were at play.

As will probably already be apparent from what I have said thus far, the answer to that question is: plenty.  Chronologically, whether or not the father was planning an exit strategy from this relationship with the children remaining in his care, matters start with the audio recording of the conversation that took place.  No criticism has been offered by the father or on his behalf of anything that the mother said or did during the course of it.  The transcripts both confirm that she in fact said very little and I accept, for reasons that I have already set out, Miss&#160;Bundell&#8217;s characterisation of the father&#8217;s approach as controlling, coercive, gaslighting, bullying and materially misleading in so far as comments that he ascribed at the time to the police and the local authority.  For the avoidance of doubt, I reject the notion and do not find that either the police or social services at that stage, and based only on the report of one parent, had decided either that the children should remain in their father&#8217;s care or, indeed, not see their mother at all or very much.</span></p>

There has been the creation of a world where the dominant emotions in these children around their mother should be fear and panic and it seems, from one comment R made in her &#8216;testimonial,&#8217; even a threat to their life.  That is and has been profoundly abusive to them and it is difficult now to see what can be recovered for these obviously damaged children.

For the most part those are matters that are all so easily capable of proof.  He said to her in the conversation on separation that he has been recording the children.  He wrote in the warning letter in 2022 that he has kept the letters and parcels as proof.  As I have said, on the morning of day two, a short bundle of somewhere around 15 messages over the space of more than a year or two was submitted.  That absence of evidence makes clear, in my judgment, that his allegations are false.  The evidence does not come close to making good his claims about the volume of correspondence and I bear in mind, as I say, his failure to prove that central allegation must be seen in the context of it being an allegation that could so easily have been proved had the evidence actually existed.  </span></p>

The observations that I have made cannot possibly fairly be characterised all as elements of subconscious feelings by the father or said simply to be an unfortunate consequence of an understandable reaction to anything.  The father&#8217;s focus has been, as it was in the 2019 proceedings and as it has been throughout his written and oral evidence, vilifying the mother and not looking at taking a problem-solving approach to achieving some reconciliation.  </span></p>

He sought to justify and explain a lot of his behaviour by reference to what occurred in the past between the mother and the children and matters of which he was unaware.  I do not accept that explanation at all and there is left a simple marked inconsistency between this father who says at separation that there should be a shared care arrangement and the situation in which the children find themselves now.  It cannot possibly be grounded in matters relating to the more distant history, matters in their childhood of which he was left completely unaware.  He intimated, after all, in the discussion that took place at separation that she may never see them again.  He left, in my judgment, that threat hanging and that, of course, is what has come to pass.</span></p>

On a superficial level it is easy to say that those occasions when she acknowledges placing herself in sight of the children and in particular in the crowd on H&#8217;s prom night and taking the risk that he may have seen her at the J concert was unwise, whether or not based on advice from a therapist at the time and, particularly with the benefit of hindsight, it was only likely to have one consequence.  I am, however, persuaded by Miss&#160;Bundell&#8217;s submission that this situation has represented little more than a Hobson&#8217;s Choice for the mother and in particular I bear in mind that those latter events only took place in 2022, that is two and a half years on from the 2020 order.  The mother must have known or suspected what was likely to happen and was taking a serious risk by playing into the father&#8217;s hands, but of course at the same time had the only other option facing her of completely walking away from her children entirely.  That may have been too big an ask but of course, save for indirect contact, it is what the mother had proposed in the 2020 order.</span></p>
