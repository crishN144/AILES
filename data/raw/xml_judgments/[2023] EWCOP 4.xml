H prefers to be referred to by female pronouns. Though H has considered undergoing treatment for the purpose of modifying her sexual characteristics, she has recently indicated that she does not want to pursue this at present. H has, in her childhood, experienced very considerable trauma including parental neglect and severe abuse, at a very young age. In her mid-teens, in very distressing circumstances, she experienced the abrupt cessation of a long-term foster placement and subsequent loss and reduction of contact with key members of her foster family. The pain of this breakdown remains raw. Between 2019 and 2021, H experienced 5 changes of placement. She moved to her present home some time ago where she is, manifestly, settled and extremely well supported by the staff. Their professionalism and sensitivity have generated an atmosphere in which H has made a level of progress which has surprised and delighted everybody. </span></p>

Each of these is a consequence of H&#8217;s traumatic and abusive childhood. H also has traits of autism spectrum condition, extremely disordered attachment and highly disrupted emotional regulation. At times when &#8216;dysregulated&#8217;, H&#8217;s behaviour has been extreme and presents harm, both to herself and others. </span></p>

This too almost certainly arises in consequence of the nature of the abuse she experienced, which has distorted her sexual template. In the opinion of a highly experienced psychiatrist, instructed in these proceedings, H presents a real risk of sexual harm to children, both in contact with them and online. There has been some discussion concerning the nature and extent of this risk but it is sufficient to say that it is a risk which is plainly very serious and requires vigilant monitoring. There is an ongoing investigation by the police relating to H&#8217;s possession of indecent images of minors on her laptop. </span></p>

Internal CCTV is installed, save for in the bathroom and bedroom. She is presently supervised on a 2:1 ratio. Until relatively recently, she had 3:1 supervision, although this proved unnecessary after a change to a placement more suited to her needs. H is only permitted access to the community with supervision. When in her bedroom, H is checked every hour. She is not allowed unsupervised access to the internet or electronic devices. She is also restricted from use of items which might be dangerous (e.g., knives). This level of supervision and restriction on her liberty has endured for over 3 years. Under this profoundly restrictive regime, H has progressed strikingly well. There has been a very significant reduction in the incidents of violent behaviour. </span></p>

The psychiatrist was plainly concerned, as am I, that H has become so used to these arrangements that far from feeling them to be invasive of her privacy, she has come to regard them as integral to her safety and security. When the psychiatrist prepared her first report, H&#8217;s circumstances were very different. There had been incidents of her striking out at others, destroying property, self-harming, threats of suicide. Physical restraint had been used where necessary. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.35in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">One of the great advantages of H&#8217;s living arrangements is that it is supported by a multi-disciplinary team. Dr S has repeatedly emphasised this and has been impressed by the therapeutic impact of a care setting which is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;stable, containing, consistent&#8230; where she knows and trusts staff and where she feels safe&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. Dr S identified </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;meaningful activity&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> which has developed a sense of purpose for H, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;crucial to her recovery and development&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. I record here that H has engaged with all the suggested activities both with great enthusiasm and obvious pleasure. In her oral evidence, Dr S wished to emphasise the fact that H is not yet 19 years of age. She is also, Dr S said, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;young for her age&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and still requires time and space </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;to mature&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. Dr S considered that the period between now and 25 years is an important one for H. Having emphasised H&#8217;s achievements, it is also important that I highlight that a great many difficulties remain. By way of example, only a few weeks ago, H became dysregulated and aggressive which culminated in her assaulting a staff member. H has since pleaded guilty to a charge of assault. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.35in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In evidence, Dr S told me that in her traumatic life, H has identified women as more likely to support and be kind to her. Her carers are women. Dr S considered that H was far more wary of men. I note also that H has formed an obviously good relationship with her female solicitor, which has been very effective for her in these proceedings, and I suspect, more widely. H&#8217;s solicitor has, in a very real way, managed to ensure that H&#8217;s voice has been heard loudly and clearly. I record that at H&#8217;s request, I met with her in chambers. Also present was H&#8217;s solicitor and her two support workers. A note of that meeting was taken. I found H to be articulate, well-mannered and funny. I enjoyed meeting with her. With her solicitor&#8217;s prompting questions, H covered a broad range of topics with, what I considered to be, a high level of candour. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.35in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr S has speculated that H&#8217;s self-identification as a woman may be deeply rooted in her trust of women and reflective of a wish to be close to and accepted by them. When I met H, she was entirely supported by women, relaxed and happy but also very respectful. I found Dr S&#8217;s view on this point both thoughtful and persuasive, in the context of H&#8217;s wider psychological landscape as it has been described to me, particularly, her difficulties in forging secure attachments. H engaged well with a specialist family service assessment which analysed her sexuality and behaviour. </span></p>

In effect, it is the gateway to this court process. Unless the presumption of capacity is rebutted, the Court has no jurisdiction. In very rare cases, resort may be had to the Inherent Jurisdictional powers of the High Court but the application of that jurisdiction is limited. It does not arise here. Ms Roper KC, acting on behalf of the Official Solicitor, has tested the evidence in relation to capacity in the spheres of residence/care/support. She tells me that H does not like to be perceived as incapacitous. This is an entirely natural reaction and I understand it. There is no doubt that H expresses views on these key issues of residence and support which are, superficially, consonant with an understanding of the issues involved. Certainly, as I have commented, H accepts this rigorous regime as linked to her welfare and acquiesces to it. However, Dr S remained very clear that H has not yet achieved capacity, although she considered that H was progressing towards it. </span></p>

She gave oral evidence on the morning of the second day. </span></p>

In doing so, I can, confidently, lean on the case law identified in Ms Roper&#8217;s helpful skeleton argument. I think it would be helpful to have the relevant law, relating to issues which arise regularly in the Court of Protection, accessible in one judgment. Also, because I know that H&#8217;s solicitors will take her through the judgment, I think it important that she sees the effort and care that has been taken for her, by all the professionals, to respect her autonomy as an individual. </span></p>

Following the family service assessment, H has been able to speak more openly about this. This honesty is regarded as a positive indicator for progress and change. H&#8217;s commitment to the various activities arranged, some with therapeutic objectives, is also reflective of her resolve to achieve a more stable life for herself. H tries to apply the techniques and strategies that she was guided towards in the assessment. She states that she has learned to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;put a barrier or brick wall up at times&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> to prevent her from thinking in sexual terms about underage children. Dr S pays tribute to H&#8217;s determination and effort but again, emphasises that H is still only 18 and has years left in which she will have to continue to work through her sexual thoughts and the impact of sexual abuse on children. As I understand Dr S&#8217;s evidence, to some degree the &#8216;barrier&#8217; that H erects sometimes requires to be taken down in order that the reality of the potential risk of harm that she represents is confronted more critically by her and better understood. In August 2022, the psychiatrist has assessed H as presenting </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;an extremely high risk of sexual offending against children. If she is not continuously supervised, it is almost inevitable that she will commit sexual offences against children, and there is a substantial risk that this could be contact offences&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Ms Roper has, in testing the evidence, sought to dislodge that evaluation of risk and, in particular, the conclusion of the psychiatrist. </span></p>

She also speculated that H&#8217;s accounts might, in some way, be a false memory, perhaps based in her own experiences. This, with respect to Ms Roper, strayed beyond the boundaries of constructive testing of evidence and into the terrain of the entirely speculative. The countervailing analysis of the available evidence points to it revealing a high level of peripheral detail, and a pattern of behaviour which would be identified by experts as &#8216;grooming&#8217; (unlikely to be understood or appreciated by H). Moreover, the allegations H makes against herself led inevitably to the collapse of a placement in which she had plainly been happy. Further, the allegations have never been retracted. Additionally, they cannot be looked at in isolation. H has downloaded indecent images of children and, at one point, made direct contact with a 12-year-old boy. Whilst I would not go so far as Dr S and say that the evidence suggests that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;it is almost inevitable that [H] will commit sexual offences against children&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, I do consider the risk to be ongoing and high. In her oral evidence, Dr S was prepared to contemplate that the progress H has made might render her earlier identification of risk to be overly pessimistic. This led her to say that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;the risk is possibly, probably lower&#8221;.</span></p>

It is not just a question of whether H wants to be at the home or not, it requires a balance of the options. H can do this in a capacitous fashion when calm and engaged but is unable to achieve this at times of emotional dysregulation. This is as Lord Stephens indicated in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re JB </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(supra), </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;an important qualification to capacity&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. Additionally, H is identified as presenting with </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;all the traits of development trauma disorder (DTD)&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> which has a considerable overlap, Dr S tells me, with the symptomology associated with emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD). A feature of DTD is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;executive dysfunction&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> caused by cognitive impairment and/or emotional instability. The executive dysfunction is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;characterised as difficulties with the higher order cognitive functions affecting impulse and behavioural control, planning, abstract thinking, flexibility and disruptions in task-oriented behaviour.

I also agree that H plainly has some insights into her behaviour but that it remains incomplete. Her co-operation with the plans for her care is one of a number of factors, which I have referred to above, which gives rise for optimism for the future. It is important that H hears me say this and that she recognises the tribute to her resolve and hard work. The philosophy of the care plan, which is being amended in light of the evidence, is to focus upon developing H&#8217;s sense of agency, to use the psychiatrist&#8217;s words. In other words, the plan is geared to enabling H to develop her own autonomy. </span></p>

Of particular sensitivity is that of the natal male, who self-identifies as female but who has not embarked upon treatment for the purpose of modifying her sexual characteristics.
