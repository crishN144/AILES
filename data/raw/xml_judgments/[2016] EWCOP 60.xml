The acute trust responsible for his care now seeks a declaration that it is lawful and in his best interests not to undergo treatment for the tumour but rather to be provided with palliative care only.  </span></p>

He has been admitted to hospital under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> on a number of occasions and has been in hospital continuously for nearly six years.  His illness is characterised by a range of paranoid delusional beliefs and abnormal perceptions, including the belief that he is being interfered with by other people.  He has also exhibited intermittent hostile and threatening behaviour.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There is an uncontested assessment as to his capacity so far as relevant to this application, namely that he lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings or to make medical decisions about the medical treatment for his brain tumour by reason of the disturbance in the function of his mind or brain.  That is the unanimous view of the doctors responsible for him, including the psychiatrist, Dr W, responsible for his care.  When the Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative visited a fortnight ago to ascertain his wishes and feelings about the treatment, he declined to meet her and he stated that he did not have a brain tumour.  I am satisfied that the evidence clearly establishes that he lacks the capacity to litigate and to make decisions about his future.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The need for treatment, or possible need for treatment, arises because in December 2013 a routine MRI scan revealed an incurable but asymptomatic brain tumour.  At that stage the tumour was considered to be likely to be low-grade and not aggressive, and the treating clinicians decided to adopt a &#8216;watch and wait&#8217; approach.  At that time he accepted that he had a brain tumour and was agreeable to that course.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Further scans indicated that the tumour was growing and, in subsequent conversations, R has been inconsistent about whether or not he has a tumour, on occasions accepting that he has, on other occasions denying it.  Earlier this year a further MRI scan revealed that the tumour was growing at a faster rate than would be expected, although he remains asymptomatic.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Standard treatment in these circumstances would be for the tumour to be removed by surgery and for the patient, thereafter, to receive a course of daily radiotherapy over a period of six weeks and possibly chemotherapy thereafter.  It is important to stress that the tumour is considered to be not curable so the aim of treatment will be to prolong his life and maintain his quality of life.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Surgery has side-effects - risks of weakness or paralysis and a small risk that he would be left with communication difficulties and a decline in his general cognitive function.  In addition, I am told R is overweight and this would add to the general issue of surgery.  Furthermore, because of his psychotic condition, it would be hazardous to use dexamethasone, a drug commonly used to reduce the risk of brain swelling post-operatively.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In the view of the clinicians and in particular Dr H, his consultant oncologist, the risks of this treatment are too high in relation to its potential benefits in this particular case.  Dr W, his psychiatrist, considers that managing R in the pre-, peri- and post-operative periods would be very difficult, that it the treatment would create a significant risk to R and would be likely to cause him distress which would exacerbate his mental health symptoms.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr W puts it this way in his report.  There would be difficulties in getting R to attend to comply with appointments prior to and after the surgery, bearing in the mind the difficulties that have been experienced in the past in persuading him to attend relatively straightforward appointments.  In the absence of at least tacit acceptance by R of the need for treatment, and a willingness to comply with all that goes with accepting treatment &#8211; attending appointments, accepting directions from the staff, staying in one place &#8211; it is considered that these difficulties would recur and that any attendances at the hospital would be likely to cause him significant distress and thereby trigger a worsening of his mental state.  Furthermore, were he to foresee that he was being taken forcibly for treatment for which he did not understand the need, not only would he see it as an affront but also it would lead him to resist and his mental health problems would be exacerbated.  The hospital would, in all probability, lack the resources to manage the behaviour and managing his post-operative period would be equally difficult.  Administering post-operative medication would cause difficulties with compliance and also, as set out above, might exacerbate his psychosis.</span></p>

There will be a limited number of cases where treatment is futile, overly burdensome to the patient or where there is no prospect of recovery.  In circumstances such as these, it may be that an assessment of best interests leads to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the patient to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment, even if this may result in the person&#8217;s death.  The decision-maker must make a decision based on the best interests of the person who lacks capacity.  They must not be motivated by a desire to bring about the person&#8217;s death for whatever reason, even if this is from a sense of compassion.  Healthcare and social care staff should also refer to relevant professional guidance when making decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment. </p>

Doctors must apply the best interests&#8217; checklist and use their professional skills to decide whether life-sustaining treatment is in the person&#8217;s best interests.

The Trust submits that the factors in favour of treatment include that (1) it may prolong R&#8217;s live for several years; (2) it may delay the onset of symptoms of his brain tumour.  As far as the factors against treatment are concerned, the Trust has identified the following: (1) the factor is the tumour is incurable; (2) the treatment would be very burdensome for R to endure; (3) R will be unlikely to cooperate with treatment such that restraint or force would probably have to be used; (4) the risks of treatment may materially diminishing his quality of life; (5) undergoing the treatment may cause his psychiatric symptoms to deteriorate thereby diminishing the quality of his life; (6) insofar as he expresses any wishes, he says that he does not want to have the treatment, although, as I have stated, he has been inconsistent in what he has said about those matters.</span></p>

Special care should be taken in a case where the issue is whether life-prolonging treatment that will be recommended to patients with the capacity should be withheld from those who lacks capacity.  It is the Official Solicitor&#8217;s opinion that, if the effective treatment of the tumour persists with surgery alone, the treatment would probably be in his best interests.  However, the Official Solicitor it is particularly concerned about the impact of the other treatment, pre and post-operation, in particular the burdens of radiology and chemotherapy.  The Official Solicitor considers that there must be a significant risk that, even if the radiotherapy course was to be started, he would decline to attend all treatment sessions, and the Official Solicitor draws attention to the evidence that a premature discontinuation of radiotherapy treatment is likely to be harmful in terms of tumour growth due to the radiological effects and depopulation of the tumour.</span></p>

The Official Solicitor submits that this is a very difficult decision because of his young age and because the possibility of the treatment may afford him considerably longer life than he would be likely to have if the application is granted and the tumour is allowed to take its course.  However, on balance, the Official Solicitor concludes that the consequences of starting a course of radiotherapy to his brain would be so injurious to his mental health and wellbeing and so unpleasant that it is appropriate to conclude he should not, in his best interests, undergo such a course of treatment.</span></p>

There is a strong presumption that it is in a person&#8217;s best interests to receive life-sustaining treatment.  However, looking at R&#8217;s welfare in the widest sense, as indicated by Baroness Hale in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust v James</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, it seems to me that in this case the balance plainly comes down against surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.  The treatment is not merely surgery but also involves post-operative care, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.  It is the whole course of treatment that must be considered in making this decision.  </span></p>

Were he to start the treatment, he would suffer significant adverse effects, both in terms of the effects of the medication upon him, but also as a result of his likely non-compliance.  Thus, the prospects of success of the treatment succeeding would be very much diminished.  In any event, the evidence suggests that he would not be cured by the treatment.  At most, his life would be extended for a period.  </span></p>
