I understand from Mr Mansfield, who represented the applicant, that &#8216;home&#8217; was a word emphasised and accepted to be important by both parties in the private law proceedings and the order made as long ago as June of 2017. The parties recognised shared care to be in the interests of the children and the value and security provided by their having a &#8216;home&#8217; with each parent. </span></p>

That is the first point she makes in favour of her application. It would, she impliedly contends, be in their welfare interests to know formally that she is a permanent and respected figure in their lives, accepted as part of the wider family framework which exists. She is integral to the home in which they live whilst with their father and thus integral to their homelife. </span></p>

Thus there is no incidental divesting of A&#8217;s relevance in such circumstances and occasions must be few and far between in reality that such interventions are required or need to be exercised without engagement of a natural parent. Thus the matters advanced by Mr Mansfield it is said are more likely theoretical constructs more in the mind of A and C than they are realities on the ground. The practicalities equally will begin to diminish as the boys grow. </span></p>

Very often, once the child attains the age of 18 they may even endure albeit not on the same formal level. </span></p>

That emotional bond, that emotional connection and that legitimacy of position and principle uttered by that legitimate individual still carries resonance well into adulthood. Whilst it may be that the child grows to a position where it does not need assistance with the day-to-day management of its life, there are other practicalities which move in to supplant them. The two primary obligations of PR may at certain times wax and wane but never does one diminish to the point it disappears so that one may focus on and then similarly begin to erode and eradicate the other principle. They travel together, as I have said, and the relationship endures. It is of value for the child in my judgment to have a continuity in its &#8216;life story&#8217;. </span></p>

I have dealt with this to some extent earlier in my judgment. I pause nonetheless to say, with respect to his client, (because I understand the difficulty of her position and how she feels) it is disappointing that B&#8217;s statement takes what I estimated to be a 12 page &#8216;run up&#8217; before getting to why, in law and in practice, parental responsibility is inappropriate in this case. </span></p>

That of itself is one of the principal reasons why parental responsibility exists as a notable concept and exists as a necessary fact, to emphasise and ensure parents recognise the privilege and responsibilities that they have in bringing up their children or children in their charge. It should thus encourage them to do so and hopefully ensure that they do so. </span></p>

It rather flies in the face, in effect, of what is being said by Mr White on the other hand. Namely, that A already has all of the aces that she needs and is exercising them.
