B&#8217;s mother is M.  She appears before the court in person.  At this hearing the local authority applies for an order permitting it to dispense with service of the proceedings on the father of B.  It remains unclear whether the father has parental responsibility for B, he not being named on B&#8217;s birth certificate but having been described in previous proceedings as having parental responsibility for B. </p>

The local authority has, accordingly, notified the Attorney General of these proceedings and of the application to dispense with service on the father.  The Attorney General has indicated by correspondence that she does not wish to intervene in the proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In this case, each of the parties before the court submits that the father should not be served with notice of the proceedings.  However, given the import of an order dispensing with service on a parent in proceedings of this nature, and the fact that the father is not before the court, it is appropriate for me to give a short, reasoned judgment explaining the basis for the order dispensing with service that I am satisfied should be made in this case. </p>

He has been the subject of three sets of private law proceedings under Part II of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the subject of one set of public law proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  B was made the subject of a final care order in 2015 and was placed in foster care.  In addition, B and his mother have the protection of a nonmolestation order against the father without limit of time. </p>

That statement makes clear that the circumstances in which the foregoing extensive litigation arose have been very difficult indeed for B.   </p>

The mother also alleges that the father sexually abused B&#8217;s sibling.  Within this context, the mother had to move home with the children a total of over </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In 2012 a MARAC assessment deemed the mother and the children to be a high risk of harm from the father.  Later that year, a finding of fact hearing in the second set of private law proceedings found the allegations of domestic abuse against the father proved and concluded that B had witnessed the father being violent to the mother.  Within this context, the father&#8217;s application for contact was refused.  In 2014 the mother alleged twice that the father had raped her and later alleged that the father had forced her into prostitution and had acted as her pimp.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Within the foregoing context, care proceedings were commenced in 2014.  The court initially acceded to an application to dispense with service on the father of the care proceedings but the father later became a party to those proceedings having been notified of them by the mother.   In those proceedings, the father strenuously disputed the allegations summarised above.  Within the care proceedings B indicated clearly to the allocated social worker that he did not wish his father to know anything about him and did not want to see his father.   </p>

In December last year, B began to allege that, when at home, he and his sibling had witnessed adults being brought to the family home by the father and harmed by him with extreme violence.  B further intimated that his father had killed people.  </p>

The social worker received advice from the social work team and a psychologist at the hospital to which B was then admitted that contact with his father would place B at risk of harm with respect to his emotional wellbeing and stability.   At this time B continued to allege that his father had perpetrated violence against strangers and against his mother and stated a wish to kill his father and sever his genitals.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Since October 2017 B has increasingly laboured under difficulties with his mental health, in addition to difficulties with drugs and becoming involved in criminal activity.  Within this context, B has been the subject of hospital admissions pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss. 2</ref> and 3 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> from August 2019.  B has displayed highly emotionally dysregulated behaviour, often in response to challenges within his family relationships.  This behaviour has included ligaturing, head banging, setting fire to his clothes causing significant burns, secreting, and using a wide variety of items including his fingernails to cut at his neck, arms, legs and stomach, picking at wounds habitually, serious intentional overdoses where he has then refused treatment, standing on tram tracks, motorway bridges and reservations, running in front of cars and submerging himself completely and fully clothed in the bath.  In October 2019 B was diagnosed with an attachment disorder, developmental trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In May 2020, following a period in which there was considerable debate amongst professionals about whether B continued to fulfil the criteria for continued hospitalisation under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>, transition planning commenced for B upon doctors advising that he no longer required admission to hospital.  Very regrettably, the transition planning did not proceed smoothly and B was discharged sooner than intended.  His mental health again deteriorated and he had incidents of overdose and self-harm.  On 4 August 2020 B was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> having threatened to stab staff, self-harmed and reported an intentional paracetamol overdose.  Whilst that detention came to end on 17 August 2020, B remained in hospital whilst a further transition to a community therapeutic placement was sought. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Upon a placement being identified, the local authority issued proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction in circumstances where they considered that the placement would involve a deprivation of B&#8217;s liberty.  In light of the regime to which B was to be subject at his community therapeutic placement on 7 September 2020 I granted leave to the local authority to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and declared that it was lawful and in B&#8217;s best interests for him to be deprived of his liberty.  At that urgent hearing, I also listed the matter for a further hearing to consider the application to dispense with service of the proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction on the father. </p>

He expressed anxiety about the impact of such a step on his mother&#8217;s mental health and as to the risk of harm he perceived his family would be exposed to should his father be given notice.  B continued to state that he wants to harm or kill the father.  The mother informed the social worker that she fears that notice to the father will cause the father again to seek to contact her and the children and once again perpetrate a campaign of intimidation and violence against them.  The social worker believes that the mother will have shared these concerns with B having regard to the social workers experience of the mother&#8217;s conduct in the past. </p>

B made clear to the Children&#8217;s Guardian his objection to this course of action, telling the Guardian that he did not trust his father in circumstances where he had hurt the family in the past, had been domestically abusive to B&#8217;s mother and had raped his sibling.  Within this context, B made clear that he would not feel safe if his father had information about him, being particularly fearful of the father finding out his address.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian, rightly, put to B that the court could control the information provided to the father were he to be given notice of the proceedings. B responded with an even more robust objection, including stating to the Guardian his fear that simply being notified of the proceedings would prompt the father to ask questions and that this would have an adverse effect on B&#8217;s mental health.  B reiterated the sexual abuse he says the father perpetrated on his mother and his sibling. </p>

In this context, where a parent has parental responsibility or a right to respect for family life under Art 8, a high degree of exceptionality must be demonstrated by strong countervailing factors to justify their exclusion from participation in the proceedings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">B is an extremely vulnerable young person.  He has been the subject of extensive private and public law litigation during the course of his childhood.  During the course of the public law proceedings, the court was satisfied that B had suffered significant harm.    On B&#8217;s account he suffered physical abuse at the hands of his father, witnessed his father physically and sexually assault his mother and sexually abuse his sibling.  More recently, B has alleged that others were harmed in the family home by his father in a graphic manner, including an allegation that the father killed people.  Whilst I bear carefully in mind that the father has consistently indicated that he disputes these allegations, from <span style="font-style:italic">B&#8217;s</span> perspective I am satisfied that these matters continue to be very real for him, as indicated by his repeated statements of a wish to mutilate or kill his father, and continue to generate in him a great deal of emotional instability and distress. </p>

Within this context, B now struggles significantly with his mental health and is struggling with his gender identity. The court does not have expert evidence before it with respect to these matters, but B has a diagnosis of attachment disorder, developmental trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Since the implementation of the current transition plan on 7 September 2020 B is making considerable progress when measured against the grave difficulties that he has experienced prior to that date.  Given those previous difficulties, progress by B, however modest, is extremely valuable.  It is also extremely fragile at the current time.   Having regard to the history of this matter, I am satisfied that any disruption to B will result in an appreciable risk that his mental health will deteriorate markedly.  Within this context, the court cannot ignore the fact that, in the past, such deterioration has resulted in conduct that has included ligaturing, head banging, setting fire to his clothes causing significant burns, secreting, and using a wide variety of items including his fingernails to cut at his neck, arms, legs and stomach, picking at wounds habitually, serious intentional overdoses where he has then refused treatment, standing on tram tracks, motorway bridges and reservations, running in front of cars and submerging himself completely and fully clothed in the bath. This conduct has resulted in B being the subject of detention pursuant under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Within the foregoing context, I am satisfied that both the risk of harm and the magnitude of the harm should that risk eventuate in this case is high.  In my judgment, giving the father notice of the proceedings will lead to a high risk that B will be caused significant emotional distress, thereby risking the stability of his mental health.  I am further satisfied that should his mental health deteriorate consequent upon learning that the father has been served with proceedings concerning him, there is an equally high risk that B will cause himself, and possibility others, very serious harm to the point where it may once again become necessary to detain him pursuant to the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.

Given B&#8217;s age I am satisfied that the court should accord weight to B&#8217;s views with respect to the issue that is before the court.  In this context, I note in particular that B makes clear to the court through his Children&#8217;s Guardian that he believes his mental health will be significantly destabilised if his father is given notice of the proceedings. One again, an in the context of the risks I have outlined above, I consider the following statements by B to be of particular significance: </p>

Within this context, I am mindful that relatively recently the father expressed a desire to re-commence contact with B.  Against this, there has been no contact between B and the father for a number of years and B has no current relationship with his father, nor does he, at the age of 17, wish for one.   Within this context, this is not a case in which the father has a well-established relationship with the child. </p>

However, whilst this is an important consideration when examining the risk of harm and the magnitude of that harm should it eventuate, I am satisfied that in the context set out above it is equally important to acknowledge and take into account that, whatever the objective truth regarding the nature and extent of the father&#8217;s conduct, B considers that conduct to have been brutal, frightening, reprehensible and damaging to him emotionally and physically.  Within this context, in my judgment the magnetic factor in this case remains the risk of harm to B&#8217;s mental health, and hence his physical safety, that is likely to manifest if the father is given notice of these proceedings and the magnitude of that harm when it does. </p>

Within this context, I have borne in mind that in considering applications of this nature the court should start with full participation then consider partial participation and then, only as a device of last resort, the father&#8217;s exclusion from the proceedings.  However, I am satisfied in this case that it is the fact of notice <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> that grounds the high risk of harm in this case and the magnitude of harm that would eventuate should that risk manifest.  In my judgment, in the context of the matters I have set out above, the risk I have identified is not capable of being addressed by giving the father notice of the proceedings but limiting his participation in the proceedings, whether by the control of disclosure or otherwise. </p>
