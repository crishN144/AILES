The reason it has taken so long to reach the final hearing is due to the complexity of the background and the fact that the parents left the jurisdiction for a period in excess of five months.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">The LA initially sought care and placement orders for all the children, with care plans to place them in adoptive placements. That position changed during the hearing when the LA revised their care plan to long term foster placements for the older three children and adoptive placements for the younger three. Save for Y all the children&#8217;s current carers are being assessed as permanent placements; the younger three children as adoptive placements and Z and X&#8217;s carers as long term foster carers. The LA plan is for Y to move from her current placement to a long term foster placement. The LA would ideally like there to be inter-sibling contact for all the children and direct parental contact for the older three children although they accept this may depend, to some extent, on whether the current carers are positively assessed. They would wish for there to be contact between the older children and their parents, although this will depend on a number of factors, including whether the parents remain here and the impact that would have on the viability of full inter sibling contact. If there has to be a choice their view is sibling contact should take priority.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">The parents seek the return of all of the children to their care. If that is not possible they seek the return of the older two children and possibly Z too. They have also canvassed the return of Y alone. Their fall back position is they would want all the children to remain in long term foster placements rather than the younger three in adoptive placements. The mother is clear that she wishes the children should remain in this jurisdiction, whether in their care or in the care of the LA. The father was less clear, his oral evidence is that if he could seek the return of the children to Slovakia he would, as he sees the regime for parental contact to children in care there being more generous than here. However, he accepts that the children cannot go to Slovakia and in the closing submissions submitted on his behalf he expressly stated that if the children were not returned to their parents&#8217; care they should remain here.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">No one who has been involved in this case could avoid being affected by the plight of these parents and their children. The descriptions by them and others of the extent of the poverty and social deprivation this family have experienced were graphic and compelling. Their living conditions in Slovakia were bleak in the extreme. The father, followed by the mother and children, moved to this country to improve their living and social conditions. They faced hurdles in establishing their family life here, not only the language barrier, as neither of the parents spoke English, but also the difficulties in getting work and their ineligibility to full state benefits until they had been here for a number of months. This meant they had to live in difficult conditions here, albeit much improved than those they had left behind. In considering this case it is as much a case of neglect by omission rather than commission but there were many things the parents could and should have done (e.g. attend medical appointments, take the children to school, provide the children with stimulation). I have to bear in mind the cultural background of the parents when considering the evidence, in particular the mistrust of &#8216;authority&#8217; and the extent of the social deprivation suffered by this family.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The involvement in this case of the Slovak Republic&#8217;s Central Authority, the Centre for International Legal Protections of Children and Youth as the Central Authority (&#8220;Slovak Central Authority&#8221;), has been very useful, as it has in other similar cases. The exchange of information between the LA in this case with statutory responsibility for child protection in this jurisdiction and the Slovak Central Authority has provided the LA, the parties and this court with important information to assist this court in making decisions relating to these children, where the children&#8217;s welfare is the court&#8217;s paramount consideration.  It is very helpful that such a responsive and constructive dialogue has been established between the two jurisdictions as an increasing number of cases, such as this one, cross national borders.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">One of the issues that has been raised in this case is the shortage of Roma interpreters. Ms Fremlova, who has expertise in the Roma Community both here and in Slovakia, stated she hoped that this may improve in the future. I would endorse any steps that can be taken to encourage more Roma interpreters to assist the growing number of families here of Roma origin. Connected to this is the clear need for community based organisations to help support these families.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The court is enormously grateful to the Legal Services Commission (LSC) who constructively considered the practical suggestion presented to it thereby enabling the parents to attend in person to engage in this hearing. The parents returned to Slovakia in July 2012 and were not in a financial position to return for this hearing. The LSC accepted that it was considerably more cost effective to fund the parents travelling here compared to the cost (and uncertainties) associated with a video link connection. This enabled the parents to participate fully in this hearing with the benefit of experienced legal representation.</p>

If it is met the court then embarks on an evaluation of the evidence in order to decide what orders, if any, meet the welfare needs of the children. Each child&#8217;s welfare is the courts paramount consideration and in reaching that conclusion the court is directed to have regard to the welfare checklist set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>.

The parents were brought up in a segregated Roma housing estate ghetto called Lunik IX, on the outskirts of Kosice, located in the East of Slovakia, in conditions of extreme poverty. The five older children were born there. Prior to coming to this country the family lived in cramped accommodation with at least 13 (possibly 19) other people. The accommodation was very basic and only had running water and electricity during limited times in the day. The poor conditions on the estate, the extent of the overcrowding and pressure on the limited services are readily illustrated by the fact that the estate was built for 2,000, but now houses between 8 &#8211; 10,000 people.</p>

The mother described the difficult position she was left in caring for five children and being pregnant with the sixth. The father obtained some casual work in England and secured a tenancy on a one bedroom flat. In August 2010 the mother and children joined him in England, the mother by then 8 months pregnant.  Unfortunately the father lost his job after his family arrived in the country.  Although he obtained some sporadic employment, he was unemployed for significant periods of time and as the family had no recourse to public funds, the family was financially supported by social services.  This included purchasing food, shopping, paying for gas, electricity, rent, and council tax.  </p>

Dr Birch considered that X was functioning at a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;considerable below average age for a child of his age&#8217; </span>such that a definition of learning disability could be applied, although she accepted this could have been influenced by his deprivation and/or his early meningitis. She considered Y had experienced a very deprived emotional environment.  She had to remain indoors with her mother and help with her younger siblings and appears to have had only limited experience of play.  When Z first went to his foster carer in August 2011 he was described by the foster carer as being very withdrawn, pale and underweight.  His language was delayed; this improved considerably after placement in foster care.  When A went into foster care his foster carer described him as being very distressed, unable to speak at all and developmentally delayed.  He had no speech and his play experiences were very limited. Dr Birch observed that he was also lacking in other &#8216;experiences&#8217;; for example, his foster carer noted that he seemed amazed by the rain and when he went out into the garden in the rain for the first time, he did not know what it was and he appeared to be trying to push the raindrops back up to the sky. When B was admitted to hospital in September 2010 he was severely underweight. With hospital supervision and feeding he almost doubled his body weight in the next 12 weeks to 8.1kg and continued to gain weight over the following month. Dr Birch stated he had experienced a period of severe malnutrition resulting in stunting of his growth. When C went into foster care at the age of 9 months his foster carer described his demeanour as being &#8220;like a very young baby&#8221;.  He had to be held and cradled in the carer&#8217;s arms and he could not sit up nor would he hold out his hands to be pulled up.  He made few spontaneous movements.  He did not push his feet against a surface when held upright.  He had no play or awareness of toys.  Dr Birch noted that C appears to have been &#8216;held&#8217; still for long periods of time and he lacked locomotor and exploratory skills when he came into care. She considered C&#8217;s weight level was of medical concern and would indicate a failure to thrive.</p>

He was not toilet trained when he arrived in foster care (and, Dr Birch reported, he was still not fully toilet trained when she wrote her report).  On arrival  A did not like to be fed and he seemed afraid that the spoon was going to be taken away from him.  A would push food into his mouth and stuff it in ravenously.

Her report is dated 24th February 2012. She concluded that all six children have suffered severe degrees of deprivation and malnutrition which have had significant effects on their physical, developmental and emotional development. She concluded the parents have shown a great deal of progress in handling and understanding the needs of the older three children and that it is likely that they could resume care of the older children with support and monitoring from social services.

However, there was a further ten months here with considerable support from the LA without significant improvement in the children&#8217;s wellbeing.  The emotional responsiveness of the three younger children worsened.  Furthermore C was never exposed to the deprivation of Slovakia, yet he too failed to thrive physically and emotionally.  This suggests that the difficulties in the family go beyond their experiences in Slovakia and beyond financial and housing difficulties.  Both parents had sad and difficult childhood experiences.  Through no fault of their own they do not appear to have experienced innate positive parenting in their early years which they can draw on in parenting their children.   Mr Tapp carried out an analysis of what has changed since the children were placed in foster care in August 2011.  He concluded that not a lot has changed.  He does not think that the parents could meet the substantial collective needs of all six children together or separately.  In Mr Tapp&#8217;s view, if any of the children were returned to the care of their parents, they would quickly slip back in their development and wellbeing.  They are very vulnerable to rapid regression, given the extent of harm in the past.

The letter from the Slovakian Centre for the International Legal Protection of Children and Youth suggests that the children should be returned to Slovakia and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;placed to institution or substitute care and in time [the] alternative family care should be provided to them.&#8221;</span>  This request was made before the Slovakian authorities were furnished with any detailed information about these proceedings, the assessments undertaken or the children&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings.</p>

He said that he and the mother had left Slovakia as they had been badly treated on their return to the country.  He said that they were now living in the Czech Republic. The allocated social worker contacted the KTT Interpreting Service and asked them to telephone the father in order to ask a number of questions.  The parents explained that they were in the Czech Republic and that they were staying in a hostel when they had funds; otherwise they were sleeping on the streets. They were selling old iron to make ends meet.  They would like to attend the Final Hearing but had no money to travel to back the United Kingdom.  They still very much opposed adoption. </p>

In his view, the parenting inadequacies are not based on cultural factors, but upon an inability to implement new strategies and skills within a timetable suitable for the children. He concluded that support had been provided to the parents, and there has been sufficient time available for the parents to have demonstrated progression in some aspects of their parental care. The Guardian concluded the prognosis for the parents to make good enough change as poor and recommended the making of care and placement orders in respect of all six children.  </p>

In her statements she describes in detail the background to the involvement of social services with this family since October 2010, including the financial support given prior to the family being entitled to full state benefits in May 2011. The support included daily visits and financial assistance in getting the children to school. She acknowledged the daily support needed better organising which was done by a diary system and that interpreters were not always available. She acknowledged the difficulties the family had in the overcrowded accommodation; they were living in a one bedroom flat. However, despite the support given, her written and oral evidence outlines little improvement in the situation. When asked about the difficulties the mother had in getting the older children to school she said the father was not working and was available to assist and the children&#8217;s centre for the younger children was near the flat. Although the flat was kept reasonably clean and tidy she saw little or no stimulation for the children, no evidence of toys despite the latter being provided. She gave some examples to highlight her concerns. For example, A had what she described as an <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;obnoxious smell&#8217;</span> in June 2011 but she could not identify from where it came. When he was placed in foster care it became apparent it was an untreated ear infection.  Whilst with their parents both B and A had had ongoing ear infections, which were either untreated or if medication was prescribed was not completed. The dental decay for the children was chronic and acute. On placement with foster carers X and A were found to be in pain and had extreme dental decay and abscesses. </p>

She was clear that she kept reminding the parents to discuss matters with their solicitors. She did discuss with them the arrears on their tenancy; she explained to them they had an &#8216;introductory tenancy&#8217; where they had to evidence that they could maintain a tenancy. She was emphasising to them the need to deal with the arrears. The parents requested contact to stop. Following that meeting there were court hearings and the professionals meeting 2 and 3 July and the parents asked for contact to be re-started. The parents contacted her on 4 July requesting financial assistance to return to Slovakia. She said she stressed to them the need to speak to their solicitors and her concern that they were not attending contact that day. </p>

Her view in her report and at the professionals meeting was based on what she saw as a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;glimmer of hope&#8217;</span> of some improvement in the parents which she had observed in the second contact with the older three children. She said the parents seem to cope better, the mother was able to give Y more attention and her behaviour was less disturbed.

She described the logistical difficulties she had in coping with the number of children (for example getting out of the flat down the stairs with the children before they had a double buggy). In relation to the return to Slovakia in July 2012 she said they returned as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;we were hoping to find a job, get a flat from the local authority, hoping to find some help [from] Slovak people to get children back&#8217;.</span> She gave a rather confused account of the meetings with the social worker before their departure and her allegation that the social worker put pressure on the parents to return to Slovakia.

He drew back from being specific about particular scenarios put to him about contact for example if the parents had to return to Slovakia would there be an extra contact. He considered this was best dealt with in the structure of the Independent Reviewing Officer, LAC reviews and general reviews to respond to any changing situation. The LA confirmed the last LAC was on 22 January 2013 and that there is an allocated Independent Review Officer. The Children&#8217;s Guardian was clear that whilst he could not rule out that the older children&#8217;s views about not wanting to return to live with their parents could relate to their experiences in the care of the parents in Slovakia, he considered it was due to the children&#8217;s experiences of the care they received from their parents, and was not limited to Slovakia.

She was fair and balanced in her evidence, was able to refer to case notes to support her position and I can see no possible motive for her behaving in the unprofessional way alleged; it was noteworthy none was suggested. I am afraid it was the parents who had the motive, seeking to justify their actions which in the cold light of day perhaps demonstrates vividly their inability to understand the basic needs of their children.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In my judgment it is more likely than not that the parents had been contemplating a return to Slovakia, this is evidenced in the LA records. Their understandable distress at the news of the LA plans for the children turned those thoughts rapidly into a reality, without thinking about the consequences for the children or investigating what help there would be in a place where they had come from after experiencing such severe deprivation. The motivation appears to be to enlist the help of the authorities there without any consideration being given to what actually could be done and the consequences of going with no means to return. That is evidenced by the father&#8217;s evidence that when they got there all the offices were closed for the summer holidays. From the children&#8217;s perspective this step was disastrous as they moved from a position of having regular contact with their parents, particularly their mother, to no contact and no information as to when they would see their parents again. As one of the witnesses described it was for the children like falling off a cliff edge.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The two matters in the agreed threshold document that remain in issue are more likely than not established. I agree with Dr Birch&#8217;s observation that after the family came to England they do not seem to have been coping and were not able to meet the children&#8217;s needs and the children lacked sufficient care and attention from their parents on moving to the United Kingdom. The evidence demonstrates the children were given insufficient stimulation as the parents were simply unable to cope with all the children. I accept the examples given by the LA of the lack of supervision of the children. I also accept the evidence about the reports regarding A&#8217;s behaviour when he was received into foster care, which is more likely than not to have been caused by the lack of stimulation and care given to him whilst he was living with his parents. The agreed matters set out in the threshold document in the papers, together with the findings I have made, more than amply supports the extent of the neglect suffered by each of these children which significantly harmed their emotional and physical development. My conclusion is supported by the professionals who attended the professionals meeting on 2 July 2012 who agreed <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Children have suffered very considerable harm by way of neglect. The harm has been by way of omission not commission and the parents have not deliberately harmed the children&#8217;.</span> Sadly these parents, most probably due to their own difficult backgrounds, did not have the understanding or ability to provide good enough care for these children, even with the benefit of intensive support, in a way that did not cause each of these children significant harm to their emotional and physical development.</p>

The older three children do not wish to return to their parents care as they may continue to experience neglectful parenting, as they did before. They have all expressed the wish to remain with their current carers. The court has to be alive to the fact that their wishes may be influenced by their experience of being cared for by the parents in Lunik IX and the attachment they have inevitably built up with their current carers. However, they lived in this country for 10 months, which they would all remember, and they continued to experience their parents care during the regular contact they had. I therefore consider that their views are more likely to be influenced by their more recent experiences of their parents care. Their wishes and feelings are only one of the relevant considerations.</p>

X suffered considerable emotional and physical deprivation. His hearing and eyesight will require monitoring and attendance at appointments. He is emotionally fragile and finds it difficult to talk about life when living with his parents. His academic progress has been slow and whilst not meeting the criteria for a statement of special educational needs he will require close monitoring and support. Y&#8217;s behaviour has been very challenging and she too is emotionally vulnerable, she is demanding and will engage in difficult behaviour to secure the attention she requires. The descriptions in the papers demonstrate this goes beyond attention seeking behaviour. She expresses considerable anxiety about her parents and her future care. Her educational progress has been slow and requires considerable support. Z requires firm and consistent parenting. His health has improved and his dental decay been treated. He is making progress at school. A&#8217;s health has improved, his glue ear successfully treated. His general health requires careful monitoring and he requires consistent and firm handling. B&#8217;s health is good, he still requires medication for his Vitamin D deficiency and benefits from his nursery attendance. C is in good health and his development now all age appropriate.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Any change to the children&#8217;s current circumstances is likely to be difficult for each of them. It will require careful planning and consistent and supported planning. All the children have thrived with consistent care and whilst the court has to be particularly careful not to place reliance on how children have improved when placed with foster carers who are in a better economic position than the parents, it is a remarkable feature of this case that all the children have made such significant progress in such a short period of time. This does, in my judgment, emphasise the extent of the neglect the children suffered in the care of their parents which the court cannot ignore. Care of course needs to be taken to ensure decisions not to restore children to the care of their parents are not made because they would be better off in foster care; that amounts to social engineering which is not the function of this court. What the court must consider is whether these parents are able to provide good enough parenting to all or any of these children. I have reached the conclusion they cannot as they would be unable to provide, even with support in place, the consistency of care that each of these children so desperately need. Obviously if the current carers are successful in the various assessments that will mean, other than Y, there will be no change in their carers. This would, on the information I have seen, have enormous benefits for these children as they will keep the stability of carer with whom they have strong attachments, the carers are known to each other, have established an effective way of ensuring sibling contact takes place and provide the best prospect of parental contact working. In relation to a change of carer for, Y that will obviously require careful planning and consistency which in my judgment the parents are unable to give.</p>

They are all of Roma descent and at the moment associate their background with severe deprivation. Some of the foster carers, to their credit, have taken steps to keep some of the Roma customs alive for the children. It is unfortunate that has not been undertaken more coherently which I hope in the future it will be. Obviously if there was contact with the parents that would provide a tangible way of doing that. The children are at ages where decisions regarding their future placement cannot be further delayed. These proceedings have now being going on for 17 months and although that delay has in part been beneficial for the children to enable them to settle with their current carers, they now require some certainty about where they are going to live.</p>

They have not seen their parents for seven months and have had no information as to when they were likely to see them again. Their parents are in a very precarious position now having returned to Slovakia in the way that they did. They are having now to try and re-establish themselves here, where they wish to remain, but it remains very uncertain. Even when they did not have the responsibility of caring for the children they were unable to manage basic aspects of their day to day life to retain their accommodation or manage their finances. Even making all due allowance for the difficulties they obviously had it demonstrates that even with support the care they would provide for the children would be very uncertain and precarious. It is unlikely they would be able consistently to provide for the children&#8217;s very basic emotional and physical needs.</p>

That is the view of the expert evidence, in particular Dr Birch and Mr Tapp, who each carried out detailed assessments and, in my judgment, kept their minds open at all times to looking at ways of restoring these children to their parents care. I accept their evidence. Each of them struggled with the impact of the historical difficulties this family have had, as have I. As Mr Tapp said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I find this a difficult complex and sad case. The parents unquestionably love their children dearly. Their commitment at attending contact has been faultless.&#8217;</span> Later in his report he states the children require <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;parenting to sustain the improvements in their development. I do not think that the parents are able to provide the necessary quality of parenting, even with support, to any of the children. I believe that the children would quickly slip back in their development and well being were any of them to return [to their parents care]. In my opinion they are very vulnerable to rapid regression given the extent of the harm in the past. They are not resilient in this respect.&#8217;</span> I agree.</p>

A, B and C each require the stability and security of placement that is life long which can only come though an adoptive placement. They are each still very young and will require consistent parenting throughout their minority and beyond. Bearing in mind their ages a placement short of an adoptive placement may breakdown and create further uncertainty for them which would be very detrimental to their welfare. They are part of a strong sibling group and any adoptive placement, whether their existing placement or an alternative placement will be sought that ensures such contact continues. For the reasons set out above the parents are not able to care for the children and there are no other members of the wider family who are in a position to do so. The LA plan, endorsed by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, is that following an adoption order being made any contact with the parents should be indirect, by way of managed exchange of letters and photographs. I agree this would meet the children&#8217;s welfare needs.</p>
