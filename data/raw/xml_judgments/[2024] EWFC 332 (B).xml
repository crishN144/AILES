B is the daughter and only child of F (&#8220;F&#8221;) and M (&#8220;M&#8221;). Both parents are from the Pakistani community. They are first cousins. M was born and brought up in Pakistan and moved to join F a couple of months after their marriage in 2008. F is British and grew up in the north of England.</span></p>

I am told there is an FDR later in the month. Since the decision to divorce, the parties have had to remain living at the family home with B. It is evident that this has exacerbated the problems between them. A significant degree of acrimony has developed, in part because of these proceedings. The court has viewed/listened to a number of recordings of arguments, some of which demonstrate a lack of self-control by both parents with examples of shouting and swearing, demonstrating very poor judgment about what has been aired in front of B.</span></p>

He applied for a Child Arrangements Order/ shared care. He was concerned that he was being excluded from B&#8217;s life and that she was being deliberately alienated from him by M. This had resulted, he said, in difficulties in communication between F and daughter and he found it difficult to spend time alone with her without M being present. M&#8217;s presence, he said, inhibited B from being able to speak to him freely and prevented him from wanting to press the issue in order to avoid conflict. M&#8217;s case is that B felt upset and let down and hurt by F&#8217;s decision to spend time away from the family home following the decision to separate. M denies alienating B from F. Whilst she agrees there are difficulties in their relationship, these have been caused solely by F and not her. For example, she says that F&#8217;s decision to scrap the family car because of the ULEZ charge made B very upset. Apparently, she was unable to eat for two weeks.</span></p>

In his evidence he has cited examples of M apparently saying she did not want B to play with British children at school. He portrayed a girl on the cusp of adolescence increasingly home-bound: not allowed to participate in extra-curricular activities; focused on her religion (Islam) and encouraged to deprecate British values and society. This concerned him greatly. In addition, he was worried that M was attempting to alienate B from him because of his more liberal views which aligned with common British values. Of particular concern was his fear that the isolation was a way of preparing her for marriage &#8211; to someone from their particular community and specifically to a cousin. He says he heard discussions between M and one of her sisters which led him to believe that there was a plan to marry B to her first cousin, the son of her maternal uncle, who lives in Pakistan.</span></p>

She opposes the &#8220;application for 50/50 contact and interim 3 hours&#8221; as ordered. She says B is at risk of emotional harm.</span></p>

However, they appear to have resiled from that position to a degree. The case as put during the hearing appeared to undercut the support the LA had shown in its s37 report to F. The clearest example of this was the LA&#8217;s challenge to F in cross examination that he had described his marriage as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">arranged </span><span style="font-size:12pt">in an historic case note (which he denied saying). The shift in the LA case, which has not been set out in any updating evidence since the s37 report has placed F at a disadvantage. Witnesses (such as the author of the note) who might have been called to give evidence so he could challenge the note, have not been called because F understood the Local Authority to support his case on the facts.</span></p>

It is clear from the video clip that when she spoke to her father she </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">did </span><span style="font-size:12pt">want to go, even if she subsequently changed her mind. M&#8217;s conversation with B undermined her confidence about making any trip away from home. B&#8217;s change of mind is, as I find, more likely to have been linked to the fact that the proposal caused parental conflict and she was trying to keep the peace.</span></p>

He was nearly 40 when he married M and had just emerged from a long-term relationship with a British girl for whom he still had feelings. In his statement he described being in a vulnerable state at this time. He says that his uncle invited him to Pakistan to choose a bride from Pakistan. He thought the time was right for marriage and agreed to make the trip. Once there, he was made aware of the shame he had brought upon his family by rejecting M&#8217;s eldest sister and came under pressure to marry M, including from his own mother, who had accompanied him on this trip. He described being introduced to women only from his own family. In his oral evidence he said that at the time, he was not really attuned to this manipulation of his choices but looking back on it, particularly now he has received advice and information from the Forced Marriage Unit, he thinks that his choice was manipulated. He says he thinks he was being watched to check he was not going out unaccompanied (an uncle was waiting in the lobby of the hotel). There were fights which took place at the homes of the two brides other than M and looking back he thinks these events were engineered to steer him towards M.</span></p>

Part of that pressure was applied because the family, and his mother, whom he said was instrumental in the attempts to get him to marry M, wanted to repair the damage he had caused to the family&#8217;s honour by rejecting M&#8217;s eldest sister and returning to England in 1998.</span></p>

This behaviour has included shouting, swearing and the use of humiliating language for example when M called F a donkey while speaking to her father on the phone. Each of them has, on occasions, used B to convey messages to the other which is wholly inappropriate and each of them has been reckless about the extent to which she has been exposed to their disputes. B has, likely, been emotionally harmed by the abusive conduct of each of her parents. F had good insight into his own responsibility for this. M did not.</span></p>

M&#8217;s explanation for this was inconsistent, saying at first that it happened because F wasn&#8217;t there and then suggesting that it was because she was having nightmares. There are also other statements B has made to professionals which suggest her mother is unhappy for her to associate with her father.

The evidence indicates that within the family, arranged first cousin marriages are practised and that the category of potential spouses is closed to relatives. There has already been a discussion about B&#8217;s betrothal to her first cousin and she may already be betrothed. This coupled with the evidence I accept of M&#8217;s threat to remove B to Pakistan and her flagrant breach of the July court order (for which she is wholly unremorseful) means that the threat is real and immediate.</span></p>
