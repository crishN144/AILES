This was due in part to the fact that the local authority felt unable to make recommendations without a defined factual matrix as there were too many potential findings to enable an either/or report to be prepared and that was a view shared by the children&#8217;s Guardian.</span></p>

The scene images of the shed immediately after Z&#8217;s death revealed the carrycot to be in a tipped-up position, with an adjacent box present and therefore it is possible that the carrycot was positioned horizontally on the box within the shed. The carrycot had signs of vomit and a dummy in it. Taking account of all the circumstances and all the information gathered there is clear evidence suggestive of the fact that Z was put in the shed in his carrycot. This has been denied by the parents of Z, however, the explanation provided for the carrycot being in the shed is unsatisfactory and all the evidence suggests that Z was put in the carrycot in the shed and as this was the only sleeping vessel for Z it would be reasonable to assume and more likely than not Z had been in the carrycot in the shed at some point prior to his death. It is not possible to say that placing Z in the shed contributed significantly to causing death. In light of the uncertainty about the sleeping conditions and the hippocampal abnormality identified the cause of death could not be ascertained.&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">While everyone knows that memory is fallible, I do not believe that the legal system has sufficiently absorbed the lessons of a century of psychological research into the nature of memory and the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people's memories are unreliable and believe our memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate.&#160;</span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Underlying both these errors is a faulty model of memory as a mental record which is fixed at the time of experience of an event and then fades (more or less slowly) over time. In fact, psychological research has demonstrated that memories are fluid and malleable, being constantly rewritten whenever they are retrieved. This is true even of so-called 'flashbulb' memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event. (The very description 'flashbulb' memory is in fact misleading, reflecting as it does the misconception that memory operates like a camera or other device that makes a fixed record of an experience.) External information can intrude into a witness's memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory).&#160;</span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Memory is especially unreliable when it comes to recalling past beliefs. Our memories of past beliefs are revised to make them more consistent with our present beliefs. Studies have also shown that memory is particularly vulnerable to interference and alteration when a person is presented with new information or suggestions about an event in circumstances where his or her memory of it is already weak due to the passage of time.</span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The process of civil litigation itself subjects the memories of witnesses to powerful biases. The nature of litigation is such that witnesses often have a stake in a particular version of events. This is obvious where the witness is a party or has a tie of loyalty (such as an employment relationship) to a party to the proceedings. Other, more subtle influences include allegiances created by the process of preparing a witness statement and of coming to court to give evidence for one side in the dispute. A desire to assist, or at least not to prejudice, the party who has called the witness or that party's lawyers, as well as a natural desire to give a good impression in a public forum, can be significant motivating forces.&#8221;</span></p>

The significance of Z possibly being in the carrycot in the shed is unclear. If the carrycot were placed onto a flat surface such as a box, then the carrycot might be flat and stable and not inherently dangerous, aside from the lack of parental supervision. There is evidence of gastric content in the lungs, with some patchy oedema and focal haemorrhage. It is uncertain whether this represents recent aspiration that caused death, as post mortem movement of gastric content into the lungs can occur. There was no evidence of significant lipid laden macrophages or reflux oesophagitis to indicate that Z had previous significant reflux. The hippocampal malformation is a subtle finding; it is a potential cause of sudden unexpected death in infancy, but less common in this very young age group. I have seen Dr Johnson&#8217;s draft report. I agree with his comments that the temperature in the shed is unlikely to have been extreme, and if the carrycot had been placed horizontally on top of the cardboard box adjacent to it in the scene photograph, then an inappropriate sleeping position could have been avoided. Therefore it is not possible to say that placing Z in the shed contributed significantly to causing death. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">In light of the uncertainty about the sleeping conditions</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and the hippocampal abnormality identified, I agree with Dr Johnson that the pathological cause of death is Unascertained.&#8221; (My emphasis added).</span></p>

Dr Mecrow replied that it was unlikely at Z&#8217;s age that he would have the strength and muscular coordination to move himself significantly in the cot. Babies in cots tend to wriggle downwards so nurses are taught to place neonates with their feet at the bottom of the cot. Dr Mecrow said he was aware that babies can move down but not it was clear about them moving up. It was difficult to see how Z could move over to the side. He would have to move to a position where his shoulders pressed him into the side. It was unlikely that he had muscular coordination to do that and therefore it was unlikely on a balance of probabilities.</span></p>

Dr  Mecrow said that he could not understand the father&#8217;s reference to having found Z  slightly rolled to the side at D 20.

It is safer to keep the feet at the feet end. The reason that that is done is because medical staff are concerned about re-breathing air which can lead to hypoxia and hypercarbia. So they place them at the bottom of the cot so that they cannot slip further down to suffer rebreathing under the blanket.</span></p>

He referred to a paper by &#8216;Safe Sleep Scotland&#8217; which gave national guidance that very few deaths occur with no risk factors present. Another document called &#8216;Out of Routine&#8217; which was a review of SUDIC cases where the children are considered at risk of harm looked at 40 cases. In 38 there was co-sleeping. In 33, there was parental alcohol or drug abuse. This suggested that there were risk factors in the majority of cases.</span></p>

It was difficult to communicate with the mother. The mother knew what she wanted to say but found it difficult to say it. She could misuse words or phrases. A conversation  was reported to have taken place on 29 June 2021 when the mother was reported as saying to the social worker &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t even me that found Z in the shed it was Father.&#8221; The witness agreed with Mr Twomey KC for the mother that this was a conversation that had taken place three days after the mother had given birth. The social worker confirmed that the mother&#8217;s emotions would have been all over the place just after the birth. It was also her first birth after losing Z and  a time when the local authority was involved. The mother was really emotional. She agreed that the mother may simply have been confused and suffered a slip of the tongue about where Z was found. In my judgment she did; however the slip exposed the truth.</span></p>

Z was the firstborn, everything was new and at times it scared her, overwhelmed her and panicked her. The support that they might reasonably expect was not there. Following the birth everything was done on the telephone including midwife and health visitor check ins. She found it difficult on the telephone and not having any face-to-face conversations. She had some after-effects from the birth and it was painful and uncomfortable. She found living like that hard and harder because of B. There was a pressure through how B would respond if  Z was crying. If Z was upset B would not talk to them and he would &#8216;run away to DD&#8217;s&#8217;.

It is a simple straightforward matter to explain how within 30 minutes of Z being taken to hospital police discovered his cot in the shed outside.

I have considered the range of potential alternative reasons why the father might give this evidence. I have concluded that the real reason is that he is trying to give an account for why the cot came to be found in the shed so soon after Z&#8217;s death that also attempts to tie up the various accounts given by the mother and father to explain why that was, when the real reason is that Z had been put in his cot in the shed and that was where he was found in his collapsed state.</span></p>

The grandfather would make a point of letting them know that he wasn&#8217;t happy. &#8220;When babies cry you cannot control them&#8221; the father said. When the grandfather would shout it would wind him up a bit as there was nothing he could do. The mother would get a bit upset with him as his grandad was upset with them. It was just an impossible job. He was trying to please everyone including the mother. He was splitting himself between three people. It was so hard he said.

In assessing the parents&#8217; evidence I bear in mind  the observations of Leggatt J in the Gestmin case and in particular Peter Jackson J in the Lancashire case above. I have made every allowance for that and also for the cognitive function of the mother as set out in the cognitive assessment at E1.</span></p>

It is unlikely in my judgment that the cot was placed in the manner shown in P282. I do not consider that it is at all likely that Z was placed in his cot in such a dangerous position. I draw the inference that the reason that the cot is in that position is because it was placed in an insecure and unsafe position due to the length of the cot extending significantly beyond the width of the box, such that it had a propensity to fall and did so. Perhaps due to Z&#8217;s movement, perhaps not. The cot tipping was not just reasonably foreseeable in my judgment, it was a clear and obvious risk to any reasonable parent.</span></p>

The clear impression that I have formed from the photographic evidence is that the position that the grey jacket is in on that photograph is the position it would have been in as a result of somebody peeling back the grey jacket at or in the region of the zip of that jacket, I infer, to check on Z underneath.</span></p>

The father was concerned about the police finding the cot in the shed and that is why he asked his mother to ask the grandfather to move the cot at 1 AM when he was at hospital just two hours after his son had been pronounced dead. In my judgement his attention would not have turned to that issue unless it was, potentially at least, very important. Whilst I have taken the evidence of PC AG into account, I consider it unlikely that at 1am he was giving a direction via his mother to his grandfather to take the cot out of the shed because he did not want anything of Z&#8217;s to remain. I find that to be inherently unlikely.</span></p>

On the one hand she spoke at times of great concern for her son and was able to articulate, what in my judgment, was genuine concern for his well-being. Evidence of that was her contacting his GP shortly after Z&#8217;s death to ask for help for him. Yet at other times when on the issue of taking the  grandfather&#8217;s money she could become easily enraged and emotionally labile, speaking at times with a venom towards the mother in particular and the father.

They were searching for peace and quiet in a pressure cooker situation and made very bad choices. The error was to place the cot on an under-sized, insecure and unstable box for a base and then to leave him unattended during the evening in a garden shed. That was neglectful. It was not deliberate harm nor was it borne out of any loss of love for their child. This child appeared well-nourished and there were no signs of any injuries, current or past.
