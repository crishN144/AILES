Mr. Justice Hedley has made some characteristically penetrating observations about the problems thrown up by a transnational or cross-border relationship.  Where, as here, an Englishman has formed a relationship with a foreign woman, both must have done so, or be taken to have done so, with their eyes open as to possible future pitfalls should the relationship founder:  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt"> a fortiori</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, if they decide to have a child.  If the relationship founders it will probably come as no great surprise to the Englishman if his own estranged partner wishes to return to her homeland.  That would not come out of a clear blue sky.  The counter-argument, which is the other side of the same coin, is that the foreign mother must surely be taken to have tacitly accepted and agreed that should the relationship founder she would sacrifice her own wishes and desires to return to her homeland in favour of the maintenance of a regular and meaningful relationship between the child and her father.

		<p style="margin-left:1.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">'The problem with the attribution of great weight to this particular factor is that, paradoxically, it appears to penalise selflessness and virtue, while rewarding selfishness and uncontrolled emotions. The core question of the putative relocator is always "how would you react if leave were refused?" The parent who stoically accepts that she would accept the decision, make the most of it, move on and work to promote contact with the other parent is far more likely to be refused leave than the parent who states that she will collapse emotionally and psychologically. This is the reverse of the Judgment of Solomon, where of course selflessness and sacrifice received their due reward.'</span></p>

I remarked during the hearing that her family seems to have stepped out of the pages of a Russian novel.  Her parents are Finnish.  When her father was 12 his brother, then aged 23, murdered their own father by shooting him.  The mother's parents were married in Finland and had two children there.

This is a town with a population of about 40,000.  Following their arrival in H, the mother's parents had two more children - AJ and the mother herself, NJ, who was born in 1983 and who is now aged 31.  However, in 1980 the mother's father was accused of arson of a property in Finland prior to their move to Sweden.  He was convicted and sent to prison for 9 months.</span></p>

The older sisters, ZJ, who still lives in H, and RJ, who lives in W, 200 kilometres away, do not have anything to do with their younger sisters or their parents.  Although the mother is close to her sister, AJ, who also lives in H, and to her parents, AJ and the parents fell out over some unexplained issue 9 months ago and have nothing to do with each other.  Were the mother to return to H I sense that she may find herself embroiled in the festering dispute between AJ and, for that matter, her husband, LO, on the one hand, and her parents on the other.  This family is divided both horizontally and vertically and, as is well-known and as has been famously said, a house divided against itself cannot stand.</span></p>

His father is a taxi driver.  His mother is a retired dental nurse.  His elder sister is GV.  She has learning difficulties and is cared for by her parents at their home. His younger sister is JV.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the family dynamics to which I have referred, the mother seems to have had a troubled adolescence.  When she was aged 14 she self-harmed and had psychological treatment.  When aged 23, in 2006, she left Sweden and travelled to Mexico where she stayed for some time.  In 2007 she came to London.  She wanted to live in a cosmopolis and London was the place for her.  She worked first for Phillips in customers services dealing with the Swedish and Finnish market and, after that, for the Financial Times in the same field.  In 2007, the year of her arrival, she met the father through the internet via the website 'Myspace'.  They began a relationship and in 2008 the mother moved into his family home in Wimbledon Park to live permanently with him.  In that year, and the following year for that matter, she visited her family in H.  In 2008 she was accompanied by the father.  In March 2009 she fell pregnant.</span></p>

In July 2010 the mother, the father and B visited her parents in Sweden.  At that point the rift between AJ and her parents had not occurred and so there were gatherings of the parents, AJ, LO and their two children, SO (who is now nearly 15) and TO (who is now aged 8), with the mother and the father and B.  However, after a few days the father abruptly left.  As I will explain, he has over-protective traits and he was very disturbed by the practice - which for all I know is a standard Swedish practice - of leaving B, then aged 6 months, outside the house in her pram.  As a result a row developed and, without putting too fine a point on it, the father stormed off and returned to London, leaving behind the mother and B who stayed in Sweden for about a month.</span></p>

The excessive drinking, which has been confirmed by the test results, and the formation of at least one highly inappropriate and unsuitable relationship imperilled her and also imperilled B.  However, it is fair to say that in the second part of this year stability seems to have taken hold.  Indeed, the mother has allowed the father far more contact than the operative provisions of the order stipulate.  She has done so up to a point through motives of self-interest, in order to pursue her relationship with YF, who lives in Portsmouth, but it is also perhaps a sign that this mother has started to turn her anarchic and dysfunctional life around.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"I write to confirm that NJ has been attending individual psychological therapy sessions with me since 21 June 2013.  The focus of our work has been the anxiety and low mood she experiences at the prospect of not being able to return to her native Sweden with her daughter B.  Whilst she is able to formulate plans for a future in London, she remains certain she will never be happy if she cannot return home.  She has struggled to sustain relationships with people in London.  She is unemployed and largely isolated.  She is unhappy in her accommodation, with little prospect in the medium term that she will be able to find somewhere better.  As a result of the strain she is under, she suffers from insomnia, anxiety, low mood and poor appetite that to date has not responded to treatment.  NJ longs to live in a small town again and in close proximity to her family.  Apparently where she to return to Sweden she would be able to access both somewhere to live and a job.  It is clear to me that NJ has not settled in London and is genuinely unable to foresee a happy future for herself and her daughter here.  From a clinical perspective I think that being compelled to reside in London would precipitate a substantial decline in her emotional wellbeing and that, as a consequence, psychological therapy in the form of long-term counselling might be necessary. Even with the provision of this treatment the outcome remains uncertain, and whilst I currently have no concerns about her ability to care for B it is possible that chronic low mood may impact on the quality of parenting she is able to provide".</span></p>

If she turned it down she would be taken to be intentionally homeless and the Council would have discharged their duty to her and would wash their hands of her.

I confess to having been surprised that a local authority could discharge its duty by offering accommodation to a homeless person in a far flung, another part of the country.

The current allocation scheme of the London Borough of Wandsworth provides that only one offer of suitable accommodation will be made and should that offer not be accepted then the duty to house is discharged and an applicant can be considered intentionally homeless and an applicant will not qualify to be or remain on the applicants' housing queues for a period of two years unless there are material changes in circumstances.  An applicant does, however, have a right to review the suitability of accommodation pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/52/section/202" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.202</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/52" uk:canonical="1996 c. 52" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Housing Act 1996</ref>.  In the present case NJ has not been given a formal offer but an invitation to view the property.  She was second on the list of those viewing in terms of priority and the property in Clacton-on-Sea has therefore been formally offered to the applicant who is first.  If this property is accepted by that applicant NJ will then be considered for other properties.  If refused by the other applicant the property will formally be offered to NJ".</span></p>

If that eventuated there would, of course, have to be a complete change of circumstances and of life for the mother and B in effectively alien territory.  In the light of this, I permitted both counsel to provide short supplemental submissions.  Miss Amiraftabi wrote to me this morning as follows;  she referred to the letter from Mr. Walesby which I have just read out, and said:</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"The letter sets out, by reference to the relevant criteria, the support that the CSS would lend to the mother's application for re-housing in borough. Although such support would not be determinative of the mother's application, it is clear the CSS would strongly advocate on behalf of the mother to be re-housed in borough.  The letter from the housing department is predictably bleak as they are always wary of committing themselves to a course of action.  Ms. Khalifah in evidence said that she had re-housed two mothers in Wandsworth this year who are facing harassment issues.  Clearly she meant in consultation with the housing department.  The mother has not to date sought to use the support of the CSS and opportunity should be given for them to liaise with housing.  In the event the mother is not offered a property in borough the father would propose that she find a property in the private rental sector.  The mother is in receipt of housing benefit which would meet the rental payments on a property suitable for her and B.  The father would meet the cost of the deposit for the property if the mother is unable to do so.  This would ensure that the mother and B remain in an area familiar to them".</span></p>

A specific question was asked of the housing department as to any impact CSS's support would have on the mother's prospects of being re-housed in the borough.  The response was not positive.  On that basis it is unlikely the matters set out in Mr. Walesby's letter would have much, if any, effect.  The mother was not asked specifically in evidence, but she states she has discussed her housing with Mr. Walesby and therefore he is aware of her need for support in this regard.  She states she has also spoken to Miss Gammon, a housing officer, about B being subject to a child protection plan but this has not made any difference to her housing prospects.  It is therefore not accepted that support or liaison between CSS and Housing has not been explored by the mother.</span></p>

She has previously considered the possibility of renting in the private sector.  Unfortunately the difficulties with that proposal are that there is a dearth of landlords within the borough who actually accept housing benefits and there is difficulty locating a property within the borough which falls within the rental limit of housing benefit.  The prospects of finding a property suitable and safe for B and the mother to live in with those limitations are remote and therefore the uncertainty around the mother's housing will still remain."</span></p>

However it is plain, and cannot be disputed, that the mother's future housing position is very uncertain whichever angle it is viewed from.  The mother's support network in Wandsworth, as referred to by Mr. Walesby, is very limited.  On the personal front, YF is a very recent arrival.  Dr. Draper has signed the mother off, as has Ms. Butterfield, the family psychotherapist who has been working with her.  So on the evidence the only professional contacts that the mother now has are to IDAS, the Integrated Drug and Alcohol Service;  her social worker, Ms. Khalifah; and to victim support. The mother is unemployed and is subsisting on benefits.  As I have said, she is living in temporary accommodation in a bed-sitting room with B.  There is no evidence the mother could find employment here.  On any view, her position, both actual and prospective, is uncertain if not bleak.</span></p>

She feared that if the mother was permitted to return to Sweden the parties may end up back at square one.  It seems to me, however, that that risk is present whatever decision I make.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I have to say that contact for at least a week in Sweden every month, with the father and B staying in a guesthouse at the mother's expense, seems to me to be quite unrealistic.  I therefore am going to make a child arrangement order in the following terms.  The child, B, shall live with the mother as her primary carer and the mother shall have permission to take her to live permanently in Sweden.  There shall be contact to the father in the following terms:  He shall have half of all the school holidays and two out of three of the school half-terms each year in London, with the mother to deliver and collect B and to pay her travel expenses.  He is to have two weekends each term in Sweden, from Friday afternoon to Monday morning, with the mother to pay the father's travel and guesthouse expenses for such term-time weekends.  He is to have Skype contact as proposed by the mother.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">My order will provide on its face that this child arrangements order is expected to be recognised and enforced in Sweden pursuant to Article 23 of the Council Regulation known as Brussels II Revised, and Article 23 of the 1996 Hague Convention.  Those provisions mean that it is not necessary for me to require the mother to obtain another order in Sweden before she goes, as those provisions provide that my order shall be recognised and enforced in Sweden as if it were a domestic order.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">However, my order will state that its provisions are variable by a Swedish court if circumstances changed and B's best interests require a variation.  There is one circumstance where I can envisage a variation being made.  The father's counsel has raised the spectre of non-compliance with my contact order by the mother.  I want to make it crystal clear that I am expecting compliance to be made to the letter.  If the order is frustrated or breached without very good reason then I will expect the Swedish court to conclude that the mother's promises to me were empty and insincere.  In such circumstances, a transfer of residence to the father and the return of B to live with him in London should be carefully considered.</span></p>
