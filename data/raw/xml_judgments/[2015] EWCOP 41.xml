I asked why she hadn&#8217;t replied to my initial letter dated 22nd July 2014 along with the other attorney YS to which she said they answered questions to the COP Visitor thinking this was a full account they had provided when they clearly hadn&#8217;t. DA told me she didn&#8217;t clearly understand the role of an attorney along with YS the other attorney. She also said that she couldn&#8217;t account because there were too many questions and that she didn&#8217;t have any of the information I requested in the letter. Advised that I would be making an application to the COP to which she didn&#8217;t seem bothered and said that she along with YS would answer any questions the COP have for them.&#8221;</p>

I would like the court to consider appointing me either as a sole or joint deputy, the other deputy being selected from the panel of deputies. I believe this would be in my mother&#8217;s best interests. As previously stated I have already some knowledge of my mother&#8217;s financial affairs in both the UK and Barbados. I also believe that as her son I can properly represent my mother&#8217;s views and wishes. It is clear that with just &#163;7,000 remaining from the sale of her home there is very little left to pay for the services of a deputy and therefore it would be in the best interests of my mum to preserve what little is left and appoint me as deputy.&#8221;</p>

She further asserts that any of the donor&#8217;s money which has been spent either by her or her brother, YS, has been spent for the benefit and enjoyment of the donor. She relies on her witness statement which refers to the history of the matter and various sacrifices she has made whilst taking care of her mother.</p>

She maintains that these transactions were carried out with the full involvement of the donor through solicitors. The deed of trust put in place showing 40% shares to the first and second respondent and 20% share to the donor was prepared by these solicitors and the donor&#8217;s signature was witnessed. If it is to be suggested that the donor did not have the capacity to enter unto this deed of trust, it is respectfully submitted that the OPG&#8217;s enquiries ought to be extended and directed towards the solicitors who prepared this deed of trust.</p>

		    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The OPG also makes the point that the deed of trust was put in place just six weeks before Ms Simonson visited the donor. However, the court is reminded that there is no medical evidence available to understand how the donor&#8217;s cognitive function has been affected by the stroke and how this has affected her capacity to make decisions in relation to her property and affairs. Moreover, the OPG appears to accept that the donor had the capacity to make the LPAs in October 2014 (after her stroke) as the validity of the instruments is not in dispute.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">As regards the appointment of ES as OL&#8217;s deputy for property and affairs, I do not believe he has sufficient detachment or impartiality to manage his mother&#8217;s affairs and to ensure that her interests and position are properly considered. I sense that he is motivated partly by a desire to salvage his own inheritance and partly by a craving for revenge against his sister and brother. To appoint him jointly and severally with a panel deputy would simply impede the decision-making process and increase the costs incurred by OL&#8217;s estate.</p>
