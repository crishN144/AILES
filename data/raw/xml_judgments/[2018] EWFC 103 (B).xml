The wife was persuaded that this was a good idea with some attractive sounding predictions of how this might work out well.

It has not been suggested that these shares were formally held on trust for the husband and wife in equal shares, but the circumstances of the purchase firmly point in the direction of these shares being matrimonial assets, strongly subject to the sharing principle.</span></p>

The only other shareholders are T (who holds 274,745 shares representing a 62.6% stake) and L (who holds 141,063 shares representing a 32.1% stake in the company). It can be seen from this that the husband, though no doubt having great influence from his role as Chief Executive, is very much a minority shareholder with little decisive power in comparison with the other shareholders. He cannot in practice access the value of the shares whilst he remains working for the company and it is common ground that it makes sense for him to continue working for the company for the remainder of his career. A likely scenario, especially given the ages of T (67) and L (72) is that the other shareholders will decide to sell the whole business as a going concern at some propitious moment in the years ahead; but this is by no means guaranteed. It may suit them (or their respective estates) to hold on to the shares.</span></p>

But that is not necessarily the end of the story because, in deciding how to structure an order, I need to bear in mind events which could potentially render one solution very unfair to one side or the other. For example, I did note from the evidence of the husband that the reaction of T, the majority shareholder, to this figure was &#8220;</span><span class="within-new" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">I am not getting out of there for &#163;12.5 million</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">&#8221; and I am conscious that a relatively small upturn in profitability would significantly increase this figure. Equally, a company with a high turnover and small margins runs risks of insolvency on a relatively small downturn in profitability. Thus, events could make this figure of &#163;12,500,000 look suddenly very large or suddenly very small. </span></p>

If the husband was to be compelled to take a large part of his capital in this shareholding and the wife instead to receive secure cash assets (which is the wife&#8217;s case) then a failure of the company would be disastrous and unfair for him. On the other hand, if the wife is expected to wait for her entitlement to receive her half share of the value of the shares and run the risk of a downturn eradicating this value (which is the husband&#8217;s case) then it is difficult to see that it is fair to deprive her of the upside of a good return by unfairly capping the value.

The counter-argument to this is that, given his relatively small percentage shareholding, the husband is not really in a position to manipulate the share sale scenario in the way feared by the wife. Also, by structuring a periodical payments award in such a way that the wife can seek a remedy in the event that the husband does manipulate the situation, I can hope to go some way to eliminating the likeliness of this happening, albeit that I am cautious about risking more litigation in the future.</span></p>

A clear and admitted illustration of his dishonesty here is his misrepresentation to the wife to the effect that a payment of &#163;9,750 in November 2016 was for the purchase of an interest in a horse when it was in fact a direct payment to J. When that was discovered the wife pursued the issue with vigour and was able, in the end, to uncover some significant facts. I do not think Mr Sharp was fair to characterise this as a &#8216;rummage in the attic&#8217;. I found the husband&#8217;s answers to Mr Sproull&#8217;s skilful questions on this subject to be not very convincing and I agree with Mr Sproull that it was an example of &#8220;stretching credulity&#8221;.

She is, in fact, officially registered as A&#8217;s carer, receiving carer&#8217;s allowance for 35 hours per week care at &#163;65 per week. For me it was a highly poignant part of the case listening to two loving and caring parents grappling with the suffering of their young daughter from the very difficult condition known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Plainly A&#8217;s experience of the condition is a severe one and this has very significantly sapped her ability and energy to live a normal life. With CFS, suffering can be severe, cures are elusive and timetables for recovery are unreliable. The future for poor A, which might otherwise have been a bright one, remains tantalisingly unattainable, though hopefully not for all time or even necessarily for a long time. I was entirely satisfied that both the parents dearly love A and have her interests at heart and it was perhaps an unfortunate part of the wife&#8217;s case that she allowed herself to think otherwise of the husband. I was impressed by the husband&#8217;s commitment (which he was happy to be recorded in my final order) to keep funding all treatment reasonably required by A. Whether this includes in the future the slightly controversial treatment provided by Dr F is something to be discussed in a sympathetic way within the family and I hope A&#8217;s voice will be predominant in that decision. </span></p>

The best estimate that I can suggest is that she should be able to find part-time employment at c. &#163;1,000 per month net as well as caring for A. I shall assess her on that basis. I would hope and expect that as and when A is well again, this would move upwards, but given the inability place a timetable on CFS recovery I think it would be too speculative to go beyond this at this stage and I cannot therefore agree with Mr Sharp&#8217;s wider projections.</span></p>

In his opening note Mr Sharp suggested that the wife would be over-housed by keeping the family home and that, instead, the family home should be sold and that both parties could be housed with a budget of &#163;450,000 (including SDLT). Although Mr Sproull&#8217;s closing presentation doesn&#8217;t really acknowledge this, the wife in her cross-examination broadly accepted what Mr Sharp had said. For myself, I also agree with Mr Sharp on this. Accordingly my order will be based on this proposition. The wife has little if any mortgage capacity so she will need cash assets to the value of &#163;450,000 and the husband&#8217;s offer contains a mechanism for bringing this about to which I find myself attracted. In so far as the husband&#8217;s readily available capital falls short of &#163;450,000 then I will need to factor into the figures his need to borrow the outstanding amount and pay it off before he is 62.</span></p>

This was not covered in detail at trial, but my own internet research suggests that this scheme has now been assumed within the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). If this is correct (and it really needs to be checked with the PPF before the final order is made) then the right order is a Pension Compensation Sharing Order against the husband&#8217;s rights to compensation from the PPF. It is, I believe, common ground that the order should be for 50% of the husband&#8217;s rights in the now PPF-funded compensation scheme.</p>

In addition they would each receive whatever half of the PPF rights amounted to (on which I have no information) and (at their respective State Pension Age of 67) state pension (no analysis has been done on this, as far as I can see anyway, but it seems to be assumed that both will receive full state pension, which is likely to be correct). To this might be added a share of the sale proceeds of the Y shares. Although some of the figurework is absent, it seems to me that this provision is such that the wife&#8217;s claim for &#8216;stock-piling&#8217; really cannot be made out and fairness dictates that I should exclude this item from the wife&#8217;s expenditure schedules.</p>

It cannot be done, in my view, without causing undue hardship. The obligations to A are part of that, but not the entirety of it. I give a non-binding steer to a future court that if A does make a good recovery and the wife no longer needs to care for her, then it may be reasonable to expect the wife to increase her earnings to the sorts of figures discussed in paragraph 16(v) above which might well justify a step-down, but probably not an elimination of the wife&#8217;s maintenance entitlement. I have declined to build in a step-down now as A &#8217;s prognosis is not clear enough.</p>

If no such substantial lump sum is forthcoming, in particular if the wife can establish that the husband has deliberately manipulated the Y share value to avoid having to make such a lump sum payment, then different considerations might apply.</p>
