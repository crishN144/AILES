It is believed that her parents are FG and JA.  All attempts to locate her parents have failed.  The Ghanaian High Commission has provided addresses for her parents to the local authority which duly wrote to those addresses.  The only response received has been from a woman living at the purported father&#8217;s address who informed the local authority that he was not known to her.</span></p>

The adults who brought her &#8211; her parents or persons posing as her parents &#8211; left the country on 31&#160;December 2012.  The local authority received a referral from a health visitor who had conducted a home visit to the property and discovered that a child was living there unrelated to DM or LA.  The local authority started an assessment in accordance with its private fostering guidelines.  On 20 June 2013 a social worker made an unannounced home visit to the property.  L initially gave a false name and date of birth but then stated that she had been brought to this country by her parents for a holiday.  During the interview, L&#8217;s account again changed after speaking to LA in the Ghanaian language.  LA and DM also gave an account which did not clearly explain to the social worker the circumstances in which L was at the property.  </span></p>

On 30 July the local authority filed an application for a care order.  Successive interim care orders have been made and L has remained in foster care, although regrettably she has moved foster placements on two occasions.  In view of the international aspect the case was transferred to the High Court.  On 21 October Mr Justice Roderic Wood made a case management order including directions for information to be obtained from the UK Border Agency and A Constabulary.  The Border Agency was only able to confirm the bare outline details of L&#8217;s arrival in this country as set out above.  The police indicated that they were not intending at that stage to pursue any further investigation.</span></p>

The Embassy replied indicating that it was not in a position to comply with that but did give details of the addresses of L&#8217;s parents.  It was to those addresses that the local authority wrote with the limited outcome indicated above.</span></p>

That assessment carried out by Dr B concluded that she was aged between 13 and 14.  Subsequently, L has told the local authority that her date of birth was 22 May 2000, which would make her now 13 years 9 months old in line with Dr B&#8217;s assessment.  The local authority also carried out a viability assessment of LA and DM.  That assessment recommended that L should not be placed in their care or that there should be some contact with that couple if she wished.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.62in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">    Fourthly, specific consideration needs to be given to L&#8217;s particular needs as a victim of child trafficking.  The guardian has identified AFRUCA as a resource that may be helpful in this regard. L&#8217;s own account of her past seems to be in some ways inaccurate and distorted.  She needs help in coming to terms with the truth and to coping with her circumstances.  In addition, it seems to the guardian, and I respectfully agree, that the local authority social worker is able to access the experience of other professionals who have dealt with cases of child trafficking.  </span></p>

I am satisfied that there is only one option in this case; namely that L be placed in the care of the local authority.  In my judgment her needs can only be met by such an order on the basis of the care plan for long-term fostering supplemented by the provisions identified by the guardian and set out above.  I therefore make a care order placing L in the care of A County Council. </span></p>

I would be grateful if the local authority counsel, Ms Watts, could arrange for that anonymisation to take place once the full transcript is available and I would ask her to submit the redacted version to me for approval before publication.</span></p>
