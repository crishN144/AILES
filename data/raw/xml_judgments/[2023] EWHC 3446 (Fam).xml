	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father has said the mother&#8217;s allegations are motivated by her and her family&#8217;s wish for him to enter the family business or take it over.  Another motive for the allegations made by the mother is said to be that she wanted to return to India to be with her family.  I bear in mind that the father does not need to prove a motive for what he says are the mother&#8217;s lies.  I remind myself that Courts know that sometimes it is impossible to say what has motivated a party to make the allegations that they have made.  Sometimes the most serious allegations are made for no reason at all. </p>

Mr Hale KC for the mother was asked if any special measures were required beyond the video link and he confirmed that nothing else was necessary.

He mentions that the father is an employee of a company where he is one of 10,000.  That could have been the point at which Mr S might have said that if the father joined the family business he would no longer be an employee but a company director or partner but there was no such comment.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question is why was it that she was not open with the court saying that she had left the jurisdiction.  Looking at it from her perspective, if what she is saying was true that she had been abused for many years in many different ways including by being coercively controlled by her husband, she had arrived in the Middle East but had not reached the relative safety of India.  She may have felt that the English authorities could have prevented her from leaving the Middle East to go to India.  It may have been fear that had driven her to keep quiet in this misleading way.  The father says it is another example of her dishonesty.  I am not convinced that he is right.</p>

Her aim was to get to India where she could have the support of her father and her family.  Her stop in the Middle East with her younger brother was the quickest way of getting out of England. The two brothers had discussed what she should do and agreed that the Middle East was where she should go.</p>

There was nothing lavish shown.  The mother&#8217;s spending habits were shown too by the father producing a statement from an add on credit card.   I noted the whole of July (I assume 2022) amounted to the spending of about &#163;250 in seven transactions.  There was other spending but bearing in mind the earnings of the father, this was insignificant.  </p>

His female cousin who gave evidence denied any financial support.  He told the police he had no other dependents.  It seemed to be highly likely in view of his attitude towards the mother&#8217;s spending that he insisted on her accounting for any expenditure and to assist with that he had set up alerts to tell him when money was spent.  A tight-fisted father is not necessarily one who financially controls his family, but I find in this case that he did.  </p>

She was not able to ask her husband the same question.   The maternal family was not trying to recruit the father to run or work in their family business.  They may have wanted their daughter to live in India but there was nothing that I read or heard which indicated more than a slight interference and this was certainly not the case in the father and mother&#8217;s daily lives in England. </p>

His answer that a broken finger caused by abuse is not the sort of thing to be reported to the police in India but is dealt with by the parents could equally apply to the abuse the mother suffered.

The mother alleged that when living in the north of England, the father would push the mother&#8217;s head hard into the wall and this caused her headaches. There was evidence in her medical records that the mother reported having headaches in 2015.  She told the doctor on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March that the headaches had resolved with antibiotics but there was a suggestion over the months that she had sinusitis.  She also had problems with her ears and on one occasion, dried blood was found in one of her ears.   The mother relied on a photograph of a broken coffee cup to show that the father threw items at her.  In the light of my finding above in relation to the assault, I find that the mother was being physically assaulted before 2016 and thereafter in the ways described.</p>

The father in his evidence said she had poured it over her own hand burning herself and she had gone to the GP.  The significance of this is the medical record shows that on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2019 the mother told the doctor that she had prickly heat rash on the back of her right hand, it had gone but it had left her with dry cracking skin.  There was no reference to burning coffee yet the father accepted she had gone to the GP.  It seemed to me an inference that I could draw is that she had hidden the cause of the burn from the doctor.  If she had poured coffee over herself, she would not have felt the need to hide this.  She was not willing to tell the doctor what was going on.  </p>

The father said the mother&#8217;s account is a pack of lies.  The mother said that she had told the truth.  In the Court&#8217;s experience, it is not unusual for victims of controlling and coercive behaviour (which I have found she is) to find it difficult to speak about what they have suffered.   Sometimes as the victim begins to feel safe and secure so they are able to speak out.  The Courts know that sometimes abuse remains hidden for months or even years.</p>

She had given the father lots of chances and he had said he would change, and she had wanted that to happen.  She wanted &#8220;a good family&#8221;.  She had thought that marriage was about sacrifice but in the end not to the extent of the abuse she had suffered.  She tried to keep the marriage going until the threat he made to her on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August 2022 frightened her so much she had to flee. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The mother told lies to the doctor and did not inform others such as midwives because she was in an abusive relationship which she was keeping to herself.  On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August 2022, the father threatened to kill her and to make it look like a suicide and threatened to send to others intimate photographs and videos of herself and him.  This frightened her so much that she rang the police and left.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I find the mother has proved the allegations made by her against the father.  He abused her and to a much lesser extent the children.  It was not the happy marriage portrayed by the father which was interfered with by the maternal family&#8217;s demands for him to work in the family business.  The mother&#8217;s account of a happy relationship to the community staff nurse was not a true one but she was not able to talk at that point about what was happening to her.  This was a relationship of control and violence on occasions where the father dominated the mother.  His dominance and control were shown in their sexual relations which were about the father&#8217;s wishes not the mother&#8217;s.  As a result of the mother&#8217;s cultural expectations which were a reflection of her upbringing, she felt she could not leave or complain.  Married at 19, her sexual education was entirely in the father&#8217;s hands, he led her to a varied sexual life but controlled the life they led.</p>
