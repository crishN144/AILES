Insurance policies are purchased with successive maturity dates, which are held on bare trust for the settlor (James). The settlor then takes all rights under the policies on a discretionary trust from which he is excluded from benefit but retains the maturity benefit. At the maturity date of the policy, the trustees (who will include the deputy) have discretion whether to postpone the maturity date, surrender the policy or allow it to mature. If the policy is allowed to mature, the benefit is to be paid to James. If the trustees do nothing, this is the default position.</p>

The proposed gift is within the current nil rate band so that although the creation of a discretionary trust is an immediately chargeable transfer, there will be no IHT immediately payable. If James survives for 7 years, the sum will be left out of account in calculating IHT on James&#8217;s estate, resulting in an IHT saving of &#163;130,000.</p>

At first sight, this appears to be a reservation of benefit. The reservation of benefit provisions avoid a person &#8220;having his cake and eating it.&#8221; However, it is well established that there is nothing to prevent a party from dividing property into separate rights and giving away only some of those rights and retaining others for himself. The rights retained were never given away in the first place, so no benefit has been reserved out of the gifted property: <span style="font-style:italic">Ingram v IRC</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 AC 293" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 AC 293</ref>. Such arrangements are known as &#8220;carve out&#8221; arrangements. The proposed arrangement is one such arrangement &#8211; the maturity benefit is not part of the property which is given to the trustees. It is not a benefit which is reserved out of the gifted property. Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs (&#8220;HMRC&#8221;) accepts this analysis: Fosters Inheritance Tax C4.16: Technical Note published May 2007.</p>

The insurance policies are intangible property. Pre-owned asset tax applies where the settlor retains the right to income from intangible property (such as an insurance policy) subject to a settlement: para 8 Schedule 15 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Finance Act 2004</ref>. This does not apply here because the maturity benefit is held on bare trust. A bare trust is not a settlement, even for tax purposes. James only derives a benefit under a bare trust. He is not entitled to any benefit under the settlement. HMRC accepts that POAT does not apply to arrangements such as this: HMRC Pre-Owned Assets Guidance, section 5.</p>

If the value of the property is left out of account, the liquid funds available to meet the cost of James&#8217;s future care, in the event that the proposal is implemented is  &#163;1.2 million (ignoring any future capital growth). James&#8217;s outgoings currently exceed his income. This is likely to continue at a rate of &#163;32,500 for the next 5 years. If outgoings exceed income at this rate for the rest of James&#8217;s life expectancy, James will be left with liquid capital cushion of &#163;387,500 plus the entire value of his home, even if capital growth is ignored. This adequately caters for contingencies. In order to exhaust James&#8217;s liquid capital (ignoring both capital growth and the value of his home), James&#8217;s costs would have to exceed his income by an average of &#163;51,1875 per annum over the remainder of his life expectancy (after the next five years). This is based on the wholly unrealistic assumption that there will be no capital growth. James&#8217;s safety net is potentially larger. Therefore, even if the proposal is implemented, there will be sufficient sums to meet James&#8217;s future needs, even on a cautious approach.</p>

The proposal should not be treated as equivalent to an absolute gift. James will be entitled to the capital if a policy is allowed to mature. Maturity of the policy is the default position in the event that the trustees do not exercise their discretion. As one of the trustees, this is within the control of the deputy. The proposal does not, in reality, damage James&#8217;s long term financial security.</p>

In the case of a person such as James, whose capacity has been severely impaired since birth, there is little (if any) scope for the court to rely on subjective beliefs and values. It is limited to relying on an assumption that James would have been guided by the belief that, all other things being equal, he should seek to arrange his affairs in such a way as to minimise insofar as is financially prudent and reasonably practicable, the exposure of his estate to IHT with a view to maximising the benefit from that estate receivable by his family. However, given that this is a mere generalisation and is not reflective of any particular beliefs or values that, in fact, are exhibited by James, the weight to be attributed to this factor must be limited. In more general terms, however, the Official Solicitor accepts that James would, if he had the requisite capacity, wish to benefit his parents (who, of course, are his primary carers) as far as is reasonably possible, practicable and sensible in the light of his own actual and potential needs and requirements.</p>

A clear example of such a case would be where an elderly person (but one with a life expectancy of more than seven years) has considerably more capital than he could reasonably need to meet, even on a worst-case scenario, his needs for the remainder of his life. The Official Solicitor submits, however, that a purely tax-driven disposal of assets can be in the best interests of the disponor only if the court is satisfied that the disposal of the capital would result in no risk to his future financial security, even on a cautious appraisal of his future needs.</p>

As noted above, James&#8217; life expectancy has been revised upwards since the date of the settlement. The Official Solicitor submits that, where a damages award has been calculated to make provision for an incapacitated person for the rest of his life, it cannot be said that any part of those damages is surplus to that person&#8217;s requirements and, hence, it cannot be in that person&#8217;s best interests to dispose of any part of his damages award. </p>

For example, if James&#8217; parents were to predecease him or become unable for them to care for him themselves, his care costs could well increase. It is in his best interests that he should retain sufficient capital to deal with such a possibility.</p>

Not only is he a 20-year old person with a life expectancy of perhaps 25 years, rather than an elderly spinster, but also the only capital that it is suggested he should give away is a share of a damages award calculated to meet his needs for a lifetime that was expected to be shorter than his current life expectancy. It is not a gift of an unexpected inheritance or other windfall, nor is it a gift of savings that, even on a cautious view, he will never need. On the contrary, James&#8217; medical condition is such that it would be prudent (and manifestly in his best interests) to prepare for (and to save for) every contingency to ensure that he can continue to meet his future needs, whatever they may be. Such needs cannot be predicted by James, by the deputy, by his parents or by the court and, accordingly, it cannot (the Official Solicitor submits) be in his best interests to dispose of assets that might otherwise be available to meet those needs (and which, it should be remembered, were the result of a negotiation with a paying party, viz. the health authority, in whose interest it was to minimise the amount payable to James). It should also be noted that the schedule of past and future losses shows a total amount claimed (excluding general damages) of &#163;2,881,931 but the compromise agreed was for a total of only &#163;2,220,854.20 (including interest). In a situation where a compromise was agreed, and full liability was not accepted, this makes it all the more likely that James&#8217; assets may be needed for his own care during his lifetime.   </p>

For example, if the proposed donee were in some particularly acute financial need and if the court were satisfied that it was in the best interests of the incapacitated donor to alleviate that need, it could well be in the latter&#8217;s best interests to make the gift notwithstanding that, all other things being equal, it would not be considered affordable or financially prudent to do so. In other words, the court should, it is submitted, be prepared to take a greater risk as to affordability where there is some compelling reason why the proposed gift is in the donor&#8217;s (non-financial) best interests.</p>

The proposal would result (subject to the observations set out below regarding IHT) in a financial benefit to James&#8217; parents (or the other beneficiaries of his estate) upon his death. It is stated that the proposed IHT saving would give rise to a greater prospect that James&#8217; parents would not have to move out of the property following his death in order to meet the IHT liability. In response to this, the Official Solicitor notes: (1) that any IHT payable in respect of the property could, as the law now stands, be paid over a period of ten years, thereby reducing the likelihood that the property would have to be sold; and (2) that the total IHT payable if James were to die today (<span style="font-style:italic">c.</span> &#163;800,000) would, on the deputy&#8217;s figures, be capable of being paid from James&#8217; assets other than the property.

Similarly, under the proposals, James&#8217; parents, as objects of the discretionary trusts, could during James&#8217; lifetime receive immediate benefits from a surrender of one or more of the policies.

The Official Solicitor notes that no permission has been given by the court pursuant to r. 120 of the Court of Protection Rules 2007 to any party to adduce expert evidence. He also notes that Mr Kelly, who is a director of the &#8216;financial services arm&#8217; of the deputy&#8217;s firm, cannot necessarily be considered an independent expert. In any event, however, the IHT implications of the proposals are not a matter for expert opinion but rather a mixed question of fact and law to be determined by the court with the benefit of such assistance as it may receive from the submissions of the parties. That said, the Official Solicitor accepts that the court may derive some assistance from Mr Kelly&#8217;s report and its addendum and he does not seek to prevent those documents from being considered by the court.</p>

In practical terms, that is correct. However, it appears from the instructions given to Mr Bretten QC and from clause 5 of the pro forma settlement that the precise mechanism is a little more complicated. As discussed above, it appears that all of the benefits are assigned to the trustees of the discretionary trust (from which the settlor is excluded from benefit) but that the trust period for any given policy terminates upon maturity, whereupon a reversionary interest belonging to the settlor falls into possession. The practical effect of this, of course, is that the settlor is entitled to the maturity benefits. In that respect, Mr Kelly&#8217;s simplified description accurately describes the outcome.</p>

In other words, this is a case of a &#8216;carve-out&#8217; or &#8216;shearing&#8217; scheme. The Official Solicitor accepts that retention by the donor of a reversionary interest does not amount to a reservation of benefit in the carved-out interest; for the reasons set out in the following paragraphs, his concern relates to the value of the retained reversionary interest.</p>

In fact, the value of those benefits is reflected in the value of the settlor&#8217;s reversionary interest. Whilst most reversionary interests are excluded property for IHT purposes (and, hence, not included in the beneficiary&#8217;s estate for the purposes of calculating its value for IHT purposes), that is not the case where the settlor himself is the reversionary beneficiary: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51" uk:canonical="1984 c. 51" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Inheritance Tax Act 1984</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51/section/48/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 48(1)</ref> (b).

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In the typical case, the retention of the reversionary interest as non-excluded property is not problematic from an IHT perspective because the value of that interest is likely to be only nominal whilst the policy in question is in force because the possibility always remains that the trustees might extend the term or surrender the policy. In other words, the settlor&#8217;s reversionary interest is precarious and its market value is effectively negligible. This is the typical case. In James&#8217; case, however &#8211; where, it should be remembered, James is the settlor &#8211; it is envisaged that the deputy would be one of the trustees and, hence, in a position effectively to veto any proposal to extend the term or to surrender the policy. In the present case, given that the deputy is under a fiduciary obligation by virtue of his appointment to act in the best interests of James, the Official Solicitor submits that James&#8217; reversionary interest is rather less precarious than in the typical case because it is rather more likely that the reversionary interest will fall into possession through an omission on the part of the trustees (forced upon them by the deputy&#8217;s veto) to extend the term or to surrender any given policy before its maturity date. For this reason, the Official Solicitor has considerable concerns that Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs (&#8216;HMRC&#8217;) would seek to place a greater-than-nominal value on the reversionary interest. Although this would not completely undermine the IHT analysis and the rationale of the scheme, it is clear that the greater the value placed on the reversionary interest by HMRC, the less advantageous from an IHT-saving perspective the scheme is likely to be.</p>

In the circumstances, therefore, there would be <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> grounds for an application by the beneficiaries of the settlement for the removal of the deputy as trustee because of his clear conflict of interests. If he were to be removed, the safeguards to which Mr Kelly refers &#8211; namely, the effective veto that the deputy would have over his fellow trustees to prevent the benefits passing away from James &#8211; would be removed. The Official Solicitor submits that the risk of such removal considerably reduces the benefits of the proposals to James and increases the likelihood that the terms of the proposed settlement could be executed in a manner inconsistent with James&#8217; best interests. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Subject to the caveat mentioned below, the Official Solicitor agrees with the first half of that sentence. However, he respectfully disagrees with the second half insofar as it is suggested that James could access the entire fund in an emergency. The only way to access the fund during James&#8217; lifetime and before the maturity of the policy in question would be to exercise the surrender right. However, the surrender benefits are held on the discretionary trust from which James must be excluded from benefit. Therefore, it is not the case that James could gain access to the entire fund in an emergency: any surrender would pass funds to the discretionary trust rather than to James. The caveat that is mentioned above is that the one-seventh of the total value that can be accessed in any given year could be accessed (by allowing the policy in question to mature) only on the maturity date. Crucially, it could not be accessed prior to the maturity date. Therefore, even if James had an urgent need of funds early in the year, he would have to wait until the maturity date in order to access those funds. In the circumstances, the Official Solicitor respectfully submits that the comment made at the first bullet point of paragraph 5 of the deputy&#8217;s letter to Miss McQuire dated 24.8.10 [p.375] is incorrect: the Trust Fund is not &#8216;readily available to the deputy.&#8217;</p>

It may be that a scheme of this sort that would be attractive to a 20-year old with an average life expectancy is less attractive to James.</p>

The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit.  In the present case the instance would be the acquisition of foolproof contraception.  Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counterbalancing dis-benefits to the applicant. An obvious instance in this case would be the apprehension, the risk and the discomfort inherent in the operation.  Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue.  At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses. Obviously only if the account is in relatively significant credit will the judge conclude that the application is likely to advance the best interests of the claimant.</p>

They refer to the matters which P would be likely to consider if he were able to make the relevant decision. P would be likely to consider any relevant beliefs and values and all other relevant factors. Therefore, the matters which the court must consider under these paragraphs of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref> involve the court in drawing up the balance sheet of factors which P would be likely to draw up if he were able to do so. Of course, the ultimate question for the court is: what is in the best interests of P? The court will necessarily draw up its own balance sheet of factors and that may differ from P&#8217;s notional balance sheet. The court is not obliged to give effect to the decision which P would have arrived at, if he had capacity to make the decision for himself. Indeed, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref> does not expressly require the court to reconstruct the decision which P, acting reasonably or otherwise, would have reached. Nonetheless, if the court considers the balance sheet of factors which would be likely to influence P, if P had capacity, the court is likely to be able to say what decision P would be likely to have reached. The court is not obliged to give effect to the decision which P, acting reasonably, would have made (the test of &#8220;substituted judgment&#8221;) but <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref> appears to require the court to consider what P would have decided (or, at least, the balance sheet of factors which P would be likely to have considered). My provisional view is that, in an appropriate case, a court could conclude that it is in the best interests of P for the court to give effect to the wishes which P would have formed on the relevant point, if he had capacity.&#8221;</p>

At the hearing, there was reference to the fact that lifetime gifts from Mrs G to C might result in some modest saving of inheritance tax on Mrs G&#8217;s death, depending on how long Mrs G continued to live after making any relevant lifetime gift. The submissions of Miss Rich and Mr Rees on that point attached comparatively little weight to that consideration. I agree with their approach. The tax saving possibility is a factor in favour of making the gifts in question but the factor has limited weight on the facts of this case having regard to the amount involved and the life expectancy of Mrs G. Nonetheless, this factor does not count against the making of the order which is sought. </p>

There should be nothing left over after his death. If the sum awarded runs out before then, it could be said that his parents and his deputy have been extravagant and imprudent.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">In the article of mine to which Lord Stewart referred, I also considered the effect on the family of the premature death of a claimant in personal injury or clinical negligence proceedings. I shall reiterate what I wrote to show that the court recognises the predicaments faced by the families of accident victims and tends generally to be sympathetic towards them.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;When advocating periodical payments in preference to a lump sum, it is usually suggested that, if the claimant dies prematurely, there will be no windfall for his or her estate, and the underlying assumption is that this would be a desirable, just and equitable outcome. For example, the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s Department said in its consultation paper, <span style="font-style:italic">Damages for future loss: giving the courts power to order periodical payments for future loss and care costs in personal injury cases</span> (March 2002):</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;If a claimant dies much earlier than expected, a lump sum award will provide a windfall for the heirs of that claimant and it will be they who benefit most from the award. It is sometimes argued that this does not matter because the lump sum payment still serves to penalise the defendant. But the purpose of tort law in these cases is to compensate claimants for loss, in particular by restoring them, so far as possible, to the financial position they enjoyed before the accident: it is not to punish defendants or provide heirs of the deceased with a financial gain beyond any compensation that was awarded to them by the court. And the cost of any &#8216;windfall&#8217; or &#8216;profit&#8217; is ultimately borne, for example, by other insurance premium payers or by users of the NHS.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The following extract, from a recent advice on settlement written by a leading personal injury silk, provides a slightly different, more humane, and maybe more realistic perspective on the effect of the claimant&#8217;s premature death on his or her family. In this case the claimant&#8217;s mother and litigation friend preferred to accept a conventional lump sum of &#163;2,850,000, and this was one of her reasons for making that decision:-</p>

Periodical payments would cease on his death.  A lump sum is likely to leave an inheritance.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I am inclined to agree. The argument about a potential windfall for undeserving beneficiaries tends to be overstated. In most cases, one or both of the claimant&#8217;s parents have given up work to care for their child, and may be the primary carers for ten or twenty years, or even longer. They become dependent on the damages award, and the child indirectly assumes responsibility for their maintenance: see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (deceased)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 All ER 665" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 All ER 665</ref>. There is often little prospect of their returning to the labour market if the child dies prematurely, and they could face hardship when the periodical payments cease on the claimant&#8217;s death, and their income stream vanishes instantaneously. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I mentioned earlier the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Wood v</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Wirral Hospitals NHS Trust</span>, where the claimant died a few days before her seventh birthday. With hindsight (and anyone can be wise after the event), it would have been preferable from her parents&#8217; perspective to have accepted a conventional lump sum instead of opting for periodical payments. Her premature death has left them with a property they can no longer afford to live in. They have a mortgage of &#163;100,000, no means to pay it, and an Inheritance Tax bill of &#163;50,000.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">As I have said, the court is generally sympathetic towards family members who take on a caring role and dedicate their lives to looking after an injured relative. It seeks to support them so far as is possible and practicable and in the best interests of the person concerned, and it does so in a variety of ways. However, it is not the function of the court to anticipate, ring-fence or maximise any potential inheritance for the benefit of family members on the death of a protected party, because this is not the purpose for which the compensation for personal injury was intended. The position would be different, of course, if the individual concerned had substantial funds surplus to his requirements that were derived from another source, such as an inheritance or a lottery win. For the sake of the record, each year between 300 and 400 claimants who have been awarded damages for personal injury or clinical negligence come within the court&#8217;s jurisdiction. Speaking from personal experience, over the last fifteen years the number of applications of this kind does not extend into double figures.</p>
