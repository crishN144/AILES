In no other way has he been a father to Duaine. The relationship with Duaine&#8217;s mother broke up before Duaine was born. There was some contact in the early years of Duaine&#8217;s life, but it appears that this was coincidental upon Keith&#8217;s visits to see Duaine&#8217;s brother, Deon. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Keith has ever showed the slightest interest in Duaine and there has been no contact since Duaine was 8 years old. He is now 30.</p>

Neither the applicant nor anyone known to her has had contact with him or his family for some years. He is believed to be in Jamaica. If I decide that he is to be notified or served, money would have to be spent in tracking him down. Ms Serwanga has indicated that this could cost a minimum of &#163;5,000. Ms Newey does not dispute this sum, and indicated that she does not consider this disproportionate, venturing that even &#163;10,000 may not be disproportionate. &#163;5,000-&#163;10,000 is a small proportion of a &#163;3.1m negligence award but is nevertheless considerable.

Olive St Barbe (&#8216;the patient&#8217;), who was 92 and had never married, was admitted to a nursing home in Kensington in June. There, she was befriended by a care assistant, Wallace Davey, 48, to whom she was married in highly suspicious circumstances on 30 October. On 18 December, when the patient was terminally ill, the Official Solicitor was appointed as her receiver and he immediately applied to the court, without giving notice to Mr Davey, for an order authorising him to execute a statutory will on her behalf. The hearing took place on 20 December before the deputy master, who made an order authorising the Assistant Official Solicitor to execute the proposed statutory will. The will was executed on 21 December and the court wrote to Mr Davey on the same day informing him of the order that had been made. The patient died on 27 December and Mr Davey appealed the order. Dismissing the appeal, Mr Justice Fox said as follows:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in">&#8220;The court, therefore, has a discretion as to what persons are to be made respondent to or given notice of the application. No doubt in the normal case the court would generally insist on the joinder of a person who was adversely affected by the relief sought, but in circumstances of urgency the position may be different. The deputy master quite clearly directed his mind to the question whether Mr Davey should be joined as a respondent and decided against it on the ground of delay. In the circumstances I think that that was a reasonable view for the deputy master to take. If Mr Davey had been joined as a respondent it is probable that he would have asked for time to consider putting in evidence and prepare his case; since the application was being heard on December 20 that would, very likely, have delayed matters until well after Christmas. If the deputy master had refused time, it seems most probable that Mr Davey would simply have asserted the validity of the marriage and would have asked that substantial provision be made for him. But that might have affected the interests of the relatives of the patient who would themselves have to be brought before the court to allow them to make representations. All that was bound to cause delay in circumstances where time might be crucial. Looking back, it seems unlikely that it could have been achieved by December 27 when the patient died. If the deputy master had decided to do nothing, then if the patient died before the matter could be investigated Mr Davey would, under the intestacy, take irrevocably a very substantial portion of her estate.&#8221;</p>

The circumstances of this case were not exceptional, nor were there compelling reasons to direct that service on PQ and his children should be dispensed with.</p>

Specifically, there is no mention of the overriding objective, the need to achieve procedural fairness, the risks of proceeding on untested evidence, or the potential; consequences to Keith of dispensing with service. Nor was there mention of the fact that Duaine&#8217;s best interests might be said to include not disinheriting his intestacy beneficiaries without giving them an adequate opportunity to present their case to the court.</p>

(The Official Solicitor is unlikely, in any case, to be in a position to go behind the applicant&#8217;s account of events which have happened years earlier. That is not to say that an alternative version of events might not be forthcoming. It is not difficult to envisage a case where an apparently absent father adduced evidence showing that he had been deliberately excluded from Duaine&#8217;s life). Giving weight to the prospects of success of the substantive application, let alone treating them (as the District Judge appeared to do) as a crucial factor in the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion allows an applicant to pull up the application to dispense with service by its own bootstraps. It is accepted that, in submissions before the judge the Official Solicitor indicated that it was open to the judge to take a view on the merits of the substantive application, although the decision was ultimately a procedural one, rather than a best interests one.</p>

If Keith is suspected of being in Jamaica, then more limited requests for information (say newspaper advertisements or a radio announcement on that island) might yield results. The Official Solicitor suggested that the judge should impose a cap on the amount to be spent searching for Keith. Alternatively, it would have been open to the court to direct substituted service (for example by sending letters to last known addresses of relatives, or placing newspaper advertisements). The learned judge failed to consider any of these.</p>

Virtually every application for a statutory will disinheriting an absent parent will give rise to some anxiety on behalf of the applicant. A real and credible risk of physical violence might in a particular case justify dispensing with service (although even there the usual approach would be to redact documents to remove addresses. This was the approach adopted by District Judge Batten in <span style="font-style:italic">Re AB</span>). However, a risk of anxiety arising (because of the past behaviour of third parties and not the person in respect t of whom the exemption is sought) should not override the other factors which would usually require that individual to be served.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">It is definitely not an urgent case. There is no emergency or need to act with great speed that would justify the court departing from its usual practice of joining as a respondent someone who is materially and adversely affected by the application. Duaine is 30 and has a normal life expectancy. He could live for another 45 years or more. At the handover meeting in 2005 I told Irma that the court can authorise the execution of a statutory will on behalf of someone who lacks testamentary capacity. It has taken her ten years to get round to making this application.</p>

Nobody knew whether she was alive or not. If she is still alive, she may be a suitable person to facilitate substituted service. The papers could be served upon her to serve upon Keith. I agree with Mr Rees that in the age of social media, a few online enquiries may assist in finding Keith or someone who is still in contact with him.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">I also agree with Mr Rees that District Judge Payne gave undue prominence to the cost of searching for Keith, though I accept that different judges may have different ideas on what is reasonable in the circumstances. Just as it was said that equity varied according to the length of each Lord Chancellor&#8217;s foot, so proportionality defies precision and predictability. In my view, Judge Payne&#8217;s concern over the expenditure of a four figure sum was unjustified, given the enormousness of the principle at stake and the extent of Keith&#8217;s disinheritance, if the court were to approve the statutory will as drafted.</p>

If, as we are led to understand, this harassment involved neither letters, nor visits nor calls, but resulted in considerable worry, one wonders what precisely it did entail and why it should have caused her so much anxiety.</p>

He may even entertain a remote hope of inheriting part of it someday. If so, there is all the more reason for serving the papers on him.</p>

In fact that is not the case. The Court of Protection deals several times a year with applications for permission to dispense with service of an application for approval of a statutory will, declaration of trust or the making of gifts, on a person who is a respondent to be served according to Practice Direction 9F. Typically such a respondent is a family member (often an absent father) who no longer has contact with P and those caring for P, and/or who has a poor relationship with them. Frequently such applications involve large sums of money.&#8221;</span></p>
