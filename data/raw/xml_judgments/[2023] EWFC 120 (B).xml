In essence, the order provided for the applicant (&#8220;H&#8221;) to exit the marriage with three rental properties (properties &#8220;A&#8221;, &#8220;B&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8221;) and for the respondent (&#8220;W&#8221;) to retain the former family home.

At that stage W was in person and had not yet filed any evidence, so it was not clear to what extent the factual background was disputed. At this hearing both parties have been represented by counsel, who both agreed that oral evidence was not necessary. The dispute is not about the facts: there is almost total agreement as to what has happened since the 2021 order was made. The issues between the parties are how each party&#8217;s conduct should be characterised; whether W&#8217;s conduct has caused H to suffer loss or detriment; and if so, what remedy (if any) should be granted. </p>

However it is worth observing that behind that order is a long history of litigation stretching back to 2016 (when H issued his Form A), including a contested preliminary fact-finding hearing on the extent of the parties&#8217; cohabitation prior to the marriage. By the time of the final hearing, three costs orders had been made against W. </p>

His order provided for the three rental properties to be transferred to H, subject to their existing mortgages. W was to retain the family home; her wish to continue to live there was &#8220;an aspiration not a need&#8221; and the recorder found it difficult to see how she would be able to afford the mortgage payments without access to rental income, but observed that that was a matter for her. There was a short-term maintenance order payable by H to W; this was intended to share the rental income in the short term while the parties restructured their finances, the recorder observing that both would be likely to need to sell assets in order to generate income. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The first hurdle faced by the parties was a refusal by each of the mortgage lenders to agree to a transfer of the rental properties into H&#8217;s name. This was probably foreseeable, given H&#8217;s financial position and the fact that all three properties were in W&#8217;s sole name, and from that point onwards there was no real dispute that the only possible outcome was that the properties would be sold. Indeed, Recorder Anderson had clearly anticipated in his judgment that H would need to sell some or all of the properties, although the 2021 order did not explicitly include a default sale provision.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is important to record at this stage that the parties&#8217; daughter, P, has suffered some significant and debilitating health issues following on from an injury in 2018. These issues were known to the recorder at the 2021 hearing, but sadly the recovery which he anticipated has not yet taken place. These issues have absorbed much of W&#8217;s time and attention and have impacted her own health also: her GP has confirmed that she has suffered from anxiety and stress. I have had this aspect of the background well in mind when considering the chronology of events since the final hearing. In particular I have had regard to a helpful chronology prepared on behalf of W, where significant developments in P&#8217;s health are recorded in blue alongside the events which are of direct relevance to these proceedings. </p>

W&#8217;s case was that she should do so as the legal owner of the properties, but H was not prepared to agree to this in circumstances where W had no interest in achieving the best possible selling price.

	      </authorialNote> that H should have sole conduct of the marketing process and sole discretion in respect of accepting offers, but once an offer was accepted W should have conduct of the sale, was an obvious compromise that should have been accepted immediately and without conditions attached. Indeed by late August it appeared it had been, although the position was complicated by the fact that by then W had granted a new 12-month tenancy on Property A on the basis that she could not pay the mortgage without the rental income. This was despite H&#8217;s offer to give W security for 6 months of mortgage payments<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

All W needed to do was ensure that Winkworths were allowed access to value and then market the properties.

However, once agreement had been reached, as long ago as August 2021, that the properties would be sold and there was also agreement in respect of the conduct of the sales, very little was required of W. All she needed to do was allow the agents access to the properties, and following on from that the majority of the &#8220;heavy lifting&#8221;, in terms of negotiating and agreeing the sales, would be done by H, until the point where W&#8217;s signature was required on the conveyancing documents. In fact, W&#8217;s attempts to resist implementation have required far more effort on her part. In my judgement, the difficulties W has faced might act as a shield for a party who has buried her head in the sand and done nothing. A party who has been actively engaged in a number of endeavours, all intended to resist an inevitable outcome, is in a very different position. </p>

It seems to me that one answer to Mostyn J&#8217;s argument in <span style="font-style:italic">BT</span> is that many &#8220;deliberate frustration&#8221; cases might well fail the first limb of <span style="font-style:italic">Barder</span> on the basis that the events in question were foreseeable, especially if the responsible party has a history of obstructive behaviour.

During the course of submissions I asked Mr Tait, for W, what other remedy would be available where, prior to implementation, one spouse has culpably and foreseeably reduced the value of an asset that is within their control but is due to pass to the other spouse on implementation. Mr Tait suggested that if an undertaking has been given, the other spouse could apply for committal for breach; or that, if the asset in question is real property, there might be a remedy in a different court under TLATA 1996. But those remedies are cumbersome and uncertain (committal does not of course provide a financial remedy at all), and their availability is contingent on the nature of the asset and the terms of the order. </p>

This is particularly obvious in property sale or transfer cases, where, however tightly-drafted the order, the owner of the property is likely to have a number of opportunities to obstruct and delay the sale or transfer, or otherwise to diminish the value of the asset, in the pre-implementation period. The <span style="font-style:italic">Thwaite</span> jurisdiction would appear to be the only remedy available in such cases, where the change in circumstances has been brought about by a foreseeably disaffected spouse, rather than an unforeseeable event.</p>

Mr Stirling suggests that because this course of action is not prohibited by the Family Procedure Rules, the power exists and may be exercised in an appropriate case. Mr Tait argues that the provisions of CPR 1998 r.73.10C (and the notes on that provision in the Red Book) make it very clear that a charging order is a necessary first step before a separate application for an order for sale can be made, and that a creditor with the benefit of a charging order is not entitled to an order for sale as of right.

If this order is seen (as I consider it should be) as a variation to the original periodical payments order, justified by the unexpected and significant delays in implementation and intended to go some way to compensate H for the loss of income he had suffered as a result, then in my judgement W&#8217;s objections, including the objection to the September 2021 backdating, fall away. </p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"> The equity in the four rental properties, after the unauthorised borrowing is added back, is c. &#163;715,000. The family home was worth a minimum of &#163;1.5m in 2021; for present purposes I will use that figure, although H has obtained a market appraisal which suggests an asking price of &#163;2 &#8211; 2.2m W says the current borrowing stands at &#163;600,000 so equity after costs of sale is c.&#163;855,000. &#163;855,000 plus &#163;715,000 = &#163;1.57m. CGT at the time of the 2021 order was calculated at &#163;205,000; the values of the rental properties have not increased significantly, so that figure is good enough. &#163;1.57m - &#163;205,000 = &#163;1.36m. &#163;120,200 as a % of &#163;1.36m is 8.8%. </p>
	      </authorialNote>. A payment of that amount from W to H will therefore shift the division of capital between the parties from a 51/49 split<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="13">

The departure from equality therefore flows directly from the increased borrowing against Property B and the reduction in value of Property A, and is the minimum necessary to compensate H for what W&#8217;s actions have cost him. </p>
