	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SF is a 44 year old woman from Scotland who has been treated in a psychiatric unit and then cared for in supported living for a total of seven and a half years in England. She has a lifelong diagnosis of moderate intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, associated periods of severe anxiety, and a diagnosis of difficult to treat schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type). It is not in dispute that she lacks capacity to conduct this litigation and to make decisions about residence and care. She is the subject of a Scottish Guardianship Order which the Applicant Council applies to be recognised and enforced in England. The Third Respondent Council, in whose area SF is currently cared for, was concerned that the SF was being deprived of her liberty in her current placement without lawful authority and made an application to bring the matter before the Court of Protection. In March 2023 Aberdeenshire Council made its application for recognition and enforcement and HHJ Scully ordered that they should become the Applicant and Sunderland City Council should become the Third Respondent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application is before me to determine the place of SF&#8217;s habitual residence. Once that issue is determined, further directions will be required to resolve the remaining issues in the case. All three represented parties contend that SF&#8217;s habitual residence is in Scotland but the matter is not straightforward. The Second Respondent, EF, SF&#8217;s mother, was too unwell to attend the hearing and is not represented. I do however have written evidence from her which is part of a very large bundle of evidence. The skeleton arguments from Leading Counsel for this hearing have been extremely helpful.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that, as agreed by the parties, SF lacks capacity to conduct this litigation and to make decisions about her residence and care.  A very detailed capacity assessment report dated 27 July 2022 by Dr Ostrowski, Specialist Psychiatrist in Autism, fully supports that conclusion in accordance with the principles set out in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>: the presumption of capacity is displaced and the lack of capacity in the respects identified above is proved. The conclusions reached by Dr Ostrowski apply equally today as they did in July 2022. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the issue of habitual residence, the brief chronology of relevant events is that from her birth until 2007 SF lived with her parents in Scotland. She has an elder brother, GF &#8211; he and members of the wider family live in Scotland. Her mother is still alive but her father died in 2022. Following a marked deterioration in her health in 2007, SF was admitted as a hospital in-patient for three months before being discharged back to her parents&#8217; home. Over the next three years SF had long in-patient admissions as well as time at the family home but in November 2010 her parents reported that they were unable to manage her behaviour and she was re-admitted to hospital where she remained until discharge to a residential support service in January 2012. In May 2014 she was re-admitted to hospital. By then her behaviour was very difficult to manage &#8211; she was physically aggressive to staff and other patients and often required prolonged restraint by four or five members of staff.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In July 2015 SF was referred to a psychiatric hospital (Hospital J) in England and in January 2016 she was transferred to Hospital J under detention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. By the end of 2017, it was considered that SF was clinically fit for discharge and attempts were made by Aberdeenshire Council to find suitable accommodation and care service providers for her in Scotland. In short, those attempts were unsuccessful. Eventually, in June 2022 SF was moved from Hospital J into a &#8220;step down&#8221; placement in England. By then, she was on MHA s17 leave which expired on 5 August 2022. Since then, SF has remained at her current supported placement with 24 hour care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 1 February 2016, on application by her parents, SF was made the subject of a Scottish Guardianship Order (SGO) for financial and welfare decisions for a period of up to five years. On 16 June 2021, a renewed Welfare and Financial SGO was made for a further seven years. Neither the 2016 nor the 2021 SGO states on its face that the Court (a Sheriff in each case) was satisfied that SF was habitually resident in Scotland. In the application for the 2016 SGO it was stated that SF was habitually resident in Scotland. In the application for the 2021 SGO, SF&#8217;s parents as the applicants &#8220;craved&#8221; the court,</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The power of the Sheriff to make an SGO is provided for by Part 6 of the AI(S)A 2000. Schedule 3 paragraph 1(2) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> could not have applied to give the Sheriff jurisdiction to make the SGO in 2021 because Art 7, which is concerned with the provision of notice to or from another contracting state, was not mentioned in the application and was evidently not complied with. The application for the renewed SGO refers to SF&#8217;s domicile but that is not a relevant concept for the purposes of the 2000 Convention or the AI(S)A 2000. The application is therefore confused. As already noted, neither of the SGOs themselves record a finding that SF was habitually resident in Scotland but I am entitled to assume, and do, that the Sheriff making the SGO in 2021 had found that they were satisfied that they had jurisdiction on the basis that SF was habitually resident in Scotland when they made their order. Unless they were satisfied that SF was habitually resident in Scotland, they would have had no jurisdiction to make the order. I proceed on the basis that the 2021 SGO was properly made and that the Scottish court found that SF was habitually resident in Scotland when it made the SGO on 16 June 2021.</p>

The measure "is to be recognised" if taken on the grounds that the individual was habitually resident in the country where the order containing the measure was made. The grounds on which a measure may be challenged may be procedural (paragraph 19(3)) or substantive (paragraph 19 (4). By reason of paragraph 21, however, which as stated above provides that for the purposes of paragraphs 19 and 20 any finding of fact relied on when the measure was taken is conclusive, there is no power to challenge the finding made in the foreign Court that the individual is habitually resident in that country. Accordingly, a finding of a foreign Court that the individual concerned was habitually resident in that country cannot be challenged in any process to recognise or enforce a measure in this country, although the process by which the measure was ordered may be challenged (for example, if the individual was not given an opportunity to be heard) and the measure itself may be challenged (for example, if inconsistent with a mandatory provision of law of this country).&#8221;</p>

Given my determination that in June 2021, upon making the renewed SGO, the Sheriff must have been satisfied that SF was habitually resident in Scotland and that therefore the court had jurisdiction to make the SGO, it follows, applying Baker J&#8217;s approach and the recognition and enforcement provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> Schedule 3, paragraphs 19 to 24, that there is no power to challenge the finding made in Scotland in June 2021 that SF was habitually resident in that country. There is no challenge to the measure itself. It might be contended that the determination of habitual residence for the purposes of jurisdiction to exercise the powers under the MCA2005 is not part of the &#8220;process to recognise and enforce a provision in this country&#8221; [Baker J, above] but the determination of habitual residence for the purposes of the application by Aberdeenshire Council, <span style="font-style:italic">is </span>for the purpose of that process and the court has ordered that Aberdeenshire Council be made the Applicant in these proceedings. That is therefore the application in which the determination of habitual residence is being made. In any event, it would be unfortunate for the court to be bound by the finding of habitual residence at a particular point in time for one purpose, but to come to a different finding about habitual residence at that same time for another purpose. As it is, I am bound by the finding of habitual residence made by the Scottish court in June 2021.</p>

The first is a report from March 2021 from a Mental Health Officer for Aberdeenshire Council in support of the SGO renewal application. He interviewed SF and spoke to her parents, the Team Manager from Aberdeenshire Council, Ms H, who had worked with SF for many years, and a nurse from Hospital J. He reported on her agitation and aggression and the frequent use of restraint and, even more often, seclusion. SF would spend many hours in seclusion to calm her down and keep her calm. Another report is an Autism report from May 2021. This again mentions frequent threats against staff and periods of severe anxiety and agitation. It does mention that, </p>

The nature of their stay has been for the purpose of receiving treatment, but this has had a sufficient degree of stability to acquire habitual residence. At the time each moved to X Hospital, the plan was for him to remain there for an indefinite period and it has been their home for a substantial proportion of their lives. It is accepted that neither DB nor EC can be said to have socially integrated in the community in the way that might ordinarily be expected for adults who have lived in another jurisdiction for such an extended period of time. Neither DB nor EC has employment, nor does either attend any kind of day care service outside the hospital. Neither has any friends in England outside the hospital. In assessing whether that is sufficient to establish habitual residence, however, the court must look at the individual circumstances in each case. The hospital forms the centre of interest for their lives and they are fully integrated there. Each has a degree of integration in the hospital community.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case I agree with Ms Roper KC that the issue of habitual residence is finely balanced. Aberdeenshire Council brings this application and contends that SF is habitually resident in Scotland. SF is either habitually resident in Scotland or England. I have approached the determination on the basis that I must consider whether the evidence establishes on the balance of probabilities that SF is habitually resident in Scotland or whether it establishes that on the balance of probabilities SF is habitually resident in England. There are many striking similarities with the case of DB in <span style="font-style:italic">DB and EC</span>. However there are also some differences. Firstly, before the move to England SF was very well integrated into family life and the social environment in Scotland because she had lived in the community with her family until the deterioration in her condition in her late 20&#8217;s. She was not a long-term in-patient as a child. She always returned to the family home in Scotland when discharged from hospital as a young adult. Secondly, SF appears to have been even less integrated into the hospital community of staff and other residents than DB or EC. Thirdly, on moving SF to England there was not a plan for an &#8220;indefinite&#8221; stay. Rather, there was a specific management plan that was in fact accomplished within two years of the move to England and within a year of her being moved to the ward at Hospital J where the work could begin in earnest. The end goal of transition to a community placement, always expected to be in Scotland, was thwarted due to lack of resources. Fourthly, from as long ago as the end of 2017 there has been a continuing expectation of SF returning to Scotland as soon as possible and there are ongoing attempts to secure suitable accommodation and care for her in Scotland to allow her to return there. Fifthly, there was no finding by a Scottish court that DB or EC were habitually resident there. Whilst I have noted that there is no express finding to that effect for SF, the 2021 SGO enables me to conclude that the Scottish court found that it could be satisfied of SF&#8217;s habitual residence in Scotland, even five years after she had been an in-patient in England.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SF&#8217;s condition restricts her integration into the social environment wherever she is living. I am however struck by the connections SF still has with her family in Scotland. Albeit she has been in England for several years now, her mother, brother and wider family remain in Scotland and she has a degree of integration with them. She has no family at all in England. Further, her residence in England has had a temporary nature throughout which, I find, has contributed to depriving her stay in England of a sense of stability. The inordinate delay in finding appropriate accommodation and care for her in Scotland has, if anything, underlined the instability of her living arrangements in England. In this case the fact that the Scottish court must have found that SF was habitually resident in Scotland in June 2021 is of considerable importance. For the reasons given, that finding cannot be challenged. Although circumstances have changed since June 2021, both in terms of the length of stay in England and SF&#8217;s living arrangements, those changes do not appear to me to be of great significance when viewed in the context of the circumstances as a whole. There is no greater stability to SF&#8217;s stay in England now than there was in June 2021. Weighing all the facts and matters available to me I have concluded that it is established that SF remains habitually resident in Scotland. </p>
