Judge Rogers was considering the appropriate welfare arrangements for AG, a young woman born in October 1985. His order is dated 3 September 2013. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appeal is brought by AG&#8217;s mother, DG. Her grounds of appeal are dated 22 September 2013. Her application for permission to appeal was considered on the papers by Parker J on 19 December 2014, who observed that the case was not suitable to be dealt with on paper and directed that it should be listed for hearing. At an oral hearing on 14 January 2015, having heard DG&#8217;s counsel, I granted permission to appeal on all of her grounds of appeal. The appeal came on for hearing before me on 19 May 2015. DG was represented by Mr James Dixon and Mr James Fraczyk, the local authority by Ms Justine Lattimer, and the Official Solicitor, AG&#8217;s litigation friend, by Ms Nageena Khalique QC. At the end of the hearing I reserved judgment. I am sorry that it has been so delayed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AG was born, as I have said, in 1985. When she was about five years old she was diagnosed as having a moderate learning disability and autistic spectrum disorder. In 2007 she was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as suffering depression. In 2007 AG took a tenancy of a property I shall refer to as OG, though she continued for a time to live with her mother. Thereafter she continued to live either at OG or with DG. In March 2011 AG made an allegation, though without details, that DG had hit her. In June 2011 DG reported that AG had attacked her. She also reported tensions at home and difficulties in caring for AG. A safeguarding investigation ended in July 2011 with an &#8220;inconclusive&#8221; determination but with a plan for AG to leave DG&#8217;s home and return to OG with a 24 hour live-in care package, for which the local authority assumed responsibility in August 2011.</p>

AG was reported as having said on more than one occasion that she did not want to visit DG. In November 2011 the care provider served notice terminating the care contract. On 16 November 2011 AG moved from OG to a placement at HH. An urgent DOLS authorisation was granted the same day, followed by a standard authorisation on 22 November 2011.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;That hearing on 2nd November 2012 was very important for a number of reasons. In the first place it made a number of important declarations. It scrutinised the care plan before the court, which was very controversial. It involved the local authority and the Official Solicitor taking different views as to timescale and the mother of AG (DG) herself taking a different view again.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">After that hearing I sanctioned, in broad terms, the local authority&#8217;s care plan, but, to some extent accelerated the timescale that had then been placed before the court. It involved a very important change in AG&#8217;s circumstances, away from residential care into semi-independent living and that of course had to be managed with great care, both in terms of preparation for her and in the choice of placement and the preparation for her move.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The matter was due to be resolved in about the middle of 2013 and the time scale has, unfortunately, slipped a little bit, hut the matter was restored before me on 27th March where further declarations were made and one of them at paragraph 4 was: &#8220;It is in AG&#8217;s best interest to move to a supportive living placement in &#8230; as soon as reasonably practicable (a target for this being achieved being June 2013).&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The local authority of course was continuing in its duty to manage the case and prepare when the matter came back before me on 27th June, but the timing was important. It was about the end of the proposed timescale, as envisaged, and coincided with the collection of evidence and the decision-making internally of the local authority.</p>

I was persuaded (particularly on the application of the local authority, with no active opposition from the Official Solicitor, who was keen for there to be progress although to a large extent he remained neutral as to the detail) that declaration number 3 should be made, namely: &#8220;It is in AG&#8217;s best interest to reside at &#8230; and to receive care there in accordance with applicant&#8217;s care plan until her transfer to supportive living accommodation as set out in paragraph 4 below. 4. It is in AG&#8217;s best interest to move to a supported living placement at [DC] as soon as reasonably practicable. A target for this being achieved being 15th July 2013 and to receive a care package in accordance with her needs as assessed by the local authority, such care package being delivered by the applicant local authority and (an agency I will call) AC.</p>

It is apparent from her counsel&#8217;s very helpful skeleton arguments, one dated 7 November 2014 and the other dated 14 May 2015, that the major thrust of DG&#8217;s case relates to ground (b). </p>

He went on (para 5) to say, and in my judgment, he was entitled to conclude in the light of all the expert and other evidence he had, that capacity was not &#8220;in any real sense&#8221; in issue &#8220;either now or foreseeably in the future.&#8221; That order, as I have said, was not appealed. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;This final hearing, therefore, has concentrated upon three issues. The first, capacity, I deal with summarily. I am quite satisfied that I dealt with that fully at the main hearing and that the direct declarations which were appropriate have been confirmed from time to time. I simply do not accept Mr Dixon&#8217;s invitation, in effect to re-open capacity and, if appropriate, to adjourn the proceedings for further assessment. That, it seems to me, would be wrong as a matter of principle, given the findings have already been made, but, also, not warranted on the facts of this case because there is no obvious new material which draws into doubt the evidence which was clear and all one way at those earlier proceedings.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Mr Dixon&#8217;s submission is that it is desirable when a declaration in terms of capacity is made in a general sense but then a specific issue is to be decided some time later, that capacity should be revisited. As a general proposition the declaration of capacity should be as close to the relevant decision as possible; 1 agree with him in relation to that. </p>

Accordingly, although we have not explored the matter in detail, I am quite satisfied that capacity is already determined and should not he reopened and these declarations, therefore, from November and dealt with in my judgment reviewing the evidence will stand.&#8221;</p>

As Ms Khalique correctly points out, there was no evidence to suggest that AG&#8217;s capacity was fluctuating, dynamic or likely to alter in the future. They both submit that Judge Rogers was right to decide as he did in September 2013 and for the reasons he gave.</p>

Mr Dixon accepts in terms, in both skeleton arguments, that there was &#8220;no new material&#8221; before Judge Rogers in September 2013. This is noteworthy because, as the order I had made on 14 January 2015 indicated, there had been a suggestion during that hearing that there <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> new material. It was for that reason that my order required the filing of &#8220;a succinct summary of the evidential material and submissions placed orally before HHJ Rogers relating to the circumstances and matters relied upon in support of the assertion that the question of AG&#8217;s capacity needed to be revisited.&#8221; No such material was produced at the hearing of the appeal. On the contrary, the skeleton argument dated 14 May 2015 &#8220;accepted that there was no new material before HHJ Rogers.&#8221; That, in my judgment, is really the end of the argument. </p>

The task of a judge sitting in the Court of Protection is to concentrate on the issues that really need to be resolved rather than addressing every conceivable legal or factual issue: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN (Adult) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/411" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 411" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 411</ref>, para 104. Of course, there are cases where expert opinion or observable events will point to the need to keep the question of capacity under appropriate review. This was not such a case. There was here simply nothing, whether in the previous expert reports or in subsequently reported events, to justify, let alone require, Judge Rogers to embark upon a course which he rightly rejected.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The hearing proceeded principally almost exclusively in terms of the discussion of the future position for AG. There were, of course, in the background a number of serious factual allegations which were unresolved and they have not been tried in the course of this hearing. In that passage from the Official Solicitor&#8217;s statement he records that at the pre-hearing review that issue was canvassed and specifically the local authority decided not to press for a fact finding hearing, notwithstanding DG&#8217;s particular desire, as she saw it, to clear her name. I supported the local authority&#8217;s decision in this case and I remain convinced that it was right that we did not devote a disproportionate time and court resources to an investigation of what has gone on in the past. That is not to say it is ignored and of course to some extent it will feature in the background, but I remain firmly of the view that even if some additional factual clarity would have emerged it would not materially have affected my overall approach to the case. I urged the parties, if I may say so, particularly DG, to be realistic about where we are at the present time and to recognise that we must start from that position when we look to the future. I bear in mind, however, that those allegations have been made but are strongly denied by DG and, applying a normal approach to the forensic fact finding enquiry, in the absence of the specific findings. I do not hold them in the background as it were by way of a suspicion lurking over DG.&#8221;</p>

It is submitted that in the absence of the original allegations there would never have been any proceedings; that in order to have a proper basis for making the decisions it eventually did, the court should have made factual findings; and that the orders are in truth based on unsubstantiated and tenuous allegations. A number of reasons are identified by Mr Dixon as to why the interests of justice required there to have been a fact finding hearing in this case: (a) DG had always denied the allegations against her; (b) the allegations were serious and DG ought to have had an opportunity to be heard on them and to defend herself &#8211; as quintessential principles of natural justice, it is submitted, demanded; (c) the allegations formed the basis of what are described as very far-reaching best interests decisions, significantly restricting both AG&#8217;s and DG&#8217;s Article 8 rights and in fact involving a deprivation of AG&#8217;s liberty; and (d) the allegations, though never proven, continue to have a profoundly stigmatising effect on DG and to hamper her attempts to have contact with AG.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">&#8230; I agree that there must be good reason for local authority intervention in a case such as the present. Equally, if there are disputed issues of fact which go to the question of Mr S&#8217;s capacity and suitability to care for S, the court may need to resolve them if their resolution is necessary to the decision as to what is in S&#8217;s best interests. Findings of fact against Mr S on the two issues identified in para [16] would plainly reflect upon his capacity properly to care for S. But it does not follow, in my judgment, that the proceedings must be dismissed simply because the factual basis upon which the local authority instituted them turns out to be mistaken, or because it cannot be established on the balance of probabilities. What matters (assuming always that mental incapacity is made out) is which outcome will be in S&#8217;s best interests. There will plainly be cases which are very fact specific. There will be others in which the principal concern is the future, and the relative suitability of the plans which each party can put forward for both the short and long-term care of the mentally incapable adult. The instant case, in my judgment, is one of the cases in the latter category.</p>

In a field as complex as care for the mentally disabled, a high degree of pragmatism seems to me inevitable. But in each case it seems to me that the four essential building blocks are the same. First, is mental incapacity established? Secondly, is there a serious, justiciable issue relating to welfare? Thirdly, what is it? Fourthly, with the welfare of the incapable adult as the court&#8217;s paramount consideration, what are the balance sheet factors which must be drawn up to decide which course of action is in his or her best interests?&#8221;</p>

As Ms Khalique puts it, although the proceedings had been issued against the background of the safeguarding concerns arising out of the various allegations, matters had progressed and the court was faced with a different landscape. Judge Rogers correctly recognised that he was looking at the <span style="font-style:italic">present </span>position and looking to the <span style="font-style:italic">future</span>. Given how matters then stood, the degree of enquiry undertaken by Judge Rogers during the hearing in October / November 2012 was, says Ms Lattimer, entirely sufficient to inform the decisions in respect of <span style="font-style:italic">future planning</span> for AG that the court was tasked with making. A lengthy and costly finding of fact hearing would, she submits, have been entirely disproportionate. I agree.</p>

I do not accept that. The application was made in good faith and properly by the local authority and not objected to by the Official Solicitor and the material available before me in June, plainly, demonstrated the need for such a decision. It is noteworthy that the objective was to achieve the timescale that in the November, earlier, I had thought so important, essentially relying upon the evidence of independent social worker Mr M. I remain of the view that the timescale was important and there was no contrary material from DG.&#8221;</p>

I hope that AG can learn to understand that her mother loves her and has much to offer her and will be there for her. It may be, as Mr M suggests, that to some extent an entrenched view has been adopted and as a result of the allegations having been made, and they cannot be retracted, that there is a certain awkwardness and difficulty which will have to be overcome. It will be difficult, I do not doubt that, and DG will have to put aside some of her reservations. But contact, if it can be achieved, must be attempted. Of course, again, AG must not be forced. But again it may be there is a nuance of difference between me and Mr M in this. It seems to me that AG must be given quite active encouragement in terms of how she approaches the resumption of a relationship with her mother. There is a fine line, as [counsel for the local authority] submits, between pressure and encouragement. I cannot define that line. It is fact specific, but I hope that the local authority will do all that it possibly can to ensure that a resumption of contact occurs in the short term. If it can and if the family are brought back on board then there is every hope that the move into supported accommodation will be very much more easily achieved. I will hear further submissions about contact but I am anxious not to be prescriptive or defining beyond what I have said.&#8221;</p>

Everyone accepts that it should move on and the local authority has accepted that within the time scale laid down earlier they should take the shorter rather than the longer route and after about eight weeks move to a weekly basis for contact. On any view, therefore, I am only really debating the next three weeks in terms of weekly or fortnightly. I don&#8217;t know exactly when the next visit will occur.

She should be given every support and Mr M&#8217;s sensible suggestion that her care plan should not only be set out in narrative form, but also should be easily comprehensible in grid or diary type form so that everyone knows where they stand is a useful contribution I do not direct that but it is obvious common sense.&#8221;</p>
