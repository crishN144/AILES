	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties to these financial remedy proceedings are AT and BT.  For the sake of convenience, and meaning no discourtesy to either, I shall, in this Judgment, refer to the parties respectively as &#8220;the wife&#8221; and &#8220;the husband&#8221;.</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_2">

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">By a Form A dated 21 January 2021, the husband made an application for a financial remedy order.  At an earlier directions hearing I ordered that, since, in reality, the wife was the person seeking financial provision from the husband, the wife should henceforth be treated as the applicant.  I suggest that consideration should usually be given at an early directions hearing to such an order in the relatively unusual cases where the person who makes the first application is, in reality, the respondent to the financial remedy application.</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_3">
	    <num>3</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In these contested financial remedy proceedings, the wife has incurred costs of &#163;833,295 and the husband has incurred costs of &#163;904,352.  There have been contested and very difficult proceedings between the parties in respect of their children and, in those proceedings, the wife has incurred costs of &#163;570,000 and the husband incurred costs of &#163;550,658.  Accordingly, the parties have, together, incurred costs which stand, globally, at &#163;2,858,305.</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_4">
	    <num>4</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">This case raises issues not only of computation but of the proper approach of the court to the sharing principle and to the principle of compensation.  In essence, the husband maintains that this is a pure needs case and the wife asserts that this is a full sharing case.  </p>
	    </content>
	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_5">
	    <num>5</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">As is usual in these cases, there are many relatively minor issues between the parties which need to be resolved, but the headline difference between the parties is that the wife seeks a lump sum of &#163;9.145 million and the husband offers a lump sum of &#163;3.545 million.  In addition, it is agreed that the wife will retain a property in Country X referred to by everybody in this case as &#8220;SB&#8221;, a property with an agreed value of &#163;195,000, which I round down to &#163;190,000 having taken off the notional costs of sale.</p>
	    </content>
	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_6">
	    <num>6</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The fundamental differences between the parties may be summarised thus.  The wife asserts that significant sums held in trust are, in reality, assets to which the husband has access, and that they should form part of the sharing principle for which she contends.  The wife seeks an equal sharing of the assets which she asserts form part of the computational exercise.  While the wife agrees that some of the assets are non-matrimonial in character, she contends that the pre-marital assets have become, to use her counsel&#8217;s phrase, &#8220;matrimonialised&#8221;.  Moreover, she contends that, to the extent to which the doctrine of pre-acquired assets might usually justify a departure from equality, that departure is rebutted by the application of the doctrine of compensation.</p>
	    </content>
	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_7">
	    <num>7</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband asserts the sums held in trust are non-matrimonial assets and should not form part of the court&#8217;s computation and, in any event, he contends that this is a needs case and that the wife&#8217;s claim should be approached on that basis.  He relies in particular on the fact that a significant part of the portfolio does not form part of the matrimonial assets because they were pre-acquired by him.  I should say when, as I have just stated, the husband asserts that the sums held in trust are non-matrimonial, it is common ground that the N Trust itself, to which I shall return, is a nuptial settlement.  The husband&#8217;s case, however, is that that trust is a generational trust which is there for the benefit of his children and their descendants, and it is in that context that I have suggested that he has characterised it as non-matrimonial.</p>

The contested Children Act proceedings came before Keehan J in March and April 2022 and, on 1 April 2022, he ordered that the children shall live with their father and that there should be no contact between the mother and VT until the beginning of May 2022.  Thereafter, contact between the mother and VT was to be for three hours on the first Friday of each month, such contact to be supervised by an independent social worker.  The mother was not otherwise to have contact with VT, not even telephone contact.  So far as LT was concerned, the judge ordered that there should only be indirect contact, by email, although there could be telephone contact at LT&#8217;s request.  A number of prohibited steps orders were made against the wife to which a penal notice was attached.  </p>

The husband asserts forcefully through his counsel that these financial proceedings have, at times, felt like a continuation of the wife&#8217;s campaign against the husband.  The husband contends that the wife has adopted a position that erased any possibility of settlement, refusing to compromise on the most anodyne issues.

No judge should ever underestimate the pressure that is on litigants in these kind of proceedings, particularly when that is set against the background of what they have both already been through.  Sometimes, both the husband and the wife, when giving evidence, were given to answer direct questions in a narrative and indirect way and, on occasions, more particularly the wife than the husband, she was prone to ramble in her answers and to give answers that were not relevant to the question.  </p>

It is also important to note, in this context, that the husband was one of the founding partners of FTO;  plainly FTO would have been unhappy about his departure to a rival private equity house.</p>

It is, in my judgement, an important feature of this case that the wife&#8217;s career, which had been on an immensely successful trajectory, was brought to a halt in 2007.</p>

Given that this concept was identified by Lord Nicholls in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane</span>, to ignore compensation in this case would, in my judgement, be an affront to the proper application of the compensation principle.  </p>

Fairness in this case, I am very clear, has to include a clean break, a clear end to the litigation between the husband and the wife, which will mean that they will not have to spend time with their solicitors, it will mean they will not have to be waiting upon contingent tax liabilities, only for the husband, for example, to have to make an explanation to the wife that this tax or that tax is due and for questions to be raised about it.  There has been mutual mistrust and it is time for all of this to end and for the parties to go their separate ways.  They will, of course, always be the mother and the father, respectively, to LT and VT.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2020, the wife moved back to England, and she and the children moved into a private rented property not far from the family home.  The wife issued divorce proceedings on 23 January 2020.  There were competing divorce proceedings brought by the husband in Country Y.  In due course the husband conceded this jurisdictional battle and Deputy District Judge Stewart made a consent order to this effect on 15 January 2021.  I dare say that one of the reasons why the husband wanted proceedings abroad was because he perceived there would be a financial advantage to him in that course.  I make no criticism of him if that was indeed his motivation.  It is, I suppose, the way of things in acrimonious divorces; the parties are going to choose the jurisdiction which they think is best going to suit their position.  In any event, the husband conceded the jurisdictional battle as I have said and at least the parties were spared that fight as well.</p>

I do not doubt that she has an earning capacity of some kind but, at the age of fifty-three and having been out of the private equity market for decades, I find that she does not have any effective earning capacity in that role.  Any income that she will be able to produce now would be modest in the context of this case, although not in the context of an ordinary average standard of living, but I do find that the wife has an earning capacity for, say, fourteen years or so, on the basis that her normal retirement age would be sixty-seven.  This earning capacity will, in my judgement, make little difference to any assessment of her needs.  I proceed on the basis that if the wife goes out to work and earns money, that is money that is hers in addition to whatever she has in these proceedings.  If and when I get to a needs-based assessment, I am not going to include in that any earning capacity.  As the parties will shortly realise, when I give my decision, I have not approached this case purely on a needs basis.</p>

On behalf of the wife, Mr Bishop invites me to find that the parties cohabited from 2003 and that the sharing principle is engaged from that date.  I am bound to say that I frequently find in these types of cases that the parties, through their advocates, invite the court to find that there was an exact date when an exclusive relationship, a committed relationship, a loving relationship, call it what you will, commenced, or when cohabitation commenced, and, accordingly, an exact date when the sharing principle is engaged.  Most of the time, life is rarely that simple.  Living together, commitment, exclusivity of the relationship, love, all take time to develop.  In many cases, the date is regarded as crucial because, as here, it would entitle the claimant to contend for a larger share of the available capital by reference to the sharing principle.  In this case, the wife contends that the earlier date of cohabitation that she puts forward would entitle her to share in the carry in what is called BTI Fund 1.  </p>

The reality is that many cases involve a blend of both of these principles, as well, as here, the principle of compensation.  I remind myself that the statute (section 25) requires me to have regard to all the circumstances of the case.  This, I suggest, is a deliberately broad piece of drafting which enables the judge to do what the judge feels is fair.

He had previously been married to M.  The wife in this case, i.e. AT, contends that the husband lived mainly at his father&#8217;s home, and only occasionally stayed with the wife.  Importantly, in my judgement, it is common ground that the husband was still attempting to see whether he could salvage his marriage with M.  I accept his evidence that he felt guilty about leaving M and the three children.  Indeed, the wife in this case has given evidence saying that she wanted to be sure that the relationship between the husband and M was over before she became heavily involved.  The wife expressed considerable irritation, if not anger, when she found out that the husband had, for the third time, moved back in with M to see whether he could resurrect their failing marriage.  Moreover, the husband went on holiday with M and the children in 2004, much to the annoyance of the wife, since he was there, not only with M, but with their children as well, by which I mean M and the husband&#8217;s children.</p>

It is easy to suggest in most cases that the sensible thing to do when there are professional valuations is to split the difference.  Splitting the difference is always unscientific and is often unattractive, but it is, after all, a reflection of the fact that a property is, at the end of the day, worth whatever somebody is prepared to pay for it, nothing more and nothing less.  The only way to test that is to put the property on the market.  There was no suggestion that, in this case, the property should be marketed.  Similarly, this is not one of those houses where one can simply look at others of the same type in the same road and determine the value by reference to recent market activity.</p>

He had scant evidence about comparable properties and he readily agreed with the suggestion put to him by Mr Bishop, on behalf of the wife, that there had not been many sales recently with which he could work.  It is the duty of the valuer to explain how they arrive at their valuation.  Whilst I have no doubt that Mr White was an honest witness, doing the best that he could in the circumstances, I felt that his evidence was poorly researched and he really did not have much of an answer for some of the important questions put to him by Mr Bishop.  Nevertheless, I respect Mr White&#8217;s opinion as the jointly instructed valuer and I would be likely to follow the opinion of the jointly instructed valuer unless there is substantial reason to take a contrary view.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In this case, there is, in my judgement, a substantial reason to take a contrary view.  I found the evidence of Mr Oliver French of Knight Frank to be compelling, properly reasoned and justified by reference to objectively verifiable criteria.  Although employed to provide an expert opinion on behalf of the wife, Mr French makes clear in his report, and I accept, that he is aware of his duties to the court.  His duty is to give an honest opinion to the court and not to support the wife&#8217;s case.  He arrives at a price per square foot for this property, measuring it against sales of other properties in a similar location.  I am afraid I have to say that Mr White failed to explain how he arrived at his valuation by reference to the price per square foot.  Moreover, Mr White frankly admitted that his comparables were less than perfect, and that an offer of &#163;4 million in 2019 might have affected his valuation.</p>

I recognise that it is difficult to value a property of this kind because there are not others of a similar kind which have recently been sold.  As it was put in court, this is not one of a type of terraced properties in a street in London where they can look at what was achieved by the sale of one down the road of a similar type.  I recognise that there is always bound to be a margin of error.  In fact, I would not call it a margin of error at all, I would call it a margin of opinion.  After all, you do not know what you are going to get for a property until someone comes along and buys it.  </p>

That is not going to happen, so I have to do the best that I can with the expert opinions that I have had in court.  I unhesitatingly prefer the evidence of Mr French of Knight Frank and I find that the value for the purposes of this case is &#163;4.1 million, as he has advised.</p>

As I recorded in the introductory part of this Judgment, on 7 December 2007, i.e. the day before the wedding, the parties signed an antenuptial contract.  The contract provided that there would be no community of property and no community of profit and loss between the parties.  I accept, as did the wife, that it is commonplace for relatively wealthy people in civil law jurisdictions such as Country X to enter into such agreements, or contracts.  It is obvious from everything that I have said about the wife&#8217;s success in the private equity world that she is intelligent, well-educated, incisive and has the ability to understand company documents and absorb information quickly.  However, she is not and never has been a lawyer.  </p>

Moreover, I accept that the antenuptial contract clarifies what was pre-marital and therefore being excluded.  The clear intention of the antenuptial contract was to exclude the husband&#8217;s FTO interests from the sharing principle.</p>

I accept that it is not as simple as saying that the antenuptial contract was signed the day before the wedding, since of course the wife had been engaged in the discussion process about the antenuptial contract prior to this.  However, the fact is that, when she signed it, she was four months pregnant and she knew that her earning capacity would have been damaged, perhaps fatally, by the fact that she could no longer work in the private equity world, in this sector, in Country X.  So the pressure to which the wife was being subjected was:</p>

As Mr Bishop put it, &#8220;the guests had all assembled from various parts of the world, presents had been given out, the wedding was ready to go tomorrow&#8221;.  What was anyone in that situation to do?  Of course, this was the culmination of a process.  I recognise that this was not something that was simply thrust into the wife&#8217;s hands the day before the wedding, but it seems to me that the circumstances to which I have referred are highly relevant when I think about and make a judgement about the appropriateness of holding the parties to the terms of this antenuptial contract.</p>

What I am going to do is to make the award that I make and leave it to the parties, and I suppose primarily the husband, to see what is the most efficient way for him to effect the payment that I am going to order him to make.  If, in due course, the parties decided that it would be appropriate for there to be a variation of the N Trust in order to mitigate tax liabilities, so long as it is agreed and so long as the mitigation is lawful, I would be likely to accede to it, and I am going to require the wife, as she has offered through Mr Bishop, to give an undertaking to take all steps that she is reasonably called upon to make to help to mitigate the incidents of tax arising in this case.   It is not the task of the court to try and save the parties tax, but  I am likely to approve any route that they want to take which is tax-efficient for them,  provided that it is agreed and provided  that it is lawful.</p>

In many respects, that is the fairest way of dealing with things because it provides mathematical certainty.  I have already said that I am not prepared to take any route in this case that provides scope for continuing argument.  If there is one thing I think that all of us in this court, and those attending remotely, would be likely to agree on, it is that AT and BT need some peace, they need freedom from litigation and so do their children.  And so I balance the certainty of the route of indemnities, cross-undertakings and so forth against the certainty of peace, and it is my judgement that, in this case, I should and I must take some risks in relation to not getting the tax figures right, because those risks buy that peace, provided I can make sure that my award gives enough to the wife and leaves enough for the husband to meet what they are likely to need in the future.

If it did change, however, it might be something that would entitle the husband to return to court in normal circumstances.

In my judgement, that is rarely the right approach because we are not dealing with a civil claim in tort, we are dealing with the exercise of a very wide discretion by a judge.  The way that I have decided to deal with this is to bring on schedule all of the assets in the case.  In other words, I bring on schedule the pre-acquired wealth.  Whether or not it has been &#8220;matrimonialised&#8221;, to use that word again, the fact is that what the husband started with is something that I am now bringing on schedule because I think that is a proper way of dealing with the compensation principle, and, similarly, I am going to treat all of the N money as being on schedule.  But, to balance the way that I have dealt with that, which would appear to be unduly generous to the wife&#8217;s presentation, I am going to put all of the tax figures in on the basis that this is the tax that will be due if this trust was wound up.</p>

On the other hand, I am bringing it all on schedule to recognise that, in terms of the way to deal with compensation, it is fair for me to say that money that might otherwise have been left off schedule is being brought on schedule, and I am going to take from that a straightforward fifty/fifty approach and, according to my calculations, and, again, I will have to ask counsel to check that, the total amount of money with which the wife should be left is &#163;6,894.791, that is just under &#163;6.9 million.</p>

The damage to this family I have described already as catastrophic.

As I commented with a slight touch of irony, judges these days do know how to use the internet, and it is just perplexing to me that somebody can put in figures which are either plainly wrong or where somebody is paying far more than they need to for a particular service.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">This is not a case where I need to descend into a discussion about &#8220;shoes and handbags and holidays&#8221;; ultimately it is up to the wife to spend the money the way that she wants to, but she was contending for &#163;230,000 a year for life.  Well, if I just look at what my award is, it is &#163;6.9 million, rounding it for the moment, if she spends, say, &#163;2.5 million on a house, then she has more than over &#163;4 million remaining, and I have no doubt that that is enough money to provide for her handsomely for the rest of her life.  I note that, for a fifty-three-year-old woman, according to the <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury</span> tables, this sum will generate for her, &#163;175,000 a year for life, and it seems to me that that is a very significant income indeed, and it would be quite wrong for it to be contended that this will not meet her income needs.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">I then look of course at what the husband has left.  Well, I am requiring him to pay a larger lump sum than he was hoping to have to pay, but I say this: I have brought all of the N money into account, but I have put all of it in taxed at 45 per cent.  The reality, I recognise, is that he will not pay 45 per cent on all of it, or possibly on any of it, because the money that he is going to pay to the wife, as I understand it &#8211; he will need to take advice on this &#8211; is going to be paid offshore, once we have had <span style="font-style:italic">decree absolute</span>, and then it will be received by the wife tax-free, and so, using that, whether it is a loophole or a mechanism, provided it is a legal one, and at the moment we all believe that it is, he will be able to mitigate tax very significantly and be significantly better off as a result of my award than a first glance will appear to give him on a breakdown of the schedule.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The wife will have, as I have indicated, just under &#163;6.9 million.  The husband will have, at the very least, the same amount. However,  the reality is he will have much more than that if  the tax is dealt with as expected.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">This, it seems to me, provides fairness for the parties.  It gives the husband significantly more than the wife, for the tax reasons that I have set out.  It means that there is no further prospect, no further need, for further litigation between the husband and the wife because there will be no claims for tax, there will be no Escrow funds and no indemnities to worry and argue about.  Obviously, this is on a clean break basis, there will be no income award and I have a very open mind at the moment in so far as the issue of costs is concerned.  At the moment, my award works on the basis that the wife will have her costs paid, so I have netted it all out, but, in due course, it may be that one or other party will be asking me to make a costs award.  Obviously, I cannot and will not know anything about any without prejudice offers that might have been made, but I am obviously going to wait until any application which might be made.</p>
