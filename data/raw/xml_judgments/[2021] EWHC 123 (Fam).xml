He is separately represented from his Children&#8217;s Guardian, Mr Smith who appears in person, there being no public funding available to him for representation at hearings.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Q is now aged 16 years old. He will be 17 in February 2021. At the age of 2 years, Q was taken into police protection with his younger sister, having been found in circumstances of severe neglect. Q was placed in the care of the local authority and was subsequently adopted with his sister when he was three years old. His adoptive parents reported developmental delay consistent with neglect and Q&#8217;s behaviour at home and school was said to have been extremely challenging. Q&#8217;s adoptive parents separated when he was eight years old and his adoptive mother found it difficult to manage his behaviour as a single parent. Aged eight years, Q was referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and was diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), for which he still receives medication. Since the age of 4, Q has engaged in harmful sexual behaviours with others, both male and female. This sexually harmful and violent behaviour escalated to the extent that, when Q was aged 10 years, his adoptive mother asked for him to be accommodated by the local authority. It is a matter of great regret that Q&#8217;s adoptive parents have struggled with his behaviours and found it difficult to support him at the present time. Neither of them have been represented at the hearings which I have conducted. The mother has attended the hearings in December and January. The father has not attended any hearing since the issue of proceedings in May 2020. </p>

He continued to display extreme behaviour such as exposing himself to a teenage girl and photographing his genitals. In February 2019, a risk planning meeting took place with the local authority in which the placement was situated because of the risk that this local authority asserted Q posed to the wider public. In consequence, risk management meetings took place every six weeks until Q&#8217;s placement broke down in autumn 2019. The placement ended when it was alleged that Q had caused the six-year-old child of a neighbour to touch his penis. The incident was investigated by police and the local authority in whose area the placement was situated refused to permit Q to remain in his placement as he was deemed too serious a threat to the public.  </p>

Following several adjournments by which the court sought greater clarity as to the restrictions said to be necessary in respect of Q, HHJ Perry sitting as a deputy High Court judge granted the local authority&#8217;s application on 13 December 2018. The order recorded that Q was living in a residential environment where he was supervised by two members of staff throughout the day and by two night-waking staff. He was the sole occupant in the placement and was not free to leave. Regrettably, the order did not provide for any review date of the restrictions on Q&#8217;s liberty. </p>

This is an independent, nationally accessible, specialist service with over 30 years&#8217; experience of assessment and therapeutic intervention with children and young people, both male and female, who display problematic or harmful sexual behaviour. Following an intensive assessment, G-Map reported in November 2019 that Q required therapeutic intervention of 18-24 months&#8217; duration to address, among other matters, his inappropriate and harmful sexual behaviours. In a report dated 25 June 2020 written at the start of these proceedings, G-Map listed incidents of Q&#8217;s inappropriate and harmful sexual behaviour from the age of four years to October 2019 and stated the following: </p>

Seemingly, victim accessibility and the opportunity to be sexual with others took precedence over influences such as having a particular victim profile, or his behaviour being triggered by sexual attraction to others. Our hypothesis is that [Q&#8217;s] harmful sexual behaviours are driven by a preoccupation with, and reliance on, sex. To our knowledge, [Q&#8217;s] inappropriate and harmful sexual behaviours were non-penetrative although given the sexual thoughts that [Q] has reported and the increased sophistication through the use of weapons and locking the door when [Q] displayed harmful sexual behaviour against his female carer, it is important for professionals to be aware of the significant level of harm he has the potential to perpetrate. Additionally, the frequency and apparent opportunistic nature of these behaviours have meant that high levels of support and supervision have been required to manage [Q&#8217;s] sexual behaviour and his risk to the public&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in"> G-Map recommended that Q be supervised during activities and in environments where he was in contact with peers and children of all genders in addition to adult females, and for the supervision to be provided by an appropriate adult who was aware of the risks he posed. Q should not be allowed to be in a one-to-one situation with a younger child or a vulnerable child/young person of any age. Where possible and defensible, it should be explored how and whether supervision levels for Q could be reduced in some situations. Public protection should be paramount in the decisionmaking process and any changes to supervision should be decided in a multi-agency arena. Finally, Q&#8217;s internet use and access to mobile communication devices should also be supervised. G-Map recommended therapeutic intervention for a further 18 months, based on weekly sessions and Q commenced this work with G-Map in February 2020. </p>

The application noted that the order made in December 2018 had no expiry date and the local authority invited the court to review matters and extend the deprivation of liberty order. On 16 June 2020 HHJ Harris, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, granted an order depriving Q of his liberty. The restrictions were that he was to be supervised one-to-one at all times; he was not permitted to leave the placement without a supervisor present; and he was not permitted to have unsupervised access to the internet, to a telephone or to social media. The order was to expire on 20 July 2020 with the matter being listed before HHJ Harris for further consideration on 17 July 2020. In June 2020, Q moved to another residential unit where there was a young female in placement (though she moved out in October 2020). </p>

Regrettably, despite the restrictions imposed by the deprivation of liberty order, Q absconded on 15 August 2020 for a period in excess of 24 hours.

HHJ Harris extended the deprivation of liberty order until 31 October 2020. The restrictions imposed by the order on 25 August 2020 were more severe, namely: (a) Q was to be supervised 3 to 1 at all times; (b) he was not permitted to leave placement without a supervisor present including into the community or to education; (c) he was not permitted to have unsupervised access to internet or telephone; (d) he was not permitted to access social media; and (e) he was not permitted to go outside into the placement grounds (including the garden). </p>

The local authority had - on the morning of the hearing - received a letter from the Secretary of State for Education which indicated his concern on learning of Q&#8217;s circumstances. He gave assurances that the Secure Welfare Coordination Unit (SWCU) was doing everything it could to help identify a placement for Q. His letter identified that: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230; Under contractual arrangements between Youth Custody Service (YCS) and SCHs (Secure Children&#8217;s Homes) it is possible for the Secretary of State for Justice to invite the Registered Manager of a SCH to make a justice bed available temporarily for a welfare placement. You can ask the SWCU to discuss this with the YCS on your behalf. However, whether the YCS agreed to release a bed temporarily is a decision for them and the decision to accept the referral would fall to the registered manager of the home and cannot be directly influenced by either my [sic] or the YCS.&#8221;</span> Given this information, the local authority informed the court that it intended to write to the Secretary of State for Justice to invite him to consider, on a temporary basis, approving the conversion of a justice bed to a welfare bed to accommodate Q as a matter of urgency. I gave permission for the case papers and my order to be sent to the Government Legal Department for the urgent attention of the Secretary of State for Justice. Additionally, I invited the Secretary of State for Justice and/or the Director of the Youth Custody Service to attend, represented by counsel, the hearing listed before me on 14 December 2020 so that I might be updated as to the availability of a youth justice bed for Q.  </p>

He had also contacted the Director of the Youth Custody Service at the Ministry of Justice, having been informed by the Director of Children&#8217;s Services that there was a possibility of changing a justice bed to a welfare bed in one of the secure children&#8217;s homes. He expressed the hope that assistance would be offered to the local authority in this case. Sir Alan Wood confirmed that he had chaired the Residential Care Leadership Board which oversaw a programme of work on residential care, but this work was complete, and the Board had, therefore, ceased to exist in March 2020. His email confirmed that he had recommended an increase in the number of secure beds for children with the same issues as Q.  </p>

He had no freedom of movement and therefore no responsibility in any aspect of his life which meant that levels of rehabilitation and desistance would remain untested in <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;real-life&#8221;</span> situations. A key area of concern was a lack of self-regulation, but the longer Q remained in an environment where he was under-stimulated, the more chance there was of him becoming dysregulated and triggered by ordinary situations from which he was presently shielded. Q was no longer able to have therapeutic support from Gmap, but the Youth Offending Service was able to offer Q a substitute intervention via his Intensive Referral Order. The Youth Offending Service would remit Q&#8217;s case back </p>

The Service considered that, at present, the Intensive Referral Order was workable. Delivering interventions in the current placement was challenging but Q was engaged and there was some limited progress. Without a relaxation of current external controls, the Youth Offending Service could not assess whether risk could be managed should Q&#8217;s supervision reduce.  </p>

The move would not mean a change in the care staff working with Q as they would move with him to the new placement. Additionally, the manager of the new placement had training in how to manage and respond to sexually harmful behaviours, having previously worked with children who presented with similar needs to Q. All the parties agreed that the move was appropriate and met Q&#8217;s needs. I extended the deprivation of liberty order until 18 January 2021 and sought further information from the Youth Offending Team. </p>

I understand there will be an investigation to explore whether Q has committed any offences by using the phones in this way. </p>

In my judgment, there can be no doubt that Q meets the criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25(1)</ref> for the making of a secure accommodation order. He has a history of absconding and would be likely to abscond from any other description of accommodation. Additionally, if he is kept in any other description of accommodation, he is likely to injure himself or other persons in that he is a real danger to carers other occupants of placement, himself, and the wider public. Even with constant supervision on a ratio of 3:1, Q has been able to engage in harmful sexual behaviour and when he has absconded, he has committed sexual offences and offences involving weapons. All the professionals involved with Q are satisfied that he meets the statutory criteria for placement in secure accommodation. However, I am prevented from authorising Q&#8217;s placement in secure accommodation because there is no secure unit with a bed suitable for him. This situation has persisted since summer 2020 and the local authority, with the active encouragement of this court, has done everything it could to identify a suitable secure placement for Q. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The process for identifying secure placements identified in the documents before this court gives rise to additional concern. The Secure Welfare Coordination Unit is the single point by which secure accommodation placements for children are identified. At the point that the search takes place, the local authority is not provided with any details of the secure units that may have placements and thus does not know, for example, where such units are located, whether they have specialist services or whether they are single sex units. No secure children&#8217;s home is required to give feedback as to why a child is not offered a place and, in this case, only one unit has offered feedback as to why it could not accommodate Q. Until a secure home offers a placement to a child, the local authority is unable to discuss an individual case with a home or offer greater information about a child unless requested to do so. I note that there have been placements available in secure children&#8217;s homes throughout this local authority&#8217;s search for a placement for Q. </p>

The children and young people most in need of secure accommodation were those being summarily refused the places available. I have some considerable sympathy with that submission. I have no evidence available to me as to the method by which secure justice placements are obtained so a comparison of the two systems might well be useful in another case or context. By way of completeness, I was informed by Miss Danton that the local authority was in the process of taking senior counsel&#8217;s advice as the merits of a claim in the Administrative Court about the changes made to the process for identifying secure welfare placements. </p>

Both the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian have genuine concerns as to whether Q&#8217;s present placement can meet his needs. The reality is that there appears to be no other option available for keeping Q safe. </p>

He cannot leave his placement as he is locked into it. He cannot even go outside to enjoy fresh air or outside space. He is not even permitted to open a window in his placement. I observe that, were Q placed in secure accommodation, the level of restriction would be significantly less than that for which the local authority now contends. Q would at least have access to outside space and have interactions with other young people. </p>

It is absolutely plain, that the likelihood of Q&#8217;s reoffending is high, and his present circumstances do little more than contain rather than treat and engage with his harmful behaviours so as to reduce them. Relevantly, the statement reads as follows: </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0in"><span/><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230; The nature of harmful sexual behaviours is so wide ranging it is difficult to predict how he may offend in the future and who the victims may be. There are some consistent themes in his previous behaviours which are suggestive of particular preferences. He has a sexual interest in pre-pubescent boys who we know he has targeted in his offending. He has discussed a fantasy to use weapons and violence to render potential victims unconscious so he can have sex with them. He lacks the ability to self-regulate so when heightened is likely to utilise any opportunities to achieve gratification or relieve anxiety&#8230;. He is most likely to display these behaviours when unsupervised as he has better access to potential victims&#8230;. He may also be violent towards any person who intervenes or thwarts attempts to abscond or challenge his behaviours. Q appears to find enjoyment in manipulating and intimidating others, particularly carers&#8230;. The majority of his negative behaviours stem from resentment at being subject to DOLS restrictions and a desire to abscond. Q&#8217;s behaviours are likely to continue to be challenging and escalate in risk because he is very determined and fixated on this desire&#8230; We would strongly discourage any relaxing of restrictions in his current placement now or in upcoming months. Although Q is complying with his order and engaging in rehabilitative programs, I cannot give a realistic assessment of efficacy of his intervention in supporting desistance from offending. As I have discussed in previous statements, we cannot test efficacy effectively without enabling Q to have more responsibility for selfmanagement which requires relaxing restrictions. A secure placement would be the best environment in which to test capacity for change. However, if a secure placement cannot offer a programme reflective of his Intensive Referral Order he is unlikely to develop the skills and tools needed to achieve change in his thinking and behaviour. The Youth Offending Service is of the opinion that a secure order would be in Q&#8217;s best interests in the absence of a therapeutic community placement&#8230; His Referral Order intervention plan may not be transferable to a welfare secure setting and this causes me concern. The window of opportunity to rehabilitate Q is very narrow, we would not support a move to a secure setting if the facility were not able to offer the therapeutic intervention he needs&#8230;. His transition back into the community would need to be robustly planned. Health assessments undertaken by specialists within the Youth Offending Service indicate that Q needs continued therapeutic support into adulthood&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>

If he does not receive this work soon, he will be a huge risk to young children and others. The nature of his likely offending behaviour also places him at risk of being a victim of serious harm, both in the community and in custody. As this judgment makes clear, Q is &#8211; through no fault of his own - a profoundly damaged young person who desperately needs care and help. The window of opportunity to tackle and address his difficulties is running out since he will be 18 years old in just over a year&#8217;s time. At that point, no order that this court can make could prevent him from leaving a placement and living in the community where he will be at significant risk of harm himself and where he will present a significant danger to others. </p>
