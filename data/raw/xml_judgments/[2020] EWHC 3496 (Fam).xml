The first set of proceedings concluded in June 2018 when I made a special guardianship order placing J in the care of her paternal grandmother, BB. These proceedings generated two judgments, the first in consequence of a fact-finding hearing (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A Local Authority v A Mother and Others (Radicalisation: Fact-Finding)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2018/2054" uk:canonical="[2018] EWHC 2054 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWHC 2054 (Fam)</ref>) and the second in consequence of a welfare hearing (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Local Authority v A Mother and Others (Radicalisation: Welfare)</span> [2018] EWHC </p>

The father played no role as he remains in prison in Turkey, having been convicted of membership of an armed terrorist organisation. I was told that he may be released in the latter part of 2021 and would wish to return to this jurisdiction of which he is a citizen. It remains unclear whether, on return, the father would be the subject of further investigation by the authorities. At an early stage in these proceedings, efforts were made to ascertain whether he could be served. Those efforts foundered and the parties expressed concern about the degree to which information about these proceedings could be shared without putting the father at an unacceptable risk whilst a serving prisoner. No party sought to delay the resolution of the proceedings for J in consequence of the father&#8217;s inability to participate. I was satisfied that I should proceed to make decisions about J&#8217;s welfare in his absence.  </p>

Prior to their departure, both the mother and the father had, independently, become radicalised. There was a point of apparent connection through the husband of one of the mother&#8217;s sisters, but any involvement from him in the arrangements to marry appears to have come after the process of radicalisation had occurred for both J&#8217;s parents.  </p>

In this jurisdiction, I record that ISIL has been a proscribed terrorist organisation since June 2014. It is a brutal Sunni Islamist terrorist group which adheres to a global jihadist ideology, following an extreme interpretation of Islam which is anti-Western and promotes sectarian violence. ISIL aimed to establish an Islamic state governed by Sharia law in Syria and Northern Iraq and to impose its rule by using violence and extortion. </p>

Whilst in ISIL controlled territory, the mother and father spent time in both Syria and northern Iraq. The mother reported - though this could not be corroborated - that they also spent periods of time apart. During their time in ISIL controlled territory, the mother fell pregnant and gave birth to J. In early 2017, the mother, father, and J presented themselves in a Turkish town near the Syrian border. Both parents were arrested. After a lengthy process, the mother was permitted to return to this jurisdiction with the support of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, following DNA testing of J. In her absence in October 2018, the mother was convicted in Turkey of membership of an armed terrorist organisation. No extradition proceedings have been brought and none were indicated. The mother was advised that she was likely to be detained to serve her sentence should she travel to Turkey in future. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At a fact-finding hearing in February 2018, I found the threshold criteria set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> were satisfied. In summary, my findings were that J had been exposed to the risk of significant harm by her parents who had travelled to Syria and lived in a war zone. Her father had been radicalised and held Islamist extremist beliefs, travelling to Syria to fight for ISIL and to engage in terrorismrelated activity. J&#8217;s mother shared the same extremist ideology and had travelled with the father to Syria to live in ISIL controlled territory. Furthermore, there was a risk (a) that the mother would radicalise J and inculcate an extremist ideology; (b) that she would seek to remove J from the jurisdiction to an unsafe location in pursuit of her extremist ideology; and (c) that the mother would behave in this jurisdiction in ways consistent with her extremist ideology. Finally, I found that the mother did not have any real insight into the risk of significant physical and emotional harm which the father posed to J and, in consequence, was unable to act protectively. I found the mother&#8217;s evidence during the fact-finding hearing to be both inadequate and dishonest and I considered that she had withheld information from the court just as she had done from the professionals working with her. Her failure to provide a complete account of events was indicative of a continuing desire to conceal her true belief system. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At the conclusion of the welfare hearing in June 2018, I made a special guardianship order in favour of the paternal grandmother, BB, coupled with a 12-month supervision order. The mother had sought J&#8217;s return to her care, but I concluded that this would not be in J&#8217;s best interests. Though the mother was more than capable of providing good physical care for J and loved her deeply, the mother&#8217;s oral evidence gave rise to serious concern. She appeared to have accepted some of the findings I made following the February 2018 hearing. However, having heard her oral evidence, I formed the view that her acceptance was limited and insufficient. I did not believe the information she had given represented a final, full, and honest account of what occurred in 2015 and thereafter. Such an account was necessary to inform any evaluation of risk. Though she had engaged with therapy, I concluded she was merely at the start of a lengthy process of personal change and that J could not wait for that process to be complete. Were J to be returned to her mother&#8217;s care, I concluded that the risks could not be safely managed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">My welfare judgment noted that there had been some equivocation by the paternal grandmother in putting herself forward as a carer for J. This was a focus of the evidence before and during the welfare hearing. Sadly, J&#8217;s placement came under significant pressure, arising from the investigation and diagnosis of J with thalassaemia in late 2018/early 2019 and the paternal grandmother&#8217;s unresolved feelings about the behaviour of J&#8217;s father. </p>

As a result, the local authority issued care proceedings in early August 2019 asserting that, given the existence of the supervision order, the threshold criteria could be established on that basis alongside the court&#8217;s findings made in February 2018. On 6 August 2019, I timetabled the care proceedings to a final hearing in March 2020 and, in November 2019, I authorised the instruction of Dr Timberlake to conduct a psychological assessment of J and members of her family. </p>

Every alternate weekend, CC provided respite care for J at the home he shared with his mother, J&#8217;s great-grandmother. By November 2019, CC had decided to put himself forward as a long-term carer for J if J was unable to return to the care of her mother. </p>

I endorsed that formulation of the threshold test in my order on that date. On 31 March 2020 and on the application of the mother, I adjourned the final hearing to October 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic meant that there were substantial barriers to the mother&#8217;s effective participation in a hearing at that time. By that time, J was living with CC and her great-grandmother and, to confer parental responsibility upon CC, I made a &#8220;lives with&#8221; child arrangements order in his favour, considering the same to be justified given the uncertainties at the start of the pandemic.  </p>

Though his special guardianship assessment identified that CC had not previously cared for a small child, the period since March 2020 had demonstrated (a) his total commitment to J; (b) the high quality of care he had provided during a conspicuously challenging time; and (c) his willingness to seek support to enhance his parenting skills. The local authority acknowledged that the mother had an extremely positive relationship with J but remained concerned about whether the risks identified in 2018 had been sufficiently ameliorated to make rehabilitation possible. It was accepted that the nature of the risk arising to J in the mother&#8217;s care was hard to quantify but, in the local authority&#8217;s view, it had not been addressed sufficiently to permit safe reunification. The alternative option of J remaining with CC provided continuity, no risk of significant harm, and was likely to allow J to continue to have a positive relationship with her mother. </p>

That recommendation was subject to the caveat that the Children&#8217;s Guardian would wish to consider any further information which might emerge during the hearing. By November 2020, the recommendation of the Children&#8217;s Guardian was even more finely balanced than it had been in March 2020. J appeared very much at home in CC&#8217;s care and the Children&#8217;s Guardian was troubled by the mother&#8217;s criticisms of the paternal family&#8217;s care which had emerged since her earlier report. She considered the concerns expressed by the mother were not warranted and was worried about the implications of an apparent growing lack of trust. She recognised that the return of the father to this jurisdiction at some point in 2021 would bring additional concerns and noted that, whilst living with her own family, the mother appeared to be isolated, have little other support, and might be unable to secure housing such that J could continue at her present nursery. In a position statement filed on her behalf at the start of the November 2020 hearing, the Children&#8217;s Guardian continued to support J&#8217;s rehabilitation with her mother though she acknowledged this was a somewhat more tepid endorsement than was previously the case. </p>

He described the mother as now being able to talk about the very traumatic and abusive experiences she was subjected to in her childhood and was of the opinion that this had allowed her to gain a deeper understanding of the process that had resulted in her becoming drawn into radical ideologies.

The IP focused on developing the mother&#8217;s knowledge of her religion and on helping her to recognise the wrongness of her past beliefs. At the end of the sessions in summer 2019, the IP concluded that she should disengage and that there remained in the mother &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">no vulnerability to radicalisation</span>&#8221;. She believed that the mother was much more resilient to extremist ideology and was now better able to separate extremist propaganda from mainstream Islam. However, though she did not identify any issues of concern, the IP commented that the mother was not always honest with her. She noted the mother was very reluctant to talk about how she met her husband, why the marriage was a secret, and when the couple decided to travel to Syria. Curiously, in the last session, the mother denied that her brother-in-law was a member of a proscribed terrorist group. The IP observed that the mother may have sought to keep some subjects under wraps for fear of incriminating herself further. Finally, the IP noted that, while the mother had stated repeatedly that she was not violent and disapproved of hatred towards anyone, this stance was at odds with her Twitter feed after the Charlie Hebdo murders. </p>

Prior to caring for J, CC had no parenting experience, but he made impressive efforts to get to know J, to learn about her interests and to take advice. The assessor considered that he had demonstrated commitment and perseverance in wanting to learn how to care for J. CC has been selfemployed all his life within the IT industry and has worked from home for much of that time. As a result, he appeared socially isolated and initially struggled to demonstrate affection and physical warmth towards J. In early March 2020, when the special guardianship assessment was completed, the assessor considered that CC needed to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;loosen up&#8221;</span> around J. Despite this emotional reticence, the assessor saw evidence of the beginnings of a bond between J and CC at that time. By the time the assessor gave her oral evidence, CC and his mother had been caring for J full-time since late March 2020. When the assessor visited in late October 2020, she described CC as being comfortable and natural with J and observed that J was very comfortable around CC. Though her visit was relatively brief, she felt CC had come a long way in demonstrating an emotional connection with J since her assessment report was written. Seeing CC and J together had consolidated her recommendation that he had the ability and motivation to care for J in the long term. Miss Giz challenged the assessor on the basis that J did not experience CC as her primary carer instead seeking comfort from her paternal great-grandmother. The assessor disagreed and relied on her recent observations. I found her evidence to be straightforward and balanced. </p>

In late 2019, she carried out a parenting assessment of the mother focused on exploring the mother&#8217;s response to the 2018 findings and trying to understand the somewhat confusing position adopted by the mother of neither fully accepting nor actively challenging those findings. Her assessment concluded that there remained real questions over the mother&#8217;s willingness to be consistently honest, open, and forthcoming with important information. In those circumstances she highlighted the difficulties for the local authority in managing risk were J to be placed in her mother&#8217;s care. She recommended that J should have contact six times a year with her mother if she were placed with CC but was deferential to the court&#8217;s view on that issue. Should J return to her mother, the social worker considered the future involvement of the paternal family was of critical importance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Miss Giz pointed to an apparent U-turn in the local authority&#8217;s position which she explored with the allocated social worker in cross examination. In 2019 the allocated social worker&#8217;s written evidence expressed clear support for the mother on the basis of the positive contact which was taking place. In May 2019, the local authority proposed that there should be unsupervised contact between J and her mother once a week in the community and noted that, when J had contact with her mother at the paternal grandfather&#8217;s home, there was a degree of unsupervised contact. The social work statement in August 2019 stated that, if J could not remain in the care of her grandmother, the local authority would explore reunification to the mother&#8217;s care and noted that the IP reports concluded that there had been a significant and positive shift in the mother&#8217;s beliefs and mindset. However, the statement also observed that the mother remained living with the maternal family, thereby maintaining contact with those who were known sympathisers and associates of a proscribed radical Islamist group. The statement mentioned the risks which might ensue should the father return to this jurisdiction once he had completed his sentence. The local authority&#8217;s recommendation at that stage was for J to remain in the care of her grandmother whilst further assessment of her mother and other alternative carers was undertaken. At that stage, the local authority&#8217;s position was entirely sensible, and I struggle to describe its recommendation to the court at the final hearing as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;something of a Uturn&#8221;</span> according to Miss Giz&#8217;s submissions. However, I accept that the developments in the mother&#8217;s contact during 2019 may have given the mother the impression that J would be returned to her. I will discuss contact towards the end of my judgment.  </p>

Given that allegedly rigid approach, Miss Giz invited me to treat the allocated social worker&#8217;s evidence about the mother with extreme caution. In my view, the social worker was entitled to come to her own assessment of the mother based on their interactions during the parenting assessment and to maintain that opinion. The social worker&#8217;s oral evidence made plain what the expectations of the mother had been during that process and highlighted the mother&#8217;s lack of transparency about key issues. However, and contrary to the social worker&#8217;s evaluation, the mother&#8217;s failure to be open did not mean the risk in this case must be assessed as unchanged since there are many reasons why people lie or do not reveal information, for example, to protect themselves or others or because of feelings of guilt and shame.  </p>

It was clear that he was capable of taking on new challenges and learning new skills conducive to providing care for J. Nevertheless, he was likely to need considerable support to care effectively for J and Dr Timberlake thought it likely that the paternal greatgrandmother would take much of the lead. At the time he reported in February 2020, Dr Timberlake thought it likely that CC had not been taking the lead in caring for J and considered it essential that he did so if J were to have a sense of who her main caregiver was. Additionally, Dr Timberlake did not think CC fully understood the requirement to promote J&#8217;s religious identity as a Muslim child.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In his oral evidence, Dr Timberlake was keen to stress that he was not undertaking a risk assessment, but that assertion did not accord with the nature of some of his conclusions, for example in relation to the mother&#8217;s vulnerability and her relationship with the father, which were expressed very firmly. Rather more critically, there were significant issues &#8211; such as her ambivalence about her relationship with J&#8217;s father - which Dr Timberlake had failed to elicit from the mother, and which were therefore absent or incorrectly framed in his analysis. Furthermore, it was unclear whether Dr Timberlake had accepted my previous judgments as the starting point for his work. Though he accepted that he had to take my findings into consideration, parts of his report demonstrated an acceptance of the mother&#8217;s account even though it contradicted the findings that I made in 2018. When cross-examined about the impact on risk, if the mother fundamentally failed to acknowledge her belief structure and agency in past events, his answer failed to grapple with that significant issue. Throughout, it appeared from Dr Timberlake&#8217;s answers that he accepted the mother&#8217;s account alongside the reports from the IP and the Returning Families Unit, seeing it as his task to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">look at her ability to form a narrative to understand her actions and how she got to her current position</span>&#8221;. When I asked him how he was able to assess the mother&#8217;s ability to make and sustain change if her narrative was, at points, wholly at variance with my findings, he responded: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">It wasn&#8217;t about challenging the factfinding but developing her understanding of why she did what she did. On reflection, understanding what may have been going on for her - the moment when she arrived, her experiences - she believed she wasn&#8217;t someone who intended to go to Syria to harm anyone</span>&#8221;. I found this evidence quite difficult to follow. If in fact the mother intended to travel to Syria to support the ISIL regime and did so in furtherance of a violent extremist mindset, then the creation of a narrative in which she believed she was not someone who intended to go to Syria to harm anyone did not strike me as a reliable way of deconstructing and challenging her past beliefs. </p>

Dr Timberlake&#8217;s assessment that the mother did not present as highly susceptible to external views or beliefs and that she had demonstrated an ability to learn, reflect and sustain change did not, for the reasons set out above, appear to be soundly based and I did not rely on it.

At the conclusion of the evidence, the Children&#8217;s Guardian was of the view that the maternal family remained a source of concern and uncertainty. All three of the eldest girls in the family had married men said to be Islamist extremists who were known to the police. The reasons for this striking feature remain unclear. During the hearing it emerged that the children of one of the mother&#8217;s sisters were not living with their mother; that this sister was staying in the family home where the mother was living; that there were private law proceedings about those children in which the court had made a section 37 direction and had directed a home visit after the section 37 reporter had not been able to make such a visit without a court direction. The mother disclosed that the reason for the section 37 direction was her own presence in the home, apparently raised by her former brother-in-law, despite the fact that he himself had been suspected of extremist Islamist views. The Children&#8217;s Guardian told me in her evidence that she viewed the maternal family as a vulnerable feature pertaining to the mother. She disagreed with Dr Timberlake that the risks posed by the maternal family could be assessed once J was in her mother&#8217;s care, considering that the outcome of that assessment was too uncertain. </p>

I understand that, when last seen in September 2019, J&#8217;s haemoglobin was on the low side and she had an enlarged spleen which may indicate the need for future blood transfusions. Nevertheless, she continues to thrive, and her health visitor is pleased with her development. All agreed that J needed stability given that she had had a series of significant changes of carer in her life. A further placement breakdown was likely to cause her real emotional harm. There was professional unanimity that J needed to know who her primary caregiver was. </p>

By contrast, a move to the care of her mother would be potentially unsettling: there would need to be a careful transition plan and this move would have to be deferred until the mother had her own accommodation. Any move would be less unsettling if that accommodation could be near to J&#8217;s current address in order that there could be continuity of nursery provision and to facilitate frequent contact with her paternal family. If this were not possible, the change of nursery would be unsettling as J was said to be happy and comfortable there. J would be likely to miss her present home environment and miss spending time on a daily or very frequent basis with CC, her paternal great-grandmother and her grandmother. Wherever J lived with her mother, there would need to be frequent contact with her paternal family, including overnight stays, in view of the close relationships she has with them. However, the close relationship J has with her mother and the extent of her mother&#8217;s involvement in her care throughout her life would help to mitigate the disruption of a move. There were, however, uncertainties, including the role of the maternal family and whether the mother would maintain contact with the paternal family in the longer term. </p>

She was born in Syria and spent her early months with her parents as they travelled from Syria to Turkey and then was detained with her mother. She spent several months in foster care before moving to her paternal grandmother, losing the relationship with her foster carers to whom she was attached. She then moved from her paternal grandmother&#8217;s home to the care of CC though the disruption and upset of that move was likely to have been mitigated by the significant role played in her life by the paternal great-grandmother. J has shown resilience but has also experienced distress in respect of all these disruptions. Currently, she was said to present with minimal difficulties around her psychological and emotional well-being. J was now settled and happy in CC&#8217;s home and had come to accept his importance as her caregiver. </p>

Thus, the candour of the mother&#8217;s admissions about matters traversed in the fact-finding judgment was a key issue, as was the existence of any continuing minimisation or lack of frankness. Those matters not only concern actual or likely risk but also engage the issue as to whether safeguarding agencies could manage any risk if there was a lack of transparency on the mother&#8217;s part. I also identified that (a) the potential impact of the father returning to the jurisdiction and the nature of the mother&#8217;s relationship with him; (b) the mother&#8217;s own vulnerability (evidenced by her earlier radicalisation) and potential isolation; and (c) the role which the maternal family might play were all crucial issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Based on my findings, the father continued to pose a high risk of significant physical and emotional harm to J. It was difficult to predict what would happen on the father&#8217;s return to this jurisdiction since he may or may not be subject to further criminal investigation and/or proceedings. The risks the father posed may or may not have diminished. Though the mother had explored obtaining a divorce from the father, this had not progressed as she had been advised that she required his participation in that process. The mother recognised that she continued to have ambivalent feelings about the father. On her own belated admission, their relationship was clearly a matter which caused her ongoing difficulties and which so far, she had been unable to address with those who worked with her therapeutically. I agree with the Children&#8217;s Guardian that there was a sense of unfinished business between the mother and the father. Though I accept that the mother appreciated on an intellectual level that the father represented a significant risk to both her and J, I find that, on an emotional level, she remains enmeshed with him such that, as recently as 10 January 2020 in a parenting assessment meeting with the social worker, the mother was recorded as saying <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I do not think I will pursue a relationship with him in the future&#8221;</span>.  The fact that, so late in the day and contrary to her views expressed elsewhere, the mother appeared unable to exclude definitively a continuing marital relationship with the father rang alarm bells. Her inability to be open about her difficulties in this regard reinforced the risk to which J would be exposed in the care of her mother. I am satisfied that my earlier finding about the mother&#8217;s lack of insight in appreciating the significant risk posed to J by her father and being thus unable to act protectively remains intact. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Additionally, there remained a risk that J would be exposed to extremist views in the care of her mother, whether or not the father was involved. The maternal family&#8217;s association with extremist Islamist beliefs was significant. I cannot exclude the risk which the wider maternal family may pose in this regard though I accept this remained presently unassessed. Whilst the mother herself appeared to have benefited from the work of the IP and had been assessed as no longer adhering to an extremist Islamist ideology, I was unwilling to conclude that J would not be exposed to extremist views by her mother. This was because of (a) the mother&#8217;s lack of transparency about pivotal events; (b) her ambivalent and enmeshed relationship with the father; and (c) her continuing association with the maternal family. I was however satisfied that the mother dearly loves J and would not place her at risk of physical harm by removing her to an unsafe place abroad or by carrying out dangerous acts in this jurisdiction. To that extent alone, I modify my earlier findings with respect to the risk posed by the mother. </p>

It was plain that the paternal grandmother remained emotionally devastated by his behaviour and his incarceration in Turkey. There was a significant difference between the paternal family&#8217;s position and that of the mother, namely that they did not share and had never shared the father&#8217;s extremist views. Those views have always been repellent to them, and I record that the paternal family reported the father missing and raised concerns about what they found on his computer. I have no reason to doubt the paternal family would protect J from her father and would rely on professional advice about any role he might conceivably play in her life. </p>

She is caring and emotionally attuned to her little girl and she could meet her needs to a high standard. Her contact has been consistently of an excellent quality. In addition to the identified risk of harm, the mother is a vulnerable young woman with few friends and little support other than that offered by the paternal family. It would be difficult for her to form close friendships and support networks for she has good reason to be guarded and closed about both her past, her present feelings and beliefs, and the role of statutory agencies in her life and that of her daughter. Though the mother told me she was anxious for there to be generous contact between J and the paternal family, the recent and wholly unjustifiable criticisms she made of their care for J suggested a rather more complex relationship. I do not know the extent to which she would continue to prioritise J&#8217;s relationship with them if J were to live with her. Thus, the risks identified in the mother&#8217;s vulnerability mean she may not be able to offer J safe care for the remainder of her minority. </p>

Observations of his relationship with J were, on the whole, positive, and I was satisfied she has started to recognise him as her primary carer. Her great-grandmother and her grandmother also have an important role in her care. Though the mother sought to cast doubts on the appropriateness of the arrangements for J&#8217;s care, suggesting that it was shared in a way that left J without a primary carer, I was satisfied that the arrangements were child focused and permitted J to spend time with her extended paternal family whilst having a proper routine with CC as her carer. </p>

Statutory agencies would struggle to manage these risks, with little confidence that the mother was being transparent in her dealings with them. Though the mother stated that she had accepted the 2018 findings and made some admissions about her behaviour, her involvement with professionals suggested that her acceptance was partial and that she continued to minimise her own role in past events and conceal her beliefs. </p>

CC is wholly committed to caring for J and has demonstrated that he can provide excellent care and promote her safety and well-being. No issue of risk rises in his care.

Her mother and father would retain parental responsibility and would need to be consulted about significant decisions affecting J which could potentially lead to friction between the adults. J will also not be brought up as a Muslim child though CC has committed to supporting her religious identity. That is a limitation on her right to manifest her religious beliefs, but this disadvantage is mitigated by CC&#8217;s willingness to promote J&#8217;s religious heritage. J will continue to have contact with her mother, and this will provide an opportunity for the mother to support and promote J&#8217;s religious identity. </p>
