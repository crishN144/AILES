They are in a loving, committed, long-term relationship, and have every intention of remaining so. In 2019, when living in France, they entered into a French form of civil partnership, a &#8216;PACS&#8217;. In 2022 they returned to live in England. Their intention was to dissolve the PACS and enter into a civil partnership in this jurisdiction. They had been given to understand that this was extremely simple, but unfortunately, they have found themselves embroiled in a tangle of red tape. </p>

They understood that the PACS would bring with it some tax benefit; they would be taxed jointly, and would bring some inheritance advantage, in that if one died before the other, the survivor would inherit the estate if that was provided for in a will. Their understanding was that French inheritance law might present something of a minefield for them, particularly as they each had children from their previous marriages.</p>

During the course of discussions with their adviser, he suggested it might be a good idea to dissolve the PACS and enter into a civil partnership in the UK. His advice was that it would simplify their tax affairs, as they would not have to explain to HMRC the nature of the PACS every time they filed their returns. Further, he said that the UK may at some point in the future change its tax treatment of a French PACS, but it was impossible at that stage to advise when or in what way that might happen. </p>

Nonetheless, I directed that they file a statement to explain in more detail the tax reasons behind their decision to enter into the PACS and then to dissolve it. I needed to be satisfied the Court was not effectively being invited to support a tax avoidance scheme. Next, I wanted to understand the information the parties had submitted in support of their application to dissolve the PACS. If PACS was equivalent to a civil partnership in this jurisdiction, it seemed possible the parties might have been required to sign a document confirming their relationship had broken down irretrievably, when this was not true.
