It included some serious allegations of physical abuse. The cause was not defended. On 26 September 2013 the wife filed a statement endorsed with a statement of truth in proof of her petition. On 17 October 2013 the court certified pursuant to FPR r.7.20(2)(a) that it was satisfied that the allegations of conduct were true; that the wife could not reasonably be expected to live with the husband as a consequence; and that the marriage had irretrievably broken down. Decree nisi was pronounced on 15 November 2013. In the usual way that the decree says on its face that the court was satisfied that the husband had behaved in such a way that the wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him; that the marriage had broken down irretrievably; and that it should be dissolved unless &#8220;sufficient cause&#8221; be shown to the court within six weeks.</p>

The husband issued an application for Notice to Show Cause dated 23 October 2013 to uphold the terms of the parties&#8217; prenuptial agreement. The wife&#8217;s application for maintenance pending suit was heard by me on 10 December 2013.

I observe in passing, to my embarrassment, that it was heavily anonymised, but issued with no rubric. Therefore, without the risk of sanction, anyone could have identified the parties in a news report. It illustrates just how absurd, obscure and contradictory the law is about the reportability of judgments issued anonymously.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife&#8217;s position is superficially curious and the facts of this case are very unlikely to be repeated in the future. One might ask: why does it matter whether she is divorced pursuant to the 15 November 2013 decree, or pursuant to a divorce order yet to be made? The answer is that the prenuptial agreement provides for increasing levels of provision to be made to the wife depending on the length of the marriage (which is to be measured in full years from the date of the ceremony to the date of separation). </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The financial remedy order of 5 June 2014 applied the level of provision in the prenuptial agreement for a marriage of under two years. If the decree is set aside and this marriage is treated as having lasted for eight years then the level of provision is increased quite substantially both in respect of free capital, capital in trust and spousal periodical payments. I calculate that the agreement would give the wife an extra &#163;1.7m housing capital (to be held on trust for her benefit during her lifetime while she remains single) on top of the &#163;2m such housing capital in trust already provided; a lump sum of &#163;250,000; and additional spousal maintenance of around &#163;13,500 per annum, on top of the existing maintenance now standing, with indexation, at &#163;123,000 per annum.</p>

He says that the court rightly found in 2013 that the marriage had irretrievably broken down. And he argues that such breakdown was not &#8220;retrieved&#8221; when the parties resumed a relationship in 2014.</p>

Her fairly anodyne petition was undefended and on 21 May 1977 she was granted a decree nisi under the special procedure. After the decree the husband attempted a reconciliation and in June or July 1977 the wife agreed to his return to the matrimonial home because she wished to give him an opportunity to change his behaviour as he had promised and because she thought his return would benefit the children. The wife's evidence was that all was well for the first five or six months of the reconciliation but that thereafter the husband's behaviour deteriorated and the reconciliation came to an end. However, the parties continued to cohabit and have sexual relations for some 3&#189; years until February 1981 when, after a single violent incident, the husband left the matrimonial home saying the marriage was over. In June 1981, more than 12 months after the grant of the decree nisi, the wife made an application for the decree to be made absolute. The husband did not oppose the application and consented to a rescission of the decree nisi if the court should refuse to make it absolute. At the hearing of the application the wife submitted that, although more than 12 months had elapsed since the decree nisi, the court should exercise its discretion to make the decree absolute because (i) at the date of the application the marriage had broken down because of the husband's behaviour, (ii) the period of reconciliation after the decree nisi had lasted only five or six months and (iii) in all the circumstances it would be wrong to rescind the decree nisi and require the wife to present a fresh petition.</p>

He submitted, however, that it was wrong that reconciliation, once achieved, should be continued with the threat of a decree nisi hanging over the head of the respondent to the suit. Encouragement should be given to the parties to agree to rescind the decree under r 64 of the Matrimonial Causes Rules 1977. His second main submission was that a stale decree nisi should not be given new life, especially when a prolonged cohabitation had taken place since it was pronounced. The test he proposed was whether the inference drawn by the court originally from the facts that 'the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent' was still justified in the light of subsequent events.&#8221;</p>

The only relevant test here, he submits, is that set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Savage v Savage</span>, which is at a lower level than that in <span style="font-style:italic">Owen v Owen</span>. Mr Ewins&#8217; argument overlooks the fact that Route C cannot be invoked by a petitioner. Rather, Route C presupposes that the petitioner will be a passive actor and the only directly live  issue is the respondent&#8217;s application for decree absolute. The application made by the petitioner here is under Route A alone and there is nothing to suggest that the jurisprudence developed under that procedure does not apply to her application. The only reason that the <span style="font-style:italic">Owen</span> case law is in play at all is because the husband made his own application for the decree to be made absolute.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept that a marriage may function without cohabitation or a sexual relationship. A functioning marriage does not require the parties to love one another. It does require, however, that the parties recognise that they enjoy a particular status and that they are in a formal union of mutual and reciprocal expectations of which the foremost is the sharing of each other&#8217;s society, comfort and assistance. It is true that some marriages degenerate into a toxic relationship of antipathy, resentment and cruelty. Some time was spent during the hearing discussing the marriage of Martha and George in &#8220;Who&#8217;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&#8221; Notwithstanding their appalling mutual loathing it was a functioning marriage &#8211; it was one of those marriages where the spouses can neither live peaceably with each other nor live apart. But no one forms a marriage on that basis. And it is hard to conceive, following a decree nisi, that parties would reconcile on that basis. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">And so I turn to the evidence given in this case. The wife was by far the better witness. Her evidence was generally clear and given in reasonable tones. She generally answered questions directly. In contrast the quality of the evidence of the husband was poor. He was combative, evasive, rhetorical, strident and in some respects obviously untruthful. For example, he flatly denied that the wife had a key to his home in Belgravia. Yet there is a WhatsApp message from him in which he is expressly states that she has the keys to his house.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, this case is a good example of the perils of placing emphasis on the demeanour of a witness, or placing too great a reliance on a witness&#8217;s irrelevant lies or other low conduct, when finding facts or exercising a discretion. In my judgment, the demeanour of a witness when giving evidence is unlikely to be a reliable aid either to finding facts, or exercising a discretion on uncontested facts. It is not just that a dishonest witness may have a very persuasive demeanour &#8211; that is of course, the first trick in a conman&#8217;s repertoire. But  the opposite side of the coin is equally problematic in that a truthful witness may unfortunately have a classically dishonest demeanour. It is obvious to me that over-reliance on the &#8220;quality&#8221; of the evidence of a witness, good or bad, can lead to facts being found, or discretion exercised, by reference to influences that are irrelevant<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="11">

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of the day in this case there was not much difference between the parties as to the dismal quality of their relationship from the moment of its formation. One key difference concerned the issue of whether there was in the period before decree nisi physical violence meted out by the husband to the wife. In her petition the wife pleaded two specific acts of violence, the first in the summer of 2012 at the husband&#8217;s home in Belgravia, and the second, in August 2013 when the parties were on holiday in Spain. Although in his evidence before me the husband denied these events took place, they had been proved by a statement endorsed with a declaration of truth by the wife, which was not contested. Those events were accepted as true by the court and were the factual basis for the decree. The wife confirmed in her oral evidence to me the truth of those allegations. I am completely satisfied that they are true, and in any event the husband is estopped from denying the truth of them.</p>

I have been given a thick file of WhatsApp messages between the parties which make very dispiriting reading and which certainly bears out the suggestion that there was a great deal of psychological abuse through this medium (although the messages show that the wife gave as good as she got).</p>

She asserted that, physical violence apart, they resumed their marriage just as it had been before. Although they did not live together permanently, as before, she would spend on average three nights a week with him and of course they would go on lengthy holidays together. They held themselves out to the world as a married couple, for example accepting a joint invitation to the wedding of Mr and Mrs Blair&#8217;s daughter and going to the World Economic Forum in Davos together.  Although the adoption of J was by the wife alone in proceedings in Russia, the husband was fully involved and was, she says, a de facto adoptive parent, who treated J, as he now accepts, as a child of the family. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband&#8217;s evidence was that the relationship was equally bad before and after decree nisi. He disputed there was any kind of meaningful reconciliation although he accepted that sexual relations took place on a few occasions in 2016, 2017 and 2018. He also accepted that the parties went on holiday together. He explained that he did so in order to be able to have contact to his children in circumstances where the wife was prone to limit his contact. He trenchantly disputed that they spent as many as two nights a week together. When he was asked why he did not apply before 14 January 2022 for the decree nisi to be made absolute his answer was that he loved the wife and he wanted to have her back. In his evidence he said: "we could not stay in the same room for five minutes without arguing. But I loved her. I still love her." This highlights just how toxic and unpleasant was their marriage, and their later "reconciliation".</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are paradoxical aspects to the respective cases. The wife&#8217;s case is that notwithstanding the terms of her petition, verified by her with a statement of truth, and found to be true by the court, the decree pronounced was erroneous, because she could, and did, live with the respondent and it was reasonable to expect her to do so. Further, it was doubly erroneous as the marriage had not irretrievably broken down. Put more simply, she argues that the decree was wrong and contrary to the justice of the case because 12 months after its pronouncement she resumed her disastrous, toxic and unhealthy relationship with the husband.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My finding on the evidence is that this was always a highly defective marriage. The husband was rightly found to have behaved in such a way that the wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him. On 17 October 2013 (the date of the certificate, which was formalised on 15 November 2013 by pronouncement of decree nisi) the court rightly found that the marriage had irretrievably broken down.  The parties were drawn back together about 12 months after the making of the decree nisi, but it would be an abuse of language to describe their resumed relationship as a marital reconciliation. While they may have referred to each other, and to the world, as husband-and-wife there was no enjoyment of each other&#8217;s society, and no mutual comfort and assistance. They did not, in the words of Lord Stair, derive any solace or satisfaction from their relationship. The treatment by the husband of J as a child of the family, with the consequential acceptance of financial liability, is very virtuous, but does not, in my judgment, lead me to conclude that the resumed relationship constituted a functioning marital reconciliation.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence in this case comes nowhere near to demonstrating that the findings made on the making of decree nisi were wrong, let alone so wrong that to allow the decree to stand would be demonstrably unjust. The evidence shows that the parties had a highly defective marriage which was rightly put out of its misery by the making of decree nisi. For reasons that have not been explained, for 12 months after the pronouncement of the decree, but before the &#8220;reconciliation&#8221;, the wife did not apply for the decree nisi awarded in her favour to be made absolute. That delay is very puzzling, In November 2014 she and the husband resumed a toxic, damaging and unhealthy relationship which had none of the qualities of marriage and which cannot be described as a marital reconciliation. That relationship endured until March 2020 when it came to a final end. However, I am completely satisfied that at all times following the decree nisi their marriage was and remained irretrievably broken down.</p>

The fact that the wife made no such application speaks volumes.</p>

I have carefully considered this list and  nothing in it gives me pause for thought as to the correctness of my decision. These, in brief, are my reasons:</p>

But, the fact that the parties lived in separate dwellings before and after decree nisi was clearly expressed in para 52 of the draft judgment where I wrote:</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Then, Mr Ewins refers to my failure to mention that after decree nisi the financial remedy order was never fully and formally implemented. Instead, the husband gave the wife financial support including gifts of value in excess of his formal liability. Para 62  refers to the fact that the financial order had never taken full effect. That the husband had supported the wife ad hoc in this way threw no light on the quality of the relationship and whether there had been a genuine marital reconciliation. It showed that the husband&#8217;s attempts to get her back (as he put it)  extended to material inducements but it revealed nothing to me about the quality of the relationship beyond that. </p>

This is true, but so what? This availability was of no relevance whatsoever to the issues I had to decide.</p>

In my judgment the omissions (if they were indeed omissions) were of no materiality in the legal and factual analysis which I had to undertake. It has taken me some time, at the expense of other work, to deal with complaints which I regard as flimsy and meritless. In my judgment, advocates must consider very carefully, dispassionately and disinterestedly whether there are, on objective analysis, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">material</span> omissions from the judgment. The omissions would only satisfy the criterion of materiality where it can be plausibly and convincingly argued that a completely different decision would likely have been reached had they been bought into account. </p>
