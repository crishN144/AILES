The Court is looking to determine if there is clear and convincing evidence that the Gestational Carrier&#8217;s motivation in participating in the surrogacy was not connected to the money that she received. Meaning, the money was not an inducement for her to participate in the process....In the case at hand, the additional &#8216;gift schedule&#8217; appears to be in line with what the Nevada court&#8217;s find to be proper. The gifts and the contract are not contingent upon delivery of a healthy child, handing over of a child to the Intended parents.....it is not out of the ordinary to see a monthly living expense of $2,000 a month and it is not out of the ordinary for a surrogate&#8217;s monthly living expenses to increase dramatically at weeks thirty four, thirty six and upon birth...In conclusion, I am confident that a Nevada Judge would find the sums paid to the Carrier in this case were not disproportionate to her reasonable monthly living expenses. That the Surrogate was not &#8216;bought&#8217; for lack of a better term in violation of the public policy that existed under Nevada law at that time.

This view has been subsequently endorsed by Ms Surratt. I also note that since the 1 October the law in Nevada has changed to permit compensation to be paid. Therefore, the circumstances of this case do not amount to a clear case of the abuse of public policy where the court would exercise its discretion in refusing to retrospectively authorise the payments made by the applicants.

The court has the benefit of a detailed report from the Parental Order Reporter Ms Jolly and the written statements from the applicants. The children are the biological children of both applicants. They have never lived with anyone other than the applicants and all the evidence points to them flourishing in their care. As Ms Jolly observed they are &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">contented, much loved and well cared for&#8217; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">children. A parental order will give permanency and security to the day to day arrangements that exist at the moment. Most importantly a parental order will confer joint and equal legal parenthood and parental responsibility upon both applicants. This will provide lifelong security for the children&#8217;s relationship with the applicants, which is what the welfare of each child overwhelmingly demands. </span></p>
