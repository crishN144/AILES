I have not set out all of the evidence which I have heard and read but a summary and have highlighted some particularly relevant matters.

Thereafter, I will consider the future welfare of P and R including the need for orders and plans for them at a future hearing. The matter was originally listed in April 2023, then in August 2023 and indeed this hearing itself was originally planned to be a composite hearing where welfare would be considered but it could not proceed on each those occasions for a number of reasons, largely due to failures of the local authority.</span></p>

This would be logical from medical knowledge of the processes that occur after a fracture has been sustained. Bleeding from the broken surfaces of the bone occurs into the surrounding tissues. As the blood denatures, this initiates an inflammatory process which results in swelling. It is this process which maximises symptoms. </span></p>

He is then described as appearing unsettled with mottled skin. An assessment of these symptoms is complicated by the fact that he may very well have been suffering with a viral upper respiratory tract infection at this time. He notes that it was thought likely by doctors who examined him at [a] Children&#8217;s Hospital that this was the diagnosis. This may very well have accounted to him appearing to have mottled skin and to be unsettled and it would be recognised that viral infections can cause conjunctivitis&#8221;.</span></p>

This would fit with the reports of Mother of his leg appearing swollen by the late afternoon (i.e., possibly around 16.00). He perceives there to be some inconsistency about the exact time at which an abnormality of the leg was noted. P&#8217;s mother is recorded by hospital staff as saying there was an abnormality from approximately 16.00 on [a date].

However, he has experience of fractures missed by medical staff and a minority of small babies suffer less pain and discomfort. In his view, &#8220;this lends support to the idea that P had, very unusually, experienced little in the way of pain and discomfort from the fractured femur&#8221;. He disagrees with Miss Rowbottom&#8217;s assessment. He believes that her movement of P&#8217;s legs without him registering significant distress does not necessarily exclude the fracture having been present at this time.</span></p>

She stated that she had training in direct working with children at her previous residential work placement. She defended herself as being sufficiently experienced and qualified to do direct work with children, accepting that this was specialised and extreme work, despite not having specific training. However, she failed to demonstrate understanding of the correct processes of interviewing children for evidence in court proceedings, answering that she did not understand the specific question. Further, whilst she had heard of ABE (Achieving Best Evidence) interviews, when asked for her understanding of the same she replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;.

She asked leading questions and her lack of understanding of both that and correct interviewing procedures including ABE and the need for specific training for direct work with children, together with her overconfidence that she had done nothing wrong and indeed would do it again cause me considerable concern. There are inaccuracies and even seemingly &#8220;spin&#8221; or impressions in her record (adding the comments about mother and father being present or not), which were only created only after conversations with the lead social worker and colleagues. I asked her how long she had looked after R on the day and she said she did not know. I asked whether minutes or hours and eventually it was narrowed down to somewhere between 2 and 8 hours. I find it extremely difficult to believe that she could remember an insignificant (at the time) conversation with R about Mr B in such detail yet cannot remember for how long she looked after her. Furthermore, I cannot accept that this was the only conversation she and R had that day as she claimed. The note at I102 states that R was awake from 4am and did not sleep and &#8220;was chatty to all adults&#8221;, whilst being supervised by herself.</span></p>

She appeared to be providing straightforward, thoughtful and open responses to questions, taking a moment to consider the question in view of her difficulties as set out above. She was appropriately emotional and clearly loves her daughter and son. On occasions she had difficulty remembering timeframes and gave conflicting evidence on certain issues such as who and when she told about P&#8217;s swollen leg. At no time did I have an impression that she was being either dishonest or avoidant. She explained that she had been more concerned about P&#8217;s constipation, mottled colour and blue-ish lips and did not think that there was a major issue with the leg or concentrate on that until told it was fractured by a doctor. It was a time of great stress and now some 18 months ago, even leaving aside her &#8220;complex communication difficulties including processing, retaining and recalling information&#8221;. Her simplicity and lack of sophistication added to the overall impression of basic truthfulness.</span></p>

Her position with regard to the father was not accusatory, but merely it was effectively &#8220;not me so it must be him&#8221; and even then she still appeared reluctant to accept that it could be the father or could be a deliberate injury caused by the father although she accepted that it was possible. She had seen and heard nothing herself, he would have to answer for that. She showed considerable loyalty to him with her descriptions of his sciatica and lack of work causing him stress and frustration despite saying that following attending a domestic abuse course she now recognised that the relationship was not what she thought it had been. Her evidence suggested that father had been less supportive than when she had R. He was stressed with his back, out of work and moody but only violent to her on one occasion. He got annoyed with himself and shouted, slammed doors and walked out. She felt he got angry easily.</span></p>

She explained that father had only looked after P alone on only one occasion [that date] and had never looked after both children alone before then. He had only helped out with holding P about 3 times in total and changed only 5 or 6 nappies. On [a date] the father had looked after P for about 5-6 hours. Initially when she brought P down at 11am, he was in a baby-grow, when she got up again at about 4.45pm he was only wearing a vest and had a blanket. She had slept late due to a disturbed night but she was unclear in her evidence as to why or for how long she had been awake in the night, but certain that P had not been behaving abnormally. She emphatically denied any knowledge of how the injury had happened but she had not caused it herself. She did not speculate. At the hospital initially and with the paramedics she was more concerned about P&#8217;s colour and lips than the leg and she was in my judgment confused about when she had initially mentioned it and who to and how she described it rather than being untruthful. She was adamant that she had mentioned it to the doctors at Triage. Given her heightened state &#8220;I was all over the place, could have said [other things]&#8221; and her difficulties, it is understandable that she may have been confused. I did not discern any evidence of lying or misleading, just confusion &#8211; she has known problems with recall. P had been settled apart from when he cried shortly after father left to go to the doctors and became mottled in colour.</span></p>

She accepted that that could potentially be a mechanism for the break, being heavy handed and doing it wrong as per Dr Mecrow&#8217;s evidence, but she had not seen evidence of an injury on that occasion. </span></p>

He said that he was in a rush, with an x-year-old running about and he wasn&#8217;t looking what he was doing.

These were some of the very many &#8220;cannot/do not recall&#8221; or &#8220;not that I know of answers&#8221; given throughout his evidence. However, he did admit to holding him by one leg to change his nappy on the [date]. In answer to a question which became confusing for all and which I clarified with the assistance of the intermediary, he confirmed that his position was that he didn&#8217;t do anything but yet may have injured P. He didn&#8217;t think anything was wrong with P. My impression was that he meant that he had done nothing deliberately to harm P but accepted that he may have done so inadvertently.

The evidence for this behaviour is in the father&#8217;s medical notes and I simply do not accept that the nurse practitioner lied about this. In view of Father accepting in evidence that he was on that day, in his evidence, stressed, in pain, in temper, looking after an active x-year-old who can wrap him round her little finger and with difficulties with mobility it is entirely likely that he could behave in such a frustrated manner. </span></p>

In his statement he said he was at hospital until the early hours and he stated that he drove Ms A home and was arriving home at 5am when the police arrived, following him from </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Mr B</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000">&#8217;s house. Further, Father denied, specifically and repeatedly when the question was clarified, that he had been present when the doctors revealed the information about P despite knowing that the x-ray had been ordered 20/25 minutes after concern about an injury was initially raised and the medical notes clearly state that &#8220;informed parents that P has a fracture or his right femur&#8221;. There is also reference to Father getting annoyed and leaving shortly after. (G322-323). He denied in oral evidence that the paramedics spoke to him whereas their evidence confirms that they did. I will address this issue again later. He denied suggesting that R should be cared for at </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Mr B</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000"> and Ms A&#8217;s house despite the clear evidence of the police and social workers that he did.</span></p>

There are further issues which also impact upon the children, including domestic abuse in parents&#8217; relationship (now reported to be over), supervision of R (P only being in the care of his parents for 5 weeks prior to his removal) and Father not engaging in the proceedings or contact with the children. He further identifies the area of largest concern, leaving aside the as yet unexplained injury sustained by P, highlighted in both parenting assessments as being mother&#8217;s ability to ensure the safety of the children. This encompasses a number of issues; lack of appropriate supervision leading to R being attacked on two separate occasions by one of the family dogs, during which she sustained substantial injuries. R spending time with her uncle Mr B, who is a registered sex offender with convictions in relation to Mother&#8217;s niece when she (niece) was 15 years old.

If the local authority proves on the balance of probabilities that J has sustained non-accidental injuries inflicted by one of his parents, this court will treat that fact as established and all future decisions concerning his future will be based on that finding. Equally, if the local authority fails to prove that J was injured by one of his parents, the court will disregard the allegation completely. As Lord Hoffmann observed in Re B:</span></p>

Whilst appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of medical experts, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence. The roles of the court and the expert are distinct. It is the court that is in the position to weigh up expert evidence against the other evidence (see A County Council &amp; K, D, &amp;L <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/144" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 851" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 851</ref> per Charles J).

They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child.</span></p>

As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, "nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another". Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their longsuffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm. This professional and realistic approach allowed the Court to focus on what was, in reality, the only live issue, namely; was GL's history of violence sufficient to lead to a finding of failure to protect upon the mother's part?&#8221;</span></p>

Hayden J addressed in detail the issue of propensity evidence and criminal matters at paragraphs 37 to 42 and in family matters from paragraphs 43 to 51. Given the nature of the mother&#8217;s position and submissions at the hearing, I invited the advocates to consider the case as it had been very recently reported and was of relevance. There are both similarities and differences between the present case and that matter. In the decision, Mr Justice Hayden underlined the duty on judges to draw on the totality of a wide canvas of evidence and, where that evidence permits, to identify the perpetrator of significant harm. He reminded us that this evaluation is carried out on the balance of probabilities (nothing more, nothing less) and, while this builds in a risk of error, lawyers and judges should not shirk that obligation out of an abundance of caution. The wide canvas of evidence invariably includes a variety of evidence, including hearsay and evidence of propensity to cause harm. Drawing together that evidence and properly drawing inferences from it assists in building a picture of the family&#8217;s life at the point at which significant harm is caused. Identifying the perpetrator avoids tainting the non-perpetrator parent while also providing the foundations for constructive and safe strategies for a child&#8217;s future care.</span></p>

However, there were striking differences in the nature of their evidence. I found the mother to be a more truthful witness on the whole, she did not seek to avoid questions or obfuscate. She made positive efforts to answer each question as well as she could and I give her credit for the fact that despite believing that the father was the perpetrator she still showed some loyalty to him as her children&#8217;s father. They have much history together and it is natural that she may behave in this manner particularly when they have been through the stress of IVF to have these children. It is not unusual for one parent to be unwilling to blame the other, particularly in the early stages of an investigation, nor is it unusual for parents to consider reconciliation. She has clearly moved on though, having begun to recognise the problems with the father and the relationship and I accept her evidence that there is no prospect of reconciliation, and indeed that it is her choice.</span></p>

His evidence was a distinct contrast to the mothers, with denials and frequent contradictions. His demeanour was very different when giving evidence and he showed no real emotion other than short bursts of frustration or temper. I accept he was in pain. It was easier to accept the mother&#8217;s evidence as being honest than the fathers for these reasons and others. I am of course aware of the father&#8217;s learning difficulties and they will undoubtedly have had some impact upon him when being questioned but there was an extremely helpful intermediary who intervened and assisted whenever necessary and I am satisfied that the evidential process with the father was entirely fair. The apparent ease with which he accepted and admitted that he may have been the cause of the injury to P (in contrast with his statement and having not seen any of the live evidence beforehand due to his failure to attend) suggested that this thought was not new to him and indeed he admitted in his evidence that he had given thought as to whether he had done something wrong on many occasions.

Whilst he has a number of convictions, none are for violent offences save for the caution which is I believe for the assault on the mother. There is no evidence of any physical abuse of the children although R&#8217;s evidence is that he shouted a lot and &#8220;threw her on the bed with her head&#8221; and she &#8220;screams a lot.&#8221; There is also a suggestion that she was slapped (F287).

He is admittedly heavy handed. He was unable to give a straight answer when questioned as to why he did not re-dress P in his baby-grow, firstly saying that it was a spur of the moment thing but when pressed, accepting that he had maybe tried to put it back on, but he couldn&#8217;t remember and P was mucking about. He accepted struggling to change P&#8217;s nappy and that that &#8220;might be&#8221; how the leg was broken. When he thought P was being a bit whingy, a bit whimpering, wriggling or agitated that may well have been the pain response to the leg fracture. I bear in mind that Dr Mecrow&#8217;s evidence was that P has highly unusual pain responses and as a very inexperienced, angry and heavy-handed carer Father was likely unaware of the extent of what he had actually inflicted upon P. Likewise the mother would have been unaware of the injury. Dr Mecrow had stated in evidence that a carer could be confused by the lack of an extreme response by P. It appears from the evidence of the ambulance workers that the father was, however, aware of something being wrong with P by their very detailed description of his behaviour when they attended and his protectiveness of P. Further, at page F236 they refer to the report of P being in pain; father made the call to the ambulance service and he reported the symptoms. They also say that &#8220;he appeared to be hyper anxious about P, to the extent that we had to repeatedly try to reassure him and tell him to calm down.&#8221; His live evidence minimised or denied this, saying that he did not tell them P was in pain and that he was not worried about P, the mother was. There are so many inconsistencies in father&#8217;s evidence and I prefer the evidence of the paramedics.

On the day of P&#8217;s hospital admission R appears somewhat confused, she talks about Mr B and [Ms A being present at her house and she says that Mr B was alone at first (F275), that they arrived at the same time (F279), at 10pm then later that mum and dad saw Mr B before they went to the hospital (F279). The police repeat to R about Mr B and Ms A being together and R does not disagree.</span></p>

She has a limited network of support and friends and Ms A was clearly such a friend. I have specifically considered the &#8220;Lucas&#8221; direction in relation to this issue and although I consider that the mother was not entirely open about Mr B, I am satisfied that this does not mean she has been untruthful about everything else. The simple fact is that it is not clear, to the advocates or even myself, how the precise details of any requirements for contact with Mr B were communicated to the mother and what was expected of her; there were changing sands according to the documentation which has been produced as to whether it was supervised or not. This is a mother who may not fully have the ability to understand subtle nuances about contact and she will have been terrified of having done something wrong. That fear may well have led her to downplay the extent of contact with Mr B. I accept her submission that she thought supervised contact was permissible. It is supported by her actions in ensuring supervision, recognising that Father did not take the issue seriously enough and I accept her evidence in this regard. I am satisfied that she did not facilitate any unsupervised contact with Mr B.</span></p>

Child protection was raised again in November 2020 following the second dog bite to R and there is mention than of a contract of expectations regarding contact with Mr B having to be agreed; there is mention of no contact at page I33. I have seen no such contract and indeed at the review meeting in [a date] 2021, there was no reference to Mr B at all. The minutes of the [a date] 2021 review are incomplete in the bundle. Since that time, until P&#8217;s injury, there is no evidence of involvement with the local authority until P&#8217;s injury. It is entirely understandable that the parents would be confused about contact with Mr B and defensive. The confusion is, in my judgment, entirely due to the lack of proper and detailed consistent guidance on behalf of the local authority.</span></p>

This was what she believed to be necessary and the issue was confusing for the advocates let alone a mother (and father) with their own issues. In my judgment, the threshold allegations were not sufficiently particularised nor were they linked to alleged harm and the suggested blanket ban on any contact at all was not supported by the evidence with documents referring to the need for supervision on occasion. The parents were entitled to a clear case to answer, they did not have this.</span></p>

There is no police evidence of father and R actually being at Mr B&#8217;s house, just the comments interpreted by the social workers as them being there. However the actual police record at F190 states that R is &#8220;at home&#8221; and the entry at 04.08 (1203) confirms that R &#8216;was momentarily at a family friends&#8217;. This supports the father&#8217;s contention that he took R with him to take Ms A home. Additionally, as I have already addressed, R also talks about Ms A coming to her home when P was taken to hospital. In any event, again there is no evidence of her being unsupervised.</span></p>

Father then offers Ms A as a carer for R, being &#8220;where R was prior to him taking her home&#8221;. This evidence is different to what the father claims &#8211; but it is far from clear. There is no mention by father to the police of having to take Ms A home from their house. Given father&#8217;s demeanor with the police, in refusing to identify himself and being upset and irate it is entirely possible that some confusion arose as to what exactly had happened prior to the arrival of the police. It is both parents&#8217; evidence that that Ms A had come to the house as requested, and I accept this happened. Unless therefore Ms A took R home to her home of her own volition, (for which neither parent can be held responsible)  the father&#8217;s version of events in taking Ms A home when he returned from hospital is entirely plausible and there is no evidence of other events. </span></p>

These are parents with a small support network and the issue with P was an emergency. I have no criticism of the mother (and indeed the father) for relying on Ms A for emergency support with R. The mother clearly views Ms A as a protective figure.</span></p>

This was during the period when Mr B was bailed to her house in [a date]. Mother&#8217;s evidence was mainly that the family have met in town, that R has spent time with Ms A alone but that R has never been into Mr B&#8217;s flat with her.

At the Child Protection Conferences in [a year] the action points were for Mr B to have no unsupervised contact with R and recorded that R was always supervised by her mother. At the Child Protection Plan meeting on [a date] (about the dog) there was reference to no contact with Mr B but on [a date] Mr B was not mentioned at all. </span></p>

There is no evidence that the mother or father have allowed R to spend any time alone with Mr B (see above), let alone willfully exposed her to a risk of sexual harm. On the contrary the mother&#8217;s evidence was that she had taken steps to avoid Mr B coming into contact with R directly and had protected her. She herself had never taken R into Mr B&#8217;s flat and she had conversations with the father about Mr B, but she felt that he didn&#8217;t take it seriously enough. She did not know for sure whether he had taken R to the flat himself but questioned this. She knows of one occasion where R told her she had been to Mr B&#8217;s with her father for 5 minutes, a few weeks before P&#8217;s injury. </span></p>

It is not appropriate to simply say any contact. The criteria should have stated whether unsupervised or not and also what and how such harm could be caused particularly if any contact  was supervised. It may be unwise for any contact but that is far from satisfying the statute and case law in relation to threshold and risk.</span></p>

The father does not seek to care for the children.
