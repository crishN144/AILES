Further, the Local Authority has not been named. Whilst the identity of the arm of the State bringing the application is generally in the public interest, the Court determines on the specific facts of this case that identity of the Local Authority is more likely in turn to lead to the identification of the children. The anonymity of the children and members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of Court and may result in a sentence of imprisonment.</span></p>

The Local Authority&#8217;s applications are made against a background of concerns of neglect, physical and emotional harm of the children arising from domestic abuse between the parents, parental substance misuse, alcohol misuse and poor parental mental health. The family has been known to the Local Authority since October 2020, after the birth of the first child, following a police referral around domestic abuse. The Local Authority received several high-risk referrals from partnership agencies (NSPCC, police, Families First, and health visiting services) regarding increasing incidents of severe physical domestic abuse between the parents witnessed in the period from January 2022 to August 2022. The parents and the children were at all times living in the home of the Paternal Grandparents. The parents have been the subject of Local Authority intervention, which has included &#8216;early help&#8217; through the local family centre, a package of individual domestic abuse intervention, intensive parenting support and a Child and Family Assessment. The Health Visitor raised concerns in respect of poor home conditions, the absence of a safe place to sleep for &#8216;Z&#8217; and a lack of parental engagement. The mother was observed by the Social Worker to have bruising to her neck. The Social Worker was refused entry into the family home when an unannounced visit was attempted in July 2022. The precipitating event took place on 15 July 2022 when the police received four separate calls of domestic abuse incidents in the family home. The father was noted by the police to have two lacerations on his lip, leading to the arrest of the mother. The home conditions were described by the police to be &#8220;messy, dirty and not in a fit state to house children.&#8221; The children were removed from the home by the police exercising powers of protection and placed in Local Authority foster care. A further police referral was received following a domestic abuse incident on 5 August 2022 when it was reported that the father punched the mother in the eye. The children remained in Local Authority foster care under a section 20 voluntary arrangements until the Local Authority issued its application on 2 September 2022, leading to Interim Care Orders being made by the Court for both children on 21 September 2022. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:11pt">This case has a lengthy and exceptional litigation history. The case is approaching its second anniversary against the statutory time limit of 26 weeks stipulated by s.32(1)(a)(ii) Children Act 1989. The Court at all times had firmly in mind the provisions of section 1(2) of the Children Act 1989 which commands the Court, as a matter of law, to have regard to the general principle that delay in determining any question with respect to the upbringing of a child is likely to prejudice the welfare of that child. Prompt determination of care proceedings under Part IV of the Children Act 1989 is not a mere aspiration. Section 32(1)(a) of the 1989 Act requires the Court, as a matter of law, to draw up a timetable with a view to determining public law proceedings without delay and, in any event, within 26 weeks. Section 32(1)(a)(ii) defines, subject only to the qualification in section 32(5) and compliance with the requirements of sections 32(6)(7), a mandatory time limit which applies to all cases. The extent to which the 26-week period can be extended is strictly circumscribed by reference to the child&#8217;s welfare and the impact on the duration and conduct of the proceedings. Pursuant to s.32(5) Children Act 1989, the Court may only extend the 26-week period if it considers an extension necessary to enable the Court to resolve the proceedings justly. On the specific facts of this case, extensions to the statutory time limit were necessary in the interests of the children, striking a balance between the need for further information and the presumptive prejudice to the children of delay as enshrined in s.1(2) of the Act. In considering the justice of this case, the legal requirement in s.1(2) to have regard to the prejudicial effect on the children of delay weighed heavily in the balance. However, in the specific circumstances of this case, extensions were exceptionally required with </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">specific</span><span style="font-size:11pt">&#160;justification, in the best interests of both children.</span></p>

On 15 July 2022, the children were removed to a temporary Local Authority foster care placement by police exercising powers of police protection.</span></p>

Notwithstanding his entitlement to free, independent specialist legal advice, the father attended that hearing as a litigant in person. All other parties were legally represented.  At a Case Management Hearing on 31 October 2022, at which the father was legally represented, directions were given by the Court to obtain expert evidence in the form of alcohol and drug testing and for cognitive testing of the mother. Parenting assessments were directed to be completed by the Local Authority. An Issues Resolution Hearing was fixed for March 2023 with a Final Hearing fixed for 3 April 2023, within the 26-week timetable. No alternative carers were advanced by either parent to care for the children, the Maternal Grandparents having informed the Local Authority that they did not wish to be assessed. The children moved to a second interim foster care placement and were reported to have settled well, it being noted that the child &#8216;W&#8217; was not displaying the same concerning behaviours as had been displayed in the previous emergency foster care placement. The Case Management Order records, &#8220;The Local Authority and Children's Guardian will continue to keep under review whether a paediatric assessment is necessary.&#8221;</span></p>

The Maternal Grandmother had informed the Guardian shortly before the hearing commencing on the morning of 3 April 2023 that she wished to be assessed as a Special Guardian for the children, having previously informed the Local Authority that she did not wish to be assessed. The care plan advanced by the Local Authority was one of adoption of both children. The Guardian&#8217;s application to adjourn the Final Hearing was supported by both parents. The Second Respondent father did not attend the Final Hearing. He had informed his Counsel that he did not intend to attend. The Guardian&#8217;s application to adjourn the Final Hearing was granted, the Court determining that an assessment of the Maternal Grandparents and the consequent delay was necessary and in the best interests of the children to ensure that the Court had the information necessary to make informed welfare decisions for the children. The Local Authority was directed to prepare a Special Guardianship assessment of the Maternal Grandparents with consequent directions for filing updated evidence. The proceedings were extended, as a necessary measure consistent with the welfare of the children, to facilitate that assessment.

The written assessment and covering letter were written in English. The assessment process was conducted in English.

The Paternal Grandparents were both assisted throughout the hearing by an interpreter. The Guardian informed the Court in her oral evidence that, whilst she remained very concerned about delay for the children, she acknowledged the limitations of the viability assessment of the Paternal Grandparents. The Guardian expressed being troubled by the oral evidence of the Paternal Grandparents in respect of their insight. The Guardian did not, at that stage, support the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; application for a full Special Guardianship assessment by an Independent Social Worker. However, taking into consideration the task of the Court to assess the realistic welfare options for the children and the need to balance the positives and negatives of each option, taking into consideration the draconian nature of the Orders sought by the Local Authority and the need for the Court to be satisfied that nothing else will do before a Placement Order is justified, the Guardian recommended a specific, time-limited piece of work for the Paternal Grandparents. The Guardian recommended an adjournment of the Final Hearing for ten weeks to afford the Paternal Grandparents an opportunity to engage in the work proposed, such work to be completed by the Local Authority with the Paternal Grandparents, with a short, updated report from the Local Authority setting out the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; progress and for the application for an Independent Social Worker to be adjourned until after that work was carried out.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The Court expressed very real concerns about delay, acknowledging the impact on the children as to their ability to achieve permanence.  The delay by the Paternal Grandparents in coming forward and seeking assessment was not adequately explained in their evidence. Nevertheless, having come forward at a late stage, and the Local Authority having taken upon itself the task of completing a viability assessment without first referring the matter to the Court, the Court acknowledged that the Paternal Grandparents had done everything reasonable to challenge the assessment, in time. The Court acknowledged that the prospects of grandparents taking over a child&#8217;s care must always be looked into carefully because it can greatly benefit a child to be kept in the family. Further, the Court acknowledged that these Paternal Grandparents have a strong connection with the children. The children lived in their household from birth until their removal. The viability assessment identified some positives. Since the children were removed, the parents had separated and moved out of the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; home. The Paternal Grandparents were clear in their oral evidence that they would not allow their son back into their home and they would contact the police if he tried to do so. The Court acknowledged that the risks to the children from the parents if placed in the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; care could be reduced by the making of protective orders. There was no suggestion that the Paternal Grandparents used alcohol or substances, there was no evidence they were violent to the parents or to each other and there was no evidence of domestic abuse in the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; relationship. The Paternal Grandparents provided financially for the children. They are financially secure and in good health. The Paternal Grandfather was available to look after the children. They appeared to have support from family members, including an adult daughter and niece. They had cared for their own children and niece without involving Childrens Services. The Paternal Grandparents stepped in to ensure these children&#8217;s care needs were met when the parents were not available due, to the parents&#8217; alcohol abuse and domestic abuse. Further, in their oral evidence, the Paternal Grandparents acknowledged some understanding of domestic abuse and the impact on children. They accepted that their understanding could be developed further. They indicated a willingness to understand. They were committed to the children. They were willing to undertake the work recommended by the Guardian and to receive visits from professionals. The Paternal Grandfather&#8217;s evidence was that, at the time of the Social Worker&#8217;s visits to the home, the Social Worker barely acknowledged the grandparents and no advice was given. The Local Authority evidence records that during one Social Work visit to home, the Social Worker noted that when she tried to engage the Paternal Grandmother, her son, the father of the children, shouted at the Paternal Grandmother. It did not appear that the Social Worker explored matters further with the Paternal Grandparents. </span></p>

They struggled to understand documents without support and they struggled to read English, as English is not their first language. Although the viability assessment concluded negatively, it was plain to the Court that the two meetings between the Social Worker and the Paternal Grandparents were conducted in English. Although the grandparents declined an interpreter in those meetings, it was clear there were areas of the assessment where they would have benefited from an interpreter, particularly when discussing complex issues around the impact of domestic violence and what steps they could have taken to protect the children. </span></p>

People who are bi-lingual regularly switch from one language to another, expressing themselves in terms which most readily come to mind. That code switching is quite normal. However, languages do not operate in ways that match each other identically. They can differ in grammatical structure, vocabulary, the meaning of abstract concepts and how much is directly spoken as opposed to understood between the lines. An interpreter&#8217;s role is to transfer, as nearly as possible, the meaning of what is said, not merely to translate words and phrases literally, which can create a false impression. English, like other languages, is not a neutral or culture-free language. It is freighted with embedded cultural assumptions. Many words in English do not have exact single-term equivalents in many other languages. It is difficult to interpret fine distinctions and these may be hard for people to understand.</span></p>

The Guardian was of the view that the conditions of the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; home internally had improved and those conditions appeared to be good enough. The question was whether the home conditions could be maintained in the long term and whether the dangerous conditions in the garden could be improved upon, noting that the number of occupants in the home had reduced considerably. At the time of removal of the children by the police, the Paternal Grandfather was out of the country and remained out of the country for a longer period than expected, as the family had experienced a double bereavement. Further, the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; wide support network had not been explored. </span></p>

An adjournment, the Court concluded, would best meet the welfare needs of the children by keeping open the prospect of them remaining in the family. As the Guardian said in her oral evidence, the work envisaged with the Paternal Grandparents was necessary: the Court could not properly make final orders, as the Court did not have all the information necessary to carry out an informed, comparative welfare analysis. </span></p>

The Local Authority agreed to provide the work through a consultant Social Worker, with the benefit of an interpreter, to deliver the programme of work to the Paternal Grandparents, covering the issue of the impact on the children of living with parents with substance misuse, exposure to domestic abuse, how childhood trauma affects development and how to care for a child with developmental trauma. The Local Authority envisaged that such work could be delivered over six sessions of 1 hour each, concluding on 1 December 2023. In addition, a Child Practitioner would be available to cover the issue of the basic care needs of the children, home conditions, safety in the home, health and hygiene and the role of safeguarding professionals.

The Court agreed with the Guardian&#8217;s professional conclusion that the viability assessment did not give answers to those important questions. Having regard to those significant gaps, the Guardian informed the Court that, when considering whether to make a Placement Order, a ten-week delay to allow the work to take place before considering whether a further assessment was required was a purposeful delay in the best interests of the children.</span></p>

The Court agreed with the Guardian&#8217;s professional recommendation that work needed to be completed with the Paternal Grandparents to inform the Court as to whether full Special Guardianship assessment was necessary and that educative work with the Paternal Grandparents needed to take place before full assessment commenced.  Having regard to the issue of delay, the Court noted that, if following the educative work proposed, a Special Guardianship report was ordered, this would necessitate at least a further three-month delay for assessment, in addition to further time thereafter for final evidence. The Court had regard to risk that any further adjournment might disrupt the children&#8217;s lives to such an extent that they might be harmed by the delay. As the Guardian observed, the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; understanding of their role in safeguarding the children was partly impacted by the Local Authority professionals keeping them at arm&#8217;s length, that treatment being evidenced also by the refusal of the Local Authority to allow the Paternal Grandparents to have contact with the children in their own right, despite the Paternal Grandparents requesting contact. The Paternal Grandparents&#8217; understanding was further compounded by the viability assessments being conducted without an interpreter, discussing complex issues, that resulted in the Local Authority reaching a negative conclusion. This Court agreed with the Guardian that the Local Authority should have insisted on an interpreter being used. Had the Local Authority applied to Court seeking directions prior to undertaking the assessment, that error might have been avoided. That opportunity was lost. The Guardian concluded from the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; evidence that the Paternal Grandparents did not know where to take their concerns, they did not know who to contact and they had an overall lack of understanding and awareness. </span></p>

The Court agreed with the Guardian&#8217;s professional, independent conclusion that the Court did not have all the evidence necessary to make final informed welfare decisions. Further, the Court agreed with the Guardian&#8217;s professional opinion that educative work was necessary, in best interests of the children, to enable the Paternal Grandparents to engage, to take on board professional recommendations, to implement strategies, to work transparently with the Local Authority and that ten weeks to complete that educative work was fair and just. The Court found no reason to depart from the careful, considered, balanced and child-focused opinions of the Guardian. The Court concluded that there was solid, evidence-based reason to believe the Paternal Grandparents were committed to make the necessary changes. Further, the Court concluded there was solid, evidence-based reason to believe that Paternal Grandparents would maintain that commitment. Whether there was reason to believe that the Paternal Grandparents could make the necessary changes would require further consideration once the Paternal Grandparents had completed the educative work proposed.</span></p>

Both parents failed to engage consistently with these Court proceedings. Both parents failed to comply with assessments directed by the Court to consider their cognitive ability and parenting capacity. There is unanimity of professional opinion that the risks concerning the parents&#8217; mental health, domestic abuse and substance and alcohol misuse remain unaddressed by the parents. There has been a lack of meaningful engagement by both parents with professionals. The combination of the identified risks is such that both children would be highly likely to suffer significant physical harm, emotional harm and neglect if placed in the care of either parent. The assessments throughout the proceedings concluded that neither parent has been able to bring about sufficient change to provide good enough parenting to a consistent level that would allow either parent to care safely for either child. The unchallenged evidence before the Court leads to the conclusion that the children would be at continuing risk of significant harm in the care of either parent and that no amount of professional support would adequately mitigate those risks. The Court must conclude on all the evidence that reunification of either child to the care of either parent is not a realistic option.  Neither parent challenges the limitations in their parenting capacity. Neither parent put themselves forward to care for either child.</span></p>

This is truly amazing because the children in [her country of origin] and small towns hardly have the opportunity for proper schooling but [the Paternal Grandmother] seems to have made up for it here, I guess driven by high motivation for success.  She hardly needed any dependency on the interpreter compared with the first applicant [Paternal Grandfather].&#8221;</span></p>

As indicated below, my assessment confirmed that the grandparents have grasped the realisation that they need to come to terms with the fact that the children&#8217;s parents were firmly implicated in the guilt of failing the children as a result of the domestic abuse substance and alcohol abuse.  We know about shame and honour, two opposite values that are strongly held, believed and practised in certain cultures, including those associated with the Islamic faith. We know about honour violence as one extreme example of this. Is it important to recognise that for a father and a mother to acknowledge and admit their son&#8217;s faults particularly associated with alcohol (banned in Islam) and the shame that it brings to their family. My view is that they were na&#239;ve to think that by denying past experiences in order to save their family honour, they probably hoped that it would be swept under the carpet. However, it is also my view that with a realisation of the consequences for their grandchildren, they would need to redress the balance between the need for the children to grow up within their care, and the need to protect their family honour and reputation. It is my view that they have moved on from the time they resisted accepting the reality of events and hiding behind cultural influences, to the reality of the need to assimilate into the mainstream culture and its values that places the children&#8217;s welfare and wellbeing above everything else in our lives.&#8221;</span></p>

The male Applicant [Paternal Grandfather] took responsibility for all of that, being the eldest male in the family with cultural/traditional expectations of full presence during such events for families. He was therefore absent from the scene, in [their country of origin] for some good length of time when the children&#8217;s care was so compromised by their parents, and they were removed into care&#8230;Both Applicants [Paternal Grandparents] feel that it was a series of misfortunes they faced at the time that prevented them from taking over the care of the two children involved in this case.

The children primarily and wholly were in the care of their parents; however the grandparents did baby sit and fed the children on occasions when they felt that the children&#8217;s parents had failed.&#8221;</span></p>

I feel that the children being placed in [Local Authority] care has led to a realisation of the reality of the situation&#8230;There may well be concerns regarding the father having influence over the grandparents, should the children be placed with them. However, the grandparents are steadfast in their view that the children&#8217;s wellbeing is their top priority, and that their son is an adult who is capable of looking after himself, and not needing them to look after him. Besides this, they are already well aware that their son, the children&#8217;s father is more often than not failing to confirm his attendance for contact. For them this is a firm confirmation of their view that their son lacks interest in the children, which in turn consolidates their motivation and drive to intensify their care and protection of the children, from either parent.&#8221;</span></p>

I advised the ISW I had recently completed an observation of supervised contact between the paternal grandparents, [the father] and the children on 21.03.2024&#8230;I observed that the children were extremely active, including climbing on furniture (including chairs, the table, and windowsill). The paternal grandparents and [the father] were not on each occasion proactive in taking the children down from the furniture often resorting to standing in front of them (to prevent injury from falling), rather than establishing appropriate boundaries by informing the children that it&#8217;s not allowed, they could hurt themselves and physically taking them down from the furniture.  I informed the ISW during feedback discussions following the contact session, when discussing day to day care arrangements of the children, [the father] stated that he has moved closer to his parents to be able to support his parents and assist with the care of the children, such as collecting them from school, if unwell. The paternal grandparents did not challenge their son at all, giving him the impression that such an arrangement would be suitable. The ISW asked about any concerns I had or had been raised regarding the children suffering with either additional needs or developmental trauma, which impact on their holistic development. I advised that both children were extremely young for any formal diagnosis, but [&#8216;W&#8217;] was displaying challenging behaviours (tantrums, throwing, hitting, targeting [&#8216;Z&#8217;] when upset), which resulted in the previous foster care placement, of two very experienced foster carers having broken down, with the carers reporting feeling unable to keep both children safe, during these incidents. The ISW advised the potential of the children having additional needs and suffering developmental damage could cause these children to require more specialist care than the paternal grandparents were able to provide.&#8221;</span></p>

Perhaps this is at the core of their consistent reluctance to accept the social workers&#8217; assertion of the damage to the children, as a result of their parent&#8217;s lifestyles in the past. There is therefore a big gap between the Local Authority&#8217;s view of concerns and that of the grandparents&#8217;. The grandparents have only seen the children in contact, describing them as highly active, but due to being so young, like many other children of their age.  They are of the view that if placed with them, within a short period of time, they will settle down and stabilise in their care.   The grandparents feel that they will give them every attention needed until they settle down. They feel that their contact sessions have shown their ability to cope well with them and to manage their highly active behaviour.  Having recently seen the reports of the staff from the Nursery where the children attend, it is of serious concern that after contact sessions, the children&#8217;s behaviour is very unsettled, demanding and agitated so that the professional carers deploy much energy to settle them down. I am of the view that this is more likely to be connected to the consequences of the children&#8217;s developmental damage, rendering them hypersensitive to out-of-routine changes/events, causing them agitation and a disruption in their senses of security and certainty.  Additionally, the &#8216;correcting&#8217; exchanges necessary from the contact supervisor needed to put the father in his place when he falters the rules, may also be picked up by the children as a &#8216;threat&#8217; to their sense of security. After contact, would be the time for them to consolidate, by reacting freely in unsettled manners that would need specialist care and input to stabilise them. In discussions with the Children&#8217;s Guardian on this issue, she also added another possible explanation, connected with the children&#8217;s possible memories of the family members before removal into care.&#8221;</span></p>

Facing a new situation is challenging and can often evoke a very unsettled and reactionary chain of behaviour which is not understood and difficult to deal with.   It must be acknowledged therefore that the developmental damage has significantly &#8216;robbed&#8217; both children from developing resilience, coping mechanisms and adaptability we expect and see in children of similar chronological age. They must lack the capacity to feel secure and resourceful to cope with change and challenge which is essential processes expected of normally developed children to be resourced and equipped with as they grow.   These are very complex issues to think about, to reflect upon and to grasp. Even many skilled carers may struggle to understand and to deal with such concepts. These are well-meaning and well-motivated and brave grandparents, driven by their desire and a sense of family honour to step in and offer their grandchildren the lifetime chance of growing up within the bosom of the family. However, their grandchildren need far more than that in caring for them.  These children need far more than &#8216;good enough&#8217; parenting skills. They need sustained and durable presence, drive and vitality, in every hour of every day of their lives from very dedicated carers. This is not just for the next few years but well into adult years, if not the whole life. We just do not know how and if, there will be a reasonable pace of progress when a child&#8217;s development is hampered through &#8216;damage&#8217; (as different from &#8216;delay&#8217;). All this is beyond the grandparents&#8217; capacity to grasp, holding unrealistic views of how well they think they can manage successful care of these difficult and hard-to-manage damaged children. A belief in the trauma the children have suffered is outside the grandparents&#8217; understanding.&#8221;</span></p>

The authorities, in order to approve them, will have to give serious thought to health and vitality factors that are fundamental to their long term developmental years. If these children continue to remain affected and be held back as a result of their developmental damage, then a greater emphasis would be needed to be placed on highly skilled and far more energetic knowledgeable carers.  I would even go further by adding here that, in the children&#8217;s best interests, they may even need to be placed separately. Whilst identity and origins are important factors when making every effort to find a suitable carer within the family, the children&#8217;s welfare and their future chances are always paramount for the Court.  We just have no idea how these two children&#8217;s lives will pan out developmentally, knowing as much as we currently know about the min terms of the developmental damage, developmentally [sic]. It is too early to know how concerns about them would unfold. It is far too early for any diagnosis at this very young age now until indicators for diagnosticians become clearer. This is not just about caring for them but substantially a potentially lifelong dedicated care, perhaps throughout adult years too.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.03in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The Court was further told of the Independent Social Worker&#8217;s opinion that, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">it is just not fair to dwell on the grandparents &#8216;capacity and ability&#8217; but the severity of the children&#8217;s state of damage. Report from the foster parent and the nursery are quite alarming. Do we really want to unfairly have high unrealistic expectations from the grandparents and judge them and their capacity for a task that can fail both them and their grandchildren?  The care of these two children, separately or together is in my view, beyond the capacity of any ordinary well-meaning care-giver. To meet these children&#8217;s needs, the grandparents would need to be far more resourceful and with far more insight into what developmental damage means and what skills are needed to settle down a child, affected by each and every challenge arising from change and disruptions in daily life.  Whilst the grandparents dedicated and deployed the very best of their resources during the contact sessions, looking after such children with such difficulties on a whole time basis and for years to come, is a different world to master. As for safeguarding the children from risks from their parents, I am no longer convinced that they would have the resolve or the motivation to stand up to their son&#8217;s challenges that might pose a risk to the children, nor do I believe that they understand the concept behind it. From the contact sheets I have read (mentioned above), the children&#8217;s father is in control of any dynamics involving the children, whilst the grandparents remain apologetic for his damaging stance and in firm control of his parents.  The father has no respect or regard for his elderly parents, he is very erratic in his dealings with issues to do with the arrangements, disrespectful of the authorities and is &#8216;a law to himself&#8217;. He is uncontrollable and can cause much damage to his children and potentially to his own parents if it comes to it. Contact records should be taken very seriously in putting together the unspoken state of relationships and the historical background&#8230;The children&#8217;s father has grown up to be unruly and disrespectful of anyone&#8217;s authority. Attraction and a taste for substances and possible alcohol misuse also exacerbate these attributes of disregard for rules and for others.  The children&#8217;s father has no inhibitions in the presence of anyone, from his own parents to others in authority over issues that should matter to him. It is inescapable that something seriously went wrong in his parenting when he was in the care of his parents and that raises questions about the grandparents&#8217; capacity for good care and to safeguard the grandchildren from anyone, specially their father. Besides all that, the grandparents will have their hands full with the competing sets of loyalties, driven by love and a sense of duty. The children need resourcefulness in the care they will receive, in addition to a sense of duty&#8230;Their long term (possibly lifelong) care will not be easy to secure without much thought and consideration and I guess, this will be a huge challenge for the Local Authority to surmount. On one hand, we know that when the children and their parents lived with these grandparents, neither grandparents were available for their grandchildren as explained earlier here: </span></p>

In migrating to a host culture, where traditions, law, beliefs and mind-sets have significant differences, conflict and breaches of values and standards may follow, with consequences that are now and here are subjected to examination and analysis&#8230;[the Paternal Grandmother]&#8230;seems, in my view, to have &#8216;burn-out, and resigned to full time work until entitled to receive her state pension. On the other hand, I think that going out to work has also been an opportunity to be out of the way in a household where she would have been the main housekeeper.  This situation will continue and be maintained, should even the children be placed with the grandparents. Should then, the need arises for the grandfather to go to [their country of origin] I think that out of convenience, he will take the children with him and let others there to look after them for his duration of stay.  Although he told me that should the need arise, their daughter&#8230;will help them out, I am not convinced that this is a durable or sensible option. It remains a concern as to how this issue would be addressed or what the &#8216;costs&#8217; would be to the children should other matters arise that need priority attention. This is because one knows that one is being watched and measured up to the standards of cultural fulfilment where shame and honour compete with each other when one is weighed up with their public image/actions and the rewards it offers. In short, we cannot/should not &#8216;bank&#8217; on that. It is always the &#8216;young who give to the elders&#8217;&#8230;The rhetoric in some cultures is to claim a &#8216;child-loving&#8217; tradition.

Whilst we come across parents from many traditional backgrounds of favouring sweet items, [the culture of the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; country of origin]  certainly has an unbreakable love for sweets, and the dental damage the children have at such a young age is testimony to this.

However, it is postulated that these children need far more than &#8216;good enough&#8217; care and may in fact need separate therapeutic care placements to enable them to survive life&#8217;s challenges, arising from the fundamental damage they have sustained as a result of the parents&#8217; lifestyles and behaviours. I do not recommend any training programme for the grandparents that would be of eventual benefit to these children. Meeting these children&#8217;s needs require carers who are &#8216;available&#8217; to be engaged with them therapeutically and tactically every hour of the day and as they become older, the task of care giving is highly likely to change and to become more demanding and complex. In line with their age-related changing needs, their placement(s) may even need to be reviewed.  It is very important to understand that we are still in the very early stages of learning about developmental damage, where as early as foetal development, brain and neurological system are affected and damaged when exposed to the damaging chemicals consumed by the expectant mother. Whilst we wish and hope the best for the children, it remains to be seen as to how their neurological resources they are left with, would fall in line with their social learning and behavioural norms formation. In some children with similar backgrounds, we have seen behaviour formations such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder as a child physically becomes older and stronger. Special care giving would go to some length to reduce the chances of this sort of situation. We owe it to both the children as well as the grandparents, to approach issues surrounding this case with head than with heart [sic].&#8221;</span></p>

The Independent Social Worker was directed to attend Court to give oral evidence.  In oral evidence, the Independent Social Worker told the Court, &#8220;My first recommendation was heavily orientated and based on information about the Paternal Grandparents and the children&#8217;s situation. I had asked before I began may I please have some reports about past contact sessions. These are usually the best indicators to guide us to assessment. They were not forthcoming until after I completed my first assessment, which was favourable towards the Paternal Grandparents, in a vacuum. I was more orientated in the direction of good enough parenting. I was not provided with the updated version of the bundle. As soon as I concluded my favourable approach to the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; assessment, a plethora of information began to come in, pointing in a different direction, that alerted me and worried me. I was quite concerned to find myself in that position. It was not fair to me or the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; either&#8230;In the absence of information, I had no option but to conclude the Paternal Grandparents have skills for good enough parenting. I was unaware of the extent of damage to the children and the consequences of that for them day to day.&#8221;</span></p>

It would have been a mismatch. That is why I changed my views&#8230;the children have consistently from the foster carer&#8217;s reports and from the day nursery, pointed us to the direction that we ought to be concerned seriously about the children&#8217;s behaviour and skills to match them&#8230;the foster care notes show how difficult the children can be and how much there is a need for input from skilled individuals is needed to calm them down&#8230;high skills in understanding why children behave in that manner, without agitating them further requires specialist experience. Not every foster carer can manage that&#8230;they may have sustained neurological damage. They have a dysregulated state of emotion. These children need much, much more than basic good enough care from ordinary parents. The foster care is already struggling&#8230;[it is] not sustainable. We cannot experiment with that&#8230;the children should not be guinea pigs in that. We cannot take risks. The Paternal Grandparents are novices in this situation. We are fantasising about that&#8230;we have to be very realistic. We cannot gamble and must not gamble. The lives of these children are precious&#8230;it&#8217;s a wishful idea.

The Independent Social Worker accepted that at the time of his first assessment, he was aware that the child &#8216;W&#8217; was displaying difficulties in regulating her emotions, including behaviour that was considered to be challenging, defiant and spiteful. The Independent Social Worker acknowledged in his first report that &#8216;W&#8217; was considered to be showing some signs of autism. The Independent Social Worker acknowledged that his positive assessment of the Paternal Grandparents in his first report was made in the knowledge of those factors. The Independent Social Worker told the Court that he had not asked the Local Authority for additional information, prior to concluding his first report. The information that changed his recommendation included details of the children reacting badly to contact on 15 March 2024. The Independent Social Worker told the Court, &#8220;The information came through very last minute. I was disappointed we were not informed at a much earlier time. It was quite alarming what I read. It changed my focus of this case at the time. I had to relate the aftermath of contact to the contact&#8230;it crossed my mind that much earlier memories of being at home with their grandparents&#8217; voices might be associated with difficult times at a very young age. I asked many questions, why should that be. I sided with a view that the children are more reacting to change and uncertainty rather than memories of individuals. I can&#8217;t say with certainty. It is a hypothesis.&#8221; When put to the Social Worker in cross-examination that the Local Authority did not place reliance on the statement from the nursery, the Independent Social Worker told the Court, &#8220;I was asked to take that on board in forming my views but there were many, many other concerns expressed.&#8221; When asked to identify the &#8220;many other concerns&#8221;, the Independent Social Worker told the Court, &#8220;The Guardian was keen I take on board her experience of contact.

The Independent Social Worker produced a note of that conversation. The note is dated 10 April 2024. The Independent Social Worker told the Court, &#8220;I may have erred on that. I put the date on later on. I may have lost count in the diary.&#8221; The Independent Social Worker told the Court that the Local Authority informed him that the behaviour of the children was, &#8220;markedly worse&#8221; after contact with the Paternal Grandparents. The Independent Social Worker told the Court, &#8220;That was the view that was formed. I was not sure whether it was due to the grandparents. My observations showed nothing wrong with their [Paternal Grandparents&#8217;] consistent efforts to manage contact. It would not have been fair to take a view and go along with that view. Its easy to form the view that contact and a deterioration in behaviour after contact is related. I can only speak from my observations. It would not be fair to blame the grandparents&#8217; ability or inability but the children need much more skilled and energetic people to take care of them. It is very concerning that the foster carers had to call on extra support to calm the children down&#8230;I am not of the view the grandparents can meet that challenge. It would not be just or fair to the children&#8230;to burden the grandparents with such a huge, enormous burden in caring for such difficult children&#8230;the current situation is, these are not two ordinary children. Their over hectic behaviours are out of line for their age and development&#8230;we are very much uncertain about what is going on in their heads and it would keep us busy for a long, long time to work out how to manage them.

The Independent Social Worker told the Court, &#8220;I commend them for that. I have no issue with that. There is a picture of uncertainty. They are playing well one day and demand extra help to manage them the next. That makes me more convinced there is neurobiological damage to them.

They are intelligent people. They have worked hard to succeed&#8230;They brought up a family. They know being grandparents they can do a lot of things they never had a chance to do as parents. They have a good understanding how to do things differently. To put all that into practice and to take it all on board, as we put on years, the learning curve begins to descend and the pace of it slows down&#8230;to deal with that at a pace the children need, right now, today, not next year, the level of support needed, its not practicable without the oversight of a Social Worker&#8230;the foster carer with all her experience is still learning how to manage the children.

The remaining gaps in the assessment related largely to information about the parents. It is plain the Independent Social Worker reversed his recommendation, after concluding his first report, only after speaking with the Allocated Social Worker and Children's Guardian. The change from a positive recommendation to a negative one was based exclusively on what the Independent Social Worker was told about the behaviour of the children in the care of the foster carer, following successful contact with the Paternal Grandparents. The Independent Social Worker did not seek to make direct enquiries with the foster carers. He did not seek to raise his concerns with the Paternal Grandparents.

Further, he expressed in oral evidence his view about the children being &#8220;difficult&#8221;, at one point referring to them as &#8220;demonic.&#8221; He made a series of theoretical assumptions when reaching his amended, negative conclusions.

She answered questions in cross-examination in a direct manner. She presented as very open and honest. She gave a good account of her own experience in the care of the Paternal Grandparents and the challenges they helped her overcome when she lived with them during her difficult formative years. Her own experiences, trauma and behaviours as a child were remarkably similar to those of the children &#8216;W&#8217; and &#8216;Z&#8217;. It is reasonable for the Court to infer that the Paternal Grandparents made a hugely positive contribution to &#8216;N&#8217; being the impressive person she is today and why she speaks so positively about them now. &#8216;N&#8217; was frank in her view that the Paternal Grandparents did not do enough to protect &#8216;W&#8217; and &#8216;Z&#8217; from their parents&#8217; domestic abuse and alcohol misuse. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, &#8216;N&#8217;s own experience of being cared for by the Paternal Grandparents as a child for an extensive period was compelling. Furthermore, her knowledge of the father and the challenges he faces was insightful. Yet further, her background employment experience would inevitably place her in a strong position to provide hands-on practical support, guidance and respite to the Paternal Grandparents if the children were placed in their care.  In this Court&#8217;s judgement, &#8216;N&#8217;s direct experience of being cared for by the Paternal Grandparents, her subsequent professional experience and her ongoing commitment to support the Paternal Grandparents in caring for the children places her in an extraordinary position to provide direct, targeted, robust support and advice to the Paternal Grandparents as an integral and vital part of their support network. This is evidence was not available to the Independent Social Worker and was not explored by the Independent Social Worker when he reached is negative conclusion regarding the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; ability to care for the children. </span></p>

The Paternal Grandparents struggle with their understanding of the children&#8217;s previous lived experiences and exposure to frightening adult behaviour, including domestic abuse, substance and alcohol misuse, living in a household where the conditions were not conducive to their development. Despite three sessions of educative work to develop insight, knowledge and awareness of risk, there is still some way to go to consolidate that knowledge and apply it to strategies in their parenting of the children. They are still at the very early stages of recognising and understanding the children&#8217;s needs. They may struggle to implement the strategies they have learned on a consistent basis. It takes time and practice and a real consistency for it to be effective. I accept they are genuine in terms of their willingness to learn, attend training and in putting themselves forward. The progress they are able to make somewhat slowed down. Work will probably need to be repeated to ensure it is embedded, to show how to apply strategies learned consistently towards the children. It may be a slower rate of change than we would want for the children.&#8221;</span></p>

I would not want to risk undoing that important work for the children&#8230;the children need more specialist care. The Paternal Grandparents, even with support, cannot offer that care. The Paternal Grandparents&#8217; care will be on a basic level.

These are very complex issues that require a lot of training and time to understand and respond. The children could regress in terms of their behaviour and that would present a larger challenge. There is a risk of placement breakdown because of the gaps around the grandparents&#8217; level of insight into the risk of their son and the mother. They struggle to fully understand the children&#8217;s presentation and behaviours. There is a risk they will struggle to manage the emerging challenging behaviours of the children by not offering consistency in their parenting approach. They are doing their best but there are still some quite significant gaps in their parenting capacity. Their ability to understand, reflect and apply strategies for parenting of the children is where they may have difficulties. A further programme of work would not assist in this case. There have been three quite intense parenting strategies provided to the grandparents. I think unfortunately they have not made the desired level of progress within the timescales provided&#8230;breakdown of the family placement would be absolutely devastating for the children to find themselves in similar circumstances with further instability. That would be extremely harmful for their development with the risk of future court proceedings.&#8221;</span></p>

It should not be for the Paternal Grandparents to understand their own gaps in learning and seek out training. That should be professionally led. A Care Order would provide an extra layer of support and safety&#8230;the children would need a wide range of support, professional and family support and clear strategies to employ with a clear direction as to what to do if things go wrong. In the early stages, this should be daily support to ensure the safety and welfare of these children. It would be a huge task for them to take on board care of these two children without a real network of support around them and a real understanding of where the behaviours come from, not just naughtiness but life experiences and to have to understand a consistency of approach. That would be key to moulding and shaping the children&#8217;s behaviour in the future.&#8221; The Guardian accepted that the option of a Care Order with the children in the care of their Paternal Grandparents was not considered in her written analysis: &#8220;I accept there is a gap there.

Similar behaviour had resulted in the breakdown of the placement with the second foster carers, who were highly experienced. The foster carer did not feel able to protect both children at times of tantrums, with [&#8216;W&#8217;] throwing toys. The focus of [&#8216;W&#8217;s] aggression was on [&#8216;Z&#8217;] who was a very young baby. The current foster carers are not therapeutic foster carers. They have support from other foster carers regularly.&#8221;  The Guardian accepted that she had observed another supervised contact session between the children and the Paternal Grandparents in June 2024 which was positive but she had not relayed that information to the Independent Social Worker. Further, the Children's Guardian told the Court that during this contact session, &#8220;the Paternal Grandparents showed a good understanding of what trauma can entail for children, more than a basic understanding.&#8221; Further, the Guardian accepted that, by reference to the foster care logs, &#8216;W&#8217;s behaviour is not challenging all the time. The Guardian accepted in respect of the recent contact between the children and the Paternal Grandparents, when the father was not present, &#8220;when it is just the two of them, the Paternal Grandparents managed the needs of the children very well and the Paternal Grandparents demonstrated they had followed advice.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.03in"><span style="font-size:11pt">Dealing with the first of those identified risks, the Independent Social Worker considered that the Paternal Grandparents had developed insight in respect of the harm caused to the children by the parents&#8217; behaviour, following the educative work he completed with them. The Independent Social Worker told the Court that the Paternal Grandparents had &#8220;moved on&#8221; in their understanding of the impact of domestic abuse and had developed a good level of insight.  The professional opinion of the Independent Social Worker was not shared by the Local Authority Social Worker, who considered that the grandparents continue to have a limited understanding of domestic abuse and its impact. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the Independent Social Worker was well placed to assess the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; level of insight, having undertaken educative work with them, in their first language. Further, the Court accepts the submission made by Miss Choudhury on behalf of the Paternal Grandparents that it is not necessary for the Paternal Grandparents to demonstrate a sophisticated or complete understanding of the impact of domestic abuse in order to safeguard the children. There is no reported domestic abuse between the Paternal Grandparents or anyone else in their household. The children&#8217;s exposure to domestic abuse was through their parents. The parents have now separated. Moreover, neither parent is living in the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; household. There is no reliable evidence that either parent would return to the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; address. The father has his own accommodation and the mother lives with the Maternal Grandmother. The conflict that existed in the family home is no longer present and there is no real risk of it returning. The risk of the children being further exposed to parental conflict or domestic abuse is minimal.  The Paternal Grandparents were clear in their oral evidence that they recognise that domestic abuse is very harmful for the children. The Paternal Grandparents&#8217; description to the Guardian demonstrates that they have learned from all the work completed: &#8220;We discussed the impact the parents&#8217; lifestyles would have on the children. The grandparents advised the children will have suffered trauma that can be expressed as tantrums, not listening to instructions, hyperactivity, having physical and emotional outbursts.&#8221;  Furthermore, the compelling evidence from &#8216;N&#8217; was of these Paternal Grandparents having a clear understanding of the impact on her of her experiences as a child arising from the negative experiences in her mother&#8217;s care, including alcohol misuse and volatile behaviour. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; understanding of the harmful impact on the children of domestic abuse is good enough. </span></p>

The Independent Social Worker formed the professional opinion that the Paternal Grandparents were steadfast in prioritising their grandchildren. The evidence before the Court is of the Paternal Grandmother having called upon the assistance of the police when their son lived in the family home at a time when his behaviour was unacceptable. The father told the Court that he would not return to his parents&#8217; property uninvited. Since his release from prison, he has not done so. Further, since his release from prison, the Paternal Grandparents told the Court frankly that they have been to check upon their son four months ago by visiting but not entering his new accommodation. There is no evidence of the father returning to the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; home since his release from prison. The Paternal Grandfather was clear in his evidence that he would not allow his son to attend the family home: &#8220;It&#8217;s not possible. I don&#8217;t want to risk losing the children because of his visits.&#8221;  The Paternal Grandmother told the Court that if her son turned up unannounced, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, &#8220;I will be firm with him and if he doesn&#8217;t listen or leave, I call the authorities.&#8221; She told the Court that she would stand up to him and she is not frightened of him. The Paternal Grandmother was criticised for apologising for her son&#8217;s behaviour during contact on 25 January 2024. As Miss Choudhury noted, the contact supervisor was already challenging the father and the children were being quite boisterous.  The Paternal Grandmother was clear in her oral evidence that she did not wish to create more conflict with the children present in the contact centre. The Court accepts that it is difficult to see what more the Paternal Grandmother could have done in that context, that would not have created more conflict to which the children would have been exposed. This Court finds weight in the submission made by Miss Choudhury that there is a distinct lack of realism by professionals in respect of what was expected of the Paternal Grandmother during this contact session, this being an example of the Paternal Grandparents being expected to meet an unrealistic standard.  </span></p>

The risk can be mitigated further by both parents entering a written agreement for their contact with the children to be supervised by the Local Authority in the first instance. The Paternal Grandparents wish for the children&#8217;s contact with the parents to be professionally managed for the foreseeable future. In this regard the Paternal Grandparents acknowledge the risk. The Court accepts the submission from Miss Choudhury that this would be an essential ingredient of any support plan if the children are placed in their Paternal Grandparents&#8217; care. </span></p>

Protective injunctive Orders can be made, excluding both parents from any address they know the children will be living at. The Paternal Grandparents told the Court they would support the making of any such Orders. The Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s evidence to the Court was that she had called the police previously when the situation required it, when her son and the mother were fighting. Her evidence was supported by the Paternal Grandfather and by &#8216;N&#8217;, who described the police being called a number of times when her mother attended the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; home drunk. The Court is satisfied that a protective Order in the form of a Non-Molestation Order, a Prohibited Steps Order or an Exclusion Order under a Care Order could provide an effective method of protection for the children specific to this identified risk.</span></p>

In this Court&#8217;s judgement, having regard to each of the factors under s13(7) Children and Families Act 2014, such expert evidence is not necessary to resolve these proceedings justly. Such evidence is not demanded by the contested issues. The delay consequent upon an order permitting such expert evidence is entirely contrary to the welfare of the children who have already been the subject of extended proceedings. The Local Authority, Independent Social Worker and the Guardian are united in their opinion that it would be too early for any diagnosis to be made having regard to the children&#8217;s ages. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the right time for assessment of the needs of the children would be after they have started school, when they are in a settled home environment. That assessment is best undertaken outside the scope of this litigation, to assess the needs of the children as they develop. </span></p>

They have experience of a grandson with autism who is non-verbal. Their evidence to the Court was compelling when telling the Court that they have needed to adapt their approach towards their grandson and they are more understanding of his needs and how he views the world. Further, these Paternal Grandparents had experience of raising their own children into adulthood without Children's Services intervention, in addition to raising their niece who had experienced traumatic early years being cared for by a mother who misused alcohol. Their niece displayed challenging behaviour, on her own account, yet these Paternal Grandparents successfully nurtured her without professional support beyond the counselling services provided by &#8216;N&#8217;s school. The Paternal Grandparents in turn now have the clear, committed support of &#8216;N&#8217; as part of their close-knit family support network, along with their adult daughter, who bring with them all the skills they have acquired through experience in caring for children with autism and professional experience in working with vulnerable people.  The Independent Social Worker described both grandparents as, &#8220;adaptable, adept, and positively smart. They demonstrated the willingness and ability to learn during the process of assessment.&#8221;</span></p>

The social worker who formulated the plan for adoption did not consider it necessary to speak to either of them nor did the Guardian, who supports the care plan of adoption. It is difficult to understand why the Social Worker considered that, &#8220;assessment of that support would not change the Local Authority&#8217;s position,&#8221; unless this was evidence of the Local Authority having closed its mind to the option of the Paternal Grandparents caring for the children. Absent consideration of this skilled, close-knit support network, neither the Local Authority nor the Guardian, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, could properly reach the conclusion that nothing else will do for these children other than adoption. </span></p>

In March 2023, the Guardian opposed the Local Authority&#8217;s application for final Care Orders and Placement Orders. The Guardian has throughout the proceedings sought to ensure that the family and the children are treated fairly and that all options to keep the children within the family are fully explored. At Final Hearing, the Guardian described this case as &#8216;finely balanced.&#8217; This is a highly experienced Guardian whose professional opinion this Court respects. Regrettably, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, it is apparent that the Guardian did not place into the balance the support available to these Paternal Grandparents from wider family members or alternatively did not place sufficient weight to it. Moreover, the option of a Care Order at home was not considered at all. </span></p>

This Court endorses those submissions. The Paternal Grandparents are clearly devoted, wholly committed to and willing to provide both children with a secure, warm and loving family environment in which the children can develop and where their needs can be met. The Paternal Grandparents have been assessed as being capable of providing a good enough standard of care to the children. The Independent Social Worker considered the Paternal Grandparents to have a good level of insight into the risks associated by the parents, albeit the Children's Guardian considers their insight is still developing. There are fewer occupants in the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; home since the mother and father moved out, making it less crowded, increasing the prospect of the Paternal Grandparents being able to focus on their care of the children. </span></p>

That unanimity of support is a factor that bodes well for the success of the placement with the Paternal Grandparents. None of the family members will seek to disrupt the placement.

This would provide both children with the opportunity to have an irreplaceable awareness of their identity, dual heritage and culture, which could not be replicated in an adoptive placement. Placement of the children with their Paternal Grandparents within the birth family would mean they were placed in a family setting where they would be cherished and loved with the opportunity to thrive within a family unit, where they can be encouraged to achieve their full potential and where they could have their needs consistently prioritised. This would plainly be the best option for the children if it was achievable, whilst maintaining their safety. Such placement could be achieved without exposing the children to the type of significant harm they have experienced in the past through exposure to domestic abuse, substance misuse and alcohol abuse. </span></p>

With the right, targeted support, those risks can be mitigated. The children would inevitably require ongoing involvement by the Local Authority in some capacity for at least the first year, following transition into the care of their Paternal Grandparents. This would result in some interference with their family life. Such interference would be intended by way of support, providing a benefit to the children and is not likely to be restrictive or interventionist. Given their young ages, such ongoing professional involvement is not likely to impact negatively on them. Further, the Court recognises the risk of placement breakdown, which would result in further distress for the children.  Any further delay in securing finality for the children would lessen the chances of a suitable adoptive placement being found for both children.   </span></p>

Adoption could offer both children a permanency option in a legally secure, permanent placement, without the Local Authority being involved throughout their childhood but with ongoing access to adoption support services, training and psychological consultation, if ever required. The children would no longer be subjected to the risks associated with their parents' care. The children may have the opportunity to feel a sense of belonging within an adoptive family unit and to feel safe and secure, physically and emotionally with the ability to develop a positive sense of identity. Adoption could provide a secure environment in which to grow up, where the children could potentially develop secure attachments with carers.</span></p>

The Local Authority&#8217;s plan of annual direct contact is subject to the agreement of any potential adopter and has the risk of not being sustained. Whilst adoption could offer both children a sense of belonging, this must be balanced against the very real and substantial  negative impact of ceasing to be part of their birth-family and the loss of those unique, irreplaceable relationships, the erosion of their cultural heritage and the impact on the children&#8217;s identity. Having regard to &#8216;W&#8217;s age in particular, she will retain memories of her birth family which may impact on emotionally and increase the risk of an adoptive placement breakdown, the consequences of which could be catastrophic for both children. Further, the children will in time come to know that the adoption was without the consent of their mother, father and family members. This may leave both children with questions when they are older about their birth family and the reasons for their adoption. Life story work and contact with the birth family might ensure that the children can be supported by their adoptive parents(s) with their identity needs. However, such would be a poor substitution for placement within the birth family where their understanding of their identity and culture would not be negatively affected.</span></p>

The Court does not do so lightly.   Having had the unique opportunity to see and hear the evidence of each of the witnesses and consider the comprehensive volume of documentary evidence, in this Court&#8217;s judgement each of the professionals placed insufficient weight on the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; ability to protect the children from their father. Further each of the professionals placed insufficient weight on the ability and willingness of the wider family support network to provide real, hands-on practical and emotional support to the Paternal Grandparents in caring for the children. Having had the unique benefit of hearing the witnesses, the Court must have confidence, that with appropriate help, the Paternal Grandparents will be able to care for the children safely. It would appear that none of the professional witnesses had the benefit of assessing the highly determined, credible and local support that &#8216;N&#8217; and &#8216;PA&#8217; would be able to provide. Further, each of the professionals placed too much weight on the unassessed behavioural needs of the children. Further, none of the professionals adequately took into consideration the range of powers available to the Court to support placement of the children with the Paternal Grandparents by way of injunctive Orders against the father. When placing proper weight to each of those factors and the factors identified in this judgment, the balance is not, respectfully, a fine one. When undertaking the balancing exercise, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, each of the professionals placed the fulcrum incorrectly towards one end of that which is to be weighed, with adoption afforded undue weight. The balance did not reflect the weight necessarily afforded to a viable natural family placement with the Paternal Grandparents. For these reasons and those given by Counsel on behalf of the mother, father and Paternal Grandparents, the Court is compelled to depart from the recommendations of each of the professionals. </span></p>

Further, Waite LJ described an essential difficulty arising under a Care Order being, &#8216;... the fact that a Supervision Order rests primarily upon the consent of the parent affected by it. Any provisions incorporated into a Supervision Order, either by direction of the supervisor or by requirements directly stated by the Judge, are incapable of being enforced directly through any of the ordinary processes by which courts of law enforce obedience to their directions. The only sanction, when any infringement of the terms of a Supervision Order or of directions given under it, occurs is a return by the supervisor to Court. There the ultimate sanction will be the making of a Care Order under which the Local Authority will be given the necessary legal powers to enforce its will.&#8217; This is in contrast to the position under a Care Order, where, under s.33(3) Children Act 1989, the Local Authority not only has parental responsibility but may determine how others may discharge their parental responsibility.</span></p>

Further, the Court is mindful of the evidence that, at times, the behaviour of the children can be challenging. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, placement of the children with their Paternal Grandparents, whilst consistent with their best interests, would require ongoing professional support in addition to support from the wider family. Support will be necessary particularly in the early weeks and months, to support transition of the children from foster care to their Paternal Grandparents&#8217; care and provide professional support in respect of contact between the children and each parent. Further professional support would be beneficial in respect of providing Social Work visits to the family home, coordinating family support, providing ongoing training to the Paternal Grandparents to meet the developing needs of the children and to set out a written working together agreement of expectations, endorsed by each relevant family member. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, such support to underpin a Special Guardianship Order is best provided under a Supervision Order as a necessary measure to achieve the provision of support and services after the conclusion of proceedings. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, a Supervision Order is in the best interests of the children and is the proportionate response to the risks presented. A Supervision Order does not give the Local Authority parental responsibility. It is less restrictive than a Care Order and its essence is to advise, assist and befriend the children. It does not endure for the whole of the child's childhood, but lasts up to 12 months, with the power for the Court to extend it for a total of up to three years. The Supervision Order can and should be made to work. The Court invites the Local Authority to accept a Supervision Order for twelve months. The Court invites the Local Authority to prepare a Supervision Order support plan and a short transition plan, which is likely to include overnight stays at the Paternal Grandparents&#8217; home pending full transition. </span></p>
