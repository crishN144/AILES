	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The members of the family and the witnesses called by them have therefore presented the court and the local authority with a difficult situation. As will become apparent there has been a culture and practice in the family of making allegations both against outsiders and members of the family. Many of those allegations are now accepted to have been false. Others I find in this judgment to be false, in particular (a) many of the allegations made against S in July and August 2006, and (b) allegations made to, and about, schools. This and other findings in respect of the members of the family mean that arguments that allegations recorded close, or closest, to the happening of the relevant events (e.g. in police records) are likely to be more accurate, have little or no weight when considering the changing and developing allegations made by members of the family and that dramatic descriptions have to be treated with care.</p>

In fact threshold is conceded by both of Mr and Mrs B and the purpose of finding facts in addition to those that are conceded for this jurisdictional purpose goes primarily to disposal. It was in my view correctly effective common ground that findings over and above the combined effect of the concessions need to be made to enable properly informed decisions to be made as to disposal (as to this see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Threshold Criteria: Parental Concessions)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 728" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 728</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (Threshold Criteria: Parental Concessions)</span> (2001) 1 FCR 139).</p>

The concessions are that the threshold criteria is made out in respect of both the mother and the father. It is common and correct ground that the relevant date for the establishment of the threshold criteria is the date when protective arrangements were initiated, namely 30th October 2006, when interim care orders in respect of all three children were made.</p>

That teacher spoke to S on the telephone and his reporting of this conversation clearly did not help because he reported that R had been excluded, which was not the case. However both Mr and Mrs B must have been aware that S might have misreported the position; indeed it is part of the common ground between them that at this time S was being very difficult.</p>

A meeting was arranged the next day first with the Inclusions Director and then, when she became available, the Head Teacher. The meetings were attended by both Mr and Mrs B, S and R and another adult introduced as their tutor. At this meeting Mrs B behaved in an irrationally aggressive manner raising a whole range of issues. At times S took notes and the children at Mrs B's insistence remained. Mr B said little or nothing. The meeting ended with the Head Teacher saying that she was not prepared to let Mrs B come in to the school without a prior appointment to which Mrs B responded that the school was not allowed to contact her either and that if the school needed to it should contact her mother.</p>

For example on 30th November 2005 she left a telephone message saying: "I'm not very happy about what you said to my mum, I have not said nothing like that. Please get [the Head Teacher] to come back to me". On 1st December R spoke to the Head Teacher's PA on the telephone on more than one occasion saying that she still did not know when she would be coming in (because of an incident when her trousers were ripped and her Nan was ill), that the letter to her mum was full of lies and asking for an appointment. Mrs B could be heard in the background shouting things for R to say at times during these conversations including that she should take the PA's name and to tell her that she would be reporting the matter to the LEA.</p>

I base this on the evidence of a school counsellor (Mrs H) whose evidence I accept with the consequence that I find that Mrs B lied to me about this. Mrs H telephoned Mrs B's mother to tell her that S would be late home and Mrs B answered the telephone and launched into a tirade shouting that S should not get the award because people did not know what he was really like and called him the Head Teacher's "fucking little poodle", Mrs B went on to say that she wanted S to have a criminal record for a minor incident reported earlier that day that S had been seen in the playground with cigarettes and it had been assumed he was selling them. Mrs B was insistent that he should have a police record for that. To my mind that stance is irrational and plainly harmful to S. It will be remembered that it was the following year that Mrs B with the support of R and Mr B did make allegations to the police about S when she felt that her career was threatened by him.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">More generally, in my judgment both Mr and Mrs B used physical violence as an aspect of their parenting of the children, in that they would hit or slap them and in Mr B's case with S on occasion pin him against a wall by his shoulders sometimes also scuffling with him pushing or holding his throat. This occurred particularly when the children were misbehaving, or were challenging, and the relevant parent was angry. This chastisement cannot fairly be described as slapping or smacking as a means of discipline. In my view it is clearer that Mr B used to so chastise the children than Mrs B. But I am also satisfied that Mrs B did so as well even if she did so less frequently. If I am wrong and Mrs B did not hit or slap the children she knew that Mr B did so and at least implicitly encouraged this because she did nothing effective to stop it. There was no evidence that their regular arguments were about violence to the children by the other although there was some evidence of Mrs B shouting at Mr B to stop hitting S or R. </p>

But in my judgment her allegations as to her childhood and the abuse inflicted on her together with the demonstration of her self centred approach in the aftermath to 21 July 2006 and with the schools and the reason she gave for having two children (S and R) with an abusive father mean that this argument advanced by Mr B is far from being determinative. </p>

	    <p>I agree. So for example, reliance was placed on the point by both sides of the argument that S had given an account of the 2005 incident to Mrs EE on 4 August 2006 (in the aftermath to 21 July 2006) before R made her allegations of sexual abuse against Mr B on 30 October 2006. Also the point was correctly made that from 21 July 2006 to his ABE interview on 10 November 2006, when he gave an account of the 2002 incident, S had had no contact with R or his mother and little if any contact with his father. I accept these points and thus that not only does S's evidence confirm that those events took place, the force of parts of his ABE interview and his first description to Mrs EE of the 2005 incident is increased by those timing factors.</p>

From her interviews, and in particular her ABE interview on 10 November 2006 when the police officer attempted to get clear descriptions (a) it is unclear to me how many times she is alleging that there was penetrative sex or an attempt at penetrative sex (see for example the summary of the police officer near the end of her ABE interview on 10 November), and the interview contains an assertion that this occurred on only two occasions but also contains descriptions that indicate that she might be saying that it happened more often, and (b) it seems to me that her accounts, and thus for example her assertion that she thought Mr B put baby oil on his penis once before penetrative sex, are not clear or clearly linked to an occasion on which R says such sexual activity took place. But I accept that such matters were not gone into in any detail in her evidence other than in connection with the 2005 incident when S came into her room. And in respect of that incident the evidence focused on what she and Mr B were wearing and where they were in the room and not what she saw, felt and experienced during the alleged penetrative sex (or attempt at penetrative sex) </p>

I therefore accept that this can found a distinction from other cases of grooming. The riposte made that the incident with S scared Mr B off has some force but does not explain why he would have renewed sexual advances in July 2006. Jealousy of the relationship with Mr S junior, the effects of drink or an inability to help himself were offered as possible explanations. They all have elements of speculation. However, and in any event, in my view it is difficult and dangerous to build a conclusion on perceived norms of grooming by reference to the cessation of abuse or the re-introduction of sexual advances in this case. </p>

The description of R on occasions being a drama queen and mischief making (a description used for example in the record of a conversation between the police officer who visited about the report from N's school and Mrs B on 6 July 2006, in the context of the different ways in which Mr B was said to have treated S and R) also supports this argument.</p>

Although R denies that and I have accepted that her initial assertion, and thus her overall account, was not expressly prompted by Mrs B, it is common ground that R withdrew that account and it follows that R was therefore then taking the position that it was a false account described in dramatic terms.</p>

This does not accurately date the May 2005 incident but there is evidence of only one such incident and it must in my view be a reference to it. The point was not pursued at that stage, even when Mr B was released and Mrs B made an allegation of fraud against him. In her statement Mrs K says that she heard R call Mr B a paedophile during a family row and because she called the police on the occasion of this family row, and said that Mr B then moved out, it was thought that this related to the incident on 7 April 2007. But, whether S suggested that Mrs B should do this as she alleges, or she did so off her own bat, this report to the policeman shows that the incident was something that Mrs B then raised and therefore had in mind when making complaints against Mr B, albeit in the context of Mr B allegedly physically assaulting R on 7 April 2006. At the time of the May 2005 incident it was not viewed as an allegation or indication of impending physical assault by use of a belt or otherwise but as one of sexually inappropriate behaviour. (I add that, although there are allegations about the use of a belt at no time during the hearing was the May 2005 incident relied on in this context. Indeed on some accounts Mr B was said to be in his boxers and not in trousers with his belt undone),</p>

However he believes that his mother would use such information to blackmail Mr B." I accept that these assertions would run counter to Mr B's acceptance that such threats were not made until after April 2006 if they relate to an earlier period. This point (i.e. the timing of threats relating to allegations of sexual abuse) was not pursued with S. With this timing qualification these references by S in an interview that was not directed to allegations of sexual abuse against Mr B support Mr B's evidence that the mother made such threats that she would accuse him of sexually abusing R.</p>

Her doing so would however be consistent with the allegation culture in the family if it was based solely in the 2002 and 2005 incidents and the common theme of the family evidence that it had been accepted that Mr B had not and was not sexually abusing R, just as it had been so accepted that N had not been sexually abused by S.

This also provides strong support for the point, and I so find, that in addition to the actual assault, she also discussed the allegations R made against S, with R. After such discussions, as I have explained, R to achieve a desired end, supported her mother by making false allegations against S. In my view the fact that R made such false allegations then based on a well known family incident relating to S, similar to (although less serious than the 2002 and 2005 confrontations) is a strong pointer in favour of the conclusion that R could have made the general allegations she did on 30 October 2006 because of such confrontations rather than the existence of sexual abuse.</p>

In my judgment the fact that she invited the foster parents to check that the computer had been cleared was a deliberate part of her plan and was made at least in the hope, if not the expectation, that they would not do so. If she had truly been worried about this it is very difficult to follow why what was left on the computer was something that was so relevant and she did not explain what other records (if any) relating to the allegations had been deleted. This record must have been put on recently and therefore must have been at least one of, if not the only, thing that would prompt the thought that the computer needed to be cleared of information relating the proceedings and disputes.</p>

Those reasons are also reflected in S's interview with Mrs EE on 4 August 2006 because he is recorded as saying in response to a question whether R would speak to Mrs EE about the allegations of sexual harassment or abuse that he felt that she would say it never happened because she does not want to lose the family network.</p>

Again I accept that that would not have been easy. But to join in the active attack of S and in doing so to "up the allegation against him by misreporting what it is common ground N said at the time - "near her minny " upped to "in her minny" - does not fit with R actively protecting N from sexual abuse at the hands of Mr B (or indeed S). Indeed if, as she asserts, at this time R was actively concerned to protect N from Mr B and was keeping an eye on N, her joinder of the attack on S to assist in protecting her mother is very troubling in that it shows an ability to hide active concerns about N's welfare whilst making false accusations against her brother.</p>

On that basis I find that this part of R's evidence (albeit a small one) was untrue and was introduced to support the version given by Mr S junior.

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Mr S junior said that he had promised R that he would not tell anyone because she wanted it kept secret and that is why he did not do so until he gave his statement to the police on 26 November 2006 (it was, he said, delayed in part because the relevant police officer was away). This reason for his continued silence after 30 October 2006 when R made her allegation and after 1 November 2006 when she spoke to the police makes no logical sense. It is clear that he knew that R had made the allegation and that therefore it was no longer a secret. Rather it had become a vital part of the allegation and counter allegation in which the family were embroiled and about which Mrs B was attending court hearings. It was common ground between him and Mrs B that he had a brief conversation with Mrs B about him going to the police and she told him to check his dates. (I comment that if he did, it became common ground between all (perhaps apart from R) that the date he gave for the incident at Mr B senior's house and the call received in the taxi was wrong). In my judgment this limited conversation with Mrs B runs counter to the general evidence as to her character and involvement in making allegations. In my judgment after 30 October 2006 Mrs B did discuss at length the allegations R was making, and her own allegations against Mr B, at the home of the two Mr Ss, indeed this would be a natural thing for her to do. </p>

In my judgment, this mystery together with the inducement to Mr S junior to support allegations against Mr B because he would have known that Mr B would be, or was, making allegations that his relationship with R was inappropriate render Mr S junior's statement as to what R told him before 30 October 2006 unreliable as corroboration.</p>

Mr S junior heard some of the argument over the telephone because he had rung R and she had left the telephone connection open. R first comments on what Mrs K remembers overhearing when she knows about this and the interpretation of that flows from the recollection of Mrs K rather than anyone else.

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I remind myself of the warning that in this case the point that the first explanation given carries weight does not apply.

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">But in my view, as already indicated, the point that S mentioned this incident when giving a history to Mrs EE on 4 August 2006 and thus before R made her "disclosure" on 30 October 2006 is significant and demonstrates that the 2005 incident and confrontation occurred and was a significant event in the history of the family. I have mentioned in Schedule G that the indications in that note that there was more than one occasion that S walked in on R and Mr B cannot be relied on. Not least because R and S confirmed that there was only one such incident.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">As I have mentioned there are a number of inconsistencies in R's account on 1 November 2006 and her later accounts. There are also a number of inconsistencies in the accounts of Mr B, S and R as to what Mr B was wearing and where they were in the room and what they were both doing when R came in.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Notwithstanding the points made later as to Mr B's explanation and reaction I do not accept, as R alleges, that this was an occasion on which Mr B had penetrative sex and that as she said in her ABE interview and oral evidence Mr B heard S coming and jumped off her, rather than in her 1 November 2006 account, when she said S walked in to see Mr B with his boxers down on top of her. In my judgment both accounts lack credibility in the overall context of the incident. In my view this part of R's 1 November account is untrue as it does not fit with any of the other accounts and R changed it. The later account of Mr B hearing S and jumping off her does not fit easily with S's account and R's account of her reading a book (which Mr B accepts in his statement of 13 June 2007) and is also not easy to fit with her account of penetrative sex. I accept that some support for this account can be derived from the mention by S on 4 August 2006 that when he went in they were moving quickly. But this part of the account is linked to him going into his parent's bedroom and thus the part of the note that would suggest that there was more than one incident when he walked in on R and Mr B therefore may be inaccurate. But reading it as a description the 2005 incident in conjunction with where he says R was (i.e. on the floor not the bed) I have concluded that this reference does not provide convincing support for R's account that Mr B had just jumped off her and they had been having penetrative sex, or this was being attempted on the bed.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">However Mr B's explanations as to why he was in R's room with his belt undone are very unconvincing of themselves (i.e. tidying up and that he occasionally left his belt undone and he was looking for his black shorts) and they become even more unconvincing when coupled with his accepted reaction ("it isn't what it looks like") and his physical assault on S that was considerably underplayed by Mr B in his police statements, as was the whole incident which was shortly followed by S going to live with his maternal grandmother.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment this explanation and reaction provide strong support for a conclusion that something inappropriate of a sexual nature (as opposed to for example chastisement with Mr B's belt) occurred, or was about to occur, and that such inappropriate conduct was not an isolated or "one off" incident. The second part of this possible conclusion is supported by the point that S was suspicious of R and Mr B and the intensity of Mr B's reaction.</p>

My discussion of them in this judgment should be read with the schedule I have prepared relating to R's allegations of sexual abuse by Mr B (Schedule G), this contains a number of citations, shows the progression of Mr B's disclosures and evidence and to a large extent is based on the final written submissions put in on behalf of the mother, whose counsel was the first to argue these points in closing submissions. This Schedule and those arguments were adopted by R and on a number of points by the local authority.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Like R, Mr B joined in the campaign against S initiated by Mrs B following her assault on S on 21 July 2006. Mr B did not make a statement to the police relating to the allegation that S had sexually abused N but his is the first recorded assertion that N had said that S had put his willy in (as opposed to near) her minny, he also joined with Mrs B (and Mr S senior, who must have based his support on what he had been told primarily by Mrs B) in confirming that S was to blame for the break up of their marriage and he refused to consent to S having a medical. In short Mr B was effectively a full member of the attack on S prompted by Mrs B's fear that if she was prosecuted this would ruin or damage her teaching career.</p>

Again a reasonable alternative explanation to those advanced by him and the problems of disclosure for a man who has been a victim as well as an inflictor of physical abuse is that he wanted to create a false impression and to hide or avoid blame for the abuse he had perpetrated.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I accept and find that the citations and descriptions of Mr B's disclosures to the police and social services and his evidence in these proceedings provide sound bases for the argument that Mr B was trying to get his retaliation in first and to hide his own abuse of the children, and in particular of R. For example they demonstrate avoidance and playing down of the 2002 and 2005 incidents, even though on 23 October 2006 Mr B had asserted to the police that he was afraid that Mrs B had threatened him with arrest for interfering with R. </p>

But as is regularly the case if this is what he was doing it is arguably surprising that he did not mention these incidents because they were well known in the family and if he was seeking to retaliate first he would have been likely to mention, and therefore confess and avoid them.</p>

As I have said in my judgment over his visit to the home on 8 / 9 July 2006 Mr B searched for the material he found in the form of MSN messages and the letter. But he then failed to address in a constructive and appropriate way, with for example Mr S junior or Mrs B, the concerns that he says he had, and could justifiably have had, that R's relationship with Mr S junior had inappropriate sexual elements. Rather he argued with R about it.</p>

The stark conflict of fact between them then has to be considered in the context of the numerous arguments as to why one is more likely than the other on this aspect of the case to be giving a truthful account and an analysis of those arguments shows that the actions, statements and approach of R and Mr B relied on by one side of the argument do not clearly or determinatively establish that argument, that many of them can be said to lead to both conclusions and that their consideration in many instances does not result in a comparison of like with like. </p>

In that sense the unattributed portion, or the unpenetrated fog, results in a draw.

So, in the context of care proceedings (and thus the interference in the lives of a family by a public authority pursuant to a care or supervision order) when, on the approach of the majority in<span style="font-style:italic"> Re H &amp; R</span>, a risk of serious future harm (a likelihood of serious future harm) can only be based on establishing that it is more likely than not that such harm has been inflicted by a carer in the past, the seriousness of the allegation is a factor against the making of the relevant finding to give jurisdiction to take protective measures against the risk of such alleged harm being inflicted again. Whereas, and in contrast, it seems to me that generally in terms of risk management (and indeed in an application of the tests under the Children Act relating to interim orders) the seriousness of the consequences of alleged harm recurring is a factor in favour of taking protective measures and preventative measures are taken and required without proof to the civil standard of the alleged inflicted harm. </p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">"The starting point here is that courts act on evidence. They reach their decision on the basis of the evidence before them. When considering whether an applicant for a care order has shown that the child is suffering harm or is likely to do so, the court will have regard to the undisputed evidence. The judge will attach to that evidence such weight or importance as he considers appropriate. Likewise with regard to disputed evidence which the judge accepts as reliable. None of that is controversial. But the rejection of a disputed allegation as not proven on the balance of probability leaves scope for the possibility that the non-proven allegation may be true after all. There remains room for the judge to have doubts and suspicions on that score. This is the area of controversy.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">" The next pointer is that the second threshold condition in para (a) is cheek by jowl with the first. Take a case where a care order is sought in respect of a child on the ground that for some time his parents had been maltreating him. Having heard the evidence, the court finds the allegation is not proved. No maltreatment has been established. The evidence is rejected as insufficient. That being so, the first condition is not made out, because there is no factual basis upon which the court could conclude that the child is suffering significant harm attributable to the care being given to him. Suspicion that there may have been maltreatment clearly will not do. It would be odd if, in respect of the selfsame non-proven allegation, the selfsame insufficient evidence could nonetheless be regarded as a sufficient factual basis for satisfying the court there is a real possibility of harm to the child in the future.</p>

	  <paragraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">The third point is that if indeed this were the position, this would effectively reverse the burden of proof in an important respect. It would mean that once apparently credible evidence of misconduct has been given, those against whom the allegations are made must disprove them. Otherwise it would be open to a court to hold that, although the misconduct has not been proved, it has been disproved and there is a real possibility that the misconduct did occur. Accordingly, there is a real possibility that the child will suffer in the future and, hence, the threshold criteria are met. I do not believe Parliament intended that section 31(2) should work in this way."</p>

This is because they founded the argument that even though neither A or B could be excluded as perpetrators, because there was a real possibility that he or she was the perpetrator, as neither had been found on the balance of probabilities to be the person who inflicted the established harm they both had to be treated as innocent when decisions were made as to the future care and placement of the relevant child, and thus on risk management issues.

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">"The context is the "uncertain perpetrator" type of case, where a child suffers physical harm at the hands of his parents, but the court is unable to identify which parent was the perpetrator or, indeed, whether both were perpetrators. The threshold criteria are met. The court so decides at a preliminary "fact finding" hearing, and the case then proceeds to the "welfare" stage and a "disposal" hearing. In one of the appeals before your Lordships' House, Thorpe LJ expressed himself to the effect that at the disposal hearing in such a case the judge cannot disregard the risk the mother presents as a primary carer for the child in question. In the other appeal, Ward LJ said the case should proceed on the basis that the child was not harmed by the mother and that there is no risk of the child suffering physical harm from her. "</p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[12] The same broad principle is applicable when courts or tribunals peer into the future and assess the likelihood that a particular event will occur. This is an inherently imprecise exercise, so far as human conduct is concerned. In theory, it is a different exercise from deciding whether somebody did or did not do something in the past. Whether or not an alleged event occurred in the past raises a question of proof. In truth, the event either happened or not. That is not so with a future forecast. The future has not happened, and future human conduct is never certain. But in practice, the past is often as uncertain as the future. The judge cannot know for certain what happened and can only assess the degree of likelihood that something happened. The same is true of the future. The decision maker has to assess the degree of likelihood that an inherently uncertain event will occur. The degree of likelihood - beyond reasonable doubt, more probable than not, real possibility and so on - required in any particular legal contexts raises a question of legal policy.</p>

As to the latter, the matters a decision-maker may take into account, are normally bounded only by the need for them to be relevant, that is, they must be such that, to greater or lesser extent, they will assist the decision-maker in reaching a rational conclusion. The context may, indeed, require that this principle should apply in its full width: see, in the context of asylum cases and the difficulties of proof, which beset asylum seekers, <span style="font-style:italic">Karanakaran v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 3 All ER 449" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 3 All ER 449</ref>, especially Brooke LJ at 458-470 and Sedley LJ at 477-479. The legal context may permit, or require, the decision maker to take into account any real possibility that a past event occurred, or even a mere possibility. Rationality does not require that only past events established on a balance of probabilities can be taken into account. Or the context may require otherwise. The range of matters, the decision maker may take into account when carrying out this exercise depends upon the context. This, regain is a question of legal policy, not logic. "</p>

By a majority the House held that, for the purpose of satisfying this threshold level of risk in cases (such as alleged sexual abuse) in which there is a dispute over whether the child has indeed suffered past harm, the court may have regard only to harm proved to the requisite standard to have happened. Otherwise the purpose for which the threshold criteria were prescribed by Parliament could be defeated in a case where the only evidence that the child was likely to suffer harm in the future was an unproved allegation that he had suffered harm in the past. It would be extraordinary if, in respect of the selfsame non proven allegations, the selfsame insufficient evidence could nonetheless be regarded as a sufficient factual basis for satisfying the court there is a real possibility of harm in the future: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re H(Minors)(Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)</span> at 591 and 100 respectively.</p>

This suggests that, given the purpose of the threshold criteria, both limbs of the "significant harm" condition called for proof of fact. Like the inference that the child is already suffering harm, the inference that the child is likely to suffer significant harm, must be founded on one or more proved facts, as distinct from unproved allegations. Therein lies the protection Parliament intends the threshold criteria shall provide against arbitrary intervention by public authorities. This is the principal rationale for what might otherwise seem an unduly rigid approach.</p>

The particular reason why the threshold conditions require proof of facts is not germane in every instance, where a decision has to be made regarding the existence or extent of future harm to a child. In the case of each statutory provision it is necessary to consider the language and purpose of the provision to see whether, for reasons of legal policy, any limitation should be placed on the matters a decision maker may take into account when assessing the risk in question. </p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">The welfare stage: 'uncertain perpetrator' cases <br/>[26] The first area concerns cases of the type involved in the present appeals, where the judge finds a child has suffered significant physical harm at the hands of his parents but is unable to say which. I stress one feature of this type of case. These are cases where it has been proved, to the requisite standard of proof, that the child is suffering significant harm or is likely to do so.</p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[27] Here, as a matter of legal policy, the position seems to me straightforward. Quite simply, it would be grotesque if such a case had to proceed at the welfare stage on the footing that, because neither parent, considered individually, has been proved to be the perpetrator, therefore the child is not at risk from either of them. This would be grotesque because it would mean the court would proceed on the footing that neither parent represents a risk even though one or other of them was the perpetrator of the harm in question.

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[28] That would be a self-defeating interpretation of the legislation. It would mean that, in 'uncertain perpetrator' cases, the court decides that the threshold criteria are satisfied but then lacks the ability to proceed in a sensible way in the best interests of the child. The preferable interpretation of the legislation is that in such cases the court is able to proceed at the welfare stage on the footing that each of the possible perpetrators is, indeed, just that: a possible perpetrator (my emphasis). As Hale LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">re G (Care proceedings: split trials)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 872" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 872</ref>, 882:</p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[29] In such cases the judge at the preliminary hearing, while unable to identify the perpetrator, may decide that one or other of the parents, perhaps both, was guilty of failure to protect. It was submitted that herein lies a better solution to the problem. The court should assess future risk on the basis of this proved shortcoming. This would be a better way to proceed because it would avoid attaching to each parent the stigma of possible perpetrator.</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[30] I do not believe this would be a satisfactory alternative. Inability to identify the perpetrator is not always accompanied by a finding of failure to protect. The judge may find that the child was injured in only one incident, by one or other of the parents, in a momentary loss of self-control. Further, when assessing future risk, failure to protect is one matter, perpetration is another. A finding of failure to protect is not a reason for leaving out of account at the welfare stage the undoubted fact that one or other of the parents inflicted the physical harm on the child. This may be important in cases where circumstances have changed since the injuries were inflicted and the parents are no longer living together.</p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[31] In 'uncertain perpetrator' cases the correct approach must be that the judge conducting the disposal hearing will have regard, to whatever extent is appropriate, to the facts found by the judge at the preliminary hearing. Nowadays the same judge usually conducts both hearings, but this is not always so. When the facts found at the preliminary hearing leave open the possibility that a parent or other carer was a perpetrator of proved harm, it would not be right for that conclusion to be excluded from consideration at the disposal hearing as one of the matters to be taken into account. The importance to be attached to that possibility, as to every feature of the case, necessarily depends on the circumstances. But to exclude that possibility altogether from the matters the judge may consider would risk distorting the court's assessment of where, having regard to all the circumstances, the best interests of the child lie.</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[32] Similarly, and for the same reason, the judge at the disposal hearing will take into account any views expressed by the judge at the preliminary hearing on the likelihood that one carer was or was not the perpetrator, or a perpetrator, of the inflicted injuries. Depending on the circumstances, these views may be of considerable value in deciding the outcome of the application: for instance, whether the child should be rehabilitated with his mother.</p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[33] From what I have said above it follows that I respectfully disagree with the approach adopted by Ward LJ in the case of child L and child C. Judge Downey concluded, expressly, that the evidence was not sufficient to exclude the mother and positively identify the father as the perpetrator of the injuries other than the fractured skull. In the light of this factual conclusion it would be quite wrong for the case to proceed on the false basis that the mother had been found not to be the perpetrator. The approach adopted in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H</span>, followed by Ward LJ in the case of child L and child C, is not apt at the welfare stage in 'uncertain perpetrator' cases.</p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[34] I wholly understand that parents are apprehensive that, if each of them is labelled a possible perpetrator, social workers and others may all too readily rule out the prospect of rehabilitation with either of them because the child would be 'at risk' with either of them. As already noted, failure to protect is one thing, perpetration is another. A parent fears that, once the possibility that he or she was a perpetrator is brought into the scales, cautious social workers will let that factor outweigh all others.</p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[35] I understand this concern. Whether it is well founded, generally or in particular cases, is an altogether different matter. Whether well founded or not, the way ahead cannot be for cases to proceed on an artificial footing. Rather, in cases of split hearings judges must be astute to express such views as they can at the preliminary hearing to assist social workers and psychiatrists in making their assessments and preparing the draft care plan. For their part social workers, I do not doubt, will have well in mind the need to consider all the circumstances when assessing the risk posed by a carer who is, but who is no more than, a possible perpetrator. To this end transcripts of judgments given at the preliminary hearing should always be made readily available when required, so that reliance does not have to be placed on summaries or even bare statements of conclusions: see Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P in <span style="font-style:italic">re G (Care proceedings: split trials)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 872" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 872</ref>, 876.</p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[36] I must mention a further point. The burden of proof on care order applications rests on the local authority. But, it was submitted, to proceed as mentioned above would improperly reverse the burden of proof. The parent would have the onus of exculpating himself when the local authority failed to prove he was a perpetrator but the possibility that he was a perpetrator was left open. I am unable to accept this submission. It cannot stand with the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire County Council v B</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 2 AC 147" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 2 AC 147</ref>. As already noted, the effect of this decision was that a care order may be made in this type of case even though the local authority failed to prove, to the requisite standard of proof, which parent was the perpetrator of the physical harm. The approach described above does no more than give effect to this decision at the welfare stage in the only sensible way which is possible.

Nevertheless I should comment briefly so that the observations made above are seen in context. This second area relates to the type of case where the threshold criteria are satisfied on one ground, such as neglect or failure to protect, but not on another ground, such as physical harm.

On the other hand there is the general principle that at the welfare stage the court has regard to all the circumstances. On balance, I consider that to have regard at the welfare stage to allegations of harm rejected at the threshold stage would have the effect of depriving the child and the family of the protection intended to be afforded by the threshold criteria. Accordingly, at the welfare stage in this type of case the court should proceed on the footing that the unproven allegations are no more than that. </p>

On an application for a care order the judge found there was a real possibility that sexual abuse had occurred but the evidence was not sufficient to prove the allegations to the requisite standard. The threshold criteria were met on another ground. The children had suffered emotional harm at the hands of the mother and her partner and were likely to suffer significant harm in the future. The judge made an interim care order and adjourned the case to consider whether to return the children to the mother and her partner. The local authority appealed against the judge's refusal to make a care order. One ground of appeal was that the judge had erred by not taking the allegations of sexual abuse into account at the welfare stage.</p>

The local authority made, but later abandoned, allegations of sexual abuse within the family. The threshold criteria were satisfied on a different ground, namely, neglect and emotional harm. Charles J held that as matters stood the local authority and the court should assess risk on the basis that the allegations of sexual abuse were just that and nothing more. Part of the background, and relevant as such, was that the allegations had been made. Also part of the background, and likewise relevant, was the fact that the allegations had not been proved and, as matters stood, would not be proved. It would be wrong for the local authority to deal with the family on the basis that it believed the children had been sexually abused. That overall approach, the judge noted, accorded with the current reality.</p>

However in an uncertain perpetrator case as recognised in the <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire</span> case the result now reached is that a parent who may be wholly innocent will face the possibility of losing his or her child. That is the same horrific prospect that is faced by a parent who is wrongly accused of sexually abusing, killing or otherwise inflicting harm on a child. If in the former case the court making the disposal or welfare decision can examine the degree of likelihood that a person was the perpetrator of proved inflicted harm because there is a real possibility that he or she did inflict the harm, the question arises whether, having regard to that development, it should be able to do the same when the real possibility relates to the infliction of the harm rather than who inflicted it. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">One view is that on an application of the general rule referred to in paragraph 10 of his speech a court proceeding "on the footing that the unproved allegations are no more than that" would, applying that rule, have to treat them on the footing that the event alleged (e.g. sexual abuse by X) had not taken place. Lord Nicholls says that the position is not materially different when unproved allegations of harm are abandoned. That approach to the application of the general rule in paragraph 10, and that rule itself, is it seems to me based on an adversarial approach which identifies the person with the onus of proof. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re O &amp; N</span> that approach is confirmed at the jurisdictional or threshold stage of care proceedings.</p>

My view and description of the reality in that case was not that the general rule relating to unproved allegations meant that the local authority and the court should proceed on the basis that the sexual abuse (the unproved allegations) had not occurred. Rather that reality was that allegations had been made and denied (see 768D, 768F and 769 A/D). </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In a case where there is potentially more than one perpetrator a finding exonerating a person of inflicting harm would often have two stages. The first would identify the pool of possible perpetrators and the second would involve the issue whether the actual perpetrator can be identified from the pool. At the first stage the test to be applied is the "real possibility test", at the second the test is the "more likely than not test". As I have indicated (see paragraph 14 of this Schedule), if it can be said that it is not a real possibility that A inflicted harm on B that conclusion would clearly found one that it is more likely than not that A did not do so. So, at the first stage, a finding excluding a person from the pool, on the basis that there is no real possibility that he or she inflicted the relevant harm is also a finding that exonerates that person. Following the identification of the pool the court goes on to see whether a finding can be made that it is more likely than not that a person (or persons) within the pool did not inflict the relevant harm. If it can, any such person is excluded from the pool and exonerated. When the pool is reduced to two, or always comprised only two, a finding that it is more likely than not that one of them inflicted the relevant harm is the mirror image of a finding that it is more likely than not that the other did not. So one is found to be the perpetrator and one is exonerated, applying the "more likely than not test".</p>

Such a conclusion would exonerate the person accused of inflicting the harm because the finding that the harm was not inflicted would be based on (or alternatively he or she would have satisfied a) higher test than the "more likely than not test". When, as in this case, such a finding cannot be made and both the allegation and the denial are therefore real possibilities a finding that the harm was inflicted or, its mirror image that it was not and therefore the person accused is exonerated, is based on the more likely than not test. </p>

To reach a conclusion on a stark choice between two real possibilities that one of them is more likely than not to be correct, the court has to be able (on the evidential approach set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H and R</span>) to penetrate with sufficient clarity, the competing factors and the relevant uncertainties to reach that "more likely than not" finding. Sometimes it will be able to do this and therefore reach a conclusion based on that test that a person inflicted harm, or that the person alleged to have inflicted harm did not do so, and therefore should be exonerated. Sometimes, as is the position in this case in respect of the allegations of sexual abuse made by R against Mr B, it will not.</p>
