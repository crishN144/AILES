	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my fourth judgment in these proceedings. SF is a Scottish woman in her 40s who has moderate intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, associated periods of severe anxiety, and a diagnosis of difficult to treat schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type).  In an earlier judgment in this case, handed down on 30 June 2023, <span style="font-style:italic">Aberdeenshire Council v SF &amp; Ors </span>[2023] EWCOP 28, I held that SF was habitually resident in Scotland, notwithstanding that she had been living in England and Wales for a number of years, first as a patient detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983 and then, from 2022, in a supported living placement in the community. At the time of that judgment, because of her condition and the circumstances of her care,  SF was not integrated in a social or family environment in England. In a second judgment, <span style="font-style:italic">Aberdeenshire Council v SF (No. 2)</span> [2024] EWCOP 10, I held that a Scottish Guardianship Order made on 16 June 2021 (the SGO) which authorised SF&#8217;s mother, the Second Respondent, EF, to consent to the deprivation of SF&#8217;s liberty, should not be recognised and enforced in this jurisdiction. In a third, ex tempore judgment given on 27 June 2024, which I have agreed should be published, I made a finding that SF had then become habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales. She had made astonishing progress under the care of Orbis at her current community placement and had become integrated into a social environment in England. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No party disputes that SF lacks capacity to make decisions for herself about where she should live and her care. I agree, and shall now make final declarations to that effect. There is ample evidence that the presumption of capacity is displaced in SF&#8217;s case and, notwithstanding the progress she has made, there is no prospect of her regaining capacity in the foreseeable future. After years of searching for suitable accommodation and care in Scotland there is now available to SF a choice of residence and carers but because she cannot make the decision for herself, the Court is required to make the decision on her behalf in her best interests.</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_4">
	    <num>4.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two options: SF can either remain in her current placement, &#8220;X&#8221;, in the Northeast of England, or she can be moved to a new placement, &#8220;Y&#8221;,  nearer to her family in the Northeast of Scotland. She has been at X for over two years now. After an initially difficult period of settling in at X, she has made considerable progress. All agree that she has benefitted hugely from the care at that placement, provided by Orbis. However, her mother, aged 74 and with health problems, finds it increasingly difficult to make the long journey from her home in Northeast Scotland to visit SF at X and SF is also located far from her brother and the rest of her family and old friends who live in the same area as her mother. If she remains at X, SF will be likely to continue to receive excellent care and to live a life of activity far beyond what was imaginable just two years ago but contact with her family would be likely to diminish. If she were to move to Y, she would be much closer to her mother, brother and the rest of the family, but there would have to be a carefully managed transition period and it cannot be known how she will settle in and progress at Y. All accept that SF would struggle with the change. The offer at Y is of accommodation, provision of care, and the availability of activities similar to those at X, but SF would be in the hands of a new and unfamiliar team in new accommodation. The connections she has made at X would be lost and she would have to start over again. There would be a risk that she would not respond well to the new carers and environment. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SF has never had capacity to make decisions for herself about where she should live. She was born and grew up in Scotland and lived there until January 2016 when she was transferred to a hospital in England because no suitable placement could be found in Scotland. At that stage, SF&#8217;s contact with her family was not generally discussed with her but at times she did not wish to see them. Her parents and brother remained in Scotland and hoped that she would eventually return.  SF maintained telephone contact with them and saw them regularly whilst in hospital. After almost two years, in December 2017, SF was ready for discharge from hospital. Aberdeenshire identified a  possible placement for her in November 2018 but that was abandoned in June 2019. Later options did not come to fruition. In May 2021 an application was made to renew SF&#8217;s Scottish Guardianship Order.</p>

Their evidence was powerful. EF is in her mid-70&#8217;s and has suffered declining health. She is now a widow. She does not drive. It takes her a full day to travel to see SF in X and she has to stay over for three nights nearby. She told the Court that she could not do this any longer as it was just too tiring for her. The journey to the proposed Scottish placement would be about one hour on the bus from her own home. EF has told Aberdeenshire Council that she would visit SF twice a week if she moved to live at Y. GF says he would be able to visit weekly. GF pleaded with the Court not to let his mother effectively suffer the loss of her daughter having already lost her husband. They both told me that there were other family members and old friends who would be able to see SF if she moved to Scotland who can currently only have video or telephone contact with her. </p>

Y has been purchased by Aberdeenshire but would need some adaptations before it could be occupied by SF. These adaptations would take some months to complete. There are other potential residents and Y cannot indefinitely be left open for SF to use. At X, SF has access to the community and she now takes part in many activities: visiting the cinema, theatre, and local community centre, going bowling, swimming, dancing, and shopping,  and attending events organised by her carers. Recently, having being encouraged to save up money for the purpose, SF made a day visit to Scarborough. I have seen a lovely photograph of SF enjoying her day out at the seaside. She plans to save for a future trip to the theatre in a nearby city. Similar activities might well be available were SF to move to Y but the transition to Y would take several months: not only are there physical adaptations to be made to the property, such as the creation of a wet room, but the recruitment and training of staff would be required and SF would have to be introduced to the placement and new staff. Staff for Y are yet to be recruited but once recruited they would have to travel to see SF and X and staff from X would probably have to travel to Y. Her condition means that SF finds change very difficult and so the process of change would have to be staged and would require careful management.</p>

SF requires two to one support and until recently received 343 hours care for each week with a third person working during the day shift. A small reduction in the number of hours of care has been discussed and recently implemented. The doors at X may be locked and physical restraint is still required to keep SF safe, but the picture has changed dramatically over the last 12 months or so. On her initial move to X, and even at the time of my first judgment in June 2023, the use of restraint and seclusion was frequent.  By contrast, the use of restraint is now much reduced. Episodes of restraint now average once a week and the restraint used is mainly handholds or 1:1 or 2:1 guiding SF back to her pod. In my June 2023 judgment I recorded that SF had little engagement in the community. Now, she is involved in many activities, she &#8220;takes centre stage&#8221; and is well known in her local supermarket and community centre. She messages with a friend who attends the disco with her. She has made a presentation to a conference of about 100 people and recently attended an awards ceremony where she was nominated for and won an award. </p>

I explained to SF that I knew what her mum and GF wanted but that it was my job to find out what she wanted. I explained that it is okay to disagree with someone and not have the same view. SF said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll miss it here, and Northumberland but I want to be in Scotland&#8221;. I told SF that I was surprised with what she had said because she had always told me that she wanted to live in England and that being back home had sad memories.

I told SF that I didn&#8217;t know and that I thought they were going to find some carers when the judge had made his decision about whether she should stay in England or go back to Scotland.

Although unclear how long this would take, history shows this was at least 18 months building these relationships. In that time SF can communicate distress through behaviour that can be very challenging which could be very distressing both for SF and staff supporting with these behaviours.  Historically this has led to high numbers of restraints which can have psychological impact on SF and on the caring relationships between staff and SF. </p>

This will involve long trips to and from Y for both SF and carers. The logistics of the transition and impact on physical and mental health need to be considered. The transition from hospital to current placement was for approximately 8 months.  This consisted of staff from ORBIS working directly into the hospital for 6 months, then hospital staff working in the current property for 2 months when transitioned.  </p>

SF was clear that she wanted to stay in X.  Mr A states that standing back, whilst it remains difficult to say with certainty that SF wants to stay in X, the vast majority of recent discussions suggest that these are SF&#8217;s true wishes and feelings.  He notes that understandably SF may want to stay there because of the excellent support and care provided to her.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The strongest factor in favour of a return to Scotland is the opportunity which SF would have for more contact with her mother and brother (there is no wider community in Scotland of people who have kept in touch with SF in the 9 years since she left Scotland).  Even with the risks of transition, and SF&#8217;s understandable refusal to visit her mother at home, she would almost certainly see more of them if she moved to a place [in the Northeast of Scotland], and that would almost certainly be a positive experience for her the vast majority of the time. </p>

The positives have been set out above and elsewhere by the Official Solicitor: SF is flourishing at X. The fact she has recently joined a new club shows there will be further opportunities for her to develop her interests and skills if she remains where she is. </p>

		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The risks of transition are great: it is likely to impose on SF a prolonged period of anxiety and disruption, and to cause a deterioration in her behaviour which will lead to greater restrictions by staff and greater levels of restraint over a period of potentially many months, both while SF remains in England and for a further lengthy period while she settles into Y, even if that goes as well and is managed by staff as positively as the move to X (which can by no means be guaranteed). </p>

The Court must make a best interests decision on her behalf applying the provisions of MCA 2005 ss1 and 4 and the caselaw briefly reviewed earlier in this judgment. There are two options available &#8211; either the court decides that SF shall remain at X or it decides that she should move to Y whereupon the transition process will be planned and begun. A third option of waiting to see what happens in the next twelve months or so is not open to the Court &#8211; the placement at Y may well not then be available. However, as in all cases, if there is a significant change of circumstances in the future and there are options available to SF that require a decision at that time, then a further best interests decision might then have to be made in the context that then applies.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A key issue is the wishes and feelings of SF. The evidence shows that she has expressed different wishes and feelings about moving back to Scotland at different times. The evidence also shows that she has been influenced by EF and GF to express her wishes and feelings in favour of a move to Scotland. Having heard from EF and GF, I am sure that they sought to persuade SF to say that she wants to move to Y because they believe it is best for her. They have not acted maliciously but rather in what they believe to be her best interests. Nevertheless, their influence has been quite strong and has made it harder to discern SF&#8217;s true wishes and feelings. Having given this matter very careful consideration I have concluded that:</p>

She greatly enjoys the activities in which she participates in the community around X. She has a good life at X. She does not want to leave X. On the other hand she wants to see her mother and brother. She has been given to believe that she will see more of them if she moves to Scotland and may not see them if she remains in England. Naturally she wants to see them more rather than less. If she could both stay at X and see more of her family, that is what she would choose. She struggles to accept that she cannot have both.</p>

She does not ruminate on moving to Scotland or to Y. It is only when prompted that she applies her mind to the issue. She would like to see more of her family but when she does not see them, she gets on with the day and enjoys her life at X and in the community around X.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">SF is easily influenced and wishes to please her family. Before EF and GF sought to influence SF, she had consistently said she wanted to stay at X. I recognise that she might have been influenced by her carers at X and that at that time no-one around her was advocating for a move to Scotland, but there is no evidence that she was influenced in the way in which EF and GF have sought to influence her. My judgement is that SF&#8217;s own wishes, before she was influenced to say otherwise, were to stay where she was living. She may not have appreciated the implications for contact with her family members, but she wanted to stay where she was. </p>

She does not want to leave X but she does want to continue seeing her mother and brother there. She has no great desire to return to Scotland itself and is very happy living at X in England. </p>

I would have thought that GF could continue to visit SF and X. He is in his early 50&#8217;s and works as a driver. EF and GF told me about the network of  family and friends who live in Northeast Scotland who would be pleased to see SF if she lived at Y. I do not wish to speculate but perhaps that network could give some support to EF to sometimes travel to England to spend time with SF however there is little to no evidence of any of them having travelled down to England to visit SF. </p>

It must be thought possible therefore for SF to travel to Scotland if needed. I accept that it is very difficult for SF to travel far, although she recently made the trip to Scarborough, but with commitment, support, and some imagination, it should be possible to avoid face to face contact between EF and SF ending were the decision made for her to remain at X. Nevertheless, the evidence is that the opportunities for face to face time will diminish due to EF&#8217;s age and declining health.</p>

EF would have to take an hour long bus journey to see EF at Y and she may not always be fit enough to do that. To be frank, I also have to consider the reality that EF is about thirty years older that her daughter and so will not always be around for her. There is a possibility that SF might move to Y and then not be able to spend time with her mother in any event.</p>

SF likes where she is living now. She enjoys going to the local disco. She might not like a disco near Y. The same risk applies to other activities. Most obviously, she has a team of carers with whom she has a very positive relationship. That cannot simply be replicated at Y. There would be a new team. Of course, SF might have an even better relationship with that team, but it could be worse. There are risks involved in changing the care team, the residence, and the location where SF lives. SF might not thrive at Y as she is doing at X.</p>

There is a risk that greater restrictions will be required during any transition period were she to move to Y. It cannot be known with any certainty whether she would settle at Y so as to need the minimal restrictions now required, or whether a more restrictive regime would be necessary</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I remind myself that the Court&#8217;s role is not to do the best for EF or the family, but to make a decision on SF&#8217;s behalf in her best interests. There is a loss to SF whichever choice is made. That has come about because of the need to transfer her care to England several years ago and the delays in finding a suitable placement in Scotland. Such an opportunity to move back to Scotland might not arise again for a number of years. Scotland is SF&#8217;s home country and all her family live there; none lives in England. Nevertheless, SF does not want to leave X and she has no great desire to return to Scotland itself. The placement at X works very well for her and she is happy there. She may not be happy at the alternative placement, Y. She does not deal well with change, indeed it is liable to cause her distress. Until she settled in to X she was much more frequently agitated and distressed, and she frequently required restraint and seclusion. It may be that a change in medication has assisted her to achieve stability, but it is also quite clear that the excellent care she has received at X has been instrumental in transforming her life. The process of removing her from X and transferring her to Y risks a significant deterioration in her condition and her welfare. It cannot be known that the combination of factors that have so enhanced her life at X will be replicated at Y.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her day to day life what matters most to SF is the place she lives, the people she has around her when she wakes up, when she eats, and when she goes out, the places she visits and the people she meets there. She has shown herself to be a sociable person who delights in the company of her current care team and in activities out of the home. Her family mean an awful lot to her too and she loves seeing and spending time with them. I recognise the sacrifice of time with her mother and family that will be suffered by SF if she remains at X but in my judgement what is more important to her and to her welfare are the care, support, and experiences she has between visits &#8211; they are what give her life the character that it now has. It is a life that she enjoys and wants to continue. Placement X is working for SF and it would be contrary to her best interests to remove her from it. She has stability in her life for the first time for many years and the funding for her current placement is secure. I am satisfied that whilst this decision interferes with her right to a family life, it respects her right to a private life and that any interference with her right to a family life is proportionate and justified as being in her best interests.</p>
