She was born in Sydney, Australia. They were married in Australia in April 1989. Prior to the marriage they lived together for about 18 months. Their cohabitation, both before and after marriage, has been in England. W presented her first petition for divorce in November 1995. The parties had by then separated. They were reconciled and the petition was dismissed in May 1997. In February 1998 their son Taylor was born. He is now 5. In July 2000 their daughter Lauren was born. She is now 2&#189;. In July 2001 W petitioned for divorce for the second time. This time there was no reconciliation. Decree Nisi was pronounced on 28 December 2001. On 30 April 2002 W returned with the children to live in Australia permanently. This is the judgment on her application for ancillary relief.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">H and W now have net assets of about &#163;12m. This fortune derives entirely from H&#8217;s remuneration as a City worker. This is not a case where one party has had a clever business idea which he has later sold for a fortune. It is a case where a fortune has been built up from savings made from H&#8217;s compensation package. W seeks an order granting her half of the assets.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">The parties met and began their relationship in December 1986. At the time that they began to live together in 1987 H was already well established as a financier. He was then aged 29. He had been working for a well-known American bank since 1981 and had been made a Vice-President of it. He had moved to England with the bank in April 1986. He told me that at the time of the marriage in April 1989 he had net assets of &#8220;$500,000, maybe a little bit more&#8221; and was earning, inclusive of bonuses, on average $400,000 p.a. W agreed that he had an income of this order, but asserted that his net asset position at the time of the marriage was about $250,000. The evidence in this regard is not supported by any documentation. In his skeleton argument Mr Marks QC asserted that H had &#8220;about $1 m by the time of marriage&#8221;. The explanation for this was that this figure included the bonus that H received shortly after the marriage. Even if the bonus was a substantial part of his remuneration of $400,000 I do not understand how $1m was arrived at. Now, in an affidavit dated 29 January 2003 (filed with my permission after the conclusion of speeches in order to deal with a different point that arose late in the case) H asserts that his pre-marital net worth was $700,000 to $800,000. The affidavit was not supposed to address the question of H&#8217;s pre-marital net worth. I find that H&#8217;s pre-marital net worth amounted to $500,000, as stated by him in the witness box. It is reasonable to assume that a significant part of this sum was built up during the period of pre-marital cohabitation.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">In June 1994 H left the bank and began to work for a substantial international corporation which I shall call X Corp. His compensation package, while extremely lucrative, is also, to use the words of Mr Pointer QC, fiendishly complex. In November 2002 H was effectively made redundant by X Corp. For the whole of 2003 H will continue to be paid a salary by X Corp at the annual rate of $300,000 unless, before the end of the year, he finds employment elsewhere.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">H is a meticulous man. Since 1994 he has prepared annual spreadsheets of the family wealth. This enables me to have an understanding of when and at what rate assets were accumulated. It is agreed by all that the spreadsheets are inaccurate inasmuch as they omit latent taxes on the assets; but provided that I am satisfied (which I am) that the omission is maintained consistently it does not alter the accuracy of the picture of accretion. H entered the marriage in 1989 with $500,000. With that datum I am able to plot a graph of the accretion of wealth for the entire marriage. The figures must be adjusted for the effect of inflation so that values are compared in the value of money today. The figures are as follows:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">An issue in the case is how I should treat funds accumulated during the period of estrangement in 1995-1997. The parties are agreed that the period of separation was about 15-18 months. This is the same as the period between the date of the first petition and its dismissal, although the two periods will not have been exactly coincidental. The rate of accretion of wealth is demonstrated by the following graph upon which is marked the period of estrangement:</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">This graph shows that approximately $5m (in the value of money today) was accumulated during the period of estrangement. This was a period of steep accretion of capital. The amount accumulated is about 20% of the total gross assets as recorded in the final spreadsheet. Of course H cannot claim sole credit for money accumulated in the period of separation as some of the increase will be attributable to natural capital growth of existing funds. I will deal below with how this should affect my award. At this stage I am only establishing the facts.</p>

They have been denoted in the documentation by obscure acronyms, which do not require explanation here. For some of these deferred rights H borrowed money in order to invest in them. The terms of entitlement are extremely complex. When W went to see her solicitor for the first or second time she took with her the December 2001 spreadsheet of the family wealth which she had printed off the family computer. This showed that the family fortune was $24.877m, or &#163;16.5m. W prepared her Form E and declared &#163;4.4m. She exchanged it for H&#8217;s Form E and saw that he declared &#163;3.6m. Part of that total was the value of a loan made by H to W (for US tax reasons) in the sum of &#163;1.4m. Ignoring that, H was declaring assets of &#163;2.2m. The two Forms E totalled &#163;6.6m, about &#163;10m less than the document prepared by H which was now in W&#8217;s solicitor&#8217;s possession.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">Even allowing for the omission of latent tax from the spreadsheet there was still an enormous discrepancy. The reason was that although H had identified all the elements of his deferred entitlements and options in Section 2.17 in his Form E (entitled &#8220;Capital: other assets&#8221;), and had attributed values to them as part of his narrative text, he replaced those values by nil values for all except those immediately realisable when it came to filling in Box G, where the actual value to be attributed to those assets is meant to be put. That figure in Box G is then amalgamated with the figures in the other boxes to give a statement of overall net wealth. It is to be noted that in Section 2.12 of his Form E H included the full amount of the loans for investment participation. But he attributed zero value to the investments themselves when it came to doing the computation of net wealth.</p>

Mr Marks QC has defended it equally forcefully. He says that the way in which the figures were presented was approved by his previous solicitor and Leading Counsel. He says that the items and their values were not concealed - they were there to see on the face of the Form E. He says that whatever number had been inserted in Box G would have been wrong: that had H tried to attribute a fair value to it he would have been &#8220;strangled&#8221; with it later by Mr Pointer QC. Basically he says that his client was faced with Hobson&#8217;s choice.</p>

The complexity alone of H&#8217;s compensation structure was such that the employment by W of a forensic accountant was inevitable. But given that W had in her hand a document prepared by H a few months earlier which stated that they were &#163;10m richer than stated in Forms E it was obvious that the accountant was going to be instructed to undertake a rigorous process of investigation and verification. Once this process started things went from bad to worse, for in their preliminary report dated August 2002, the accountants instructed by W unfortunately made an elementary error in their calculation of the value of H&#8217;s option rights. They calculated them without taking into the account the option price which H would have to pay to acquire the assets. They attributed over &#163;6m to these options when the correct figure, net of tax, would have been only about &#163;640,000. Thus they stated that H had understated his assets by some &#163;11m, when the correct figure, when bringing into account the true value of the deferred assets, was nearer &#163;5.3m.</p>

That said both parties were demanding in their respective skeletons condemnation of the other and vindication of themselves. When W went into the witness box she stated</p>

This showed that the evidence given by H in a recent affidavit that terms had been conclusively agreed was economical with the truth. Worse still, the suggestion that the loans for the investment program were immediately payable to a commercial bank was misleading: The loans had been taken over by X Corp, and H was negotiating that they should be repaid by him over time.</p>

Essentially he submitted that a proper construction of its terms was that the loans would in fact be forgiven rather than deferred. Moreover he submitted that a proper interpretation of the agreement was that H would be $1.2m better off than had otherwise been thought. I directed that H should file further affidavits dealing with this, notwithstanding that the case had otherwise concluded. An affidavit from H and two witnesses, both of whom are chartered accountants, were duly produced. Having read them I am satisfied (although the matter is not entirely free from doubt) that H is not going to be any better off as a result of his negotiations with X Corp other than in respect of deferment of the loans.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">In my judgment it was a mistake for H to have presented his assets in his Form E in the way that he did. He accepted that the representation that he was only worth &#163;3.6m was unfair. The very point of Form E is to give an honest and conscientious estimation of the true net worth of the party at the time of swearing it. For these purposes sensible and fair figures have to be attributed to unrealisable or deferred assets. The maker of the Form E is fully entitled to qualify those figures in the narrative part of the section. But a proper figure has to be put in. It is unacceptable, in my view, that simply because an asset is not realisable on the day that the Form E is sworn, but is assuredly realisable, or likely to be realisable, at some future date, for a zero figure to be inserted.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">Moreover, when a person&#8217;s financial affairs are complicated it is incumbent on him, as part of the duty of full, frank and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">clear</span> disclosure to give a presentation that is immediately understandable by a solicitor of average financial sophistication. It is no good to present very complex material in such a way that only an accountant of enormous financial acumen can understand it. As it happens in this case H did make such a clear presentation, but only in response to W&#8217;s accountants&#8217; preliminary report. It would have been altogether better had that presentation formed part of his Form E. From that point onwards I am satisfied that H cooperated fully and clearly with W both in the disclosures made between solicitors and in his direct meetings with W&#8217;s accountants. It is a pity that he should have sullied that impression of clear and honest cooperation by suppressing the draft severance terms which I am clear he should have produced as part of his continuing duty of full and frank disclosure. It cannot be emphasised often enough in these cases that a party&#8217;s obligations of disclosure are not confined to providing the information and documents prescribed by Form E and as ordered by the Court in response to a questionnaire. There is a continuing duty to provide, without being asked, new information and documents that may affect the exercise of the statutory discretion.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">Note 1:<marker name="tab"/>I take the value of H&#8217;s US pensions at the figure of &#163;130,000, which is now agreed. Mr Marks QC argues that this should be reduced by &#163;50,000 being the tax that would be payable if H were to withdraw the money. I do not propose to do so. I am persuaded by the argument of Mr Pointer QC that this would be wrong in principle. He states, and I agree, that the court would not discount the CETV of a UK pension to reflect the tax that would be payable once the pension comes into payment. In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Norris v Norris</span> (28 November 2002) Bennett J declined to discount the value of a pension to reflect its illiquid nature, and I believe that the same principle should apply in relation to asserted tax liabilities on the funds once they came into the beneficiary&#8217;s hands. My researches reveal that the New York Courts would adopt a similar approach to a US pension fund. In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Reidy v. Reidy</span>, 136 A.D.2d 614, 523 N.Y.S.2d 860 (2nd Dept 1988), the appellate court rejected a husband&#8217;s claim that, because a large portion of the assets he received consisted of tax-deferred IRAs and employer-funded pension funds, he had in fact received less than half of the marital assets. Rather, the court found that the value of those assets would grow considerably by the time that the husband began to receive taxable income from them, and therefore any taxes incurred upon his future receipt of those benefits would be more than offset by the increase in their value.</p>

Reliance was placed (admittedly on rather scrappy material) on the practice in New York where, under a similar statute to ours, the courts routinely divide the marital assets equally after a marriage of 20 years or more.

The case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">White</span> has emphasised that the law in this area is not moribund but must move to reflect changing social values. I cannot imagine anyone nowadays seriously stigmatising pre-marital cohabitation as &#8220;living in sin&#8221; or lacking the quality of emotional commitment assumed in marriage. Thus in my judgment where a relationship moves seamlessly from cohabitation to marriage without any major alteration in the way the couple live, it is unreal and artificial to treat the periods differently. On the other hand, if it is found that the premarital cohabitation was on the basis of a trial period to see if there is any basis for later marriage then I would be of the view that it would not be right to include it as part of the &#8220;duration of the marriage&#8221;. This was the finding made in the recent case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">F v F</span> (14 January 2003) by Hartmann J in the High Court of Hong Kong, which decision contains some valuable insights on this and other aspects of the law of ancillary relief.

It seems to me that the assumption of equal value of contribution is very obvious where the marriage is over 20 years. For shorter periods the assumption seems to me to be more problematic. I am not attracted to a formulaic solution, as suggested by John Eekelaar, but I do in essence accept his proposition that the entitlement to an equal division must reflect not only the parties&#8217; respective contributions but also an accrual over time.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">I now turn to Mr Marks&#8217; second argument, which focuses on the famous passage in Lord Nicholls&#8217; judgment in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">White</span> under the heading &#8220;Inherited money and property&#8221;. This reads</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in">I must also mention briefly another problem which has arisen in the present case. It concerns property acquired during the marriage by one spouse by gift or succession or as a beneficiary under a trust. For convenience I will refer to such property as inherited property. Typically, in countries where a detailed statutory code is in place, the legislation distinguishes between two classes of property: inherited property, and property owned before the marriage, on the one hand, and &#8216;matrimonial property&#8217; on the other hand. A distinction along these lines exists, for example, in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/37" uk:canonical="1985 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985</ref> and the (New Zealand) Matrimonial Property Act 1976.</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in">This distinction is a recognition of the view, widely but not universally held, that property owned by one spouse before the marriage, and inherited property whenever acquired, stand on a different footing from what may be loosely called matrimonial property. According to this view, on a breakdown of the marriage these two classes of property should not necessarily be treated in the same way. Property acquired before marriage and inherited property acquired during marriage come from a source wholly external to the marriage. In fairness, where this property still exists, the spouse to whom it was given should be allowed to keep it. Conversely, the other spouse has a weaker claim to such property than he or she may have regarding matrimonial property.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in">Plainly, when present, this factor is one of the circumstances of the case. It represents a contribution made to the welfare of the family by one of the parties to the marriage. The judge should take it into account. He should decide how important it is in the particular case. The nature and value of the property, and the time when and circumstances in which the property was acquired, are among the relevant matters to be considered. However, in the ordinary course, this factor can be expected to carry little weight, if any, in a case where the claimant&#8217;s financial needs cannot be met without recourse to this property.</p>

The reasons are explained by Mr Marks QC in an article entitled &#8220;Duxbury-&#8212; The Future? Episode II&#8221; [2002] Fam Law 408. Essentially the fall in world markets demanded a downward revision of the existing industry standard of 4.25%. The working party suggested a half-point reduction to 3.75%. That half-point revision reflected a similar revision to the damages discount rate, now set by the Lord Chancellor at 2.5%. The paper makes clear that the revision is merely a suggestion pending judicial approval and it is for this reason that <span style="font-style:italic">At A Glance </span>has published tables on both the 3.75% and 4.25% rates.</p>

Discounts crop up in a number of areas when the valuation of assets is undertaken in ancillary relief proceedings. They arise in relation to the valuation of minority shareholdings in private companies; in the valuation of substantial blocks of publicly quoted shares, where it is said that a sale would drive down the price; and, as here, where it is said that the assets are illiquid, risky or deferred. Although the technique has a respectable pedigree it must be recognised that it is one that is devoid of any science, and is never more than a guess by the expert valuer of what lesser price than face value a hypothetical purchaser would pay for the asset in question. And it is almost invariably the case that the expert will align his guess with his client&#8217;s interests, so that the expert for the owning party will almost always suggest a higher discount than the expert for the claiming party. So the court is asked to choose between less than disinterested guesses. Here H argues for a discount of 25%. W says it should be 15%. How and by reference to what considerations can I possibly decide this dispute? It is impossible, and any decision made by me would almost certainly be wrong. It is for this reason that I am clearly of the view that a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Wells</span> sharing is particularly appropriate where the asset in question is the subject of a dispute about discounts.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">When dealing with this aspect of the case I identify three principles. First, I am of the view that the appropriate starting point for a child maintenance award should almost invariably be the figure thrown up by new child support rules. The Government&#8217;s express policy in making awards of child maintenance susceptible to abrogation and replacement by a maintenance calculation by the CSA (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/4/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s4(10)</ref>(aa) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref>) was that child maintenance orders should be negotiated</p>

All parties will know that either parent can turn to the CSA in future, and that it will therefore be sensible to determine child maintenance broadly in line with CSA assessment rates.&#8217;</p>

[1999 Cm 4349]). If a child maintenance order, whether made by consent or after a contest, is markedly at variance with the calculation under the new regime then there will be a high temptation for one or other party after the order has been in force for a year, and after giving two months notice, to approach the CSA for a calculation. Quite apart from the obvious acrimony that this would engender, a calculation in a different amount to the figure originally negotiated or awarded may cast doubt on the fairness of the original ancillary relief settlement between the parties, leading to further litigation. These spectres should be avoided at all costs.</p>

It should be noted that the Government justified the omission of the parent with care&#8217;s income in the new formula on the ground that she would from her own resources be making a substantial contribution to the support of the children.</p>

The husband has an income well in excess of the canned amount of &#163;2,000 per week. I am also of the view that where a proportionate division of the main assets has been effected then that proportion should inform the division of the child maintenance costs. 60% of the child maintenance costs would come to A$82,464. I therefore award general maintenance of A$40,000 per child per annum payable quarterly in advance, first payment to be made immediately but to take effect from 1 March 2003, to continue until each respective child attains 18 years of age or completes full time tertiary education if later. Such payments to be indexed annually on the 1st of March in each year by reference to the movement in the Australian retail price index for the most recent 12 month period for which data is available. Once a child enters tertiary education the payments will be made, as H has suggested, as to two-thirds to the child direct and one-third to W.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in">It is, therefore, clear that Calderbank offers require to have teeth in order for them to be effective. This is recognised by the requirement in RSC Ord. 62, r. 9 (and the equivalent CCR Ord. 11, r. 10) for the court to take account of Calderbank offers, and, by analogy, open offers, in exercising its discretion as to costs. There are certain preconditions. Both parties must make full and frank disclosure of all relevant assets, and put their cards on the table. Thereafter, the respondent to an application must make a serious offer worthy of consideration. If he does so, then it is incumbent on the applicant to accept or reject the offer and, if the latter, to make her/his position clear and indicate in figures what she/he is asking for (a counter-offer). It is incumbent on both parties to negotiate if possible and at least to make the attempt to settle the case. This can be done either by open offers or by Calderbank offers, both adopted by the husband in this case. It is a matter for the parties which procedure they prefer. There is a very wide discretion in the court in awarding costs, and as Ormrod LJ said in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">McDonnell</span> (above at p. 38), the Calderbank offer should influence, but not govern, the exercise of discretion.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in">There are many reasons which may affect the court in considering costs, such as culpability in the conduct of the litigation; for instance (as I have already indicated earlier) material non-disclosure of documents. Delay or excessive zeal in seeking disclosure are other examples. The absence of an offer or of a counter-offer may well be reflected in costs, or an offer made too late to be effective. The need to use all the available money to house the spouse and children of the family may also affect the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion. It would, however, be inappropriate, and indeed unhelpful, to seek to enumerate, and possibly be thought to constrain in any way, that wide exercise of discretion. But the starting-point in a case where there has been an offer is that, prima facie, if the applicant receives no more or less than the offer made, she/he is at risk not only of not being awarded costs, but also of paying the costs of the other party after communication of the offer and a reasonable time to consider it. That seems clear from the decided cases, and is in accord with the Rules of the Supreme Court and County Court Rules requiring the court to have regard to the offer. I cannot, for my part, see why there is any difference in principle between the position of a party who fails to obtain an order equal to the offer made and pays the costs, and a party who fails by the offer to meet the award made by the court. In the latter case, prima facie, costs should follow the event, as they would do in a payment into court, with the proviso that other factors in the Family Division may alter that prima facie position.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.4in">Second, it seems to me that the present system in effect forces the parties to engage in a mandatory form of spread betting. The parties are required to guess the outcome of the case and to take a position. If they have guessed correctly then they win a large amount; if they have not then they lose. But there is one significant difference to a spread bet. With a spread bet the amount the gambler wins or loses is the difference between the result and the position-maker&#8217;s spread. If he has bought and the result is higher than the top of the spread he wins; if it is lower he loses. If he has sold and the result is lower than the bottom of the spread he wins; if it is higher he loses. The closer the result is to the position-maker&#8217;s spread the smaller the amount the gambler wins or loses. The orthodox Calderbank theory in ancillary relief proceedings is however different in that it does not reflect the closeness of the litigant&#8217;s call. Instead, the mere fact of beating his guess by even a tiny amount entitles the maker of the offer to call for payment of <span style="font-weight:bold">the entirety </span>of his costs from 28 days after the date of his offer. Similarly if his guess is a fraction less than the result, then the other party can call for all her costs to be paid by the maker of the offer. So it can be seen that vast sums can swing on even the smallest failure to guess accurately. And there is no premium for guessing really well.</p>

He says, according to his calculations (which Mr Pointer does not agree), that in the first period H offered W 40.7% and in the second 40.2%. He says that as a result of H&#8217;s prescient guessing for these periods W should pay most of his costs. I estimate that he is seeking about &#163;150,000. If one takes a rough mean of H&#8217;s offers at 40.5% it can be seen that he is in effect asking to be treated as a spread-better who has wagered about &#163;300,000 per percentage point.</p>

A spouse who does not respond constructively to a Calderbank offer, whether a good offer as in this case or only one that is bad or indifferent, stymies whatever chance there is of settlement. Such a spouse cannot with impunity expect immunity from responsibility for that ...</p>

The husband&#8217;s conduct in that case can be characterised as manifestly unreasonable. The FDR procedure requires the parties to &#8220;use their best endeavours to reach agreement on the matters in issue between them&#8221; (FPR 2.61E(6)). I believe that this obligation extends outwith the ambit of the FDR. If a party refuses to negotiate in Calderbank correspondence, or adopts a manifestly unreasonable stance, then he or she can expect to be penalised in costs.</p>

The Court should be astute to discern meritless tactical posturing, such as filibustering, exorbitant demands for disclosure, or the taking of obviously bad points. When such conduct is demonstrated, it will be characterised as unreasonable and the delinquent party can expect to be penalised in costs. I would hope however that at the First Appointment, the directions phase of the FDR, or the pre-trial review the Court will be able to identify any such incipient unreasonable conduct and quash it.</p>

It can be seen that I have done this, with the parties&#8217; assent, in the Schedule of Assets at paragraph 20 above. The logic of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Leadbeater</span> cannot be gainsaid, namely, that not to add back costs paid, and not to deduct costs outstanding, effectively pre-empts the Court&#8217;s decision as to costs. But it is plainly an artifice, for the costs paid are gone and the costs outstanding will assuredly be recovered by the parties&#8217; solicitors. Costs paid do not exist as an asset, and costs outstanding are as much a debt as a debt due to any other creditor.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in">Finally, we record MR Posnansky&#8217;s supplemental submission that the judge should not have added back the costs spent, applying the practice established in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Leadbeater v Leadbeater</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] FLR 789" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] FLR 789</ref> (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Leadbeater</span>). The practice was introduced on the premise that the assessment of an applicant&#8217;s needs without both adding back payments made and disregarding liability for unpaid costs incurred and to be incurred, would effectively anticipate the costs order that would eventually be made. However, in this modem world of time costing and departmental targets, few if any, litigate on credit. In reality solicitors require to be put in funds either in advance of each step along the litigation road or soon thereafter. There is therefore an artificiality in the practice and judges must be careful not to lose sight of the reality. In the husband&#8217;s case the money was spent and was most unlikely to be his to spend again. In the wife&#8217;s case the money was spent and might be recovered in whole or in part dependent on negotiations that might have been conducted in Calderbank correspondence. That of course was only the wife&#8217;s due if she had been pushed all the way to trial by the husband&#8217;s failure to negotiate realistically. In the present case we are quite satisfied that Wilson J never lost sight of these realities and we therefore reject the submission. However the adoption of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Leadbeater</span> mechanism should never be automatic. It is probably more useful in cases where one party has paid money out and the other has obtained credit by offering security or where the court suspects some element of contrivance or artificiality in the arrangements which one party has set up.</p>

For W, I replace the positive figure of costs paid of &#163;290,000 with the negative figure of costs outstanding of &#163;55,000.

There is some merit in Mr Marks&#8217; position for his client was offering hard cash now out of deferred and risky assets. The table shows clearly that from 24 April 2002 H was making sensible offers close to the award I have made of 40%. By contrast, W&#8217;s position was always unrealistic. She at all times sought in excess of 50% of the assets. Her stance was founded on her initial erroneous estimation of the size of the assets, as I have explained in my main judgment. This arose from H&#8217;s unwise presentation of his assets coupled with her accountant&#8217;s mistake. But she maintained her stance even when the position had been made clear. She ignored numerous entreaties from H&#8217;s solicitors to engage in a dialogue leading to compromise. Her conduct made the case unsettleable, and amounts to unreasonable conduct for the purposes of deciding the issue of costs.</p>

Why it should be, where even on Mr Pointer&#8217;s case, H was guessing the result much more accurately than his client, that H should have to pay all W&#8217;s costs is beyond me. If one wanted to devise an even-handed betting system for ancillary relief proceedings then surely the party who has guessed closest should win the costs?

I do not regard his misconduct as being as serious as W&#8217;s, for the initial misrepresentation of his means was cleared up pretty quickly, and the latter default did not cause, in the overall context, a particularly large wastage of costs.</p>
