	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these proceedings, commenced by a summons dated 3 May 2006, the Plaintiff, Robert Andrew Brown, seeks a direction for the unsealing of the wills of the late Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and the late Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon ("the wills"), of which the first and second defendants are the executors.  He seeks the opening of the wills to public inspection, or at any rate leave for himself to inspect the wills as part of his investigation to establish his claim to be the illegitimate child of Princess Margaret.  The wills are under the control of the High Court in the Principal Registry, having been sealed up pursuant to orders made by the former President of the Family Division on 10 April 2002 and 19 June 2002 respectively on applications made by the executors, to which the Attorney General was made party.  The orders are in similar terms.  Each provides that the executors have permission to seal up the will; that no copy of the will should be made for the record or kept on the court file; and that the will should not be opened without the consent of the President of the Family Division for the time being.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Plaintiff's summons is dated 3 May 2006, but it was not issued until 28 September 2006 pursuant to the <span style="font-style:italic">Non-Contentious Probate Rules</span> 1987 ("the NCPR") Rule 61 the <span style="font-style:italic">Rules of the Supreme </span>Court 1965 ("the RSC"), Order 32.  The RSC continue to apply to such matters pursuant to rule 3 of the NCPR.  Thus, the Plaintiff's application is made by summons (rather than application notice) pursuant to the RSC. The summons is apparently of the Plaintiff's   own drafting.  It sets out the grounds of his claim under three main heads (1) Public interest; (2) Personal interest; (3) Rights of illegitimates in the succession.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Under (1) he refers to s.124 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Supreme Court Act</span> 1981 and Rule 58 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Non-Contentious Probate Rules</span> 1987 (see below) and asserts that it is in the public interest that the wills should, like any other, be accessible to public inspection, considerations of privacy being insufficient reason for exemption when measured against the public interest.  Under (2) he asserts his personal interest in the form of a claim that he is the illegitimate child of Princess Margaret and that he has an interest in unsealing and inspecting the wills in order to advance and/or establish that claim.  Under (3) he asserts, erroneously, that any first born illegitimate child of Princess Margaret would rank twelfth in the order of succession, notwithstanding illegitimacy and that, if it be that the wills were sealed up for the protection of such an illegitimate child, then the unsealing of the wills is likewise a matter of public interest.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In a form of affidavit dated May 2006, sworn in support of his application, the Plaintiff sets out the background and details of his claim to be the illegitimate son of Princess Margaret, which claim he states to be 'the result of quiet consideration, much "soul searching", extensive and ongoing research, weighing up probabilities, circumstantial evidence, and of memories.'  The executors assert that, upon examination of the so-called 'evidence' upon which the Plaintiff relies, it is clear that the claim has no substance whatever and that the personal interest which the Plaintiff asserts is consequently illusory, having no foundation either in fact or rational argument.  Upon that basis the executors apply on summons of their own to have the Plaintiff's claim struck out <span style="font-style:italic">in limine </span>pursuant to RSC Order 18 rule 19, alternatively under the inherent jurisdiction of the court.</p>

(2) In so far as the plaintiff alleges his personal (i.e. private) interest in the unsealing of the will, for the purpose of establishing his claim that he is or may be the illegitimate child of Princess Margaret, the matters on which he relies utterly fail to support that claim and his assertion of a right or interest over or above that of any ordinary member of the public is thus doomed to failure.

The relevant Kenyan Ordinance (No 2 of 1928 dated 9 June 1928), exhibited to the affidavit of the executors' solicitor, Mr Bridges, states its purpose as being "to Provide for the Notification and Registration of Births and Deaths and Other Matters Incidental Thereto".

Furthermore, it is clear from the rest of his affidavit, that the Plaintiff accepts that Cynthia Brown, now deceased, recognised and brought him up as her own child.  Curiously, he makes no reference to Douglas Richard Brown, named as his father in the birth certificate save, in passing, as follows.  He states that he does not accept for the purposes of his application that his birth certificate is an accurate record on the grounds that such date is inconsistent with an entry in the 'Births' section of the Times of 7 January 1955 which gave his birthday as the 6 (not the 5) of January which, he adds, is also that recorded in the hand of "D R Brown" in his tax return for the year 1955.  Nonetheless, in exhibited correspondence with the Treasury Solicitor, he refers to Douglas Brown as 'the name of the gentleman that 'raised' me';  and in a letter addressed to Buckingham Palace in 2002 (see para 33 below) he makes reference to aspects of his upbringing by Douglas Brown.  Thus it does appear that the Plaintiff was brought up by Cynthia and Douglas Brown (both now deceased) as their own child.</p>

Suffice it to say that I find that the matters on which the Plaintiff relies are devoid of any substance or significance by way of potential proof or corroboration of his claim.  Furthermore, he does not assert that any person or source, informed or otherwise, has ever told, or even suggested, to him that he is the illegitimate son of Princess Margaret.  Indeed, he acknowledges they have not.

The wording of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/4/section/124" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.124</ref> anticipates control by the High Court of the right to inspect, subject to and in accordance with probate rules, currently contained in the NCPR, which by Rule 58 plainly permit curtailment of what would otherwise be a right available to members of the public generally if, in the opinion of a District Judge or a Registrar (or in this case the President) public inspection of a particular will would be undesirable or otherwise inappropriate. It has been no part of Mr Robertson's argument that Rule 58  is <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/4/section/124" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.124</ref>. The NCPR provides no guidance upon the question of what facts or circumstances may be apt to justify  a decision to close or seal a will from public inspection, but it is to be presumed that the power to do so is concerned with considerations of privacy and the perceived necessity in particular cases to protect from harm, harassment, intrusion  or publicity those who are beneficiaries, potential beneficiaries, or otherwise interested under the will or who, for other reasons, may be adversely affected if the provisions of the will are open to public inspection.  Equally, it is to be presumed that, in relation to such a decision, those considerations of privacy fall to be weighed against the manifest general statutory presumption in favour of openness in respect of all wills subject to probate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At this point it is pertinent to note that the former President's decisions, while made on the application of the executors of the estate of an individual, were in the nature of public law decisions affecting the public at large.  The statutory scheme, comprised in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/4/section/124" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.124</ref> and the relevant rules of the NCPR, is concerned with the right(s) of members of the public at large to inspect any will deposited with and under the control of the High Court, subject only to the power of the court to close an individual will to such inspection as provided for in Rule 58.  In applying for a will to be closed to public inspection, the executors of the will concerned engage the public interest in respect of openness and, if a decision to seal the will is taken, that decision stands as a ruling binding upon the public at large.  For that reason, in any case where there is reason to suppose wider interest on the part of the public, (of which  the will of a member of the Royal Family is plainly a good example), it is appropriate for the Attorney General to be served with notice of the application in order to ensure that the public interest is represented and protected, at what would otherwise be an <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> hearing with no such representation.</p>

Mr Robertson submits that it is difficult to see why members of the Royal Family should be accorded such protection, when it is not vouchsafed to any other family so far as his researches show.  He submits that neither <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/4/section/124" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.124</ref> nor Rule 58 make an exception for royalty and that the fact that the Royal Family may have a unique status in society does not itself provide a rational reason why public inspection would be undesirable or inappropriate.  Indeed, he submits that the status of the Royal Family makes the public interest in inspection greater rather than less in this respect.</p>

Fifth, he submits that there is a public interest in checking whether the will indicates an existence of a hitherto unrecognised offspring who may have some hereditary claim to royal privileges or entitlements.  Sixth, he submits that it is anomalous that a sealing order should be made in respect of the wills of members of the Royal Family when no such provision is made in respect of the will of the Sovereign herself.</p>

Mr Robertson submits that it appears that such precedent was followed by the President in making the sealing orders in this case, as Mr Robertson puts it, 'on application by the Attorney-General and the royal executors, <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> and without any analysis or opposition.'</p>

It is plain from the order in each case that the application was  one made by the executors who joined the Attorney-General as defendant in the application to represent the public interest.  Nor has Mr Robertson provided any basis for his assertion that the application was made "without analysis or opposition".  I am certainly not prepared to proceed on this application on the basis that neither the Attorney-General nor the court analysed the position in the terms of the overall public interest or that the President failed to have regard to the balancing exercise required to be performed as between the statutory presumption of openness and the privacy interests of the beneficiaries under the wills.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Reverting to Mr Robertson's earlier points, he is of course correct that neither <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/4/section/124" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.124</ref> nor Rule 58 make an exception for royalty.  But there is no good reason to suppose that the President thought that they did, or that she considered that the 'unique status' of the royal family was a reason <span style="font-style:italic">in itself</span> to accord protection to its members.  There would have been no reason, however, why that so-called status should not have carried considerable weight in assessing the particular need for protection from speculation, gossip and general intrusion into the privacy of those named under (or indeed omitted from) the provisions of the wills.  There is of course a difference between 'the public interest' properly so called and the interest of the public in the sense simply of its seemingly insatiable curiosity about the private lives, friendships, and affections of members of the royal family and their circle,  as distinct from  matters of genuine concern to historians or investigative journalists.  </p>

I am not prepared to assume that they were omitted rather than considered.  I would however add that, in respect of what Mr Robertson calls 'the transparency interest' in seeing that nothing is being done improperly or unlawfully or that there are grounds for suspecting undue influence or foul play, these are scarcely matters which are likely to appear from inspection of the will itself.  They are matters which, as in the case of any other will, fall within the responsibilities of the executors and in respect of which remedies are available to aggrieved parties under ordinary probate procedures.</p>

I propose to treat her decisions as decisions regularly arrived at, having taken into account the public interest in open inspection at the time they were made.  Nor do I proceed upon the basis that between 2002, when the sealing orders were made, and today, contemporary conditions or public interest considerations have materially altered so far as the public at large are concerned.  Indeed Mr Robertson does not so suggest.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, that is not in itself sufficient to shut out the application of the Plaintiff.  Whilst the former President ruled that the will should be sealed from inspection so far as the public at large were concerned, she added the proviso that the will should not be opened 'without the consent of the President of the Family Division' for the time being.  I conclude from the terms of her order that she envisaged, and intended to provide for, the possibility of future  application by any individual member of the public or an institution with grounds to assert a claim or interest under the will, or otherwise able to demonstrate substantial prejudice suffered by reason of the sealing orders, such as to render it 'desirable or appropriate' that inspection should be permitted on application made to the President.  I am clear that she was right to make such a proviso.  Once an order has been made under Rule 58, there is no provision in the NCPR, nor so far as I am aware is there any guidance to be found in the RSC (or CPR), affording a specific remedy to a member of the public whose private rights or interests are adversely affected by the making of such an order, but who has had no opportunity to bring such rights or interests to the attention of the court at the time of its order so as to enable the court to make special provision or reservation in that respect if it appears appropriate to do so.  Nor is the remedy of appeal or judicial review available in respect of such an order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, as it seems to me, in exercising the jurisdiction to make an order that a will should not be open to inspection, it is appropriate for the court to include  a proviso to the effect that it can be opened by subsequent direction of the court and that, in a case of high interest, the direction should be that of the President.  So to provide gives appropriate protection and opportunity to anyone who is aggrieved, in the sense of being adversely affected or prejudiced by the making of a sealing order.  However, the burden is upon the applicant to demonstrate that such is, or may be, the case.  It is therefore necessary that the application for a direction should be supported by affidavit evidence setting out the grounds upon which it is made, as ordered by the Senior District Judge in this case.</p>

So far as the Plaintiff seeks to assert a <span style="font-style:italic">private </span>interest as opposed to a public right in unsealing the royal wills for his inspection, it is submitted that he has produced no evidence to suggest any such interest, nor is there any reason to suppose that such evidence would be forthcoming.  His interest, or prospective interest, therefore lacks any foundation in reality.  It is indeed apparent from his own affidavit that it is illusory.  Thus to proceed further with the application on the basis that it is or may be established would be a waste of time and expense with which the executors and the court should not be troubled and would amount to an abuse of process.</p>

He has simply asserted that the plaintiff's claim is made in good faith, as I would accept in the sense stated in paragraph 40 above.  Nonetheless, that does not seem to me to be sufficient to establish an interest or prospective interest of the kind sufficient to justify the Plaintiff's application.  In relation to a strikeout application, in a case where it is apparent that the plaintiff has no claim or interest, or prospective claim or interest, of the kind necessary to support an action, it is no answer to the application simply to say that the claimant <span style="font-style:italic">believes </span>he has a claim.

If, however, the application appears to be otherwise arguable and there is no other discretionary bar, such as dilatoriness on the part of the applicant, the applicant may expect to get leave to apply, leaving the test of interest or standing to be re-applied as a matter of discretion on the hearing of the substantive application".</p>

He has in truth and reality no interest which has been adversely affected by the former President's orders.  His application is based on an asserted interest which lacks any basis or foundation save in his own mind.  He is not himself an historian or investigative journalist, nor does he himself proffer any reason to suppose that the terms of the will are likely to refer to any illegitimate offspring, let alone the Plaintiff.  Further, on the evidence which he himself places before the court, there is no reason to suppose that he is other than the legitimate son of Douglas and Cynthia Brown as stated on his birth certificate, or that sight of the wills will in any way assist or bear upon that question.</p>

In relation to Article 8 (Right to respect for private and family life), he has sought to rely upon a number of extracts from ECHR decisions in relation to the definition of the notion of 'private life' and the fact that 'Respect for private life must also comprise to a certain degree the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings' (see <span style="font-style:italic">Niemietz v Germany</span> (1993) 16 EHHR 97 at para 29).

Article 8 thus embraces both the right to maintain one's privacy and, if this is what one prefers, not merely the right to waive that privacy but also the right to share what otherwise would be private with others or, indeed, with the world at large.  So that the right to communicate one's story to one's fellow beings is protected not merely by Art 10 but also by Art 8."</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reasons why these cases appear to me to be of no assistance to Mr Robertson's argument can be simply stated.  The Human Rights Act was enacted and the Convention concluded in order to protect from interference and prejudice real rights and existing situations, not illusory rights or imaginary claims.  A claimant is entitled to respect for the existence and development of his or her real family life under Article 8 and not for a fantasy family life, the product of his or her imagination.  There is no evidence and can be no realistic suggestion that the Plaintiff's real private or family life is related in any way to that of the royal family.  All of the authorities cited by Mr Robertson are cases in  which an individual was able to demonstrate a personal interest in receiving information relating to his or her private or family life as it truly existed.  The right to respect for one's private and family life does not include a right to make an unfounded claim to be related to a stranger (thus, incidentally, intruding on that stranger's private or family life), nor do any of the judicial observations referred to by Mr Robertson begin so to suggest.</p>

It is of course the position that Article 10 does not confer a general right of access to information held by State bodies.  The right to freedom to receive information basically prohibits governments from restricting a person from receiving information which others wish or may be willing to impart: see <span style="font-style:italic">Leander v Sweden</span> (1987) 9EHRR 433 at paragraph 74.  The withholding of access to the royal wills does not in itself involve any fetter upon or interference with the Plaintiff's freedom of expression as contemplated by the Convention.</p>
