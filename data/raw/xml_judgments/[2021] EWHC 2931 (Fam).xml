	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 8 September 2021 I handed down judgment in four cases heard together (MA21P01965, FD21P00578, FD21P00472 and MA21P02001) one of which, FD21P00578, is again before the court. In that judgment, I decided that it remains open to the High Court to authorise, under its inherent jurisdiction, the deprivation of liberty of a child under the age of 16 where the placement in which the restrictions that are the subject of that authorisation will be applied is prohibited by the terms of the statutory scheme (as amended from 9 September 2021 by the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2021), subject always to the rigorous application of the President&#8217;s Guidance of November 2019 entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Guidance: Placements in unregistered children&#8217;s homes in England or unregistered care home services in Wales </span>(hereafter, &#8216;the Practice Guidance&#8217;) and the addendum thereto dated December 2020. </p>

Following that judgment, I listed each of the four cases in the cohort before me separately to deal with the merits and, applying the principles set out in the judgment, made orders in each case. Within this context, on 9 September 2021 I made an order in case FD21P00578 authorising the deprivation of liberty of the subject child in those proceedings, CK. On 7 October 2021, I granted permission to appeal against the order made in case FD21P00578 on the application of the first respondent mother in those proceedings. That appeal is listed to be heard by the Court of Appeal on 16 and 17 November 2021. In circumstances where that appeal remains to be determined, the first respondent mother in case FD21P00578 has proceeded on the basis that it remains open to the High Court to authorise, under its inherent jurisdiction, the deprivation of liberty of a child under the age of 16 in a placement prohibited by the terms of the statutory scheme, without prejudice to arguments that she may advance on appeal disputing that proposition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This judgment concerns a further question that has now arisen in three cases, including FD21P00578, concerning the range of circumstances in which the jurisdiction I found subsists may be applied. Namely, whether, given the central role accorded to the President&#8217;s Guidance by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re T</span> and by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Tameside MBC v AM &amp; Ors (DOL Orders for Children Under 16</span>), it remains open to the court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction in cases where a placement either will not or cannot comply with the Practice Guidance. The spectrum of the submissions made to the court on this question has been bracketed at one end by the submission of each of the local authorities that the answer to this question is &#8220;yes&#8221;, and at the other by the submissions of the Secretary of State for Education and Ofsted that the answer to this question is &#8220;no&#8221;. Whilst each of the cases before the court concerns a child under the age of 16, the answer to the question posed in this case is applicable to all cases in which the Practice Guidance applies.</p>

This followed a period during which CK was frequently excluded from school, physically assaulted her sibling and exhibited behaviour that was difficult to manage, including assaults on the police and her mother and physical aggression against property frequent absconding, arrest by the police, self-harm and attempted suicide. Between April 2019 and December 2019 CK had over 100 missing episodes and 6 incidents leading to her involvement with the police as a result of her criminal activity. On occasion, CK has stated that she has a voice in her head that she is unable to get rid of. CK regularly used drugs and alcohol to the extent of requiring medical attention. </p>

In the circumstances, CK was placed in unregistered provision with externally commissioned staff. On 25 August 2021 Newton J authorised a deprivation of CK&#8217;s liberty in the unregistered provision until 1 September 2021.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">QV has a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourette&#8217;s Syndrome. QV was made the subject of a care order and a placement order on 26 April 2012. The placement order was discharged and the care order reinstated on 22 April 2014, following an extensive and unsuccessful search for prospective adopters. QV lacks any awareness of risk and is extremely vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. A secure accommodation order was made on 5 November 2019 and again on 6 August 2020. QV has exhibited violent behaviour on occasion when in a secure placement, caused criminal damage and has discussed how to make a bomb. QV was moved to a residential placement following his discharge from secure accommodation. QV&#8217;s behaviour again deteriorated in June 2021. Following an incident on 5 September 2021 where QV gained access to the roof of the placement and began throwing items onto the street below, QV was moved to an unregistered placement as no registered provision could be identified that would accept him. On 16 September 2021 Plymouth sought an order authorising the deprivation of QV&#8217;s liberty in the unregistered placement. That order was granted by Poole J on 17 September 2021. The order was varied by Peel J on 24 September 2021 after it became apparent that a further placement move was required for QV to his current unregistered placement. This placement is a lodge in a holiday park where QV is provided with 2:1 supervision at all times. QV reports feeling isolated and is refusing to attend his education provision. A further holiday lodge has been identified, to which QV will move on 22 October 2021.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Whilst Plymouth wish to place QV in a secure unit under the auspices of a secure accommodation order, it has not been able to identify such a placement despite daily searches for the same. As of 14 October 2021, there were 58 live referrals for children requiring secure accommodation and only 6 projected beds. Plymouth is also searching for a long term private rental property in a rural location that would be suitable for QV&#8217;s needs and which the local authority could seek to register with Ofsted but this search has not been successful to date. Within this context, Plymouth contends that it has no choice but to attempt to keep QV safe in an unregistered placement with an order authorising the deprivation of QV&#8217;s liberty. Plymouth does not believe that QV&#8217;s current unregistered placement will consent to an application being made for registration with Ofsted. This will also be the position in respect of the placement to which QV is to move on 22 October 2021.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in;text-indent:-0.50in">&#8220;[1] This Practice Guidance is being issued to explain the registration and regulation structure applicable in England and, separately, in Wales for residential care facilities for children and young people. The number of applications made for a court in family proceedings to authorise a residential placement of a young person in circumstances where their liberty may be restricted has increased markedly in recent times. Often the court is invited to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to approve a particular placement at an &#8216;urgent&#8217; hearing. Where a residential unit is registered as a &#8216;children&#8217;s home&#8217; in England, or a &#8216;care home service&#8217; in Wales, the placement will be regulated and inspected by Ofsted (England) or the Care Inspectorate Wales. The primary focus of this Guidance is to ensure that, where a court authorises placement in an unregistered unit, steps are immediately taken by those operating the unit to apply for registration (if the unit requires registration) so that the placement will become regulated within the statutory scheme as soon as possible. The Guidance requires the court to monitor the progress of the application for registration and, if registration is not achieved, to review its continued approval of the child&#8217;s placement in an unregistered unit.&#8221;</p>

The nature of the guides is, or should be, different. They do not, or should not, contain directions; they do, or should, explain, inter alia, how practice directions apply and are interpreted.

The Court of Appeal said (para 84 of the judgment of Sir Andrew McFarlane P, with whom the other two members of the court agreed) that the case did &#8220;not concern the placement of children in other than the equivalent of secure accommodation&#8221;, and that &#8220;[d]ifferent considerations will apply when an application is directed towards, and only directed towards, a deprivation of liberty&#8221;. Matters cannot, perhaps, be quite so simply stated now, given the evolution of the proceedings since the Court of Appeal hearing, but the focus of the appeal is still confined. In essence, it is concerned with children who the local authority consider require to be deprived of their liberty, and in relation to whom the statutory criteria for the making of a secure accommodation order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> are satisfied, but who the local authority propose to place elsewhere than in a secure children&#8217;s home which is approved for that purpose. There could be said to be two distinct categories of children within the group: (1) children who would be placed in a secure children&#8217;s home but there is no place available for them, and (2) children whose needs would, in the local authority&#8217;s assessment, be better met in an alternative placement. There will also be children who fall entirely outside the group because they are unlikely to satisfy the statutory criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref>, although they do need to be deprived of their liberty to keep them safe.&#8221;</p>

In any event, the Guidance primarily envisages that the children&#8217;s home will become registered so that a criminal offence is no longer being committed by others.

It must be attended by fair and proper procedures. An individual who is deprived of their liberty is entitled to have the lawfulness of that detention reviewed by a court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The first point that the court must acknowledge at the outset is that there remains no entirely satisfactory child-centred answer to the question before the court in the absence of a concerted effort by those responsible to remedy the current acute shortage of clinical provision for placement of children and adolescents requiring assessment and treatment for mental health issues within a restrictive clinical environment, of secure placements and of registered placements. The Practice Guidance was promulgated by the President of the Family Division to assist in addressing an urgent and acute problem borne of this lack of resources. On the one hand, failure to follow the Practice Guidance will deprive children of the regulatory protection Parliament has deemed they should benefit from. But, in the context of the continuing and acute shortage of appropriate resources, following the Practice Guidance can risk a vulnerable looked after child having nowhere to go. The dilemma is eloquently described in the written submissions of Ms Morgan and Mr Paisley on behalf of QV:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in;text-indent:-0.50in">&#8220;[37]<marker name="tab"/>There is a circularity which is, for the guardian as she contemplates the position for QV in this case and similarly placed young people in others, problematic. It is a circle which is impossible to square: the Guardian all things being equal would make the submission that the solution at which the Court should arrive if it concludes that the relevant body &#8216;won&#8217;t&#8217; apply to register or is failing to comply or is dragging its corporate feet in relation to the President&#8217;s Guidance or is quite simply making use of the jurisdiction because it remains available to it and is the path of least resistance would be for the Court to say in effect &#8216;thus far and no further&#8217; and to bring it to an end. That would be in all likelihood, a way in which the difficulties (which to return to the beginning are difficulties of resource above all else) move from the arena of the court where they should not be and into the province of others. Such an approach however comes at a cost; and the cost is paid by the cohort of vulnerable children and young people for whom there is then nothing in the way of a protective jurisdiction at all. So it is that the Guardian steps away from the otherwise obvious submission that the Court should stand firm; should pursue the reasoning at [62] in <span style="font-style:italic">Wigan BC v Y</span> to its logical conclusion; should refuse to sanction the jurisdiction. The welfare of this or another subject child is nowhere in that approach never mind paramount or primary.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The second point that must be emphasised at the outset is that a provider who is operating or managing a placement that falls within the definition of a children&#8217;s home is <span style="font-style:italic">required</span> to apply for registration. Before one gets to the question of the Practice Guidance, the statute <span style="font-style:italic">mandates</span> this course of action. Pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14/section/11/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.11(5)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" uk:canonical="2000 c. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Standards Act 2000</ref>, it is a summary offence for a person to carry on or manage a children&#8217;s home without being registered. In these circumstances, it is not open to providers or local authorities to decline to be constrained by the statutory requirement of registration. Parliament has enacted the statutory scheme, of which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 22</ref>C(6)(c) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> is an important part, on the basis that vulnerable children are best protected and safeguarded by their placement in a registered children&#8217;s home. It is not for local authorities and providers to choose when they consider it appropriate to act in accordance with this legislative scheme. They are required to do so. The Practice Guidance simply requires providers and local authorities to comply in a timely fashion with a pre-existing, and mandatory, legal obligation. Within this context, it is again important to note that a child who is the subject of a declaration made pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court authorising the deprivation of his or her liberty is highly likely to be receiving care with accommodation for the purposes of meeting the definition of a &#8216;children&#8217;s home&#8217; contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" uk:canonical="2000 c. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Standards Act 2000</ref>, thereby engaging the obligation to apply for registration.</p>

As I have already noted, I am satisfied for the following reasons that, <span style="font-style:italic">ordinarily</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>the answer to this question should be &#8216;no&#8217;.

As Lady Black made clear at [113], the court should not be led into an interpretation of the relevant legal instruments which focuses so intently on the detail of the legal theory that it damages the ability of the High Court to react when the assistance of the inherent jurisdiction is truly required. However, this by itself is not an answer to the question before the court. The deployment of the inherent jurisdiction in respect of children is only effective if it safeguards and promotes their welfare. Where an unregistered placement makes clear that it will not or cannot comply with the Practice Guidance, and in particular the requirement to issue an expeditious registration application, a number of factors militate against the deprivation of the child&#8217;s liberty in such a placement being in the child&#8217;s best interests that are not, in any sense, a mere matter of legal theory.</p>

Orders authorising the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty can confine a child to a specified location behind locked doors and windows, prevent a child from having contact with family members, deprive the child of the use of a telephone or access to the Internet and, in extreme cases, permit the chemical restraint of the child by way of administration of medication without consent and without the protective regime afforded by Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.

If the placement is in an unregistered children&#8217;s home, a criminal offence will be committed by any person who carries on or manages the home. The important safeguards that come with registration will be absent. If the placement is in an unregulated setting, it will equally escape these safeguards, and it is noted that the Children&#8217;s Commissioner expresses particular concern about children being deprived of their liberty in unregulated placements, to the point of questioning whether such placements, for example in caravans and outward bound centres, could ever be classed as sufficiently appropriate for article 5 purposes.&#8221;</p>

The function of the court, as recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Re T</span> at [23], is to determine issues that have arisen between the parties to litigation. The High Court is not a regulatory body and nor is it equipped to perform the role of one. It cannot, for example, deploy inspectors to inspect the placement in question nor does the court have the institutional expertise of an independent regulator. Whilst it can direct evidence from the local authority, that evidence will be from a party who has an interest in maintaining the placement in question. In short, the court is simply not in a position to replicate the scope and rigour of the regulatory regime that applies to registered placements. Parliament has further made clear that the task of regulatory oversight falls to an independent regulator and not to the court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is in this stark context that the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re T</span> makes clear that compliance with the Practice Guidance promulgated by the President of the Family Division is <span style="font-style:italic">central </span>to safe exercise of the inherent jurisdiction to authorise the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty in a placement that is not approved as secure accommodation or that is a children&#8217;s home.

This approach is entirely explicable having regard to the matters summarised in the foregoing paragraphs, as is the view taken by both Lady Black and Lord Stephens that a condition for the use of the inherent jurisdiction to authorise the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty in an unregistered placement is the need to take steps immediately, in accordance with the Practice Guidance, to bring the placement back within the regulatory regime by requiring strict compliance with that guidance. In doing so, the Supreme Court was not elevating the Practice Guidance to the status of a regulatory regime, but simply recognising the imperative need for children who are deprived of their liberty to be the subject of the regulatory regime put in place by Parliament for their protection by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" uk:canonical="2000 c. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Standards Act 2000</ref>, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" uk:canonical="2000 c. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Standards Act 2000</ref> (Registration)(England) Regulations 2010, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the Children&#8217;s Homes (England) Regulations 2015. </p>

Whilst the Supreme Court treated the question of the management of the proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction, including the role of the Practice Guidance, as ancillary to the central question of the existence of the jurisdiction in the specific circumstances with which the Supreme Court was concerned, it cannot be said that the statements made by the Court regarding the need for strict compliance with the Practice Guidance in this context were <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span>. Those statements were central to the Supreme Court&#8217;s rationale in determining that the inherent jurisdiction remains available to authorise the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty in a placement that is not approved as secure accommodation or that is a children&#8217;s home. The statements concerned a point of basic principle and were not confined to the facts of the case (albeit the court did not have before it findings of fact to inform the point ultimately argued before it) or distinguished by reference to the types of placement with which the court was concerned. The statements cannot be said to have been made in passing or as being inessential to the decision.</p>

As noted above, at [153] Lady Black concluded that the President&#8217;s Practice Guidance makes a contribution to the procedural protection for the child in that context. Within this context, compliance with the Practice Guidance forms <span style="font-style:italic">part</span> of the necessary procedural structure for purposes of Art 5 with respect to both lawfulness and protection against arbitrary detention. In circumstances where the Practice Guidance seeks to bring the subject child back within the regulatory framework governing his or her situation, compliance with that guidance guards against the risk of the arbitrariness, and the lack of certainty in the law, that arises from the deployment of an <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> scheme existing outside the statutory framework. </p>

Such a refusal by a provider is, in reality, a statement of intent not to comply with the law put in place by Parliament to safeguard and promote the welfare of the subject child through the imposition of a comprehensive and wide ranging regulatory regime. Given the burden placed on providers by an application for registration, such a position on the part of the provider <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> be understandable if the provider does not ordinarily make such provision, for example a private landlord, the owner of a holiday park or other venue not ordinarily involved in social care. However, it is placements in this category that are most likely to result in a wholly unsuitable placement for obvious reasons. Within this context, a refusal by a provider to apply for registration immediately following a placement deprives the child for the duration of that placement of regulatory oversight where it is arguably <span style="font-style:italic">most</span> needed. In the context of the cases before the court, the local authority considers that the placement for QV, a holiday park, will not consent to an application being made to Ofsted for registration.</p>

In such circumstances, the court may be required to make a very short order (measured in hours or days and not weeks) to hold the ring whilst alternative arrangements are put in place. This will particularly be the case where a placement is required immediately in order to meet the operational duties under Art 2 of Art 3 of the ECHR by keeping the child safe and the unregistered placement is the only means of achieving this (referred to as &#8216;in the moment cases&#8217; in by Fordham J in <span style="font-style:italic">R (on the application of Matthew Richards) v Environment Agency and Walleys Quarry Limited</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2021/2501" uk:canonical="[2021] EWHC 2501 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWHC 2501 (Admin)</ref> at [50]). The operational duty of the court in such circumstances is to keep the child safe, however any authorisation given for a deprivation of liberty in that situation should be for the least time possible and a timetable for the identification of a placement that is registered or willing to apply for registration set by the court, registration of the placement being essential to ensuring that the child is kept safe in the medium and long term.</p>

In the former situation, an attempt has been made to bring the child back within the regulatory regime mandated by Parliament, albeit that attempt has been unsuccessful. In such circumstances, the regulator has had a chance to consider the placement and the court must factor in the result when determining for the purposes of the Practice Guidance whether the placement of the child in the unregistered children&#8217;s home or unregistered care home service continues to be in the child&#8217;s best interests, and in particular whether, on the advice of the regulator, changes can be made to ensure a successful registration application in due course. In the latter situation, there has not even been an <span style="font-style:italic">attempt</span> to bring the child within the statutory regulatory regime, notwithstanding that that is what the law requires, with no opportunity for the independent regulator to consider the placement (because no application is made) and with the result that the child remains outside the statutory regulatory regime for the duration of the placement.</p>

In such circumstances, not to insist on compliance with the Practice Guidance would be to permit the providers who are unwilling to comply with the law to benefit from the lack of resources. Further, a child&#8217;s best interests falls to be evaluated taking into account all relevant circumstances. Whilst the absence of a placement may place the child at risk, the court must also take account of the fact that it is likely to be antithetic to a child&#8217;s best interests to be deprived of the protections of the statutory regulatory regime mandated by Parliament. Within this context, in the experience of this court, the providers that are unwilling to apply for registration of those offering placements that are the most problematic for vulnerable children in respect of which the court most regularly encounters a refusal to apply for registration, examples including holiday parks, private Air B&amp;B properties, caravans and canal boats. These expose the child to a double deficit in the form of a sub-optimal placement that is also outwith the statutory regulatory regime designed to safeguard him or her. In such circumstances, for the court to acquiesce in the face of a refusal of a provider even to seek registration is to heighten significantly the risk to the highly vulnerable subject child. </p>

Rather, in such cases and accepting the difficulties created by resource issues, after hearing the matter the court is likely to indicate its intention to refuse the application for authorisation and invite the local authority to present alternative proposals (as this court did in<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Cambria Math'"/><span style="font-style:italic">Wigan MBC v W, N &amp; Y</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2021/1982" uk:canonical="[2021] EWHC 1982 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWHC 1982 (Fam)</ref>). Again, in such circumstances, the court may be required to make a very short order (measured in days and not weeks) to hold the ring whilst alternative arrangements are put in place. Again, this will particularly be the case where a placement is required immediately in order to meet the operational duties under Art 2 of Art 3 of the ECHR by keeping the child safe and the unregistered placement is the only means of achieving this in an &#8216;in the moment&#8217; case. Again, any authorisation given for a deprivation of liberty in that situation should be for the least time possible and a timetable for the identification of a placement that is registered or willing to apply for registration set by the court, registration of the placement being essential to ensuring that the child is kept safe in the medium and long term.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">With respect to providers that &#8220;cannot&#8221; apply for registration, on behalf of Ofsted Ms Clement submitted that Ofsted does not recognise such a category, any person carrying on or managing a children&#8217;s home being required to apply for registration and any other placement not requiring registration because it is not a children&#8217;s home. Within this context, Ofsted contend that there is no such category of placements that &#8220;cannot&#8221; apply for registration. There is considerable force in that submission. However, in so far as a provider determines not to apply for registration because it could, for example, never meet the requirements to successfully apply, the court will be left in a similar position to that it finds itself in in respect of providers that will not apply. Once again, the child would be left outside the statutory regulatory regime for the duration of the placement as an application to Ofsted would never be made. Once again, this is not likely to be in the subject child&#8217;s best interests for the reasons set out above. If there are no steps being taken to regularise the position by applying for registration contrary to the Practice Guidance, the placement cannot be brought back at any point within the regulatory regime that Parliament has determined is required to meet the child&#8217;s needs. The inherent jurisdiction should not be used in circumstances which lead to the perpetuation of such an outcome. Again, the court may be required to make a very short order (measured in days and not weeks) to hold the ring whilst alternative arrangements are put in place, particularly where a placement is required immediately in order to meet the operational duties under Art 2 of Art 3 of the ECHR by keeping the child safe.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Providers who are in the process of an application obviously fall into a different category. The Practice Guidance makes clear that it accommodates the process of seeking registration and the possibility that registration may be refused or the application withdrawn. But where there is a continued failure to prosecute an application for registration despite a stated intent to do so, once again the court may find itself in a position where it cannot extend the authorisation depriving the child of his or her liberty in circumstances where the placement continues to be outside the regulatory regime. That the Practice Guidance sets out timescales in respect of the application for registration (which timescales I shall return to in more detail below) indicates that the effort to secure registration, and thus an order authorising under the inherent jurisdiction the deprivation of the child&#8217;s liberty in an unregistered placement, cannot be open ended. The requirement to make an application for registration and the timescale for doing so serves to ensure that deployment of the inherent jurisdiction in association with unregistered placements departs from the statutory scheme&#8217;s requirement of a registration to the minimal extent necessary. Within this context, the greater the delay beyond the timescales set by the Practice Guidance the greater the risk that the statutory scheme ensuring the welfare of vulnerable child is undermined. With respect to the cases before the court, the two placements for FJ were first identified by York in a statement of the social worker dated 26 March 2021, some six months ago. With respect to CK, Derby has no definitive timescale for achieving registration and as yet no clear evidence that registration is achievable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Where there is a continued failure to prosecute an application for registration despite a stated intent to do so it is difficult to see how court could continue, indefinitely, to use its inherent jurisdiction to authorise the deprivation of liberty in such a setting, as this would leave the subject child outside the protection of the statutory regime and would be contrary to the legislative intent underpinning the statutory regime. It is plainly unsatisfactory for a child to be in an unregistered placement very for months after it was known that he or she has been placed there. Such an approach increases the risk that a child will be moved into an unregistered placement and then moved again before the application to register is made, the completion of the registration process always lagging behind the child. This is not consistent with strict compliance with the Practice Guidance. Further, as Ms Clement points out, the granting of a declaration authorising the deprivation of the child&#8217;s liberty does not act to abrogate the continuing duty of the local authority under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> to safeguard and promote the child&#8217;s welfare under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/22/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, and to provide the child with accommodation which meets the child&#8217;s needs in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22</ref>C of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>. Where that accommodation is in a placement operated as a children&#8217;s home, it must be the subject of an application for registration. Whilst there is delay in applying for registration there is no independent review of placement or care of child or qualifications or training. Within the foregoing context, if a provider fails to apply for registration in a timely manner, and if a local authority fails to require that they do so, they must expect at some point that the court will refuse to continue authorising the deprivation of liberty of very vulnerable outside of the regulatory regime carefully designed by Parliament to protect and safeguard them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I accept the general proposition that cases in which a child has been placed in an unregistered placement for a significant period of time by reason of delay in securing registration, and is making sustained progress in such a placement, will raise more difficult welfare questions in circumstances where moving the child by reason of an unacceptable delay in securing registration may conflict with the child&#8217;s wider welfare needs. However, such a situation is avoided by strict compliance with the Practice Guidance. The timely application for registration required by the Practice Guidance should avoid the situation arising where a child has settled in an unregistered placement such that to move him or her is not in his or her best interests and avoid the court being required to choose between ensuring the child is brought within the statutory regulatory regime and potentially prejudicing the child&#8217;s welfare in other respects. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Finally, within the context of the matters set out above, the local authorities invite the court to make comment about how realistic the timescales set out in the Practice Guidance are. The timescales contained in the guidance are a matter for the President of the Family Division. However, it is important to remember that Practice Guidance is just that. For the reasons set out above, the expectation is that the guidance will be strictly complied with to ensure that the child is brought expeditiously within the statutory regulatory regime. However, that does not exclude flexibility in an appropriate case. For example, it is inconceivable that a child would be left without the protection afforded by an authorisation under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court because an application for registration cannot be submitted within 7 days of the first hearing in a case where there are good reasons for this, where the provider and the local authority are working to a defined plan checked by Ofsted, where the provider and the local authority are engaging in a dialogue with Ofsted, are being transparent about each step and any hurdles faced, are meeting the planned objectives, have provided the court with detailed plans and evidence of review, monitoring, support to ensure that the standards inside the placement are high, and where the local authority, providers and Ofsted are <span style="font-style:italic">ad idem</span> on the approach being taken. Whilst, for the reasons I have given, the court should not ordinarily countenance the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction in respect of a placement that will not or cannot apply for registration as required by law, it is equally the case that where a provider and a local authority working with Ofsted to achieve that end, the court will not seek to frustrate that approach by the overzealous enforcement of timescales contained in non-statutory Practice Guidance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As in each of the cases that has come before this court, the issue at the heart of the legal questions that arise regularly for determination this context is an ongoing lack of resources. Within this context, on behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Auburn contends that this speaks of local authorities failing to fulfil their sufficiency duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 22</ref>G of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. In turn, the local authorities before the court charge the Secretary of State with failing to provide them with the resources required to fulfil the sufficiency duty. The court did not hear detailed submissions regarding where responsibility for the manifest lack of suitable provision for vulnerable children lies, and I accept the submission of Mr Auburn that it is no part of the function of this court to arbitrate the respective financial responsibilities of central and local government. Within this context however, I do note that in <span style="font-style:italic">Boumar v Belgium</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1989) 11 EHRR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">(1989) 11 EHRR 1</ref>, the ECtHR held that where a State choses a system of educational supervision with a view to carrying out its policy on juvenile delinquency the State is under an obligation to put in place appropriate institutional facilities which meet the demands of security and the educational objectives of the policy in order to be able to satisfy the requirements of Art5(1)(d) of the Convention.</p>

Within the context of the cohort of cases before this court, the situation is demonstrated starkly by the position Plymouth finds itself in when seeking to ascertain the suitability of a <span style="font-style:italic">holiday park</span> as a safe placement for a highly vulnerable child with a diagnosis of ASD, ADHD and Tourette&#8217;s Syndrome who displays violent and destructive behaviour with complex and acute emotional needs, as summarised in the statement of the social worker:</p>
