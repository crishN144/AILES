At this point, the father began to spend more time with the mother and A and between then and Evie&#8217;s death, they lived together as a family.

He would then hand over to the mother later in the morning and go to sleep himself.  He would get up in the late afternoon, participate in the bedtime routine and return to work.

On behalf of the Guardian it is said that her evidence under cross-examination by Mr Rowley QC was defensive, hostile and petulant.  It is also said that she showed more emotion when speaking of the father&#8217;s infidelity than of Evie&#8217;s death.  I do not agree.   Assuming for the moment that the mother did not injure Evie, her demeanour was in keeping with the situation of somebody who had at different stages come to the realization that she had been betrayed, both as a partner and as a parent.  Why would she not be indignant and angry?  The submission also overlooks the times during the mother&#8217;s evidence when she showed great sadness at the thought of Evie&#8217;s suffering. </span></p>

It is clear that the father, for one, began to behave in a completely and shockingly different way but I regard it as highly improbable that both parents will have changed character, or that they were acting collusively.  In reaching that conclusion, I take account of the fact that the mother was responsible for looking after A as a baby without any difficulty and certainly without A suffering any injury.  I further rely upon the distinction I make between the parents&#8217; credibility as witnesses.</span></p>

There is no reason why she should have made it up, particularly as it clearly gave her pain to admit that she had done nothing about it.  Taken on its own, I would regard B&#8217;s statement as being of very limited weight, given that it was not repeated in a form that can be examined more closely.  On its own, it falls miles short of proving anything against the father.  However, it is far from being the only evidence in the case and, although I cannot be sure, I find that the probable explanation for B&#8217;s otherwise bizarre account is that she had seen a glimpse of the father mistreating Evie in a way that he would not do in front of an adult.</span></p>

In the course of argument, they raised three reasons as showing why the mother may know more than she is saying about the injuries: (1) that she did not react more decisively to the realization that the father was telling inconsistent stories about the events of 6 December but (2) that she instead continued a relationship of a kind with the father after Evie&#8217;s death, and (3) that her account of the night of 20/21 February is questionable because she said (and, it is said, emphasised) that she did not pick Evie out of her cot during the night.  I have addressed the last point above and deal with the first and second points below.

The fact however remains that it was the father, also tired and under stress and with ample opportunity, who has been shown to have caused major injuries.  It is many times more likely that someone who did this twice did it repeatedly than that there were two assailants.

There were no physical signs that should have alerted her.  The mark on the forehead, seen after death, was not spotted by the grandmother (if it was there) or by several investigators after it had been caused.  Nor should the mother have suspected that the father was responsible for the skull fracture in December.
