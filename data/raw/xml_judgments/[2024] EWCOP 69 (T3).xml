When taken together, the applicant says that it would be running a very high risk to both mother and baby to postpone the Caesarean section past 4 November 2024. The risks are set out in detail in the medical evidence which I have read from Miss A (consultant obstetrician). I have also considered evidence from Dr B (consultant psychiatrist), Dr C (consultant anaesthetist) and Dr D (consultant perinatal psychiatrist). As none of their evidence is challenged by the Official Solicitor, I have not heard any oral evidence from the medical team.</span></p>

SC&#8217;s presentation at the consultation the previous day was such that the clinicians did not feel able to discuss the proposed care plan before the Court. Because SC had not yet been told about the application, a visit by the Official Solicitor&#8217;s agent had to be delayed until 31 October 2024, the day before this hearing. In fact, however, that visit has taken place and the Official Solicitor is satisfied that she has been able to properly consider SC&#8217;s position and to elicit her views. I received this morning a record of the meeting between SC and Natalie Coates (&#8216;NC&#8217;) of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office, from which I can extract the following expressions of her position:</span></p>

SC interrupted NC and stated, &#8220;that was because of neglect, it&#8217;s different this time, I&#8217;m not agreeing to it when I know I can give birth&#8221;. NC asked whether a second opinion from any doctor would change SC&#8217;s mind. SC confirmed, &#8220;no not to a c-section. They are trying to make me believe I am only having one baby. I know there is more. There were 3 babies on the scan pictures&#8221;. &#8230; </span></p>

SC did not agree to show the pictures. SC continued, &#8220;when I had a scan there were 2 heart beats so there are at least 2 babies, I know there are 4 in me, I can feel them I know this because they are in me. If I have the c-section, I&#8217;ll get 1 and they will take the other 3 away and sell them. That is what they want to do. I need more power more rights&#8221;. &#8230;</span></p>

SC &#8230;stated, &#8220;it is the way you phrase it, they think I am mentally unstable, I have a high mental IQ. I am not lying.

Since the assessment of capacity is decision-specific, the court is required to identify the correct formulation of &#8220;the matter&#8221; [68]. The correct formulation of &#8220;the matter&#8221; leads to a requirement to identify &#8220;the information relevant to the decision&#8221; under s3(1)(a) which includes information about the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or another or of failing to make the decision: [69]. The court must identify the &#8220;information relevant to the decision&#8221; &#8220;within the specific factual context of the case&#8221;: [70]. Capacity may fluctuate over time, so that a person may have capacity at one time but not at another time. The &#8220;material time&#8221; within s2(1) is decision-specific; the question is whether P has capacity to make a specific decision at the time when it needs to be made: [64].</span></p>

These consequences are not limited to the &#8220;reasonably foreseeable consequences&#8221; for P, but can extend to consequences for others: [73]. There should be a practical limit on what needs to be envisaged as the &#8220;reasonably foreseeable consequences&#8221; of a decision or of failing to make a decision so that &#8220;the notional decision-making process attributed to the protected person&#8230; should not become divorced form the actual decision-making process carried out in that regards on a daily basis by persons of full capacity&#8221;: [75]. P&#8217;s ability to use or weigh information relevant to the decision as part of the decision-making process &#8220;should not involve a refined analysis of the sort which does not typically inform the decision&#8230; made by a person of full capacity&#8221;: [77].</span></p>

That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament&#8230; But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;</span></p>

Namely, why do you want to do a Caesarean section, what are the alternatives, what will happen when it is done, is it safe for me, is it safe for my unborn child, how long will I take to recover and what will happen if I decide not to do it.

It is evident from the medical evidence that there are strong reasons to favour the last of those: it brings a lower risk of uterine rupture than vaginal delivery; the baby is in a breech position and it is not generally advisable to rely on moving the baby manually in cases where there have been two previous Caesarean Sections; and planned Caesareans are (self-evidently) safer than emergency Caesareans.

If SC were to go into spontaneous labour before the date of her Caesarean Section then this would pose the risk of uterine scar rupture potentially causing major haemorrhage and foetal death. This would put the life of mother and baby at risk and so if a patient is at risk of spontaneous labour then this would be a reason to consider delivery from 37 weeks in order to minimise the risk to mum and baby. Additionally at the last USS SC&#8217;s baby was breech. There is no evidence to support offering ECV to women with 2 previous caesarean sections in order to turn the baby to the head down position. Nor is there any RCOG guidance or evidence to support vaginal breech delivery after 2 previous caesarean sections. Any woman wanting to embark on a vaginal breech birth after 2 previous caesarean sections would need an informed personalised care plan with a senior Obstetrician where the woman understands the risk of not only uterine rupture but also the risk of complications of a vaginal breech delivery.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">13 The second factor is that, on the last USS there was static growth of the foetus. This can be an indication of placental insufficiency. The third factor is that SC has noted on a number of occasions that she has absent or reduced foetal movements. Recurrent reduced foetal movements can also be an indication of placental insufficiency. </span></p>

Were SC to suffer a stillbirth and decline medical intervention this would pose a risk of major haemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (&#8220;DIC&#8221; &#8211; a condition where blood does not clot) and possibly death, as well as having a significant impact on her mental health.</span></p>
