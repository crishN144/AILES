His parents had brought him to hospital on 20 June with a swollen right arm.  X-rays identified several old and new fractures of the arm and shoulder.  A full skeletal survey was carried out.  This showed that C had suffered no fewer than 26 fractures, affecting all four limbs, the ribs and the shoulder blades.  The fractures had occurred on at least two separate occasions. </span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">The purpose of this hearing is to establish whether the local authority has proved that C&#8217;s injuries were inflicted by his parents.  They both strongly deny this and rely on expert medical opinion that the injuries may have been the manifestation of a condition as yet unknown to medical science that caused transient fragility in C&#8217;s bones.  Against this, other expert medical opinion considers it much more probable that the fractures were the result of C being assaulted. </span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">All the doctors agree that extensive investigations have not shown C to have any known medical condition that might explain the fractures.  At the same time they all agree that the radiological appearances seen in the skeletal survey are highly unusual.  It is also agreed by everyone that C&#8217;s mother and father have been consistently observed to be caring parents, both before and after the hospital admission.  The basis for intervention in this case rests on the origin of the fractures, and nothing else.</span></p>

These were from Dr David Ayoub, an American radiologist, and Professor Stephen Nussey, a consultant endocrinologist.  Dr Ayoub disagreed markedly with the previous interpretation of the x-rays, while Professor Nussey raised the possibility that a rare condition (hypervitaminosis A, or HVA) or the interplay of polypharmacy (and in particular the effects of anti-reflux medicine) might be relevant to C&#8217;s presentation.   </span></p>

After the prosecution medical witnesses (Dr L, Dr Halliday, Dr Ng and Professor Bishop) had been cross-examined with reference to the opinions of Dr Ayoub and Professor Nussey, the parents were acquitted on the direction of the judge.  Accordingly, neither Dr Ayoub nor Professor Nussey gave evidence at the trial and they did not undergo cross-examination.</span></p>

Possibility C is only proved if, on consideration of all the evidence, it is more likely than not to be the true explanation for the medical findings.

Self-evidently, rare and unknown conditions do exist.  In each case, the court must give proper consideration to the possibility that it is dealing with a case where something has been missed because the search that might have found it has not been carried out, or because we do not know what we are looking for.  That discipline is particularly needful here, where medical witnesses on both sides of the argument agree that C&#8217;s case is unusual to the point that several of them described it as unique, whether it is a case of inflicted injury or not.  This characteristic undoubtedly heightens the need for the most careful scrutiny of the evidence, with particular attention being paid to the possibility that the presentation results from an unknown cause.</span></p>

The standard itself is, however, finite and unvarying. Situations which make such heightened examination necessary may be the inherent unlikelihood of the occurrence taking place (Lord Hoffmann's example of the animal seen in Regent's Park), the seriousness of the allegation to be proved or, in some cases, the consequences which could follow from acceptance of proof of the relevant fact. The seriousness of the allegation requires no elaboration: a tribunal of fact will look closely into the facts grounding an allegation of fraud before accepting that it has been established. The seriousness of consequences is another facet of the same proposition: if it is alleged that a bank manager has committed a minor peculation, that could entail very serious consequences for his career, so making it the less likely that he would risk doing such a thing. These are all matters of ordinary experience, requiring the application of good sense on the part of those who have to decide such issues. They do not require a different standard of proof or a specially cogent standard of evidence, merely appropriately careful consideration by the tribunal before it is satisfied of the matter which has to be established.&#8221;</span></p>

All are considerable specialists in their own disciplines and respected the frontiers of their expertise when giving evidence.  Each of them was willing to acknowledge the claims of other disciplines and each possessed a working knowledge of the science beyond their own specialisms that enabled them to express a coherent overall opinion.  So, the radiologists were able to situate their interpretations of the x-rays within the general context of the biochemistry, while the other experts demonstrated a good understanding of the general significance of the x-rays.  During the course of the hearing, the disciplinary borders were appropriately policed by counsel, but in the end I am satisfied that these five specialists went no further outside their own territory than was necessary to address the questions on which the court required their help.</span></p>

In Dr Ng&#8217;s case, the submission rests upon her reference to normal child protection procedures whereby tests are carried out to identify metabolic conditions that might rule out inflicted injury.  In Dr Halliday&#8217;s case, it rests upon her evidence that with findings of this kind she started from a hypothesis of inflicted injury and then sought to rule it out.  With Professor Bishop, his approach was that in cases referred to him, he was looking for an explanation of bone disease.</span></p>

My view then in relation to her, and my view now in relation to all three witnesses, is that this concern is more apparent than real.  Anyone considering a case of this kind must start somewhere, and doctors and lawyers may not necessarily start from the same places.  What is important when considering the weight to attach to an expert witness&#8217;s evidence is the substance of their investigation and the way in which they have formed their views.  What matters is the journey and not just the starting point.  Has the witness given open-minded consideration to all the realistic possibilities, or has their opinion been limited by an impermissible thought-process?  Having readdressed this issue, I reach the clear conclusion that whatever proper reliance can be placed on the views of these three witnesses should not be discounted on this score.  Each of them justified their opinions on the basis of what they saw as positive supportive evidence.  Each was willing to consider all the available information and none of them arrived at their view by a process of exclusion.</span></p>

He is also taken to task for points of inaccuracy in his police statement in March 2015 (the details appearing in paragraph 28(a)(ii) of the parents&#8217; closing submissions).

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">As to these matters, my view is this.  I do not consider that Professor Bishop&#8217;s evidence was materially hampered by the fact that he had not looked at the radiographs recently.  He was not alone in this, and had it been considered important for him and the other experts to do so, it should have formed part of the extensive series of preparatory directions given for the rehearing.  Further, had a point been reached during the hearing where any witness was unable to deal with an issue because of the absence of the original radiographs in court, arrangements could have been made to remedy this, but that did not arise.  Secondly, insofar as there are limited inaccuracies in Professor Bishop&#8217;s summary of the x-rays, I bear in mind that he is not a radiologist and that he was commenting on the overall position alongside more detailed radiology evidence.  Lastly, the Professor accepted and regretted the comment made at the experts meeting.  It is not suggested that this compromised his independence; rather, it formed part of an overall submission that he had not approached this case with the necessary care.  Having heard Professor Bishop giving evidence for over three hours, mostly under cross-examination, I do not accept that submission.  I consider that he, like the other witnesses, has fully engaged in applying his expertise to the unusual facts of the case.</span></p>

He has never trained in paediatric radiology and his clinical work does not include infants (children under one year old).  He has seen just one case of severe rickets in his clinical practice.  By contrast, his legal work, stretching back over 10 years, is entirely focussed on infants.  This involves him in writing reports and giving evidence, always for the defence, in cases where adults have been accused of causing fractures in infants.  70% of these cases are civil, the remainder criminal.  This is unpaid work that he performs out of an avowed conviction that many cases of alleged child abuse are misdiagnosed and are in fact cases of metabolic bone disorder, particularly rickets, which he described as &#8220;vastly underdiagnosed&#8221;.  He considers that he has an ethical duty to correct this situation.  When I asked him where he considered his views would be considered controversial, he said that they would to those who are unaware or ignorant of the published support for them.</span></p>

Secondly, his approach is shot through with the dogma that child abuse is over-diagnosed.  It does not matter for this purpose whether he is right or wrong.  The expert with a scientific prejudice may perform a service to science by asking questions that challenge orthodoxy, but be unsuited to be an expert witness, a role that requires objectivity when giving answers.</span></p>

He made himself available at an early hour at personal inconvenience and gave his evidence in a serious manner.  However, his evidence was characteristic of his general approach.  Having taken up a position, he advanced it with the tenacity of an advocate and was dismissive of alternative possibilities.  He entertained no doubts about the correctness of his opinion, a dangerous mindset for any expert witness.</span></p>

Likewise, the PR seen on the metatarsals can be explained as being the result of an application of force, perhaps by a twisting of the feet, with or without fracture.</span></p>

This may coincide with the falloff in his weight gain shown by the growth charts, but that would be speculation.  Nonetheless, the presence of so many untreated fractures undoubtedly affected his response to being handled, so that he has been described by his parents and grandfather as being "antisocial" or as wanting to be left alone.

This view had little or no support from the other witnesses.  Nevertheless, two particular aspects of the radiology received closer attention on this occasion: (a) the appearance of PR on the shoulder blades (scapulae), and (b) the appearance of the third metacarpal in the right hand.  The latter led to a debate about whether C may have had secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), the effects of which are often seen in the long bones of the hands, and if secondary to low calcium, can be in response to or evidence of vitamin D deficiency.</span></p>

It has long been recognised that the inhibition of gastric acid production reduces calcium absorption.  Fibre within the diet may also reduce calcium absorption.  Used as a feed thickener specifically for reflux, locust bean gum safety in neonates and young infants has been reviewed (Meunier et al.  2014).  However, this is not been done in the context of other medications such as Gaviscon or Ranitidine used in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux.  In the case of C it is to be noted that its use is not recommended in pre-term infants (ibid).  Studies in vitro have shown that locust bean gum reduces the availability of materials such as calcium and iron and this is likely to be exacerbated by a reduction in gastric acid production (Bosscher et al. 2001).</span></p>

In excess, it is the only toxic substance known in rats to lead to spontaneous fractures.  Although vitamin A toxicity has been known about for centuries and characterised since the 1940s, there remain large lacunae in knowledge.  It is recognised that toxicity is seen at lower doses in the young and elderly, and that there may be other factors exacerbating toxicity.  Some of these may be genetic (Hathcock et al., 1990).  In vulnerable groups such as children toxicity has been reported with doses of the order of 1500IU/kg/d (ibid).  The presentation of toxicity varies with the dose and duration of exposure, as well as the age of the individual exposed.  C was noted to have irritability, failure to thrive, persisting, anaemia, and by inference, bone pain and tenderness.</span></p>

Human breast milk contains circa 80&#181;g RE/100ml; Cow &amp; Gate Stage 1 55&#181;g RE/100ml; human breast milk with fortifier contains 315&#181;g RE/100ml (Cow &amp; Gate; Reference).  I am not a Neonatologist, and it is not possible accurately to calculate vitamin A intake in the SCBU from the available material, but it is to be noted that C received human breast milk with fortifier during this admission and after discharge until about the middle of April, when he was eight weeks old.  At this time he was receiving 2500IU vitamin A in Dalivit and this was continued subsequently.  Depending on the number of sachets of fortifier added to each 100ml of breast milk.  It may be roughly calculated that he was receiving about fourfold the TUL and an amount of vitamin A that has been associated with toxicity in reported cases.</span></p>

		      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">It is noted that the Dalivit dose was increased in June 2014 and yet the radiological appearances of C&#8217;s bones were reported to have improved 5 months later.  This may be accounted for by a number of factors.  His growth meant that the dose of vitamin A per kg body weight was reduced.  There may also have been maturation of changes in the liver.  In addition, it is known that there is a potential antagonism between vitamins A and D.  He was likely to have been born with a marked vitamin D deficiency and thus to have been more sensitive to vitamin A excess.  As the vitamin D stores improved.  He may have become more resistant to vitamin A.  In addition, he was no longer taking any medication for reflux after discharge.  As there is evidence that histamine has physiological effects on bone cells (both osteoclasts and osteoblasts) it is possible that histamine (H2) receptor antagonism may have played a role (perhaps idiosyncratically in C) in the effects on bone.  This effect was removed when the ranitidine was stopped in June 2014.&#8221;</span></p>

It would of course be valuable, though hardly realistic, to have had sequential data for the whole of C&#8217;s early months.  I have therefore borne in mind the possibility that the available test results, broadly normal or only somewhat abnormal, might not be the whole story, and that had tests been carried out at other times, they might have disclosed grossly abnormal readings.</span></p>

It is also known that vitamin D levels in the population of the northern hemisphere are reduced in winter.  There is no doubt that throughout the relevant period, C&#8217;s vitamin D levels were lower than normal.  The measurement of these levels is problematic and the debate during the evidence has referred to various definitions of &#8216;normal&#8217;, &#8216;insufficient&#8217; and &#8216;deficient&#8217;.  However, even those who favoured &#8216;deficiency&#8217; cannot point to C&#8217;s vitamin D level being at a critically low level for any sustained period, such as to have a substantial effect on his bone mineralisation.</span></p>

Consideration must be given to the possibility of a new unknown condition, and also to a syndrome that results from a combination of known conditions whose interplay is not understood.  As already stated, Dr Allgrove is struck by the extent and symmetrical distribution of the PR and the fractures, which leads him to conclude that there must have been some sort of underlying metabolic bone disease.  It may be multifactorial, may involve vitamin A toxicity, and certainly involved vitamin D insufficiency; while one alone may not account for the presentation, they possibly provide an explanation in combination.  As before, I understand the reason for Dr Allgrove&#8217;s perplexity, and I set his opinion beside the others.</span></p>

The inability of either parent to describe a single occasion when he reacted in this way is highly suspicious.  The only incidents that they have offered for consideration occurred in doctors&#8217; surgeries.</span></p>

That is not the case here.  The parents are no doubt credible narrators of normal life events.  However, with regard to the specific issue of C&#8217;s injuries, I did not consider that I could rely on the evidence of either of them.</span></p>
