This judgment has enough disputed issues to resolve without being weighed down with admonishments to either/both parties, however it is necessary to make clear the impact that such non-compliance has on both the preparation for and hearing of a case of this nature. The issues posed by the above non-compliance led to delay in the case commencing. It was necessary to reverse the normal order of live evidence, with the husband going first. It was necessary to fix a rigid hearing template to ensure submissions, at least, could be completed. Notwithstanding these efforts this failed to rescue the hearing. In hindsight this was an inescapable consequence of the need for last minute consideration of documents and a changing evidential landscape as the evidence was probed. The consequent fall-out was that neither final submissions nor judgment could be entertained within the hearing as I would normally have wished to do. I have subsequently received written submissions on about 8 April 2024.</span></p>

The father works in the personal grooming / body modification industry. The wife is an employee whereas the father is responsible for running a business (previously in partnership with the wife although she was not actively involved in the day-to-day activities of the business). The nature of the husband&#8217;s business is that he both operates personally out of the premises by providing services but also &#8216;rent&#8217;s chairs&#8217; in the establishment to independent operators whether on a daily charge or commission basis or both. The business turnover is thus a combination of his own efforts and the return on third party activity. It seems clear the husband has over time moved from a focus on personal grooming to the point where his activity is now exclusively body modification. It appears the partnership was terminated in April 2022 and I understand the husband has traded on a self-employed basis since that time.</span></p>

Faced by this the Court will likely err in favour of the non-offending party and the culpable party cannot complain if in doing so the Court falls into error and incorrectly assesses what is the reality.

Whilst being a form of control this does not merit judicial criticism per se. In this case the husband alleges control in the form of the wife&#8217;s control and management of the formal financial records of the family, i.e., tax returns.

It was a perfectly natural role for her to take and particularly so given the parties operated the husband&#8217;s business affair through a partnership. That she was responsible for completing and filing returns for both of them is neither surprising nor concerning. I heard evidence as to this continuing post separation and indeed a surprising state of affairs under which the husband could not file a recent tax return because the wife had already done so on his behalf and it would seem likely without his knowledge or consent. I agree this step was inappropriate for obvious reasons, particularly given the fact the wife could not possibly know the components required to be included within the return. I did not find her account of the reason for doing so to be correct but I was not satisfied that in doing so she was acting with an intention to control or cause harm. The return she filed was after all one which in broad terms fitted with the records on which the husband has come to rely.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">This was the most significant evidential issue placed before me. There is a fundamental disagreement between the parties as to the husband&#8217;s earning levels and this shapes their approach as to what is a fair outcome in this case. It is sensible to outline the parameters of the dispute. Within her opening position the wife put the husband&#8217;s income at (&#8216;at least&#8217;) &#163;206,000 per annum. In closing this was reduced to a &#8216;ballpark present and/or future income and/or earning capacity of &#163;170,000-180,000 per annum&#8217;. My clear sense from the calculations which underlie this argument is that these figures are gross and prior to deduction of likely business costs and/or taxation. Reflecting this point and assuming a business cost of 15% (I received no evidence at all on business costs but there plainly will be costs associated with running the premises in which the business operates) this would translate to a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">net</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> income of around &#163;85,000 per annum (using the revised figures). In contrast the husband was somewhat opaque as to his own estimate of his earning position. He accepted a historic income of about &#163;75,000 gross per annum; noted (and seemed to agree) the wife stated he had earned about the same as her prior to separation (hence around &#163;60,000 gross) and estimated a likely return to earning around &#163;35,000 in the foreseeable future after a difficult period following the Covid Pandemic. When examined he accepted a potential in excess of this and figures of over &#163;50,000 and around &#163;70,000 were put and not entirely rejected. He made the point that the wife was responsible for tax returns which broadly support his contention as to recent earnings.</span></p>

I did not understand her case to be based on an anticipated increase in income into the future. Her case was based on a cash-based business which was producing an income which was not fully disclosed to the tax authorities. However, in the course of the hearing it became apparent this was not in fact her case. As noted above she accepted his income levels approximated her own prior to separation and went onto make clear she was estimating (she would say from an informed position) the likely income potential from the business as now constituted. I note the wife did give evidence as to the husband having received an income in excess of that claimed within the recent Post-Covid past and drew attention to the incongruity of this being the case whilst claiming Universal Credit but for the avoidance of doubt this argument fell far short of the figures claimed above.</span></p>

However, that was the strong sense of the evidence until the wife was asked to consider the implications were that true given her role in the partnership and involvement in the provision of the accounts for the business. My sense was that it was at that point that the wife modified her position. As a consequence, I do not in fact have any direct evidence to support a contention of the very high levels of income (a net return at around &#163;170,000 would equate to a gross income close to &#163;450,000) claimed by the wife and must limit my assessment to her case based on the period since separation.</span></p>

I have addressed this point above. I simply cannot proceed on the basis that the husband will not declare his income and thus will have the benefit of that part of the return that should be paid in tax. I cannot structure a final and fair outcome in this case based upon both an expectation and requirement for tax evasion. The Court will always work with net figures. Furthermore, once the wife modified her case as to this earning level being post her involvement with the business it became one based not on actual non-disclosure of income to the tax authorities but likely non-disclosure to the tax authorities. The wife explicitly at no point said in any given year (pre-termination of her role with the business) the husband earned materially more than was disclosed to the tax authorities. It would be entirely wrong to therefore find he is likely to do this in the future.</span></p>

I also note the point made as to the husband claiming Universal Credit at a time when he had income from the business. However, these points, whilst they may have some general purchase on credibility, say little if anything as to the claimed level of income put forward by the wife. The figure for this period ended up as less than &#163;20,000 (an annualised income of less than &#163;40,000). It was surprising and somewhat unfortunate that a significant part of the banked funds upon which the husband was questioned came from family funds rather than work &#8211; a point which the wife readily accepted when she gave her own evidence. </span></p>

I disagree with her contention that the husband simply would not have reduced the commission for a particular worker and not charged him a daily chair rate. In my assessment it is both plausible and likely that a different approach may be taken dependent on the worker. This is essentially a business calculation. It may be better to accept a commission only (and indeed lower commission) from a highly skilled professional who works from multiple outlets and could at any time choose to work elsewhere. After all, 30% of something is better than 50% of nothing. In contrast in the case of a less experienced individual it is entirely plausible that the focus would be a on a fixed chair price rather than a commission-based approach. Ultimately a business calculation will be undertaken to determine the best way of maximising income from a given individual. For my part I did not assess the husband as having a particularly obvious business acumen and so his assessment might differ from others. </span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">My decision making is impacted by an unhelpfully high level of speculation. However, this is informed by the history. I accept the husband was previously earning at a gross level of about &#163;75,000. I also accept that the Covid Pandemic would have had a significant impact on this personal case business. I entirely accept the income during this period was substantially reduced. I also note the husband has now materially changed the focus of the business. It is likely over time this will reach a settled position. Doing the best I can I consider it unlikely the husband&#8217;s income will settle at a level of &#163;35,000 per annum. In my assessment the combination of his own efforts and those of third parties will push this to a higher level. Yet I cannot find a safe foundation for an outcome anywhere near that proposed by the wife. For my part and on the available information I cannot assess the husband&#8217;s likely gross income as being any greater than &#163;80,000 per annum in the foreseeable future. I would get to this figure (although there are various permutations for doing so) in the following way: (a) income from husband at about &#163;40,000 gross per annum; (b) Income from rented chair with fixed daily rate of &#163;100 per day at 4 days a week, hence &#163;400pw / &#163;20,000 per annum, and; (c) Income from commission from a separate more skilled operative at 30% of &#163;80,000 per annum, i.e. &#163;24,000 per annum. In my assessment this sum would be associated with some business expenses and for these purposes I apply a 15% rate leaving a net turnover of about &#163;71,500, which after taxation reduces to about &#163;48,000 per annum. I note this broadly accords with a return to the earning level prior to separation and Covid. It is noteworthy that on his own efforts alone the husband would have a net income closer to &#163;27,000.</span></p>

More often than not the available resources will not be sufficient to meet the full needs of both parties whilst giving first consideration to the needs of the children in respect of their housing need with their primary carer. But it is important to understand &#8216;need&#8217; is intended to be an elastic concept and not an assessment of the bare minimum that would meet the housing requirement. Given this understanding there is an onus on both parties to inform the Court as to the likely cost of replacement properties within the band set by the &#8216;housing need.&#8217; This process is not adversarial but inquisitorial. The Court is seeking a fair outcome. It is not for the Court to be presented with two stark options and a choice to pick one or the other. The Court should be provided with information which fairly covers the position in question and information as to the position proposed by each party. Thus, the Court can assess the positions put forward and reach a fair outcome. It will nearly always be the case that when parties take starkly opposed positions there exists a sensible middle ground that may supply the answer to the question of a fair outcome. Yet neither party provides the Court with the necessary information to reach a clear position. What should a Court do in such circumstances? In my judgment it is a position facing the Court in this case. The answer is the Court will be entitled to draw reasonable inferences and apply them in a measured and sensible manner in reaching a conclusion. As with the issue of non-disclosure noted above it will not be open to a party to later complain if they have chosen not to provide the Court with all the information they might have done.</span></p>

She claims the property would have been transferred but for the inability of both her father and her to be in the relevant jurisdiction at the same time. The husband is poorly placed to challenge the claimed payments made but rests his case on the fact the property is still in the name of the wife.

The husband relies on the fact the property has not in fact been transferred but that does not necessarily support his contention in the light of all the evidence. Secondly, and in the light of my earlier findings as to family support I accept of the sum &#163;20,000 has effectively been off set against monies previously given. That leaves a balance figure of &#163;20,000. The wife has evidenced sums received and taken together these do total to the sum in question. Whilst this is somewhat more balanced, I do prefer the wife&#8217;s case. I am not assisted by any evidence beyond the evidence of the wife and the essential suspicion of the husband. But this does not mean I accept all family transactions are to be viewed as akin to commercial lending. I will return to this but there is a difference between a specified agreement relating to the transfer of a property and more generalised support. </span></p>

It is clear the wife has a gross income of no more than &#163;55,000 [83 + child benefit]. Using a multiplier of 3.5 x income would produce a mortgage capacity of no more than &#163;200,000. I have assessed the husband to have a slightly better earning capacity but his position is complicated by his recent accounts, which show a significantly lower level of income, and by his dependence on third parties to generate this income. It seems to me his mortgage capacity at this point would be severely compromised but even with time it would not much exceed the level set for the wife. I bear in mind the mortgage capacity report obtained for the husband [192] which bears out this point. The parties are both young and have the potential of a full mortgage length available to them. The wife works in banking and has shown a historic ability to obtain financing which may assist her beyond that which might be expected.</span></p>

It is undocumented and there is no evidential confirmation from the family member. It sits somewhat uncomfortably with the fact of commercial borrowing undertaken by the father and whilst there is evidence of family support (noted above) this is in a different league to the sums proposed here. I listened to the husband when he gave this evidence and whilst I recognise the apparent frank nature of the &#8216;admission&#8217; it did not strike me as evidence on which I should place particular reliance. It is noteworthy that it formed no part of the offers in this case which is puzzling given the open manner in which the evidence was given. This was not a case of evidence being extracted forensically but I felt a somewhat unconsidered observation by the husband. I consider, given the history, that there may be future generosity from both families but I consider it would be unsafe and likely to generate an unfair outcome were I to centrally base the future housing resource of either party on supposition as to what this might be.</span></p>

The claim for an award of this nature was first made in the wife&#8217;s open proposals provided one day before the final hearing. I note N entered private education in 2021 after the parties separated (he followed his older brother in doing so) but in general terms I fail to see how this was a financial decision which was consistent with the parties&#8217; resources as I now find them to be.

However, I bear in mind that these sums are but part of the broad support offered by the family. It is clear to me none of the contributors could have had a firm foundation on which to base the belief the sum could be repaid without destabilising the housing of the party (and children) in respect of who they have a direct interest. This is not a case with spare resources looking for a use to which they might be put. In contrast most if not all of the features at (f) apply save for perhaps with respect to delay. My strong sense and conclusion is that these funds have been offered without a firm commitment to repay and whilst I accept there may have been an understanding that they would be paid, </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">if possible</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">, I do not find any agreement was reached which suggested the funds would be paid no matter what happens. </span></p>

On my assessment it is difficult to see the evidential foundation for this prior to separation in late 2020. Thereafter the assessment is complicated by the impact of the Covid Pandemic on the family finances. It seems clear the husband&#8217;s contribution thereafter was not what the wife would have expected. However, there is a significant distinction between ability to pay and willingness to do so. I am not persuaded this was a case in which the husband&#8217;s position was unchanged leaving him free but unwilling to offer support. In my assessment there is good evidence, including the tax returns filed by the wife which plainly demonstrate the difficulty facing the husband. It may of course be that some level of animus shaped support but it is undeniably the case that greater factors were also in play. As I have noted above this necessitated not only the sale of the matrimonial investment property and X, but also the full use of these resources to keep the family afloat. Elsewhere I note the criticism of the husband in moving into the residential property at </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">AR </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">and moving the tenant out.

The solution I find does give first consideration to R in ensuring he is left in suitable and secure housing and in circumstances in which his key needs are being met. For reasons given this decision does not prioritise his private education but this does not amount to an abdication of the responsibility on the Court to have first consideration to his needs. In considering his needs I have not disregarded a need for a relationship with his father and the opportunity to repair this to include spending time with his father overnight. The children will benefit if they see both parents have an opportunity to successfully prosper post-separation. An outcome which leaves one parent unsatisfactorily provided for or an unacceptable distinction between the living standards of the child&#8217;s parents does have potential negative impact on a child of the family.</span></p>

Furthermore, he is significantly dependent on his connections in terms of third-party activity within his business. In my judgment the ultimate income balance is also fair.</span></p>

I have closely scrutinised the reasons given. I note this judgment has not been redacted as to the details of the case and I am asked to simply remove the parties&#8217; names. I bear in mind that were I not to redact the names then it would likely lead to the identification of the children of the families, one of who is a minor. I do not consider there is any essential public interest in knowing who the people behind this judgment are although there is a strong public interest in the publication of the substance such a judgment to inform the public as to the approach taken by the Court to such applications. I take account of all the points raised by the wife and agree a number of these points sound in favour of a level of redaction. </span></p>
