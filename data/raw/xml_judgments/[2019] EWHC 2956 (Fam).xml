	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">H and W are each aged 58.  They are Russian nationals and do not have any other nationality.  They married in 1983 in Russia and have 3 children, aged respectively 35, 30 and 21 years old.  They separated in 2007 (as H claims and the Russian courts have found) or 2013 (as W claims).  Their divorce took place in 2014.  On either basis the marriage was a long one and W is a fully entitled wife.   Throughout the marriage the parties lived only in Russia. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The parties were not always wealthy, but from around the mid-1990s H was able to take advantage of the extraordinary opportunities that existed at that time in Russia to amass a fortune.  It is unnecessary in this judgment to go into any details beyond saying that H became massively rich.  The parties&#8217; lavish lifestyle reflected his wealth which W puts, taking figures from published sources, at some $20 billion (all $ figures are USD).   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">During the course of the marriage H and W built up substantial cash balances in their names.  Before January 2007 H had transferred assets to W valued at RUB1.87 billion which was the equivalent at the prevailing rate of exchange in 2007 to $71 million.  He says, and it has not been challenged, that between 2007 &#8211; 2008 he transferred a further RUB125 million, being the equivalent of $5.1 million.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This was, says W, only a tiny fraction of H&#8217;s true wealth because nearly all his assets comprised shares in companies or other business entities which were not registered in his name but were held in trusts or corporate vehicles.  H does not disagree and said that this was an agreed policy to ensure that the family was protected against any financial catastrophe. </p>

He says that they wanted to protect their youngest child from a divorce and they did not tell him about the separation.  They lived apart from then on but continued to take holidays together for the sake of their child and to celebrate certain festivals and family occasions.  By 2010 H had formed another relationship and in 2011 became a father again with his new partner. </p>

This is subject (for these purposes) only to the proviso that if the party&#8217;s residence was outside the Russian Federation overseas law might apply, but that did not apply in this case and Article 161 was therefore bound to frustrate any claim by the applicant to apply foreign law.   </p>

There was not a dispute as to what they were but when it was that marital relations ceased between the parties because that was the trigger date against which the division of the assets was to be judged.  It was H&#8217;s case that marital relations ceased between the parties after a dispute in January 2007 and it was W&#8217;s case that the spouses preserved their marital relations right up until 17 November 2013.

Accordingly, W&#8217;s claim was dismissed.  All appeals against the order were unsuccessful.   </p>

Like many other jurisdictions, Russia does not recognise beneficial ownership in the way that England does.

He points out also that the experts instructed by W, went no further than to say that Russian law does not recognise trusts.  But the fact is W sought to access the third-party assets by the use of foreign law which would have been unnecessary if Russian law took them into account as matrimonial assets.  In any event, it is widely known that Russia, along with many other countries, will only divide between the spouses what is held in their individual or joint names. </p>

I do not think it proper for me to consider those cases as they do not help.  First, it is common ground between the parties that Russia, along with many other countries governed by civil codes, does not have a doctrine of precedent.  Each case is decided by applying the terms of the code to the facts agreed or found by the court.  Secondly, at least one of these cases, <span style="font-style:italic">Sergeeva</span>, was decided before W made her appearances in the Supreme Court.

Under the Nigerian court order the wife received very modest provision.

The emergent practice of listing or directing applications for leave to be listed on notice for hearing inter partes is compliant neither with the clear requirements of FPR rule 13.7(1) nor, unsurprisingly, given the terms of the rule, with the authoritative guidance given by the Supreme Court. The practice should stop. The application for leave should be listed ex parte for a hearing which can be appropriately brief, as can the judgment either giving or refusing leave. Those minded to apply to set aside the grant of leave should be mindful of what Lord Collins said. Such an application, if nonetheless pursued, should be given an appropriately short listing to enable the respondent to demonstrate, if he can &#8211; and it will not take all that long, which is why the listing can be appropriately short &#8211; that he has some "knockout" blow. Unless the respondent can demonstrate that, his application, if not dismissed then and there, should be adjourned to be heard with the substantive application. </span></p>

This was resolved by an amendment to the rules by SI 2017/741 which provides as follows (1) The application must be made without notice to the respondent; (2) Subject to paragraph 3 the court must determine the application without notice; (3) The court may direct that the application be determined on notice to the respondent if the court considers that to be appropriate. </p>

The second is to consider whether an order should be made under section 17 having regard to the matters in section 18. There are two reasons why the duties are inter-related. First, neither section 16(2) nor section 18(2) and (3) refers to an exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account. Section 16(1) directs the court to have regard to "all the circumstances of the case" and section 16(2) refers the court to certain matters "in particular." Second, some of the matters to be considered under section 16 may be relevant under section 18, and vice versa. An obvious example would be that section 16(2)(e) refers the court to the financial provision which has been made by the foreign court. Plainly that would be relevant under section 18. So also the direction in section 18(6) to the court, in considering the financial resources of a party, to have regard to whether an order of a foreign court has been complied with would plainly be relevant in considering whether England is the appropriate venue. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Despite the very able submissions made by Mr Howard QC and Mr Nagpal, I have come to the view that this is a classic example of a spouse whose background and married life was firmly fixed in her home country and who had no connection with England, whether by presence of the parties or their assets or business activities, seeking after the breakdown of the marriage to take advantage of what is a more generous approach to her claims than she has been able to achieve in her home country after the fullest possible use of its legal system.  Mr Bishop is right to say that if this claim is allowed to proceed then there is effectively no limit to divorce tourism. </p>

Even if I were to put aside the weakness of W&#8217;s connection with this jurisdiction and instead give full respect to her habitual residence in England and Wales, a survey of all the other <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.16</ref> matters counts heavily against W. </p>

But it is not the job of the English courts to correct what might be thought to be the deficiencies of the legal systems of another country in the circumstances which are shown when the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.16(2)</ref> matters are analysed.  It would be arrogant for this court to assume that England and Wales is the sole arbiter of fairness.  It is easy to imagine the offence that would be caused if the roles of England and Wales on the one hand and Russia on the other were the roles of the countries reversed. </p>

To most people it would seem inconceivable that someone who has received an award of $40-80m could argue that reasonable needs have not been met, but each case is fact-specific and I accept that W could argue that her reasonable needs have not been met. However, the other <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.16</ref> factors militate strongly against her claim proceeding.  </p>
