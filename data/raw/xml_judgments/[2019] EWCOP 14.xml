P is the first respondent to the applications.  Prior to this hearing P stopped giving instructions to his solicitors and they appeared by counsel at the beginning of the first day to make an application for permission to come off the record.  In circumstances where P indicated that he had indeed failed to provide his solicitors with instructions and had no intention of doing so moving forward, I granted that application.  The second respondent to the applications is LH. She is described in the papers variously as P&#8217;s housekeeper, P&#8217;s carer or P&#8217;s friend. She is a Croatian national.  P and LH spend a considerable amount of time in Croatia, where LH and P have business interests and where she cares for her elderly mother, her father having passed away last year.  LH is represented on a direct access basis by Mr Michael Glaser, Queen&#8217;s Counsel. </p>

I take Mr Dew&#8217;s point that it is not <span style="font-style:italic">entirely</span> clear to someone not present at the last hearing that my last order thus limited the issues for determination today.  Within this context, at the outset of this hearing Mr Dew sought to persuade me that I should determine <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> of the capacity issues before the court, even were I to decide that P did not have capacity to litigate these proceedings.

By contrast, Mr Glaser on behalf of LH submitted that the court should adjourn the <span style="font-style:italic">entirety</span> of the issues given the absence at this hearing of certain witnesses relied on by the applicant that, he submitted, went to the issue of capacity to conduct proceedings.  P, to whom I made clear that, as a litigant in person in respect of whom no decision as to capacity had yet been made, was entitled to address the court, asked me to conclude the proceedings as quickly as possible.  He did not however, engage in detail with the arguments for and against proceeding <span style="font-style:italic">in toto</span> or adjourning <span style="font-style:italic">in toto</span>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having considered the competing submissions, I decided to proceed in the manner I had originally intended, namely to determine only the issue of P&#8217;s capacity to conduct these proceedings.  With respect to the substantive questions beyond this preliminary issue, I was satisfied that not all the witnesses from whom the court would be required to hear to determine those substantive questions were before the court.  In those circumstances, whether P had capacity or not, the court was not in a position to proceed fairly to determine those substantive questions in their entirety.  In addition, for reasons I set out below, I was not satisfied that were the court to determine that P lacked capacity to conduct proceedings it followed that he did not require the appointment of a litigation friend.  Against this, I was equally satisfied that, in circumstances where the evidence provided by the absent witnesses was primarily relevant to P&#8217;s capacity historically and, in line with the decision of Baker J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">PH v A Local Authority </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2011/1704" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCOP 1704" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 1704 (COP)</ref> at [16], that the expert evidence in this case was of very considerable importance when determining the issue of P&#8217;s capacity to conduct proceedings at <span style="font-style:italic">this</span> point in time, it was not necessary for the court to hear from those absent witnesses in order to determine that narrow preliminary issue of capacity to conduct proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In the circumstances, the sole issue before me for determination is whether P currently has capacity to conduct these proceedings.  In determining this issue I have had the benefit of reading the two lever arch files of documentary evidence comprising the trial bundle and of hearing oral evidence from the applicant, from a witness familiar with the nature and extent of P&#8217;s business affairs, Mr NP, from LH and from the expert witnesses, Dr Barker and Professor Kapur.  I have also been greatly assisted by Skeleton Arguments provided by Mr Dew and Mr Glazer, as well as having the benefit of their considered oral closing submissions.   As noted above, during the course of the hearing I gave P regular opportunities to put questions to witnesses through me and to make any comments he wished by way of closing submissions.

P was educated at Eton and obtained a degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from Oxford.  He thereafter worked as a senior sales executive and then as an accountant in the family business.  He retired aged sixty-five to pursue his own property interests. P was married before divorcing in 2010.  He has two children, the applicant, who is twenty-seven years old and a daughter aged twenty-five.  During the divorce proceedings, the High Court judge charged with determining the same criticised the management by P (and his exwife) of his family inheritance.   </p>

A number of statements before the court detail the consequences of P&#8217;s alcohol use, which include public urination, inappropriate and anti-social behaviour and consequential bans from a number of national institutions.  P also has a number of medical issues.  He suffers from back problems, suffered a minor cardiac event a number of years ago and has been diagnosed with prostrate cancer, with secondaries in his lungs and bones.

On the same date P executed an LPA appointing LH as sole attorney in the management of his health and welfare.  Registration took place on 11 November and 12 November 2017 respectively. On 7 November 2017 the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) received a deed of revocation dated 12 September 2017 indicating that P wished to revoke the LPA of 16 July 2014 made in favour of Mr RL and Mr NY.

He identified evidence of impairment in P&#8217;s executive function, most likely to result from his previous excessive alcohol intake and considered P&#8217;s cognitive impairment to be relatively mild.  In the circumstances, Dr Barker considered that a neuropsychological assessment would assist in clarifying the range and extent of P&#8217;s cognitive difficulties, with an addendum report to be completed by Dr Barker once that neuropsychological opinion was available.  Within this context, on the issue of capacity to conduct proceedings, Dr Barker provided a provisional conclusion that P&#8217;s capacity in that regard would depend on the matter under litigation.  Given his difficulties with executive function and having regard to the nature of the legal matters in issue, Dr Barker expressed concern regarding P&#8217;s ability to understand, use and weigh relevant information.

In particular, Professor Kapur identified two neurological deficits during the course of his testing.  First, Professor Kapur identified what he considered to be clear evidence that P has significant executive function impairment which could impact on his capacity to deal with the proceedings.  Second, Professor Kapur identified clear memory deficits in P which are likely to significantly compromise P&#8217;s ability to comprehend complex material and retain information.  On the basis of his assessment, Professor Kapur concludes that P shows evidence of significant neuropsychological impairment, stating as follows in this context: </p>

This could be a frontotemporal dementia, or perhaps a dysexecutive variant of Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease.  His past history of alcohol abuse is probably an additional contributory factor to his cognitive impairment.  In my opinion, his condition probably represents a dual pathology &#8211; neurodegeneration and alcohol related cognitive dysfunction &#8211; rather than being subsumed under a single diagnostic category, such as &#8216;alcohol related dementia&#8217;.  In my view, the history of ischaemic heart disease, the possibility of a cerebrovascular component needs to be borne in mind, though I note an MRI scan in 2016 is reported as showing minimal small vessel disease.  In individuals with a history of alcohol abuse, the possibility of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome also needs to be considered, but the asymmetric nature of [P&#8217;s] cognitive impairment and other features of his clinical history make this a less likely diagnosis.  If it is true that [P] has significantly cut down his alcohol intake in recent years, and that his level of alcohol consumption in the weeks prior to my assessment was modest, then it is unlikely that there were acute effects of alcohol consumption on his performance during my test sessions.  However, if recent alcohol intake has been significant, this complicates interpretation of his neuropsychological test performance.&#8221; </p>

Few people have the capacity to manage all their affairs unaided... It may be that she would have chosen, and would choose now, not to take advice, but that is not the question.  The question is: is she capable of doing so?  To have that capacity she requires first the insight and understanding of the fact that she has a problem in respect of which she needs advice... Secondly, having identified the problem, it will be necessary for her to seek an appropriate adviser and to instruct him with sufficient clarity to enable him to understand the problem and advise her appropriately... Finally, she needs sufficient mental capacity to understand and to make decisions based upon, or otherwise give effect to, such advice as she may receive.&#8221; </p>

This is consistent with the principle that an individual who, by themself, lacks capacity on the subject matter in issue should be facilitated to make a capacitous decision on that subject matter by the taking of all practicable steps to help them to do so.  Where a litigant in person lacks capacity to conduct proceedings absent advice and assistance and lacks capacity to instruct advisers, he or she will lack capacity to conduct proceedings. A question remains as to the position where a litigant in person lacks capacity to conduct proceedings in his or her own right but has capacity to instruct advisers to conduct those proceedings and <span style="font-style:italic">chooses</span> not to do so.

The requirement is to consider the question of capacity in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic">particular</span> transaction, its nature and its complexity.  Within this context and having regard to nature of the applications summarised in the Paragraph [1] of this judgment, I am not able to accept Mr Glaser&#8217;s submission that the need to focus on the litigation under consideration rather than the whole of P&#8217;s affairs (per <span style="font-style:italic">Masterman-Lister v Brutton &amp; Co </span>at [18]) means that the subject matter comprising these proceedings can be characterised as and are straightforward.   </p>

More fundamentally, the nature of legal proceedings themselves, and in particular the specific demands they make on litigants, also fall to be considered.   I accept Dr Barker&#8217;s characterisation of legal proceedings as not being simply a question of providing instruction to a lawyer and then sitting back and observing the litigation, but rather a dynamic transactional process, both prior to and in court, with information to be recalled, instructions to be given, advice to be received and decisions to be taken, potentially on a number of occasions over the span of the proceedings as they develop.

However, Professor Kapur in my judgment met each of these criticisms satisfactorily.  In particular: </p>

It is the case that Professor Kapur stated that he relied on the observations of behaviour detailed in witness statements, the information provided by P in the structured interview and the neuropsychological testing equally.  However, Professor Kapur was also clear in his answer to questions put by the court that what underpinned his conclusion that P suffered from &#8220;major cognitive impairments&#8221; (which conclusion was in turn the keystone of his opinion that P lacked capacity to conduct proceedings) was the results of the neuropsychological testing and the memory and executive functioning impairments it revealed.  In my judgment, on the narrow question of capacity to conduct proceedings, it is the current assessment of P&#8217;s functioning provided by the neuropsychological testing and the structured interview that is the key information provided by Professor Kapur&#8217;s expert opinion, rather than his views on the more historical information provided in the witness statements sent to the Professor. </p>

However, Professor Kapur was equally clear that there was no suggestion of such a global effect arising out of mood, pain, discomfort or fatigue in circumstances where P had done well on some tests and poorly on others.   Professor Kapur further made clear that, having regard to P&#8217;s indication that he was in pain, the test sessions were broken up with breaks and conducted over two days. </p>

However, once again, Professor Kapur made clear that it was possible to see in the test results that this was not an issue.  Professor Kapur made clear that had P&#8217;s medication had an effect it would have been seen in the speed of processing results, which results for P were normal or only mildly impaired.  Further, if the medication affected memory Professor Kapur was clear that such an effect would have been seen &#8220;across the board&#8221;.  However, Professor Kapur noted that P performed badly in some memory tests but well in others.  Within this context, Professor Kapur considered that the absence of a witnessed global effect ruled out medication having had an adverse impact on the results. </p>

However, Professor Kapur made clear that the extent of the history he took from LH was in response to her assertion (consistent with the position set out in her witness statement to this court) that she did not consider that P had any major memory difficulties and that memory lapses were contributed to by pain, fatigue and mood.  Within this context, Professor Kapur made clear in his oral evidence that in circumstances where LH contended there were limited issues in this regard, the length of history he took was necessarily dictated by those assertions of relative normality.   </p>

It is not appropriate at this stage for me to make findings arising out of her evidence, but I do note a number of matters.  Whilst LH appears to have sought to play down any suggestion that P has cognitive difficulties, and apparently took the decision not to reveal medical his history to Dr Markovic in September last year, it is clear from her statement that there are occasions when his mental clarity is diminished, LH contends by reason of paid, tiredness or medication, and that he has &#8220;good days and bad days&#8221;.  Further, and within this context, it was reasonable to expect that, in the days leading up to this hearing and as they travelled from Croatia, LH and P would have discussed this hearing and the proceedings more widely.  LH  conceded in evidence that they had done so.  LH was clear in questions asked by the court that whilst P had understood some matters during the course of those discussions he had not understood others, LH being of the view that P had understood &#8220;some things but not everything&#8221;. </p>

Beyond this, and whilst in no way determinative, my exchanges in court with P left me with doubts about his understanding of the proceedings.  He made no real contribution on the question of an adjournment in light of the absence of certain witnesses.  It is, of course, not reasonable to expect a litigant in person to articulate in detail the legal merits of an adjournment such as ensuring an Art 6 compliant hearing, or to deploy exhaustive arguments as to the lack of relevance of particular witnesses to the issue in hand in an effort to avoid one. I also consider that P&#8217;s case appeared broadly co-terminus with that of LH and that Mr Glaser made extensive submissions. However, I was nonetheless left with the distinct impression that P&#8217;s lack of contribution was borne out of a paucity of understanding.  The same impression was given by his lack of engagement in the process of questioning witnesses who were stating things with which, on the face of it, he plainly disagreed, notwithstanding the offer of having those questions put through me.  Again, whilst I take into account that Mr Glaser asked many questions that were also supportive of P&#8217;s stated position and that the court environment can be an intimidating one, and whilst in no way determinative of my decision, this situation reinforced for me the observations of the experts that I have set out above and had the effect of adding colour to those expert opinions.  </p>

In the same manner, Mr Glaser sought to rely on certain seemingly rational and reasonable decisions made by P historically to demonstrate the opposite.  However, as I noted at points during the hearing, and whilst material of this nature may in some cases serve to inform the court&#8217;s decision as to capacity to conduct litigation, given the point at which these matters arise in the chronology, the fact that the question before the court is P&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">current</span> capacity to conduct proceedings and the central importance of the recent expert medical assessments, I am satisfied that it is not necessary to deal with those submissions at this point.  This is particularly so in circumstances where the conduct to which they refer may be relevant (or at least more relevant) to the determination of the retrospective question of his capacity to validly execute LPAs in September 2017 (see <span style="font-style:italic">D v R (Deputy of S) v S</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2010/2045" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCOP 2045" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 2045 (COP)</ref> at [40]), which issue remains live before the court and is for another day.    </p>

Having regard to the totality of the evidence before the court, and to the manner in which he presented himself before me, it is tempting to describe P as the archetypal eccentric, although to do so would be to overly romanticise alleged conduct that has, on the face of it, caused a great deal of worry, concern and hurt to others.   </p>

For the reasons I have given, I am satisfied that the magnetic evidence in this case regarding the question of whether P has litigation capacity at this point is the expert assessment undertaken in this case, considered in light of those other aspects of the evidence that illuminate P&#8217;s understanding of these<span style="font-style:italic"/>proceedings that I have set out above.  The decision of the court at this point is confined to one of whether, as at this point, P lacks capacity to conduct proceedings.  Having regard to that analysis, I am clear that P does lack that capacity. </p>

Further, the court already has the benefit of two expert opinions with respect to those issues.  Against this however, the issues in dispute between the parties regarding P&#8217;s property, affairs and welfare are complex in nature, in particular the question of the retrospective assessment of P&#8217;s capacity to execute the LPAs created in September 2017 which arguably now forms the central issue in this case.  Both Dr Barker and Professor Kapur identity the difficulties in this exercise, Professor Kapur observing that:  </p>

It is a very long way from a non-contentious matter capable of being dealt with on the papers.  In order to resolve the matters of dispute concerning P&#8217;s finances and personal affairs the court will be required to hear evidence from a number of witnesses, including the expert witnesses, and argument.

The letter states &#8220;On reviewing the papers, the Official Solicitor will decline the court&#8217;s invitation to act as [P&#8217;s] litigation friend as it is not clear what value he can bring to the proceedings (particularly at this late stage)&#8221;.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having regard to the matters set out above, the answer to the question of what value the Official Solicitor can bring to the proceedings as a litigation friend for P might perhaps be thought to be plain on the face of the papers.  Namely, to identify and advance, independently and objectively by the fair and competent conduct of proceedings, the best interests of an elderly protected party who is caught up in a contentious dispute between his putative carer and his son as to the proper administration of his financial and personal affairs and, in circumstances where both his putative carer and his son have potentially vested interest in the outcome, where he has no one to identify, articulate and champion his best interests before the court (or to put it in the language of the role of Solicitor to the Suitors, the precursor to the Official Solicitor of the High Court of Chancery, has no &#8216;natural protector&#8217;).  The Official Solicitor&#8217;s assessment of the issues as &#8220;not legally complex&#8221; is also somewhat difficult to understand in the circumstances that I have articulated during the course of this judgment and in the context of the inherent complexity of retrospective assessments of capacity. </p>

In circumstances where it would not appear that there is another suitable and willing person to act as a litigation friend, and where security for costs does not appear to be an issue in this case having regard to P&#8217;s resources, I intend to repeat the invitation to the Official Solicitor originally made by Newton J on 6 March 2019 to act as litigation friend to P in this case.
