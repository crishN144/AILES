	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs MMAM lived for very many years in Stoke Newington. It is her own property, mortgage free and of significant value. Some of that time she lived with her sister and then for a period on her own, joined later, as I have said, by her grandson in 2010.  It is clear by September 2013 Mrs MMAM was living in parlous conditions.  A statement prepared by a social worker records her as having been &#8216;severely self neglecting&#8217;.  On the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2013 District Judge Batten declared that Mrs MMAM should live at a residential care home and she was admitted to such a home on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2013.  It was intended that such admission should be temporary, rehabilitative in its objectives and permit Mrs MMAM&#8217;s dilapidated home to be cleaned and repaired. Shortly after her arrival there she was assessed by a Dr Natasha Arnold who found her to be suffering from &#8216;significant malnutrition&#8217; and &#8216;chronic self neglect&#8217;.  It also emerged that she had been known to the Older People Community Mental Health Team since 2007 and had been assessed on five separate occasions concerning presumptive mental health diagnosis and personality disorder which had led to a period of detention under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> in April 2007.   Ultimately in her report of the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014 Dr Natasha Arnold, Consultant Geriatric Nutritionist with a special interest in intermediate care, concluded as follows:</p>

She dismisses her personal welfare needs and hence is unable to consider and weigh them in her considerations how and who would look after her.  She does however seem to understand the cultural impact of taking a decision to move to Saudi Arabia away from the U.K. where she has lived for 40 years and actively wishes to be with or near her family, provided her welfare is managed for her.  [MMAM] also lacks capacity to engage meaningfully with the litigation process.  Although [MMAM] is increasingly able to express her wishes coherently and may well be supported to take decisions of increasing gravity with adequate support.  At the moment that is not the case in my view and she dismisses information through abnormal belief&#8221;.  </span></p>

Her family believe that she is more likely to conform to her care in Saudi Arabia but the evidence of her progress in X road suggests that she is likely to need skilled carers at times to ensure her basic welfare is managed when she is feeling particularly resistant.

I have been told she is currently residing in Saudi Arabia.  On the morning 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April the Second Respondent (Grandson) took Mrs MMAM from the X road residential home.  He did so with the compliance of the manager who believed that he had no legal basis to prevent such a course.  He was apparently told that Mrs MMAM was going with her grandson to the Saudi Arabian Embassy.  She was taken there and her travel documents were provided which appeared to have enabled her to be booked on the very next available flight from London to Jeddah which left that evening.   The grandson purports to outline the events of that day in his statement dated the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.  I say without hesitation that I found his account to be self serving and disingenuous.  The description of what is said to be Mrs MMAM&#8217;s behaviour on that day bears absolutely no relationship to anything I have read about her in any other document.  At paragraph 8 the grandson states </p>

Once I had introduced her, I left her to discuss her affairs as I had understood from my father I should not participate in discussing the case with officials and her in any detail.  A few hours went by, I was summoned and asked to accompany my grandmother to a place where food was given to her and then we were taken to a rest facility.  Little later someone from the embassy came to take her and I was told to return home and that they would contact me as required.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The picture presented is a complete fabrication.  This old, sick, largely incapacitous lady further burdened by an &#8216;abnormal belief system&#8217; would simply not have been able to function effectively or autonomously in the way the grandson asserts.  It is clear from the above passages that the grandson was acting entirely on his father&#8217;s instructions.  That is the dynamic of their relationship which I have observed for myself in the courtroom at previous hearings.  The reference to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the time constrained medical condition&#8221;</span> sadly relates to the fact that Mrs MMAM is suffering from metastasised bowel cancer.  The statement requires recasting in reality.   Mr MASM and his son have plainly colluded to defeat the declaration made by this court. Mr MASM has done so notwithstanding that he acquiesced to the declaration made and drafted in the terms that it was.  He was the applicant in this litigation.  In my judgement he has acted with cynical disregard to the objectives of this process and, in the light of the declarations drawn, it must follow that his actions are entirely inconsistent with the best interests of this vulnerable and incapacitous woman, who is of course his own mother.  The reasons for this planned deception are not immediately clear, but I draw from this history and from the actions of these two men that their motivation is likely family&#8217;s financial self-interest.  It seems to me that if Mr MASM had genuinely believed that his mother&#8217;s interest did not lie in her remaining in the residential unit for the reasons Dr Arnold said then he had every opportunity to put those conclusions to the assay by cross examination.  He chose not to do so despite being represented by counsel.</p>

The Court has in connection with its jurisdiction the same powers, rights and privileges and authority as the High Court (COPR 2007, R89) which means that it may find or commit to prison for contempt, grant injunctions where appropriate, summons witnesses when needed and order the production of evidence.

The relevant practice directions (PD21A) and &#8220;practice guidance notes&#8221; deal with Contempt of Court, Applications for enforcement may also be made; the CPR relating to third party debt orders and charging orders are applied as are the remaining rules of the Supreme Court 1965 in relation to enforcement of judgments and orders and writs of execution fieri facias (writs and warrants of control, post April 2014)  All this said the Court of Protection jurisdiction is limited to the promotion of &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold">the purposes of</span>&#8217; (<span style="font-style:italic">my emphasis</span>) the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (MCA) and, it follows, the appropriate order may be, from time to time, to direct the Deputy or some other person to take proceedings of a different kind in another court where the objectives fall outside the remit of the MCA. </p>

An application for committal of a person for contempt can be made to any judge of the Court of Protection by issuing an Application Notice stating the grounds of the application supported by affidavit in accordance with practice directions.  (COPR 2007 makes additional provisions).  In addition to this the court may make an order for committal <span style="font-weight:bold">on its own initiative</span> against a person guilty of contempt of court which may include <span style="font-weight:bold">misbehaviour in the face of the court.</span></p>

In a response which I considered to be supine, they  advance no opposition to Mr MASM&#8217;s application to withdraw the proceedings.  I was roundly critical of that reaction.  Mrs MMAM had been rescued from squalor and neglect.  I have been shown photographs of her previous living conditions.  Her grandson, the man who negotiated what he calls her &#8220;repatriation&#8221; was living in the same house as his grandmother whilst her circumstances had reduced to the parlous conditions that I have described.  In addition, Mrs MMAM lacked capacity in relation to medical, welfare and litigation decisions.  Moreover she was in addition gravely ill physically. Local Authority&#8217;s simply have to absorb the extent of their responsibilities in these challenging cases.  Vulnerable adults must be protected every bit as sedulously as vulnerable children.  I emphasise that it is the safeguarding obligation that is similar- I do not suggest that vulnerable adults and children should be regarded as the same.  Accordingly, I asked the Local Authority, the Official Solicitor and Mr MASM to reflect on the questions identified in paragraph 13 above.  </p>

There is no injunction against him - he is no more bound by the injunction granted against Paterson than any other member of the public. He is bound, like other members of the public, not to interfere with, and not to obstruct, the course of justice; and the case, if any, made against him must be this - not that he has technically infringed the injunction, which was not granted against him in any sense of the word, but that he has been aiding and abetting others in setting the court at defiance, and deliberately treating the order of the court as unworthy of notice. 1f he has so conducted himself, it is perfectly idle to say that there is no jurisdiction to attach him for contempt as distinguished from a breach of the injunction, which has a technical meaning. Mr. Seward Brice has endeavoured to persuade us that there is no such jurisdiction; and that the only course to pursue would be to proceed against him by indictment. I confess that it startled me, as an old equity practitioner, to hear the jurisdiction contested upon the facts in this case. It has always been familiar doctrine to my brother Rigby and myself that the orders of the court ought to be obeyed, and could not be set at naught and violated by any member of the public, either by interfering with the officers of the court, or by assisting those who were bound by its orders."</span></p>

The difference is very marked. In the one case the party who is bound by the injunction is proceeded against for the purpose of enforcing the order of the court for the benefit of the person who got it.  In the other case the court will not allow its process to be set at naught and treated with contempt. In the one case the person who is interested in enforcing the order enforces it for his own benefit; in the other case, if the order of the court has been contumaciously set at naught the offender cannot square it with the person who has obtained the order and save himself from the consequences of his act. The distinction between the two kinds of contempt is perfectly well known, although in some cases there may be a little difficulty in saying on which side of the line a case falls." </span></p>

Wellesley removed her from their care. He was ordered by the court to bring her to the bar of the court, but he failed to do so and refused to disclose her whereabouts. He was committed to the Fleet.  He was, however, a member of Parliament and reported the matter to the Speaker of the Commons, claiming privilege. The Committee of Privileges took the view that his actions constituted a criminal contempt, which fell within the principle under which persons committing indictable offences were considered not to be entitled to privilege.  The matter then came before Lord Brougham L.C. on a motion to discharge the committal order. He held that Wellesley was not entitled to privilege, for such a claim was of no avail where the object of the process was the delivery up of a person wrongfully detained. &#8221;</span></p>

A later order was made restraining the ward and one Kearney from marrying. In breach of this order they married. At the Register Office they produced a forged form of consent, purporting to be by the girl's parents. The parents accepted the position and took no further action, but the Attorney-General moved the court to commit the ward and Kearney for contempt. Counsel for the Attorney-General stated that it was the first time he had intervened in a wardship case, but the marriage was ipso facto criminal contempt and it was therefore proper that the motions for committal should be brought in this way. Faulks J took a similar view, and sentenced both contemnors to 28 days' imprisonment, because he felt it necessary to show that such an order of the court could not be deliberately flouted. &#8221;</span></p>

Mr. Laws has consistently contended that there are two types of contempt. The first is civil contempt, which consists of a breach by a party to proceedings of an order made against him; that is not the present case.

If, then, it is argued, that is assumed to be the purpose of the court in making the order, the purpose is one which the court cannot legitimately achieve because, as the authorities referred to demonstrate, the order is only properly made inter partes. There is an appealing logic in this but the answer is, I think, that it confuses two quite different things, that is to say, the scope of an order made in private litigation inter partes and the public law question of the proper administration of justice. If the court has taken into its hands the conduct of the matter to the extent of ordering the interim preservation of the interest of the plaintiff so that the issue between him and the defendant can be properly and fairly tried, it has to be accepted that that is what the court had determined that the interests of justice require. The gratuitous intervention of a third party intended to result in that purpose being frustrated and the outcome of the trial prejudiced, must manifestly interfere with and obstruct what the court has determined to be the interests of justice. Those interests are not dependent upon the scope of the order.&#8221;</span></p>

Times Newspapers Ltd. could not by any stretch be applied directly to the present appeal. It depended on four circumstances. There were proceedings in existence between the Attorney-General and the first group of defendant newspapers which would be fruitless if anyone made public the information whose confidentiality the proceedings were brought to assert. There was in force an injunction, admittedly not directed to anyone except the first group of newspapers, but obviously intended to stop the publication by any medium of materials which would compromise the pending proceedings. The editor and publishers of &#8220;The Sunday Times&#8221; knew of the injunction and understood its purpose. Accordingly they knew that if they published extracts from the book they would frustrate both the purpose of the injunction and the purpose of the action itself. Their choice to publish was treated by the courts below (and this was no longer challenged before the House) as justifying the inference of an intention to interfere with the course of justice. </span></p>

References to this injunction recur throughout the arguments and judgments, and its presence overshadows the entire case. Nevertheless it was not the mainspring of the decision, for every member of the House was at pains to emphasise that the submission for the Attorney-General did not depend on giving the injunction any binding effect on &#8220;The Sunday Times.&#8221; It is not perhaps entirely clear what the reasoning of the House would have been if the injunction had not existed at all.

However, on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2015 when, as will be obvious, the outline of this judgment had already been completed, I received a document in which the Local Authority had largely adopted the analysis of the Official Solicitor in relation to the law.  Doing the best I can to summarise  the Local Authority&#8217;s position, it would seem that they do not abandon their earlier submissions but, as I understand it, relegate them to secondary status.

Nor do I consider that Munby J intended to go so far in Re <span style="font-style:italic">SA</span> (supra). Whilst both jurisdictions require there to be a sedulous protection of the vulnerable, there is a paternalistic quality to wardship which does not easily equate to and is perhaps even inconsistent with the protection of the incapacitous adult, in respect of whom capacity will or may vary from day to day or on issue to issue.  There is in addition, the obligation to promote a return to capacity wherever possible.   The Court of Protection has a protective and supervisory role but wardship goes much further, it invests the judge with ultimate responsibility.  The child becomes the judge&#8217;s ward.  There is no parallel in the Court of Protection and it would be wrong, in my view, to rely on this now dated and limited case law (identified by Mr McKendrick) to permit this Court to reach for a power which is not specifically provided for in the comprehensive legislative framework of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  </p>

Lord Atkinson&#8217;s description of a &#8216;paternal and quasi domestic jurisdiction over the person and property of the wards&#8217; has little resonance for practitioners for whom &#8216;family life&#8217;, protected under Article 8 of the ECHR, is evaluated by analysing competing rights and interests, where the autonomy of the child is also afforded great respect. Unsurprisingly and partly in response to the range of these principles the scope and ambit of wardship has reduced very considerably (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 100</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> repealed <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 7</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Reform Act 1969</ref>, the route by which the High Court had derived its power to place a ward of court in the care, or under the supervision of a Local Authority). <span style="font-family:'Arial Black'"/>Whilst Mr McKendrick is entirely right to draw this line of authority to my attention, the position in relation to wardship is, to my mind, largely anomalous, predicated as it is on the  somewhat artificial premise that the court represents the Sovereign as parens patriae and cannot therefore be resolving contested issues as between the parties in an non adversarial arena (see Arlidge, Eady and Smith on contempt (4 edition) (Para 11-338).  Mr McKendrick put much emphasis on the judgment of Munby J in Re SA (Vulnerable Adult with Capacity: Marriage) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/2942" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 2942 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 2942 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 FLR 867" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 FLR 867</ref>, para 84.

It by no means follows automatically that an alternative course of action to that determined in the Declaration, is contrary to an individual&#8217;s welfare. There may, in simple terms, be a &#8216;second best&#8217; option.  For this reason, such a declaration cannot be of the same complexion as a Court Order.  It lacks both the necessary clarity and fails to carry any element of mandatory imperative.  I am ultimately not prepared to go as far as Mr McKendrick urges me to and elevate the remit of the Court of Protection, in its welfare decision making, to such a level that anything hampering the court in the exercise of its duty, or perpetrated in wanton defiance of its objectives is capable, without more, of being an interference with the administration of justice and therefore criminal contempt.  Such an approach would it seems to me be entirely out of step with the development of our understanding of the importance of proper and fair process where the liberty of the individual is concerned.  I would add that this has long been foreshadowed by the recognition that the necessary standard of proof in a application to commit is the criminal standard.</p>

A declaration is ultimately no more than a formal, explicit statement or announcement.  That said I emphasise that Mr MASM, in fact acted, through the agency of his son, in a way which was cynically contrary to his mother&#8217;s best interests.  The course he took was not a &#8216;second best&#8217; option but one entirely inimical to his mother&#8217;s welfare, physically, mentally and emotionally.

Many of the litigants who come before the Court of Protection are at a time of acute distress in their lives, as a cursory glance at the case law of this still fledgling court will show.  The issues could not be more challenging, not infrequently they quite literally involve decisions relating to life and death.  Inevitably, some litigants do not achieve their objectives neither wholly nor in part but they respect the process.  More than once I have observed that the importance to a family of being heard in decisions of this magnitude matters almost as much as the outcome itself.  Sometimes the medical and ethical issues raised are such that NHS Trusts seek the authorisation of the court to endorse or reject a particular course of action.  The court ultimately gives its conclusion by declaration both in relation to lawfulness and best interests.  The terms of these declarations often cannot and indeed should not seek to be too prescriptive. </p>

Frequently, these issues resolve themselves but it would to my mind be disproportionate and indeed corrosive of the cooperation ultimately required, for the shadow of potential contempt proceedings to fall too darkly over cases such as this.  It would not be an appropriate response to this judgment for the profession to over burden future orders too readily with Penal Notices.  </p>
