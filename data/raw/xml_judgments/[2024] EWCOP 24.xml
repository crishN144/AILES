HC has a degree in photography and videography, and enjoys arts and crafts, yoga, and rock climbing.  Sadly, while at secondary school, she started to suffer with mental health difficulties, and shortly before she went to university, she was diagnosed with anorexia.  Since then, she has had a number of admissions to hospital for treatment for her mental health, and in particular for anorexia, both as an informal patient and under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.3</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>.   </p>

On 31 January 2024, HC's current placement, K House, gave four weeks&#8217; notice to the applicant and 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> respondent to terminate HC&#8217;s placement there.  Following the identification of D House as a suitable placement for HC, K House said that it would not keep HC beyond 15 April 2024.  This application was issued on an urgent basis on 10 April 2024, leaving only two working days in which a decision could be made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Proceedings in the Court of Protection concerning HC started in October 2022 by the NHS Trust with responsibility for HC&#8217;s mental health needs in the community.  At that time, HC was severely underweight, with a BMI of only 12, and there was no agreement as between the statutory bodies and  RC about her care.  RC was of the view that HC had suffered trauma as a child as a result of the care provided to her by mother, and that HC required specialist trauma intervention as well as treatment for anorexia.  The Trust said that he had not engaged with professionals and had been obstructive. There was, very evidently, a breakdown of trust, with RC critical of earlier decisions about care provision for HC. That lack of trust persists on both the part of RC and the statutory bodies.  For example, RC and HC continue to hold the view that they would not accept any treatment from the eating disorder service in Leicestershire. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The orders initially sought in 2022 were aimed at enabling professionals to obtain access to RC to assess her care needs and her capacity.  The evidence of the Trust as to HC's capacity was that anorexia prevented her from using and weighing information about the serious risks to her health of refusing a care package, and that HC was unable to exercise any capacity she might have due to coercion and control by her father.   The question of capacity was obviously a complex one, with different professionals holding different opinions.  HC held the same view as her father, that therapy addressing past trauma was an essential element of any care package.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of the proceedings in 2022-2023, various issues were raised as regards the relationship between HC and RC which were never tested or determined, but which remain pertinent to the situation HC now faces. Professionals reported that HC repeated her father&#8217;s views, would not express an opinion without checking with him first, and was subject to his influence. It was reported that RC had written letters to professionals which purported to be from HC without telling her.  The independent expert instructed to assess HC&#8217;s capacity, Dr Tyrone Glover, said that RC had not acted in RC&#8217;s best interests, by failing to seek appropriate medical treatment for HC even when she was very unwell, and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">although his intentions are not malign, his intransigence is potentially putting his daughter&#8217;s health at serious risk&#8221;</span>.  While Dr Glover had not observed direct evidence of coercion, he said that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">RC exerts a powerful influence over H&#8217;s thinking which appears to be urging her towards unsafe preferences in domains in which she lacks capacity&#8221;.</span> A treating psychiatrist, Dr B, expressed the view that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">There is an enmeshed and rather circular relationship between RC and HC</span>&#8221;, explaining that HC fears loss of attachment, and so any attempts by RC to extract himself from the position of primary carer results in distress to HC &#8211; he therefore continues in that role.  This has the effect of reinforcing HC&#8217;s belief that she cannot function without RC. </p>

A second LPA for health and welfare was registered after that date, and has not been suspended, but the order of Mrs Justice Lieven of 20 January 2023 recorded in a recital an expectation that no decisions would be made pursuant to the second LPA in respect of matters which were before the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 7 June 2023, the parties agreed an order which was approved by the court without a hearing, which recorded the fact of HC&#8217;s detention under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>, that her BMI had increased to a healthy level, and that it was anticipated that she would be discharged imminently.  The order provided that the applicant in the proceedings at that time &#8211; the NHS Leicestershire Partnership Trust &#8211; must apply for further directions by 16 June 2023.  No such application was made, and HC was eventually discharged from hospital on 1 November 2023 to K House, following a 6-week transition.  The court was not informed of her discharge, and no further communication with the court took place until this application was issued on an urgent basis on 10 April 2024.  HC was in agreement with the plan to move to K House, and she was apparently assessed as having capacity to decide on her discharge destination.  </p>

At that hearing, the Official Solicitor and RC complained of the manner in which the application had been made - with little advance notice, inadequate evidence as to the proposed arrangements for HC at D House, and without supplying the court with all relevant documentation.  Directions were given for the provision of further evidence.  K House agreed that HC could remain there until the conclusion of the full hearing later in the week.</p>

RC did not wish to give oral evidence.  I also met HC by video-link, attended by her solicitor, to introduce myself and to ascertain directly her current wishes.  HC did not wish to attend the hearing itself but was in communication with her father during the hearing.  I was provided with a bundle of documents which I read in full. Attendance notes prepared by the ICB&#8217;s solicitor were provided at intervals, setting out additional information obtained from Ms T and a member of staff from D House, while the hearing was underway.   </p>

By the end of Ms T&#8217;s evidence, there was agreement that this could be extended by a few days, but she was clear that having given notice 11 weeks ago, any longer extension would not be countenanced by K House.  This judgment has therefore been prepared very swiftly.  The parties and the court have undoubtedly been put in a difficult position by the lateness of the application, an application which could and should have been made in early March 2024 when the local authority social worker assessed HC as lacking capacity to make decisions about where to live and receive care, and RC expressed his belief that HC required a further specialist placement, contrary to the advice of professionals. </p>

RC considers that HC also has complex PTSD and it may turn out that this is correct &#8211; it was the view of Dr Glover that HC displayed symptoms consistent with PTSD, and K House appear to have been providing treatment to HC on that basis.  </p>

Ms T said that she did not think HC could &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">think things through&#8221;</span>, and that during therapy sessions, it had become evident that HC could not retain information to use it on subsequent occasions.

It is consistent with what Dr Glover advised &#8211; that RC&#8217;s involvement reinforces HC&#8217;s difficulties, it is not the cause of them &#8211; and that HC&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">lack of self-worth, ongoing hopelessness and anxiety&#8221; </span>were a further source of impairment of her capacity in addition to her anorexia.</p>

Further, Ms Earle did not inform HC that she was assessing her capacity when she spoke to her about options for moving on from K House.  As I understood Ms Earle&#8217;s evidence, she started the conversation with HC (at which HC&#8217;s father and two therapists at K House were present) without expecting to conduct a capacity assessment, but having heard HC&#8217;s responses to questions, she formed the view that HC was unable to use or weigh the information she was being given.   </p>

In an email on 31 January 2024, Ms T wrote that HC &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">is able to make choices and decisions, but it does feel that they are largely decided or influenced by her father. Our experience of her is that she is able to grasp things, however there does seem to be fluctuations in her logic and ability to compute that learning into action&#8221;.  </span> The progress report from Ms T on 10 January 2024 said that HC &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">does not have the ability to make any choices or decisions for herself and at times during conversations it felt like there was an expectation that I make them for her or her family make them for her&#8221;.  </span>When asked by staff at K House why she did not want to go to D House, HC responded that her family had told her it was not the right place.  Ms T told me that she has never assessed capacity, and is not familiar with MCA caselaw.  K House&#8217;s approach is to treat everyone as having capacity, partly in order to encourage people to assume responsibility for themselves.   </p>

While that may appear perfectly reasonable to them, it is easy to see why it seems unreasonable from the perspective of RC &#8211; who has a longstanding fear that insufficient or inappropriate services will be offered to HC &#8211; and from the perspective of HC, who fears abandonment, suffers from anxiety, and feels unable to function without a high level of support.  From their point of view, they were losing access to the specialist placement they had been seeking for a long time, they were being told there was only one option and so there was no choice about where HC would go, and the level of support that HC would get was being reduced in quantity and quality.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">The use of physical restraint to move HC, even on the basis that is a last resort, is not justified.  It is neither necessary nor proportionate at this juncture, and I have significant reservations about authorising its use in circumstances where the orders I make are on the basis of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.48</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> and there is a dispute about HC&#8217;s capacity to make her own decisions.  HC already suffers from anxiety and it seems extremely likely that the use of physical restraint would be a further source of trauma for her.  Her litigation friend, the Official Solicitor, does not support the use of force.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2022, Dr Glover observed that if the court authorised the unwanted separation of HC and RC for treatment for her life-threatening anorexia, which neither of them supported, this would &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">almost certainly be viewed by RC and quite probably HC herself as further evidence of the harmful interference of yet another state agency, potentially cementing the family&#8217;s negative view of those institutions with an inevitably harmful impact on the effectiveness of any such treatment&#8221;</span>.  Dr Glover&#8217;s view was that intervention was nevertheless required at that time because HC was at risk of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">catastrophic and potentially fatal consequences of inaction&#8221;</span>.  Today, the risks that HC faces are not of the same magnitude. She is not underweight.  She does not need urgent medical attention. She does need somewhere to live and receive care and support where she can build trusting relationships with other people, and start to believe in herself.   The best way to achieve that, in my view, is not to forcibly move her to a placement to which she objects.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Last month, RC was overheard instructing HC what to say to therapists and her social worker &#8211; he told her not to tell her therapists how she was feeling, not to sign any documents or trust her social worker, and not to give her email address to anyone. A safeguarding referral was instigated by K House.  It is evident that RC is fearful that HC will be moved to somewhere that is not right for her, but HC needs him to support a move to a suitable placement &#8211; even if it is not the perfect placement &#8211; and to accept that professionals are trying their best to support HC.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The orders I will make therefore, will require the provision of additional evidence from the statutory bodies at the start of next week and will consent on HC&#8217;s behalf to a move to D House if she is willing to move there.  If she is not, then the court consents on her behalf in the interim to her moving home to live with RC, and to receiving the proposed package of domiciliary care.  In that event, there will need to be either agreement from RC or orders ensuring that professionals can have access to HC, and can see and speak to her directly and without RC being present. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr O&#8217;Brien submitted that in the event HC moves willingly to D House, an urgent authorisation should be put in place and a standard authorisation implemented to authorise her deprivation of liberty, as D House is a locked facility.  I raised a concern as to the appropriateness of this approach given that urgent authorisations are not designed to be used when a move is planned in advance, and that the test for capacity in respect of a standard authorisation is equivalent to that applied in the making of a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.15</ref> declaration, which is not a declaration that I have made, or been asked to consider making.  Furthermore, given the complexity of the issue of HC&#8217;s capacity to make relevant decisions, there is a risk that an assessment of capacity by a new professional for the purposes of a standard authorisation might result in a conclusion that HC has the necessary capacity, which would then result in an urgent court hearing being required. On further reflection, Mr O&#8217;Brien submitted that the court should authorise HC&#8217;s deprivation of liberty at D House instead.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I consider it inconsistent with my determination that it is in HC&#8217;s best interests to move to D House only if she agrees to go there, to order that once at D House, if she changes her mind, she should be prevented from leaving.  If the only reason for not imposing a forced move was the use of restraint during the journey, the two propositions would sit together more easily.  But that was not the only reason &#8211; there are serious concerns about the impact on HC&#8217;s mental health and self-harming behaviour of imposing a decision on her to which she objects.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, since HC&#8217;s living arrangements at D House would be an objective deprivation of her liberty, and since I have found that there is reason to believe she lacks capacity to make decisions about her care and residence, substitute consent to her objective deprivation of liberty is required while she resides there willingly. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I will therefore authorise HC&#8217;s deprivation of liberty at D House in the event she has agreed to move there, but that authorisation will end if HC changes her mind about staying there and says that she wishes to return to the family home.  The case must be returned to court for further directions immediately if that happens, or if it is intimated.  In any event, the case will be listed for review and further directions within a short timescale.</p>
