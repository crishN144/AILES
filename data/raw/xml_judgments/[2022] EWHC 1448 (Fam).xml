In a number of emails, the respondent said that she could not come to court because she was abroad, and that she was abroad because she feared for her safety.  She repeatedly said that she wished to join the hearing remotely.  The applicant said that he was concerned that the wife would record or even live stream the proceedings if she was permitted to attend remotely, but I decided, in the context of proceedings that are heard in public and the need to ensure that the wife could participate, that I should permit her to join by video link on CVP. This she did. She gave me an assurance that she was not recording and would not record the proceedings.  I have seen nothing to suggest she has broken that assurance.</span></p>

I note, however, that on the order the penal notice was on page 2 of 3 rather than on the front which does not comply with Rule 37.2. Despite the submissions of the applicant, I am not satisfied that no injustice arose as a result, and as a consequence I do not find that the respondent is liable to committal for contempt of court as a result.  I know that she is able to quote legal authority and research, but her posts, emails and documents suggest her understanding of legal issues is very superficial. </span></p>

The evidence is very clear indeed, and I note that the respondent did not deny creating the posts or give any explanation for what she had done save to say that she had a right to freedom of speech and that the orders were fraudulent.   By doing this, she was in clear breach of the terms of the order of 24</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> August because the posts refer to the applicant . There was a warning on the front page of the order that if it was not obeyed, Ms Gissing McMeel would be in contempt of court, and this was repeated in capital letters at the top of page two. Whilst it might have been better if the words in capitals on page two were in the same form on page one, I do consider that the requirements of Rule 37.2 are met, and in any event that Ms McMeel cannot have been in any doubt about the consequences of breach in relation to this order.  It was this order (which did not have a time limit) that she was in breach of, as the order of 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> October was not served on her until 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> October.

The order is on page three of the order and is followed by a penal notice which starts with capital letters. The penal notices do not conform with Rule 37.2, and despite the applicant&#8217;s submissions I am not satisfied that no injustice is caused as a result, so cannot waive this procedural defect. Accordingly, I do not find the respondent in contempt of court in relation to these orders. </span></p>
