However, the couple has nothing but praise for the medical treatment they received, leading to the birth of a much-loved child.  The Trust, for its part, has explained what went wrong, done everything it can to remedy matters for this family, taken steps to improve its procedures, offered an unreserved apology, and agreed to pay the legal costs.</span></p>

In the nature of things, treatment may be provided in cycles, as happened here.  However, this does not mean that consent has in every case to be renewed before each individual treatment cycle, if the reality is that the couple are engaged in a continuous series of treatments to which their earlier consent is intended to apply.  This point was considered and explained by the President in Case U: see paragraph 19 of the judgment.  This is not to discourage renewal of consent, but what matters is that valid informed consent can be seen to apply to the treatment that is being provided.  So, on the facts, a single consent may well apply to a series of treatment cycles.  The existence of consent is a question of fact and it will all depend on the facts of the individual case.  </span></p>

It can be seen that the couple signed a mass of consent paperwork in the reasonable belief that the Trust was ensuring that the legal position of themselves and any child born to them was being secured.  However, the question is not what they were entitled to expect, but what the legal effect of their actions was. </span></p>

In 2005 and 2006 X explicitly confirmed in Y&#8217;s presence, as witnessed by a member of the clinic&#8217;s staff, that he would become the legal father.  There is then joint confirmation on no fewer than ten occasions between 2005 and 2011 (six of which related to the treatment with donor embryos after September 2009) that </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I stand back and consider whether, as the statute requires, X gave written notice that he consented to being treated as the father of any resulting child and whether Y gave notice that she too consented to that.  Having done so, my conclusion is that these conditions are satisfied in this case.  Whether the treatment is considered to have begun in 2006 or 2009, the whole tone was set by the consents signed by X in the presence of Y and the clinic in 2005 and 2006 to his becoming the legal father of any resulting child.  Thereafter, at each stage of the treatment, the couple gave signed, written notice to the clinic evidencing their consent to X becoming the child&#8217;s father.  The fact that the forms do not contain the wording that is to be found in in Forms WP and PP is no more than a reflection of administrative incompetence on the part of the Trust.  What matters is the substance and total effect of the documents, which clearly express the intention of the couple to be treated as full and equal legal parents.  Had they been asked at the time what they were doing in signing these documents, they would have said that they were doing what was necessary to achieve this parenthood.  Had the clinic been asked what the couple was doing in signing these documents, it would have agreed.  The difficulty here only arose because the clinic failed to give the couple the recommended tools for the job, but I find that the couple still managed to get the job done with the tools that they were given.</span></p>

It is an outcome that conforms with the twin pillars of the legislation &#8211; informed consent and child welfare.</span></p>
