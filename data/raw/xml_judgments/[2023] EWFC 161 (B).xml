Following discussion with the parties (and after establishing that H had no intention to re-instruct a lawyer &#8211; he told me he could not afford to do so - and that he was not inviting the court to adjourn the hearing other than for a short period to enable him to prepare questions of W) I made participation directions that prevented H from directly cross-examining W and I gave him time to prepare written questions with a view to commencing W&#8217;s evidence at 2pm on the basis that those questions would then be asked through me. This course of action was agreed by both parties. </span></p>

I therefore adjourned the case overnight to give H the remainder of the day to work on them. I was then able to utilise that time to read the core bundle and a selection of documents from the disclosure bundle that had been signposted to me, but inevitably this derailed the (already tight) time estimate.</span></p>

It is regretful that they have not been able to compromise these proceedings and that they have each incurred significant legal fees liabilities as a result.

She has been funding her representation through an expensive commercial litigation loan. H has also incurred legal fees during the times he has been represented (although he has not filed updated evidence of the total amount incurred). What is clear, is H had spent some &#163;48,000 by the time of the FDR in May 2023 and still has at least &#163;32,000 outstanding.

She invites the court to &#8216;add back&#8217; these losses to H&#8217;s side of the balance sheet (the figure sought by W started at &#163;406,820 but then reduced by &#163;60,000 following the oral evidence as W now accepts that &#163;60,000 deposited into the account in 2020 came from C, the company of which H is a director and shareholder) on the basis that H&#8217;s actions in gambling and losing this money were reckless and have significantly reduced the value of the &#8216;pot&#8217; available for division between the parties and that it would be inequitable to disregard this conduct. </span></p>

Ultimately, a property is worth what someone is prepared to pay for it, and I accept he has drawn on his lengthy experience as a chartered surveyor to provide what he considers to be a fair value for each of the properties, about which it is inevitable there will always be an element of subjectivity and uncertainty.</span></p>

On the other hand, he acknowledged that the property is in a commercial unit which is unusual and would not be (in my words) everyone&#8217;s cup of tea. He also felt that the current presentation might put some buyers off, but he also did not think it would cost a significant sum to undertake any necessary cosmetic improvements. He said there are flats on the market in the same block and in the same post code (of a comparable size and nature) with asking prices in excess of &#163;400,000.</span></p>

Whilst I acknowledge W&#8217;s concern about H having involvement with this money because of my findings about his reckless behaviour in the context of the spread betting account, I consider her concerns are adequately dealt with by the use of a formal trust structure and the requirement of two signatories (W and H) to remove any money from the trust bank account. I do not consider it in the best interests of the children (whose welfare is my first consideration) for there to be a framework whereby H is cut out of any financial responsibility for the payment of school fees due to the risk that this may create an impression in the minds of the children that H does not contribute to their school fees or is not involved to the same extent as their mother.  </span></p>
