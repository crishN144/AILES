Additional investigations with brain imaging may allow us to differentiate between these different causes of dementia, but it will be a chronic disorder that will have a tendency to slowly get worse over time, even with treatment, with the potential to further compromise his ability to make decisions.</p>

As illustrated above, he fails on elements of understanding, as well as retaining, as well as weighing in the balance various bits of information. There is an added element of being incongruently unconcerned and laid back about the situation, which means that he will be suggestible with a tendency to agree with the person who he is talking to at the time.&#8221;</p>

For example, it is now essential, and clearly in PL&#8217;s best interests, that a stair-lift is installed, but any discussion of this will inevitably lead to a disagreement. In his witness statement VL expressed the following opinion on a joint appointment:</p>

[My sisters] have already shown that they are not in the slightest bit interested or concerned with my father&#8217;s welfare. They are interested in his money. They have already shown no inclination to agree that essential payments be made for his wellbeing and, if they were made joint deputies, I fully expect that they would stand in the way of such essential payment. A good example is the shower. If I had had to obtain their consent before spending my father&#8217;s money on this installation, I very much doubt that such consent would be forthcoming. However, the shower is absolutely essential for my father&#8217;s health, wellbeing and his own peace of mind. Another good example is the car. My father would simply not be able to attend essential GP and hospital appointments without it.&#8221;</p>

Therefore, there will be no tax or NICs consequences on such payments made for caring duties. Similarly where payments emanate out of a trust fund set up for this purpose there is unlikely to be an enforceable contract, therefore, there should be no question of tax being assessable as employment income or of a liability for Class 1 NICs.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in">Caring activity under these circumstances would not amount to gainful employment so there will be no liability for Class 2 NICs. The services provided are unlikely to be regarded as commercial in nature or amount to valuable consideration so there will not be a charge to tax on trade profits or on income not otherwise charged to tax.&#8221; </p>
