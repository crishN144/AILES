	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.5in">Acutely aware of the considerable delay that has taken place in determining this application, along with the attendant costs, the F realistically seeks today an order for reasonable direct contact with H along with various orders in respect of parental responsibility and recitals to assist in the implementation of that contact, notwithstanding that the mother has plainly intentionally and successfully sought to avoid any participation in these proceedings, has repeatedly avoided service initiated by all manner of different mechanisms, and has effectively frustrated contact since her wrongful retention of H in Spain in August 2006.&#160; The last time the F saw H was for one hour in June 2007. Further delay in granting the orders which F seeks is likely to be regarded as inimical to H&#8217;s best interests.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.5in">To maximise the F&#8217;s ability to successfully participate in contact with H in Spain in the near future, this court has decided to give a detailed judgment which sets out what it intends to do but does not finalise matters for the purposes of Article 10 (b) (iv) so that further use can be made of international judicial cooperation before jurisdiction is ceded to Spain. Given the response of the Spanish Liaison Judge, there may well be advantages at this stage in this approach.&#160; The judgment is to be translated and communicated without delay to the Spanish Central Authority and the Spanish Liaison Judge and also to the last known address and e-mail address of the M and her Spanish lawyers. </p>

Shortly after that refusal, the mother applied in this country pursuant to Article 11 of Brussels II Revised for the court to consider the question of the custody of the child and for consideration of whether the court should order the return of the child forthwith.&#160; Having considered the matter on a broader welfare basis and the welfare checklist set out at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (see paras [95] &#8211; [96]), and having heard oral evidence from the mother, her new husband, the mother&#8217;s younger sister, the maternal grandmother, Singer J. ordered that the child should live with his mother, that he should be returned to this country to achieve that end, that the child be made a ward of court, and that the &#8220;judgment&#8221; was to be enforceable forthwith in accordance with Article 42 (1) of Brussels II Revised.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>

When the child was 2 months old, the mother and the child went to France to visit her family.&#160; When she returned from France in August 2005, without, it seems, the child, she told the father that she wished to end the marriage.&#160; She proposed that the father should see the child for fortnightly supervised contact in France. In September 2005, the M initiated divorce proceedings in the Tribunal de Grande Instance at Vannes in France.&#160; In October 2005, the father initiated Hague Convention 1980 proceedings.&#160; The final hearing of those proceedings was heard in July 2006 when the French court refused the child&#8217;s return on the basis of Article 13 (b).&#160; On 18th October 2006, the F initiated proceedings in the Principal Registry seeking an Article 11 (7) examination of the child&#8217;s custody, and seeking a residence order and a specific issue order. On 14, 15 and 28th June 2007, Singer J heard evidence from the mother, the father and the children&#8217;s Guardian and heard submissions and he handed down judgment on 24th August 2007. It is plain that there was accordingly considerable delay between the F first seeking a return to the UK by virtue of the Hague Convention and Singer J&#8217;s final determination of the Article 11 (7) point.&#160; That said, on the facts of that case, Singer J found that he could indeed make orders as to contact on the basis that even if he were not to order the child&#8217;s return to England, the court&#8217;s jurisdiction remained validly seized: see, importantly, paras [87] &#8211; [94].&#160;&#160; </p>
