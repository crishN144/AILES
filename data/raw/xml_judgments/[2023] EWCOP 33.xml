	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As a consequence Mr Allen submits first, medical treatment is broadly defined but in relation to mental disorder it must have the purpose of alleviating or preventing a worsening of the disorder or one or more of its symptoms or manifestations. It requires the purpose of the treatment to be to alleviate or prevent a worsening. Chapters 23 and 24 of the MHA Code provide further explanation which, he says, supports his submission. Second, treatment for mental disorder is not limited to treating an &#8216;underlying&#8217; or &#8216;core&#8217; mental disorder. It includes addressing its manifestations, as summarised by Charles J in <span style="font-style:italic">GJ</span> in [52], demonstrating the breadth of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref> and its purpose insofar as medical treatment for mental disorder is concerned. Examples from previous cases illustrate the point, such as feeding was considered treatment for autism, dialysis was treatment for personality disorder and why treating wounds self-inflicted as a result of mental disorder also falls within the definition.</p>

This breadth is reflected in both the DoLS Code (at paragraph 4.46) and the MHA Code (at paragraph 13.51).

When a party, usually a hospital Trust, applies to the Court of Protection for authorisation to deprive liberty it will need to convince the judge that P is not ineligible. Evidence of the reasoning of the MHA decision-maker should be provided as part of the evidence in support of the application.

The Nuffield Family Justice Observatory has published research analysing data regarding applications under the inherent jurisdiction seeking orders that authorise deprivation of liberty relating to children. The latest data reveals that there are about 117 new applications per month, 60% relate to children who are 15 years and over, about 70 children a month within that age range.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

He had evidence from the registered nurse that confirmed she was medically fit for discharge on 10 January 2023. The statement detailed evidence of what nursing was being provided to JS, that she continues to self-harm, wishes to end her life and the detailed incidents that had taken place since the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s2</ref> lapsed, including seeking to swallow a plastic cup and trying to self-ligature with a shower cord.

Her rigid thinking prevents her from considering other options&#8230;these therefore manifest in agitation and self-harm. She isn&#8217;t able to identify triggers and cannot remember incidents of severe agitation. She is impulsive. All this makes her behaviour unpredictable. When she is in an agitated state she isn&#8217;t able to think and consider the risks that her actions pose. She is not able to appraise her arousal and control herself and this therefore has required that restrictions are placed to maintain her safety in hospital&#8217;.</span> This evidence is all connected to JS&#8217;s mental disorder. In the letter from the Trust to the social worker on 26 January 2023, it sets out how the risks relate to her neuro-developmental difficulties, again confirming that it is her mental disorder that gives rise to these risks and why the hospital needed to put in place the care plan. </p>

Patients who have been detained under the MHA (like [JS]) can theoretically be discharged into the community with a suitable package of care, but only when that package is actually available. Many weeks or months can be spent putting such packages together (funding, placement, support etc) and in place. During which time patients remain detained. The whole <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/117" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 117</ref> process is designed to speed that up so as to ensure detained patients get out and stay out of hospital. Of course, because [JS] was never detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 3</ref> of the MHA, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/117" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 117</ref> aftercare was not available to her.</span></p>

This is an invalid argument which contains two fallacies. First, she was detained by her care plan which I have summarised above. What jurisdictional label is placed on the care plan is immaterial to its restrictive nature, whether that be MHA, MCA, &#8220;common law&#8221;, the High Court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction is irrelevant to whether she was detained for treatment. That was the care plan&#8217;s doing.</span></p>

Good clinical practice and the operation of Article 5 of the European Convention requires a patient to be detained only for so long as is necessary. The MHA does not prolong detention. In fact, as I have already said, proper use of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/117" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 117</ref> should reduce the overall time a patient spends in Hospital because professionals inside and out of Hospital concerned with health and social care should all work together to put together an effective discharge plan speedily.</span></p>

Ideally, a 17-year-old vulnerable young person would not be detained in a psychiatric facility, let alone a mixed adult general ward. However, where there is literally no option in which that young person will be safe, or as safe as possible in the circumstances, I cannot see how the MHA decision maker can avoid the decision I have had to make in this judgment. If the patient has to be detained for treatment for their mental disorder, and there is no alternative outside the hospital setting, and no other treatment plan available, then it seems clear to me the patient should not be detained under the MCA but rather under the MHA.</span></p>

They are set out below. Ms Kelly takes issue with what Ms Mulholland stated was one of the issues that caused the stalemate in this case, that the Trust did not have any approved mental health professionals (&#8216;AMHPs&#8217;) to proceed with any application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>.
