It is very important that he should seek to deal with the case in ways proportionate to the financial position of the parties. It is very important, more so today than it was when these rules were drafted, that he should allot to each case an appropriate share of the court's resources, taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases. In his general duty of case management he is required to identify the issues at an early date and particularly to regulate the extent of the disclosure of documents and expert evidence so that they are proportionate to the issues in question.</p>

In my view, this case cried out for such an order. The issues which were fought and lost by Mr&#160;Kotonou included issues which, in the judge's view, should never have been raised at all: including issues on which the allegation of representation was dismissed on the basis that the representation had simply not been made. I would have been surprised if a judge, hearing a trial of this nature, had not reached a conclusion that this was an appropriate case for an issue based order. At the least, it is impossible to hold that this judge's conclusion that that was the correct approach was flawed in principle. </p>

Paragraph (6)(f), as I have indicated, is the power to make an issue-based costs order. Paragraph (6)(a) enables the court to make an order that one party pay a proportion of another party's costs. It is unnecessary I think to refer to paragraph (6)(c) in detail. The thinking behind rules (6)(f) and (7) is not difficult to understand. Separate assessments of the costs relating to individual issues are likely to be complex and expensive: difficult to carry out in circumstances in which there are common factors which spread over a number of issues. How should the costs of those common elements be apportioned between the separate issues? A more convenient method, while keeping in mind the issue based approach, is to assess all the costs together and then apply a proportion which reflects the fact that one party has won on some issues and has lost on the other issues. That is what the Costs Rules require. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[23]At paragraph&#160;21 of his judgment this judge recognised that it would be difficult accurately to identify the separate costs occasioned by the separate issues. That is exactly the sort of case which the rule making body had in mind when it provided in paragraph (7) that, if practicable, the court must make an order under paragraph&#160;(6)(a). The judge indicated, in the first two sentences of paragraph&#160;22 of his judgment, that he had decided to make a split order -- which in context meant an issue-based order as appeared from the last sentence of paragraph&#160;20 -- but, to translate that split into simple percentages of the overall costs. That would obviate the need for a detailed assessment of the separate costs of each issue. That, as it seems to me, is not only a proper approach: it is the approach which is positively required by the Rules. </p>

The effect on the timely preparation of the case was evidenced by the fact that, as W went into the witness box the only budget available to H&#8217;s team was the inflated budget annexed to her Form E devised by W &#8216;in revenge&#8217; and again by the fact that on the first day of the trial, although the report of Mr G had been disclosed to H (albeit very late), W had to make an application under <span style="font-style:italic">Daniels v Walker</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 WLR 1382" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 WLR 1382</ref> for introduction of the same into the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Kotonou </span>the Court of Appeal approved an approach which translated the split of costs between issues into a simple percentage of the overall costs. Such an approach obviated the need for a detailed assessment of the separate costs of each issue. This approach did, as was noted by Chadwick LJ, still necessitate an assessment of the totality of the costs. In this case that would be expensive and time consuming requiring a detailed assessment of H&#8217;s costs before the relevant percentage could be applied. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have decided that this is a case where the court should properly make an issue based order for costs.  Mr. Marks ambitiously submitted that the proper order in such an event is one whereby W has to pay 50% of H&#8217;s costs. I bear in mind that this was a case where there had been very few interlocutory hearings, so an unusually high proportion of the costs relate to trial preparation.  However, an order that W pays 50% of H&#8217;s costs would not in my judgment adequately acknowledge: </p>

In order to avoid the expense and delay of detailed assessment I intend to make an order pursuant to CPR rule 44.3(7) and CPR rule 44.3(6) (b) that W pays costs to H of a stated amount, namely a rounded down figure of  &#163;175,000.</p>
