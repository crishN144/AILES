I will call him George.  He lives with his mother, Mrs R, who is aged 29, and his 15-year-old half sister J.  The mother and J are Thai nationals who have lived in this country since 2005/6, and George was born here.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The events leading to the proceedings arise in large part from deceptions carried out by the mother towards two men.  The first is her husband, Mr R, who is a British citizen aged 70.  The second is the biological father of George, Mr S, a Swedish citizen aged 54.  In brief, having married and achieved economic security with Mr R, the mother renewed an association with Mr S as a result of which she became pregnant.  Before George's birth, she set out to persuade both men that Mr R was the child's father, and for the first 2&#190; years of George's life, he was brought up as if this was the case.  At that point, the mother left, taking the two children, and Mr R&#8217;s part in George's life has been very limited ever since.  In the meantime, the mother's relationship with Mr S has been rekindled, and they now apparently intend to marry once the mother is free to do so.</span></p>

In approaching those issues, I am bound to make George's welfare my paramount concern.  I also bear in mind the rights of the adults under Article 8 ECHR for respect for their family life, although these must take second place where they conflict with George's welfare.</span></p>

Having created a new family relatively late in life, and having treated George as his child and become very attached to him, he has been left bereft.  However, the court can only be guided by what is best for George, however great its sympathy for Mr R&#8217;s position.</span></p>

He was married between 1964 and 1972 and has two daughters and four grandchildren, none of whom he has any significant contact with.  He has for 30 years lived in a detached house in Chislehurst.  In 2000 he went on a Saga holiday to Thailand, fell in love with the country, and returned.  In 2002, he met and began a relationship with the mother, who was then 19 or 20 years old.  At the age of 14, she had given birth to J, who was only six years old when Mr R came on the scene.  J was being looked after elsewhere in the country by the mother's own mother.  It is clear that the mother was living in relatively impoverished circumstances, and that her contacts with relatively well-off Europeans were of importance to her.  </span></p>

At around the same time, Mr R bought a house in Thailand, which he put into the mother's name.  He explains that he did this to provide her with security in the event of his death, raising the capital by taking a mortgage on his own home for which he continues to make substantial repayments.  After the marriage, Mr R returned to England to make preparations for the mother's arrival.</span></p>

That relationship had subsided, but it seems to have begun again after Mr R left for England, and Mr S and the mother kept in touch with each other thereafter.  The mother did not tell Mr S that she was married.</span></p>

However, in January 2006, she met and had sexual intercourse with Mr S and she became pregnant with George.  When she was three months pregnant, she informed Mr S of her marriage, but said that he was not the father, something that he was unwilling to accept.  When she was six months pregnant, she also told Mr R of the possibility, which she put at 5%, that he might not be the father, thereby disclosing the existence of another man.  She expected Mr R to end their relationship, but he did not do so.  He suggested that a DNA test be taken before the birth of the baby, but this was regarded as risky and was not pursued.  In July 2006, J came over from Thailand to join the family, and George was born in October 2006.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The mother appears at that time to have taken the decision to turn her back on Mr S and throw in her lot with Mr R, who she says she still loved.  She refused to communicate with Mr S, who responded by sending an e-mail to Mr R in January 2007 identifying himself.  Nevertheless, the mother and Mr R continued to bring up the two children together until the middle of 2009.  The mother learned some English.  She communicated with Mr R in English and with the children in Thai and English.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The reasons why the relationship between the mother and Mr R broke down are not of central importance to the issues that have to be decided, but I make these limited observations.  It is undoubtedly the case that the mother's infidelity created a huge fault line through the relationship, cracking the foundations that Mr R had created.  It is also clear that she is capable of being untruthful when she considers it necessary.  On the other hand, I accept that she felt extremely guilty about her behaviour, and I find it difficult to see her, as Mr R understandably does, as a calculating schemer.  She has been dependent on the goodwill of two older and much more experienced men and, in trying to make the most of her relatively disadvantaged position, has created a situation that neither of them has found comfortable.  In the brief evidence that she gave, she struck me as a gentle person who is genuinely sorry for what has happened.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">For his part, Mr R was undoubtedly committed to the marriage, and remains committed to George, but there are signs that support the mother's account of him as not always being easy to live with.  Even taking account of the indignation that he understandably feels at the mother's conduct, he comes across as someone who does not always find it easy to listen to other points of view.  In answer to a direct question from him, the mother described him as a good and bad husband, the bad being that he would not let her express herself.  She also rightly complains about incidents concerning J, the details of which are not in issue.  The first took place when George was a small baby.  Apparently J, who was only aged 11 or so, put him down on the table.  The father considered this dangerous and slapped J on the face.  By September 2008, J&#8217;s school was expressing concern that she seemed unhappy and withdrawn.  She complained that Mr R was hitting her, and the mother said that he was domineering and critical and undermining of their Thai culture.</span></p>

It seems that she was being difficult and a row broke out in which Mr R became concerned that she might cause a crash by grabbing the steering wheel, and slapped her in the face with the back of his hand.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">This incident appears to have been the catalyst for the separation.  On 3 August 2009, while the father was out, the mother left the family home with the children and went to a refuge.  Her departure was assisted by a local authority social worker.  Neither she nor the children have returned since, except for a brief visit a few days later when the mother returned to collect some belongings.  The mother and Mr R's next conversation took place on the first day of this hearing, when he cross-examined her through an interpreter.  There has been no contact between Mr R and J.  After a gap of six months without any contact between Mr R and George, there has since February 2010 been fortnightly contact for two hours at a contact centre.</span></p>

In October 2009 the mother undertook not to apply for a passport for George, Mr R was given permission to amend his application to include an application for contact, and a CAFCASS report was ordered on the question of prohibited steps, contact and residence.  Contact was ordered to take place for two hours on alternate weeks at a contact centre as soon as possible, with Mr R to make the necessary arrangements.  In the same month, he applied for a residence order.</span></p>

She was the supervisor of the author of the previous report.  She observed two occasions of contact, one in March and one in April.  On both occasions, she felt that the interaction between George and Mr R was very positive and that George appeared very relaxed and comfortable.  He enjoyed Mr R's company, and Mr R was patient and child focused.  He referred to Mr R as "daddy" but also referred to Mr S in that way.  Mrs O felt that George was happy with the routine and that there had been a clear progression in terms of quality of contact compared to a year ago.  This was corroborated by the staff of the contact centre, whose only concern was that Mr R tended to ask George a lot of questions about his life at home.  The recommendation of the report is that there are no concerns about Mr R's ability to meet George's basic care needs and that it would be appropriate for there be contact outside the contact centre.  Any extension to staying contact could not be recommended until the outcome of the relocation application is known.</span></p>

She saw no basis for a change of residence.  It would be very difficult for George, who has been cared for by his mother all his life and in her sole care for half his life.  As to contact, she saw it as quite a complex question.  It is now regular, consistent and going well.  It would be in George's best interests to allow it to take place outside the contact centre with broader activities.  She recommended moving forward with some caution given the uncertainties about the future.  She would recommend maintaining the current frequency but extending the periods to 3 hours to start with, and then to a possible five hours.  She would not be troubled by the absence of a third party, and could see some advantages in contact taking place at Mr R's home.  She did not support staying contact while the situation remains uncertain.  George was brought up with Mr R as his father.  There is a close relationship and he offers continuity.  She believes that George sees himself as having two daddies, which is not unusual.  He will face a period of adjustment.  Contact should continue even if Mr R is not granted parental responsibility.  Its purpose is to maintain Mr R as a father figure or a significant person.  Maybe as matters progress, Mr R will become less of a father figure but still be important to George.  George will decide what he makes of it.  Mrs O said "the main thing is there is some form of attachment".</span></p>

Mr R was somewhat indignant about this, pointing to evident ability on the part of the mother to speak and write in English.  It was nevertheless not unreasonable for her to want to give evidence in her first language in relation to such important matters.  In essence, she said that she felt guilty about her behaviour and apologised to Mr R.  She was prepared to keep him informed about George's progress, even though this had not happened since the separation, but she did not feel happy about him having parental responsibility.  George has been at nursery for a year and a half and would start school in September.  They have been in their current address for about a year.  She largely accepted the contact proposals made by Mrs O, although she would prefer a three-hour period and asks for any change to be phased in quite slowly.  As to a move abroad, she has never been to Sweden and would like to go there in August to reconnoitre, leaving George in the care of a friend.  She said that Mr S is a divorced man and that she has told him everything about her situation and that of her children.</span></p>

He accepts that Mr S is George's father, but is very concerned about his own name disappearing from George's birth certificate.  He does not like the idea of George losing his legitimacy.  He would like to have parental responsibility in order to have the right to have a say in all important decisions about George's upbringing, but if the court only ordered that he should have information, he would have to accept it.  So that documents did not have to be edited, he would be willing to agree not to go to the mother's address or to George's school if he is provided with that information.  He points out that he has not had any information thus far.  For him, the issue of residence is the most important one.  He points to his own stability, the suitability of his home and the availability of good local schools.  Because he is not going anywhere, he is able to offer a predictable future for George.  He can look after George full-time with no other distractions.  He is in good health and has made contingency plans for care by a nephew, his sister's son.  He would support contact with George's mother.  He is very concerned about the prospect of George leaving this country, and the effect on him and on J of moving to Sweden where they do not know the language.  He described the situation that would exist if George was allowed to leave as "a black hole" where no further control could be exercised by this court.  He regards the mother's future plans with Mr S with great suspicion.  He is also concerned about George's mind being poisoned against him by the mother.  In relation to contact, he did not speak strongly against Mrs O&#8217;s recommendation, but would like some staying contact, for example when the mother goes to Sweden in August.  He is amenable to agreeing a way in which he and the mother can now be divorced.</span></p>

I will direct that contact continue on alternate Saturdays, the next being 24 June, and that the W Centre shall be the venue for George to be dropped off and collected by the mother.  The next two occasions of contact shall last for three hours, with the first hour and the last half-hour being spent within the Centre.  The next four occasions of contact shall last for three hours, all to be spent outside the centre if Mr R wishes.  Thereafter, contact shall last for five hours, all to be spent outside the centre and to include short visits to Mr R's home, if he wishes.</span></p>

I quite understand Mr R's feeling about this, which includes concerns about the proposed carer during the mother's absence, but I do not think that it is in George's interests to embark upon staying contact at such a time of uncertainty.  That question is better considered when the mother's proposals are known.</span></p>

Although it was a poorly prepared application, it undoubtedly caused great anxiety to Mr R.  Now, the whole situation has changed again.  The mother may wish to seek permission to move to Sweden.  If so, she will have to present a coherent application.  Because there will be a contact order in force, it will be appropriate for Mr R to remain a respondent to that application, even though he will not have parental responsibility.  I make no assumptions about what the outcome of that application will be.  It is an application which need not be heard in the High Court.</span></p>

I shall direct that if the mother seeks to pursue her application in so far as it relates to a move to Sweden, she shall lodge an amended form of application no later than 7 November 2011 in the County Court.  When making the application, she shall set out in outline the proposals that the mother is making for George's accommodation, education and healthcare, and the role that Mr S will play, and her proposals for contact between George and Mr R.  I invite that court to consider requesting CAFCASS to allocate any further work on the case to Mrs O, who is respected by the parties and has a good understanding of George&#8217;s situation.  </span></p>
