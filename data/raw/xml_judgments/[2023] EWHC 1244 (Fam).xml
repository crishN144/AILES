Very soon she was caught up in what she genuinely perceived was an &#8216;horrendous&#8217; (her word) situation in which professionals were actively validating her concerns, and advising her to protect her daughter from abuse.&#8221;</p>

This was assessed at c.&#163;76,000.  Francis J gave the mother 24 months to pay (payment is therefore due by 18 January 2024) and directed that no interest was to accrue on the award in that period. After the delivery of the costs&#8217; order and judgment, the mother contacted Francis J (by e-mail to his clerk) on 21 February 2022 in these terms:</p>

I have no available resources in order to meet this costs award to the father, this whole case has cost me, including the costs award, in excess of &#163;200,000.  My lifesavings have gone and I am in debt from the ongoing proceedings, all funds which have been allocated to the ongoing proceedings.  Following your costs award made to the [father], I simply cannot afford to pay this sum of money in its entirety and after discussing the options available to me, I am left with the dire potential outcome of having to pursue bankruptcy if I cannot raise the funds&#8221;.</p>

Then, on 17 January 2023, the mother applied for an order that the costs order be rescinded or substantially varied.  She initially purported to bring the application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>F(6) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> (&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>&#8217;); it is now accepted by counsel and by the mother herself that the statutory basis on which her application was originally based was erroneous given that the costs order had been made in the High Court exercising its appellate jurisdiction in relation to a private law matter.  The hearing proceeded before me on the basis that the court could exercise its power under rule 4.1(6) of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (&#8216;FPR 2010&#8217;) to &#8220;vary or revoke&#8221; this costs order if it was considered appropriate.  </p>

Counsel appeared <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span>, and I am immensely grateful to them for their generosity in this respect.  At the end of the oral argument, I invited further submissions on whether I could make an order that the costs order not be enforced without leave of the court &#8211; a relatively commonplace order where the party against whom a costs order is made is publicly funded (not the situation here).   Both counsel supplied me with further written submissions.  I reserved judgment. </p>

Nor was/is there any funding available within the local authority to facilitate this. The current programme of therapy was sourced following an extensive search by the Children&#8217;s Guardian and the mother.  A therapeutic package is being offered privately and is now in place.  The total cost of this package is about &#163;2,500, which I have directed is to be split equally between the parties, with the father&#8217;s share being paid by the mother and deducted from the order for costs against her.  At the moment, the mother has settled invoices of c.&#163;650.</p>

D is a party to these proceedings and has a Children&#8217;s Guardian who has, unusually, not yet met her; D is reluctant to make this engagement but is at least now aware of these court proceedings.   D has communicated to her therapist that at present she does not wish to have any contact, indirect or otherwise, with the father. D's views are reported to be clear and unequivocal.</p>

In the alternative the mother seeks an order that the costs order be varied by reducing the sum awarded to the father. In the further alternative, the mother seeks an order preventing the father from enforcing the order for costs without permission of the court, together with a direction that interest shall not be payable on the amount awarded to the father.</p>

Moreover, the mother is rendered anxious and stressed by the costs order; this is having an impact on her life and her care of D, and accordingly on D&#8217;s wellbeing, and will continue to do so.  &#8220;It cannot be in D&#8217;s interests for anything to imperil the mother&#8217;s and the maternal family&#8217;s equilibrium prior to and during engagement in the therapy. The intolerable burden of the present costs order does precisely that&#8230; the mother must be in a position where she can engage freely with the therapeutic process without fear of the possibility that the costs will cause it to end prematurely, which of course would be to the detriment of the most important person in this process, D.&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

		</authorialNote>.  The father&#8217;s case is that the mother had made clear in her original submission to Francis J on the determination of the costs issue that she was financially destitute; when making the order for costs, Francis J was well aware of this.  The father maintains that the mother&#8217;s financial circumstances have not materially changed since that order so as to justify its variation or revocation.  The cost of living crisis has not fallen on the mother alone; the father is also similarly affected, and he will of course be affected by any variation or revocation of the earlier order.  </p>

My finishing point is that the father incurred the fees that he did because he had been wronged and he was required to prove it. There were steps that the mother could have taken to reduce the costs. Once I had given permission to appeal, the mother could have accepted that the earlier hearing was flawed, but instead she went to the Court of Appeal and tried to overturn my decision. She then put the family through a long and agonising further fact-finding hearing before Cobb J. She contested the appeal in the face of powerful submissions by the Guardian. She instructed her counsel to take every minute point in front of me in relation to the appeal and the application for relief from sanctions, in spite of the fact that I repeatedly suggested that the detailed facts were not the issue at the appeal hearing&#8221; (&#167;29);</p>

The trial court is likely to be in a better position than this court to assess the true significance of the further evidence, its advantage being all the greater if the findings are relatively recent, and if the matter can be considered by the judge who made them, as should always be the case if possible. Another reason for preferring an application to an appeal is that it is likely to be dealt with more quickly and at less expense. There will, however, be circumstances in which a return to the trial court will not be appropriate. That will certainly be the case where the applicant is alleging an error by the trial judge, regardless of the further evidence. Judges cannot hear appeals from themselves.&#8221;</p>

But given the mother&#8217;s deep dissatisfaction with the original order, it seems to me that she could or should have challenged it at the time by way of an application for permission to appeal, rather than &#8211; as she has done &#8211; by seeking its variation or revocation a year later.  The mother should not interpret these comments as encouraging of any appeal; far from it.  Consideration of the merits of an appeal (particularly one which would be now so far out of time) has for obvious reasons not been argued before me and is not within the scope of this judgment.  In this regard it is worth noting that:</p>

I regard it as entirely proper to draw on the caselaw which has considered rule 3.1(7) CPR, where judges have reached that specific conclusion, although I accept that the circumstances in which the power can be used in relation to a final order is likely to be limited; a discrete, self-contained order such as a costs order is one good example.

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-style:italic">Financial inability to pay</span>:  Although when Francis J considered the arguments on the costs issue he did not apparently have detailed financial statements or disclosure from the parties, I am satisfied nonetheless that he was well aware of the state of the parents&#8217; respective finances in at least general terms.  For instance, (as I have mentioned above &#8211; see &#167;47(ii)) he referred to the &#8220;financial calamity&#8221; which had befallen the parties as a result of the proceedings (see &#167;19(ii) above), and the fact that neither the mother nor the father could &#8220;bear the burden of the costs&#8230; incurred&#8221; (see &#167;19(viii) above); he further referred to the relative poverty of both parents (&#167;19(vi) above)).  Specifically, Francis J addressed the fact that neither the mother nor her husband &#8220;have any savings, that they now have outstanding loans to both of their parents and are &#8220;over leveraged against our home&#8221;&#8221; (&#167;19(v) and that &#8220;neither of these parents could afford the fees that they have incurred&#8221; (ibid.).  It seems clear to me that Francis J was well aware that the mother was financially in an extremely vulnerable position, and he did not identify means by which she would be able to satisfy the costs order.  While the mother&#8217;s financial situation may have deteriorated over the last 15 months, I cannot find that this constitutes a change in circumstance which is materially different from the position which she presented to Francis J.  The mother has had to commit in part at least to the cost of the therapy, but this is &#163;650-700 so far and is not so significant a sum as to warrant a conclusion that there has been a material change in circumstances;</p>

However, </span>I am not satisfied that the rise in the cost of living between the date of the order and the date of the mother&#8217;s application constitutes a material change in circumstances; insofar as it is a change, it of course affects <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> parties who are now relatively worse-off;</p>

However, this is not in itself a material change.  In March 2021 I found that the mother had experienced &#8220;life stresses&#8221; for a considerable period of time, including during the period in which D was making her allegations, and was continuing to do so.  Francis J was aware that I found the mother to be a &#8220;temperamental&#8221; and &#8220;emotional&#8221; woman.  I accept that the costs order may well have aggravated the mother&#8217;s stresses, however I do not accept that the imposition of the costs order has so materially increased those stresses that:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having found that no basis exists for a variation or revocation of the costs order on this application, it would evidently not be principled for me to &#8220;vary&#8221; it by suspending enforcement of it.  This was Mr Fox&#8217;s very much subsidiary argument, and I decline to make such an order.  As it happens, the question of enforcement does not in fact arise for another 8 months.  Whether the father seeks enforcement of the order at that time is a matter for him.  He will by then be entitled to receive from the mother a very substantial sum of money to assist him to defray his own enormous bill of costs in pursuing his appeal.  I am conscious that he has lost financially to a significant degree through this litigation.  More importantly, and very sadly, he has to all intents and purposes lost a relationship with his daughter.  But if he considers that enforcement of this order will indeed have &#8220;devastating consequences&#8221; for the mother and her family, including D, I imagine that he may well find himself pausing before doing so. </p>
