On 2 October 2019, following receipt of the transcript of judgment and amended Grounds of appeal and a skeleton argument I gave directions that the application for permission to appeal be listed for an oral hearing with appeal to follow immediately if permission was granted. I gave detailed directions for the preparation of the appeal. On 16 October 2019 following liaison between counsel&#8217;s clerks and the clerk of the rules the appeal was listed for hearing before me on 25 February 2020. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Today, 25 February 2020 I heard the application for permission to appeal. After hearing submissions from Mr Wilkinson for the proposed appellant (&#8216;the local authority&#8217;) and Mr Butterfield counsel for the proposed first respondent mother (&#8216;the mother&#8217;) I gave the parties my decision to refuse permission to appeal with short reasons and confirmed that a short written judgment would follow. This is that judgment. I am not giving permission to cite this decision because I did not hear full argument in respect of the legal issues raised having regard to the stance that the local authority took before HHJ Bush in respect of the law and my view that it was not open to the local authority now to raise some of the arguments that Mr Wilkinson sought to pursue. I accept Mr Wilkinson&#8217;s point (agreed also by Mr Butterfield) that because there is no reported authority where a non-party cost order has been made against a local authority in respect of failures in relation to the provision of a section 7 report my judgment might if citable be relied upon in future as some sort of binding authority that section 7 reporters are by reason of that status alone within the reach of a non-party costs order. This is judgment is NOT authority for any such proposition.  Because of the facts involved in this appeal full argument was not heard on the applicability of the non-party costs regime in respect </p>

The local authority had previous involvement with the family, the child was apparently on a child in need plan and so it was felt that the local authority rather than Cafcass was the more appropriate provider of such a report. The local authority did not object to the order but they did in due course write to the court asking for an extension of time to file the report. This was granted and the listed dispute resolution appointment was put back. </p>

Directions were given for a final hearing listed for three days before HHJ Bush on 30 and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July and 3 August. This hearing was accommodated because the mother wished to travel to Canada over the summer vacation and temporary leave to remove was sought. The orders made up to and including 19 June clearly contemplate a rolled up hearing in which both factfinding and welfare issues would be determined. Unfortunately shortly after this hearing Ms X fell ill.  </p>

The court was informed that Ms X was ill and was likely to be off work until at least September. The order records that the father had been told that Ms X was ill on the preceding Friday, 27 June. The mother informed the court that she had not been told that Ms X was ill until she arrived at court. Both of the parents indicated to the court that the sought an order that the local authority pay the wasted costs of that days hearing as a result of the local authority&#8217;s failure to inform the parties in good time that Ms X would not attend court. The final hearing was adjourned until 19 September. Further case management directions were given. These included a direction for the local authority to file an addendum section 7 report dealing with matters raised in recent contact reports relating to an alleged decline in the child&#8217;s behaviour and allegations of coaching. Provision was made for Ms X or her team manager Ms Y to give evidence at the adjourned final hearing along with the author of the addendum section 7 report. Provision was also made for the local authority to file a statement in relation to wasted costs by 28 August 2018 and they were joined to the proceedings solely for defending the application for a wasted costs order. They were directed to attend on the afternoon of the third day of the final hearing in order to deal with that application. </p>

Self-evidently this was late and Mr Butterfield told me it was not in fact filed until after 1 October. For reasons which are unclear this statement was not included in the bundle of documents provided to HHJ Bush at the hearing on 3 May 2019 and does not appear to have been provided to the local authority&#8217;s counsel as it is not referred to in his skeleton argument.  </p>

The section 7 report addressed the question of relocation in the briefest of terms and did not deal with critical aspects of welfare related to relocation. Nor did it deal with critical issues relating to the competing &#8216;live with&#8217; applications. Ms Y was clearly not prepared so as to be able to fill those gaps. Ms Z had been given a more discrete section 7 function and so her inability to answer questions relating to the relocation or the live with order is not surprising. </p>

That was to be heard at the conclusion of the adjourned final hearing on 19 December 2018. In fact that hearing was also ineffective because Cafcass were unable to allocate the case to the officer they had expected and so they were unable to prepare a report. The wasted costs application was adjourned. The order states that it was to be listed on 27 April 2019 but this appears to be a mistake as the final hearing was listed for five days from 29 April which would take the conclusion of the hearing to 3 May. </p>

The local authority instructed counsel who filed a skeleton. I directed that a transcript of that hearing be obtained and included within the appeal bundle. The local authority did not obtain it. Mr Wilkinson was unable to explain why. As a result I have been unable to supplement my understanding of what was said to the judge and what she herself said and thus I have to rely on the skeleton arguments and upon the judgment itself to identify the submissions that were made and how the judge responded to them. The transcript would of course form part of the penumbra.  The skeletons filed by the mother and father on the one hand and the local authority on the other were in broad terms in agreement as to the relevant test to be applied in determining a non-party costs order. Both referred to the leading cases within the civil sphere and to the decision of Mr Justice Cobb in HB-v-PB otherwise known as Re OB (private law proceedings: costs) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] 1 FLR 92" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] 1 FLR 92</ref>.

I do not think that Cobb J was referring to Re T in that sense but rather in rejecting an argument that hard pressed local authority resources should (as in most children cases) be a bar to a costs order. In the local authority&#8217;s skeleton argument the jurisdiction to make such an order was summarised by their counsel as </p>

She then set out from paragraphs 23 to 30 a consideration of the law. That was plainly drawn from the skeleton arguments of the local authority and the parents. It is a somewhat fuller summary than was included within the local authority&#8217;s skeleton. In paragraph 30 of the judgment she draws the legal test and the facts together.

After some discussion he accepted that ground one which alleged procedural unfairness could not be pursued. It seems to me that this was inevitable. How the amended Grounds of appeal and skeleton came to be filed asserting that the local authority had not been given an opportunity to be heard on the application is beyond me.  In relation to the point that the court was led to believe that the local authority had not provided a statement it emerged that the local authority themselves had not referred the court to this statement and it was not referred to in their skeleton argument for the costs hearing. The assertion that the judgment erroneously refers to the mother having not been informed in advance of 30 July hearing was one which the judge was perfectly entitled to reach. It is clear that she had seen the statement of Ms Y (which the local authority assert she wrongly found had not been filed) because she refers to the content of it. The reference at paragraph 28 of the judgment to the local authority not having complied with the direction to file a statement is a reference to the fact that it was not filed by 28 August; it is dated 20 September.  The deployment by the local authority of points which are unfounded in fact causes one to question the reliability of other assertions. </p>

The further assertion that the father&#8217;s application for a psychological assessment would have prevented the final hearing was similarly misplaced. That application had been refused before and was not granted on this occasion. Finally the assertion that the local authority was not responsible for the decision to adjourn the final hearing is irrelevant. </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The local authority submit that the judge was wrong both in terms of her factual conclusions in relation to when the local authority notified the parties of Ms X&#8217;s unavailability and in her characterisation of that failure as reprehensible so as to warrant the making of a costs order. Mr Wilkinson argues that the judgment wrongly asserts that no one was told before the morning of 30 July that Ms X could not come and that the judge wrongly says that the section 7 report was filed 15 days late. The order records that the father had been told on the Friday, 27 July but the judgment itself concludes that the parties (or the father) was told one day (working) before the hearing. However the evidence of Miss Broadmeadow which was before the judge which asserts (without identifying how) that both the mother and the father were told on 27 July was not consistent with the statements filed by Ms Y (which was not in the trial bundle but had obviously been see by the judge) which only asserted that the father was informed by a reply to an email he had sent that day. Mr Wilkinson submitted that the local authority was unsure when Ms X would be in a position to resume work and that it was unfair to criticise them for only informing the parties on 27 July. Of course what is conspicuous in its absence from any of the evidence filed by the local authority was any attempt to inform the court of any difficulties with Ms X or any identification of what they knew in terms of Ms X being certified unfit.  Whilst I accept the point that one cannot predict how long an illness will last that hardly addresses the point of the local authority&#8217;s state of knowledge of how long a period Ms X was certified unfit to work which presumably was known to the local authority and which ought to have been passed on to the court. More importantly the evidence discloses no attempt to notify the court in advance of the issue of Ms X&#8217;s illness and her probable inability to attend which would have enabled the court to consider whether three days of court time ought to remain set aside for the case or whether the case should be adjourned or converted into a hearing of a temporary leave to remove application. Thus although Mr Wilkinson may be right in identifying a minor error in the judge&#8217;s recording of the facts relating to Ms X nonattendance on 30 July 2018 that has no bearing on the cause of the adjournment and the waste of costs that accompanied the ineffective hearing. Taken at its highest the local authority&#8217;s case is that both parties were notified in the course of the Friday that Ms X would not be available on the Monday. That communication even if correct was so late in the day that neither party could have taken any meaningful action in response. As the judgment makes clear HHJ Bush was particularly concerned that no steps had been taken to notify the court.  Mr Wilkinson submitted that the hearing would have been adjourned in any event and in this he relies on the direction for an addendum section 7 report. I do not accept that there is any merit in this. Had Ms X been available all the indications are that the hearing would have proceeded. The direction for an addendum </p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">section 7 report was an effect of the adjournment not a cause of it. The order of 30 July makes clear that the hearing was adjourned because of the absence of Ms X and that the court and the parties had been deprived of the opportunity to either vacate the hearing or converted into some other purpose by the failure of the local authority to provide proper notice of the problem. Mr Wilkinson&#8217;s submission that the awareness of the parties earlier in July that Ms X was ill (as recorded in the child in need meeting) or that the notification on 27 July was somehow adequate are without any merit. The first duty of an authority directed by a court to provide a section 7 report whose author is directed to attend a hearing is to the court and not to the parties; although a duty is also owed to the parties. The failure to notify the court in good time is inexcusable. I&#8217;m told that the local authority is one of the largest in the country and I have little doubt that the children services Department and the legal department are familiar with both the duty and the processes to update the court. Indeed the local authority did so in relation to seeking an extension of time for filing the report and so the failure to keep the court and the parties informed in good time of Ms X&#8217;s illness is inexplicable. Had this been the only default it is a matter of speculation as to whether HHJ Bush would have made a non-party costs order but regrettably it was not. </p>

He submits that they deal with the relocation issue albeit in brief terms. He also submitted that the criticism of Ms Y and Ms X for not having read (or fully read) the parties&#8217; statements prior to giving evidence or completion of the report should not be criticised. He submitted that it was the duty of the parties to provide witnesses such as Ms Y with the material and to ensure that they had read it. Whilst I accept that this would be well directed in relation to updating material it is utterly without foundation when one is referring to the substantive witness statements in support of the competing child arrangements applications. It is particularly hard for Mr Wilkinson to maintain the submission when the skeleton argument filed on behalf of the local authority contained the concessions (following the obtaining of the transcripts of their evidence) </p>

He submitted that it was inappropriate to criticise the practitioners&#8217; evidence in September, particularly bearing in mind they are social workers not Cafcass officers, when the defects were not identified either at the dispute resolution appointment or at the hearing on 30 July. Mr Butterfield responded that it is not unusual for defects in a section 7 report to be made good by exploration with the witness in oral evidence and that hindsight should not now be deployed to criticise the way the case was managed by the parties and the judge. Whilst I am prepared to accept that in an ideal world defects in a section 7 report will be identified at DRA and the author invited to address them the reality is that in a very significant number of cases there will indeed be omissions which might be plugged or uncertainties which might be clarified and practice in the real world suggests that these are usually adequately dealt </p>

Given that neither the social worker, counsel or the judge identified at that stage that the report was so defective that the only possible course would have been to direct a supplementary report I am not prepared to accept the submission that the local authority should not be held responsible for the defects because others were also responsible. The duty to complete the section 7 report lies upon the local authority. They should have in place processes which ensure that such reports (which are not the ordinary fare of children services social workers) are allocated to an individual who has the necessary experience and skills to undertake the work. If such an individual is not identified then management and legal support should be put in place to ensure that the report addresses the issues the court has identified. Ultimately it is the responsibility of the local authority at senior management level to ensure that they comply with the direction of the court and if they feel unable to do so they should notify the court accordingly. In this case the local authority did not (until the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> May 2019) assert that Cafcass were a more appropriate resource, nor did they assert that they did not have the capacity or ability to provide such a specialist report.  </p>

I am prepared to accept that there are extracts from the transcript which would suggest that Ms Z was criticised for not having considered issues which did not fall within the remit of the addendum section 7 report. However those isolated examples that Mr Wilkinson took me to are hardly representative of the entirety of the transcript of evidence or the overall impression which clearly emerges from it of a failure to grapple with the really significant issues which confronted the court and the parties. It hardly needs to be said that the section 7 report on such issues can be hugely significant in equipping the court with the evidence to determine the issues and in making reasoned recommendations to assist the court in understanding what will best promote the child&#8217;s welfare. For reasons which I am not entirely clear (and I accept may be related to pressures of work, inexperience, lack of support) the preparation that was undertaken both in the report and in the oral evidence was plainly so defective that the court was simply not provided with useful evidence on which it might seek to rely in the determination of these important applications. </p>

That is simply incorrect as no findings were made by HHJ Bush at the September/October hearing. The actual basis for requiring a further risk assessment is set out in paragraph 16 of the judgment and relates not to findings made but matters not addressed in the original report.  </p>

Having heard evidence from Ms Y and Ms Z over the space of some three days HHJ Bush adopted a most unusual course because she clearly concluded that the evidence she had heard had not provided her or the parties with the material required to justly determine the applications. Having dipped my toe into the transcripts her conclusion that the evidence was so poor would appear to be irrefutable. It is of course also supported by the concessions made by the local authority at the hearing on 3 May.  </p>

Both counsel submitted that the FPR does not refer to non-party costs orders although the Red Book does and it contains a summary in the 2019 Edition at p.2210. The authorities referred to by the parties and indeed by Mr Wilkinson make clear that it is not a precondition that there must be exceptional circumstances in order to make such an order. What the authorities do make clear is that such an order is only likely to be made in unusual circumstances and where there is clearly identifiable conduct (or misconduct) which makes it just to make such an order. Whether one uses the terminology of reprehensible, or unreasonable or misconduct or breach of duty is perhaps neither here nor there. The criticism that the judge cited a passage from one case which was in fact attributable to another case is no more than a proverbial slip of the pen/tongue/keyboard.

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0in">In her judgment as a result of the mother&#8217;s summation of the law in her skeleton argument HHJ Bush quite properly summarised the need to establish a sufficiently close connection or responsibility for the proceedings to bring them within the reach of a non-party costs order. The central focus of Mr Wilkinson&#8217;s oral submissions was the submission that in fact the local authority was not sufficiently connected with the proceedings so as to fall within the category of persons against whom a non-party costs order could be made. Given that no such submission was made to HHJ Bush I declined to permit Mr Wilkinson to rely on this. The skeleton argument submitted on behalf of the local authority for the hearing on 3 May 2019 makes absolutely no reference to any argument that there was an insufficiently close connection to bring them within the reach of a non-party costs order. It is implicit in the skeleton argument that is it is accepted that the local authority is sufficiently closely connected. As I have said before given the absence of full argument on this point I reach no conclusions on the legal test to be applied and whether there is a distinction between a section 37 direction and a section 7 report being ordered. The cases suggest that the focus should be on substance not form which would be consistent with the approach generally under the Family Procedure Rules where the focus is on achieving a just outcome rather than permitting reliance on technicalities. It is clear that on the facts HHJ Bush at paragraph 25 found that there was a sufficiently close connection to engage the jurisdiction. Given the local authority&#8217;s position during the hearing on 3 May 2019 that conclusion is not open to them to challenge her application of the law. However stepping back and undertaking my own independent judicial duty to consider matters of law I am unable to see any matter which would undermine the conclusion that on the facts of this case this local authority were sufficiently connected having regard to the central importance of this section 7 report. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0in">there is no substance in the assertion that the process adopted by the court was unfair to the local authority. The test on an appeal is whether the decision is unjust for procedural irregularity. The case advanced on behalf of the local authority does not establish any procedural irregularity still less one which rendered the decision unjust. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0in">The judge&#8217;s conclusions as to reprehensible behaviour were open to her on the facts as she knew them or found them to be. Having dealt with the application since 30 July she was well placed to determine the extent of the failures of the local authority and the impact they had had on the proceedings. What amounted to reprehensible conduct is a question of evaluation and the judge was well within her evaluative discretion to determine that the failure to notify the court and the parties in good time before the hearing on 30 July and the failures to prepare the section 7 report or to prepare for oral evidence fell within the parameters of reprehensible conduct.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In the circumstances I do not consider that the local authority has demonstrated any real prospect of success in relation to any of the grounds. On closer examination which has been afforded by this hearing and the benefit of sight of the skeleton argument submitted on behalf of the local authority to HHJ Bush and the benefit of submissions from Mr Butterfield as well as Mr Wilkinson it is clear that the appeal never had a realistic prospect of success and I therefore declined to grant permission to appeal. There might have been a compelling reason to grant permission had the issue of &#8216;sufficient connection&#8217; been open to the Local Authority to argue but that issue will have to await a case where it has been argued at first instance.   </p>
