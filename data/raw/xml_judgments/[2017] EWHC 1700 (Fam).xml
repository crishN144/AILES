It is a case with a dispiriting history, some of which is necessary for me to set out in this judgment so that the orders made by Roberts J may have context. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I start with the hearing which took place before District Judge Hayes in the Norwich County Court now as long ago as 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2001.  Those were private law proceedings, concerning the couple&#8217;s two children.  The central issue concerned contact by the father to his children, which was strenuously resisted by the mother.  Before the judge was able to determine what the progression of contact should be, it was necessary for him to resolve a series of allegations brought by the mother.  Over a period of two days the judge addressed that task assiduously and was able, on the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, to provide the parties a written judgment in which he set out the evidence that he had heard and the conclusions he had arrived at.  In the final passages of his judgment he noted that there was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a lot of evidence before him&#8217;</span>.  He identified significant aspects of it and, in particular, what he found to be helpful corroborative support from <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;third parties and outside documents&#8217;</span>. It led him to an unambiguous conclusion which he expressed as follows: </p>

I simply cannot recognise and reconcile the demeanour of Mr Gibbs and what I saw, with what he is alleged to have done. On conflicts of evidence I prefer Mr Gibbs, I am satisfied he is doing his best to tell the truth, although he says he is not perfect.&#8221; </span></p>

She indicated that if I don&#8217;t think he is guilty of emotional abuse I will have made a mistake. I don&#8217;t think I have. She said she might appeal, she has the right but she must bear in mind I make my decision on the wealth of evidence I have read and heard. I think both may have abused emotionally. Children should be protected from the battle of wills. Both parties need to put the interests of the children first.&#8221; </span></p>

Sadly, it did not. The judge indicated the mother had a right to appeal and she elected to pursue it. The appeal came before HHJ Barham sitting at the Norwich County Court.  In a concise written judgment, dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2001, the Judge analysed the Grounds of Appeal which were drafted by the Appellant personally.  I note that the Judge had sight of the typed Note of Judgment drafted by District Judge Hayes.  The appeal was rejected as disclosing no error of law, fact or procedure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One might have hoped that that would have been the end of the matter but, again, it was not.  Barely 12 months later the case found itself back before the Court, this time before the High Court, Family Division.  At that hearing, before Mr Justice Munby, as he then was, the mother was represented by counsel and solicitors, so too was the father.  By this stage the children were also represented.  The local authority had intervened.  Events took an unanticipated turn.  At the doors of the court the mother&#8217;s counsel conceded on her behalf that the available evidence filed in the proceedings, taken at its highest, had no prospect of establishing the allegations that the mother had initially sought to pursue.  A Consent Order was placed before the Court which was scrutinised by the Judge in a short judgment which has been transcribed and filed in this application.  The preface to the order records that it was acknowledged specifically by the mother <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">&#8216;that she was afforded the opportunity to pursue the allegations but did not seek to do so&#8217;.</span>  Secondly, it was recorded that the mother:</p>

I am sure that I do not have to say this, but it is important for the parties to appreciate that this is intended to be a final order which maps out into the foreseeable future the pattern of father&#8217;s contact with B and, equally importantly, B&#8217;s contact with her father.&#8221; </span></p>

It did not, it next came before Mr Justice Johnson scarcely 6 months later, in November 2002.  The arrangements made in respect of contact had already fallen into difficulty.  In his judgment dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2003 Mr Justice Johnson expressed himself with characteristic lack of ambiguity.  He said this:</p>

I am told that prior to this hearing it was said by some in her community that &#8216;truth would out at this hearing&#8217;.

At the beginning of this hearing the father told me that the mother had attended court with a number of supporters, one of whom had threatened to take steps to deprive the father of his office in Holy Orders. I caused that person to be brought into court to take the oath. He denied having threatened the father, but from the manner in which he spoke and his demeanour I did not accept his denial. It needs to be made plain that those who attend court are entitled to the protection of the court. These cases relating to children are full of emotional tension, and anyone who could speak in the way that that man spoke demonstrates their lack of understanding of human nature.&#8221; (my emphasis)</span></p>

Though the Court had been determined to ensure that B had a relationship with her father, the orders for contact, foundered, once again, on the rocks of the mother&#8217;s intransigence.  On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2004 the case came before Mr Justice Ryder, as he then was.  His Order of that date is prefaced by the following recording:</p>

The above recital was specifically intended to underscore that which had already been established in the previous litigation namely that the limited order for contact did not in any way reflect an adverse judgment by the Court on the father himself.  For the avoidance of doubt, there were no findings of physical, emotional or sexual abuse made against the father.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From early in 2017 and perhaps for a little time before that, the mother had begun to step up her campaign of vilification against the father.  She issued a raft of emails to thousands of individuals all of which either accused the father directly of physical, sexual and emotional abuse or inferred in the most unsubtle of ways that he was an abuser.  The father had undoubtedly become used to his character being traduced by the mother in this way but this bombardment against his reputation was, as the mother herself frankly acknowledges, beyond anything that she had undertaken before.  She had, she told me, visited her lawyer <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;some time in approximately 2014&#8217;</span>.   She discovered that the prohibited steps order made in the Children Act proceedings was not life long, as she had understood it to be but in fact expired when B turned 18 years of age.  This in part explains, in my view, the liberation she felt in being able to pursue her campaign more vigorously. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In contemporary society it is difficult to think of any allegation against a man or a woman which attracts greater public opprobrium than one of sexual abuse against a child.  Where these allegations are proved that public censure is entirely understandable. Here allegations are not proved.  The responsibility of mature adults is to take such complaints seriously, but to avoid rushing prematurely to judgement. The Reverend Gibbs believes that, faced with the onslaught of his ex wife&#8217;s allegations, his Church, his friends and his colleagues have done precisely that, moved ultimately to judgement against him.  They have, he believes, succumbed to the openly malevolent objectives of his ex wife to discredit him publicly and to attack his position in the Church. </p>

Again, it requires to be said: neither of the party&#8217;s children, both well into adulthood, has ever made a complaint to the police or been subject to investigative ABE interview; neither has appeared before, or presented written evidence to a Court alleging abuse.  There is no extraneous medical evidence pointing to abuse. Mrs Gibbs, when represented, as I have said, by experienced counsel before a judge of this division, readily accepted that the evidence before the court could not, even on the civil standard of proof, establish a finding.  At risk of repeating myself: there has been no finding of sexual abuse; no finding of perjury against the father; no evidence produced either in 2003 or in the years that followed that would be likely to establish such findings. </p>
