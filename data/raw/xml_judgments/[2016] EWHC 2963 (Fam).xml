	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns an application for an adoption order under the Adoption and Children Act (ACA) 2002 for Z, a little girl who is now six: she was born in Egypt on or about 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2010 to unknown parents and was found abandoned. Z had been placed in the care of T (the Applicant) a British citizen living and working in Egypt and her Egyptian husband, K (the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent), by an orphanage run by a UK charity in 2011 with the approval of the Family and Childhood Division of the Ministry of Social Affairs (&#8220;the Ministry&#8221; - the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Respondent). The local authority Liverpool City Council (LCC &#8211; the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondents) have been aware of Z&#8217;s presence in the UK since October 2013 and support the adoption application. Z herself is represented by counsel through her guardian (she is the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Respondent). Z has lived with T since she was an infant, at first in Egypt and then in England, since she was brought here by T in July 2013 for a visit, with the approval of K and of the Egyptian authorities.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Court has before it three inter-related applications: the first, being an application by T to adopt Z made on 25th November 2013 (permission was granted by this Court to make the application on 26th March 2014); the second is an application in the alternative by T for a Residence Order (now Child Arrangements Order) dated 13th February 2014 under the Children Act (CA) 1989; and the third is the application by the Ministry of Social Solidarity for return of the child to Egypt under the inherent jurisdiction; dated 2nd August 2016.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In May 2013 T, while living in Egypt, applied to the Home Office for permission for Z to enter the UK as a visitor; Z was given entry clearance until 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2014. T and K were given permission by the Egyptian authorities to travel with Z between 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2013 and 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2014. Z, accompanied by T alone, entered the UK on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2013 and has remained here since, in T&#8217;s care since. The application for an adoption order was made by T in England on the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2013. The Home Office, the British Embassy in Egypt and the Egyptian Embassy in London were served with the first order made by this Court on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2014, and although the Egyptian authorities informed the child&#8217;s solicitor and the Foreign Office of their objections to the application and despite further court orders inviting their intervention, it was not until December 2015 that the Egyptian Ministry of Social Solidarity applied to be joined as a party as a result of which the final hearing, due to take place in January 2016 was adjourned. It took place from 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2016 to 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016 with full participation of all parties except K (I shall return to his participation later; although acting in person, he was given some assistance by the Ministry and their solicitors before, during and after the hearing.) </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application for the adoption order is supported by the child&#8217;s guardian and by the responsible local authority. The Egyptian authorities oppose Z&#8217;s adoption by T and seek her return to Egypt with or without T. The case involves a conflict between the law of England and Wales and those of Egypt, particularly in respect of adoption, which has raised sensitive cultural and religious issues as well as legal conflict. The circumstances of Z&#8217;s retention in this jurisdiction, the manner in which she was brought here, ostensibly for a visit, her long term future and her individual legal status in international law add to the complexities of this case. Ultimately, however, all parties agree, it is the best interests of Z that must prevail and it is her welfare now, and in the future, that is this court&#8217;s paramount consideration. There has been no dispute regarding this court&#8217;s jurisdiction, which is based on the child&#8217;s habitual residence in England.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to the trial this court was sent a document setting out some agreed facts by way of background, by those representing the applicant, the local authority, the child&#8217;s representatives and the Ministry but, during the hearing, it became apparent that K did not agree with all of the facts as set out in that document; this was, in part, because he had not fully participated in the proceedings until the hearing which started at the end of August 2016. With that understanding I set out the facts as accepted by all the other parties, and, to a large extent, by K; in conjunction with those facts that were not in dispute during the hearing; where there is a material dispute as to the facts it is set out in this narrative. </p>

She was taken by the police and placed in the Al-Shams Al-Mushriqa Foundation orphanage (otherwise known as the &#8220;Sunshine Orphanage&#8221;; a UK charity, the Sunshine Project, provides help by means of sponsorship funding and grants to the orphanage) in Luxor. Following the standard practice in Egypt Z was given a name and a birth certificate was issued by the Civil Affairs Authority as a result of the police report. The names of her parents recorded on her birth certificate are, therefore, entirely fictitious.</p>

There is some dispute as to when Z came to live with T and K, who spent most of his time living with her in the villa she rented near Luxor, returning home to &#8220;visit his family&#8221; at least once a month. It is accepted that Z had been visited regularly in the orphanage by T, and that she was spending an increasing amount of time living at T&#8217;s villa with the consent of the Sunshine Orphanage. In his evidence K at first accepted, and later disputed, that Z living their full time by the time of her first birthday. Officially, at least as far as the Ministry is concerned, Z did not get placed full time with K and T until after the placement was formally sanctioned in 2013.   </p>

According to T, and as accepted by the Ministry at the outset of the hearing, K was divorced and separated from his Egyptian wife when he and T married. K himself disputes this and says that he has never divorced his Egyptian wife and that T was always aware of this; during the hearing the court was shown a marriage certificate the English translation of which clearly said that K was not married although, apparently, the Arabic version said that he was married. I am unaware of the precise and current status of this marriage between T and K in Egypt.</p>

The placement with T and K was under a system of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;kafala&#8221;</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;fosterage&#8221; </span>the legal status of which most closely resembles long term fostering in England &amp; Wales. All major decisions in relation to an orphan throughout her minority are made by a local Foster Care Committee (FCC) including the decision of where and by whom she is fostered. Mr Edge commented that he was unaware of any other case where fosterage has been awarded to a foreigner. He advised that a contract between the FCC and the foster parents is drawn up which outlines what the FCC expects from the fostering couple; there are regular visits and 6-monthly reports as to the progress of the placement and depending on these reports changes to the terms, or the termination of, the foster placement may result. </p>

He said that not only would an adoption order in the UK not be recognised by Egypt but that it would be regarded as a serious breach of trust by the adopting parent.

He reiterated that various Egyptian laws and charters have been breached by T. The Egyptian authorities are opposed to Z&#8217;s adoption; not only is adoption not recognised in Egyptian law (and contravenes Shari&#8217;a) but the adoption of an Egyptian Muslim child by a non-Muslim puts at risk the retention of her faith, culture and heritage.

Mr Abdel Basset himself in his oral evidence appeared to accept there were deficits in the information about the alternative placements that he had placed before the court when he suggested that professionals from England should go to Egypt to carry out their own assessments. </p>

His analysis, and that of the social worker, has been the subject of criticism on behalf of the Ministry, and of a lack of balance.</p>

It would seem that he thought she should return with T but if not she should be placed within his immediate family. K did not advance this case until well into the proceedings (in 2016) and, indeed, K had not taken part directly in any of the previous hearings. It was a matter of uncertainty that he would participate in the hearing in August and September 2016. Just prior to the hearing the court was given to understand that he would only give his evidence by video link from Egypt, and not take part otherwise. Provision was made for a video link so that he could give evidence from Egypt and an interpreter was provided by the court. It was not until after he had joined to proceeding to give his evidence that K then said it was his intention to continue to participate in the hearing. Unfortunately, but not unusually the IT available to the court and the video link was of such poor quality and signal that it proved impossible for K to give evidence by video. He gave evidence over the telephone and attempts were made to enable him to listen into the rest of the proceedings but as he was apparently moving about from place to place in Egypt and did not always have a reliable signal his participation was curtailed. He was provided with two court appointed interpreters who, K told me (he speaks a considerable amount of English) were acceptable, and, he told me that they understood each other.</p>

He was self-evidently, and understandably, concerned about the ramifications for him, legally, professionally and personally of Z possible adoption and of her not being returned to Egypt. It was made clear to this court that her adoption by T would not be considered lawful in Egypt and that illegality would extend to her retention in this country. K started his evidence by talking, at length, about a boat which he said had been owned by T, its current ownership and the financial dealings concerning the boat. This matter had been raised as an issue by T but it is not now, and never has been, the subject of these proceedings which are concerned with the welfare of Z and her long-term placement. The emphasis which K placed on this issue was because he wanted to prove both that the boat had changed hands legitimately and that T had been involved financial impropriety in Egypt, and, by extension and implication, no-one in Egypt including K himself had behaved improperly over the transfer of ownership of this property which had belonged to T. The boat, as I far as I could understand, had been purchased by a third party from whom I had and heard no evidence; the documentary proof on which K sought to rely, such as it was, was filed during and after the hearing (so it would not have been possible for T to challenge it) and I found the evidence to be inconclusive and as in the way it was presented to the court, certainly after the hearing concluded, improperly attested. </p>

Z has, after all had little if any contact with most of the family and has not seen K himself (whatever the reasons) since December 2013. K has not had any indirect contact with her since 2015 when his relationship with T ended when he ceased to support the application for an adoption order after the Ministry made its opposition known to him, although this was many months before they sought to intervene in these proceedings. Since then K has made no attempt to keep in contact with Z. </p>

T did show some emotion when talking about Z, which I find was appropriate and in keeping with the love and commitment that she has shown Z throughout. T was, however, adamant that as far as she was concerned she had adopted Z in Egypt; this apparent intransigence has to be viewed in the context of what T herself had been led to believe at the time Z was placed with her and subsequently.</p>

It is agreed by all parties, that as T told me, the arrangements for Z to be placed in their care were undertaken in Arabic by K. T does not speak or read Arabic (it is accepted that her business was conducted in English and that her clients were expatriates); nor does she read it, therefore she was entirely reliant on K to translate all documents and explain all the steps and procedures that were undertaken, not only as regards the placement but in all their other dealings where there were documents in Arabic.</p>

The accusation levelled at her for arranging for and taking a job on her return is ill-founded; far from providing proof that it was her intention to remain in England at the outset, I find that this job (which was temporary when she started it) is evidence of T&#8217;s determination to provide for herself and Z as she had always done. T has struck me as a person of some self-possession and admirable independence, who has supported herself since she was a very young woman and would be determined to continue to do so; it is not a matter which should attract criticism, on the contrary T is to be praised for her industry.</p>

It is more likely than not that he was attempting to avoid conflict with the Egyptian authorities and avoid any action being taken against him. In his oral evidence he was unable to explain why he had not told them of the court proceedings, although this was unsurprising given his obvious attempts to ensure that the evidence he gave was coincided with the views expressed by the Ministry.</p>

Even Mr Abdel Basset accepted that the discrimination against orphans and foundlings was still prevalent, although improved; he described their situation as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;far from rosy&#8221;</span>. T told the court that she had observed that the children from the Sunshine Orphanage were treated as objects of derision, and on one occasion she had experienced children having been admonished by their mother for showing an interest and starting to play with Z; I accept her evidence in respect of her own observations while living in Egypt. This matter, which was raised by Mr Edge in his advice on Egyptian Law was, quite understandably, disputed on behalf the Ministry and I was told, and I accept, that such behaviour was not condoned and that concerted efforts have been made to greatly reduce if not eliminate discrimination; however, these assertions made by Mr Abdel Basset, which I am sure were genuinely held, were just that, assertions, and do not amount to evidence that discrimination does not exist, any more than his assurances about the elimination of FGM.  If children of unknown parentage are suffering discrimination socially and personally in Egyptian society this would militate against Z long term future being better provided for by her return.</p>

Given that the political and social situation worsened in 2013 along with the continued collapse in tourism, which directly affected T&#8217;s ability to support Z and herself, along with her estrangement from K it is quite understandable that she did not wish to return to Egypt to live there. As time went on, she had little if anything to return to; she no longer owned her boat, her husband &#8220;returned&#8221; to his wife and the situation in Egypt remained volatile. From her stand point she had no reason to return for she understood that she had (and the documents confirmed) full and permanent custody of Z. The signature on the agreement with the authorities in Luxor to return with Z by a specified date is not that of T; despite K&#8217;s repeatedly assertions that he had authority to sign on her behalf, there is no evidence over and above those assertions that he had any such authority and his willingness to sign &#8220;on her behalf&#8221; is further evidence of his duplicitous behaviour such as he exhibited when lying to the authorities in Egypt about Z remaining in England, while hiding the fact of the court proceedings from them. </p>

I accept the submission made on behalf of T and supported by the local authority that her commitment to the proceedings, which have been lengthy (and very expensive for her personally) has been beyond question and is a concrete manifestation of her devotion to Z. T has not, at any time, sought to hide from the authorities or the court how Z came into her care and she certainly did not delay in making her application regarding Z&#8217;s placement with her in the UK. Any delay in concluding these applications has not been as a consequence of any action or inaction on her part. Although it is inevitable that her case will benefit because of the length of time Z has now been in her care, that has not been because of action taken by T and as such any submission relying on case law where that was the case, such as where applicants for adoption orders have hidden a child over long periods of time to strengthen their case, can have little if any weight or application.</p>

T&#8217;s love and commitment to Z has never been in doubt throughout these proceedings and was conspicuous in her oral evidence; her devotion was palpable in the way she spoke about Z. In contrast, whilst allowing for the distancing effect of the telephone and the need for an interpreter, there was marked absence of any evidence from K which betrayed any reflection on the effects on Z of her removal from T or the effects on her on being placed amongst strangers in a strange (to her) land; nor did he manage to convey any affectionate feeling for her. K has never supported Z financially in the past, and he has not sent her any gifts or cards or anything else at all while she has been in England. He has not spoken to her for over a year and has made no attempt to do so. K has never made a formal application for contact, nor has he informally broached the subject of contact with the guardians, both of whom have been in touch with him during the proceedings. He has, in fact shown little or no interest in Z since he last saw her when he visited in December 2014.

To deal with the second first; when Z came to England there was a substantial change in her life in the absence of K, who had been living with T and treating Z as their child. The extent of the role he played in Z&#8217;s life when in Egypt is difficult to assess as his claim that he was almost constant presence in the household is at odds with his concurrent claim that he had a continuous and active marriage to his Egyptian wife and had always been actively involved with his first wife and children. I do not accept that he played a significant role as a primary carer. His direct involvement with Z initially diminished in 2013 and then effectively came to an end in 2015. This must have had a reductive effect on Z&#8217;s awareness of direct cultural influence as well as a significant loss of her psychological father; however, much of the responsibility for this must be K&#8217;s as he did nothing to maintain the link with Z, either as a father-figure or as a conduit for, or connection with, her Egyptian Arabic heritage. This lack of commitment on K&#8217;s part raises serious questions about his motivation for seeking Z&#8217;s placement with him now.</p>

This document did not, apparently, resurface until the summer of 2016, shortly before the hearing, although the guardian said he was aware of it after he took over the case, he was not able to tell me when he first saw it. I am unsure that this document lay dormant for over six months as the solicitors file does not confirm whether or not it was forwarded to the other parties or not; certainly there is no evidence that it was passed on to Ms Harding so that she could consider it as an option. Be that as it may, K himself took no steps to inform the local authority or the court of his intention to put himself forward as a carer for Z and such inaction on his part betrays a lack of commitment to Z and nothing by way of indication that he was seriously pursuing any placement with him. </p>

They, in turn, did not inform the court of their support of placement with K until after the hearing had got underway and Mr Abel Basset told me that the placement was only approved the Sunday prior to the trial commencing. The evidence is that K did not pursue the placement of Z with him and his family even in Egypt until just before these proceedings came to court in August 2016; this highly suggestive of expediency on his part, doubtless to mitigate against further difficulties for himself which might arise as a result of breaches of Egyptian law.  I wholly reject the submission on behalf of the Ministry that K should be considered by the court to be a &#8220;victim of inadequate social work&#8221; on the part of the local authority.</p>

There is no denying that once Z left Egypt she was removed from the country of her birth with all that must entail; she has been removed the daily influences that she would have had growing up in Egypt and there is there is nothing that can be done to replicate those influences which could only be restored by a return to living in Egypt. I acknowledge this as I do that the country she has been living in is inherently and intrinsically different in many ways to the country of her birth. Some of those differences are profound and exemplified by matters that fell to be considered during this hearing. The most elemental being that legal, societal and cultural, ethical and moral norms are rooted to much greater extent in religious context in Egypt than in the UK an example of which is that polygamy is permissible in Egypt and a criminal offence in the UK (bigamy). </p>

This is illustrated, for example by the Egyptian legal stipulation that T must on her return to Egypt with Z have an Egyptian Muslim husband in order for Z to remain placed with her; but this is without any consideration of how K would divide his time as between his two wives and families as it is a &#8220;private matter&#8221; or of the actual likelihood of T accepting such an arrangement, or, indeed, of the effect of all this on both families. The different views in the importance to the child of micro management of her welfare, as opposed to the macro view of a child&#8217;s welfare in terms of her nationality and heritage, sets apart some of the considerations that are advanced in the cases of the local authority, the guardian and T on the one hand and the Ministry on the other. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is further illustrated when it comes to the possibility that Z should have some choice when it comes to religious observance as the concept of choice with regard to religious belief is another significant difference. The religion of Z&#8217;s parents is as unknown as is their identity. She may be the child of Copts or of a sect of Islam not widely adhered to in Egypt; her parents may have had different religious beliefs. There is a significant possibility that Z was not born to Muslim parents given the Coptic population in the area in which she was found; the head of the Sunshine Orphanage at the time was a Copt. All orphans are assigned their religion by the state and the possibility of making a choice later in life is not contemplated or an accepted practice, whereas freedom of religious expression is considered a fundamental human right in many parts of the world including the UK. It is not for this court to make decisions based on some concept of cultural or legal superiority; and I do not do so, however the UNCRC has been ratified by the Egyptian State and I can and I do, properly use that as part of my consideration in due course.</p>

I can, and I do, take into account that this loss was one which the Egyptian authorities seemingly permitted to persist for some considerable time as there were repeated attempts by the court to engage the Egyptian Government in the proceedings through the Embassy/Consulate in London.

The evidence before this court (which was not disputed) was that even when in Egypt Z was spoken to in English by both T and K with occasional use of Arabic words. As an infant she was not instructed in the Muslim faith and had not had any specific religious instruction. The Directorate&#8217;s own report from their social worker who visited the child acknowledged that T (as the mother) was the main carer.

While it is true to say that she did not carry out an assessment of K and his family she was never in a position to do so; British social workers are quite simply not qualified or authorised to carry out assessments in overseas jurisdictions. In any event, K did not provide any details of his home, his family or of where and in what circumstances Z would make her home with his family on which the social worker could have based even a preliminary assessment. As to the assessment of the two other families suggested and put forward by the Ministry, it would be facile to suggest that she could have carried out an analysis of those possible placements; a good deal of the evidence about them was first adduced by Mr Abdel Basset in his oral evidence.

The importance to a child of placement stability has, as Ms Harding alluded to, been widely researched, and the importance of developing secure attachments in early infancy have long been recognized as essential ingredients in normal child development; the local authority&#8217;s evidence made reference to Ainsworth et al. 1978; Bowlby, 1969; &amp; Bentovim, 1991. It is accepted that instability in a child&#8217;s placement reduces the opportunity for children to develop permanent, secure attachments, may compound existing difficulties and reinforcement of insecure patterns of attachment; the effects of which are life-long. Thus children who are moved to different placements are less likely to attempt to establish intimate relationships with those who care for them and to display behaviour that keeps carers emotionally distant; this can, and does lead to placements breaking down and further rejection, from the point of view of the child. </p>

It was the submission of the local authority, supported by Ms Harding in her evidence, that the quality of care provided by T, and along with their conclusion that there was a lack of deception on her part, led to the reasonable conclusion that Z remaining with T was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;very likely to be a stable, life-long commitment&#8221;</span>.

This is a view that was, to some extent at least, shared by Mr Basset, for when I asked him how T and Z would be financially supported if in Egypt he said that they could, perhaps, receive financial support from the British state. Although T, with some emotion and evident fear and trepidation, told me that if there was no other choice she would of course return with the Z to Egypt rather than abandon her, I agree with the submissions made on behalf of the other parties that this can only be viewed as testament to T&#8217;s commitment to the child rather than a realistic option. There are many reasons to reach the conclusion that this is not possible, from the Ministry&#8217;s view point the arrangement, if T were to return to Egypt with Z, would have to include the continuation of the marital relationship between T and K. This court would and could not countenance an order that was based on T having to accept and voluntarily subject herself to a polygamous marriage which would place her in an untenable, and to her repugnant, situation. Moreover, the evidence on which the Ministry had sought to rely failed to address any and all of the practicalities of this situation which they apparently favoured; there was no evidence of where T and Z would live; who would fund the move; where T would work (if she could) and how care was to be divided between T and K.

As such both Z and T would be living in a tenuous legal relationship, at best, which could be terminated at any time without recourse to legal proceedings; a situation which is precarious, uncertain and psychologically unsustainable.

Understandably he was at pains to promote a view of Egyptian society which concurred with the stance and aims of the Ministry. I was, however, wholly unconvinced by his evidence regarding the prevalence of FGM, for example, which contradicts the 2015 findings of the Ministry of Health and Population and did not find assertions that possible foster-carers would not have Z <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;cut&#8221;</span> because they were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;well-educated&#8221;</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;businessmen with a science background&#8221; </span>convincing or reassuring; not least as there was no independent objective evidence before this court which provided the court with any proof of their qualifications, still less that this subject had been broached with the potential carers when their assessment took place.</p>

The fact is that her first language was English; both K and T spoke to her in English from babyhood. T does not speak Arabic and conducted her business, in Egypt, in English. K&#8217;s evidence supported this; it has always been his case that he helped T in translation and that he explained everything to her in English. Despite this Mr Basset insisted in his oral evidence that Z spoke Arabic and did not accept, when it was put to him that Z, had never spoken Arabic. Similarly, he refused to accept that Z had moved out of the orphanage to live with T and K before her first birthday, as it was he said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not possible under Egyptian Law&#8221;</span>. The evidence of T and K is that Z had been living with them for well over a year when the placement was officially recognised, other than at local level, in Spring 2013. This seemingly stubborn refusal to accept evidence of matters being other than they <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> be betrayed Mr Basset&#8217;s determination to present the case as it fits with the Ministry&#8217;s perspective.</p>

From the point of view of the Ministry this would have to be with the concomitant resumption of the married relationship with K; it would, he explained be up to K how he divided his time between the two families.

This would be a considerable hurdle for Z to overcome, at least initially and would, as a matter of fact, add to the feelings of isolation that she would feel if placed amongst strangers in a strange land. She is a very little girl and larger socio-political concepts such as nationality and heritage would not provide her with the reassurance and feeling of security necessary for a child of her age. I was left with the strong impression that it was the principle and not the child that Mr Basset and the Ministry were focussed on and, as such, their analysis lacked balance.</p>

He had not been able to speak to the previous guardian because of illness; but as a result of the work already done by Cafcass and the local authority he did not have to carry out much in the way of further investigation of Z&#8217;s welfare and, as he explained he did not want to cause the child anxiety by undertaking unnecessary visits. Mr Smith did not want to impose visits on the child of longer than 10 to 15 minutes, Z had already spent considerable time with the social worker, who had, as a result of the protracted proceedings spent an unusual amount of time with the child, and with her previous guardian. As a result, his overall knowledge and grasp of the details of the case were not as comprehensive as those who had been involved from the outset. He was, though, quite clear that moving Z from her placement with T would cause her harm, and pointed out that Z had been with T since she was 10 months old and had now been living in the UK for three years. It was his view, based on over thirty years&#8217; experience as a guardian, that as moving a child very often caused harm and it was very likely that it would in this case; leading Z to feel resentful and guilty and to blame herself for the move; the long term effects would, he said, include lack of self-esteem, behavioural and other emotional difficulties, which would stretch beyond childhood.</p>

If there are no apparent and conspicuous reasons for a move that would make it worse for the child to deal with an as she would have to come to terms with what to her would be an incomprehensible move. T would, he said, and I agree, have extreme difficulty in manging what would have to be conveyed to Z as the reasons for her move. As her guardian Mr Smith had properly concerned himself with questions regarding the importance to Z of her heritage and background, both as a child and into adulthood. He felt that the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;elements of race, culture, religion and nationality would be covered if she moved to Egypt [but in respect of] her faith and nationality steps were being taken.

In his view Z regarded T as her mother and with her support Z has dealt with some of her past, but that professional help with her life-story work would be needed to explain to her the fact of her abandonment and her move to living with T. There were, he said, no indication that T had dealt with Z&#8217;s background inappropriately or that she would in the future; Z was getting to know her background in an age appropriate way. </p>

The formation of such a relationship was critical to her ability to form secure relationships now and into adulthood, and to her self-image, self-esteem and confident ability to develop throughout her life. Bluntly he repeated that he did not know how one would explain to Z a move away from T to Egypt as there was no welfare reason for such a move; he did not know how she would understand it.

Nonetheless, Mr Smith accepted that he had not set out a consideration of a placement with K. It is the court&#8217;s view that any such analysis would have been severely limited and restricted by the paucity of information available about K&#8217;s suggestion, which was not even taken up by the Ministry itself until after the trial commenced. It was suggested on behalf of the Ministry that the courts frequently move children who are more than adequately cared for if it is in their best interests to do so. This may well be the case when children are moved from short-term foster care to a permanent placement; but it misses the point, all the alternative placements put forward on behalf of the Ministry are permanent <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> in the sense that the child would be permanently returned to Egypt. None of them offer the personal security of remaining part of any family for the whole of this child&#8217;s life. I shall return to this later.</p>

The parents&#8217; views, whether religious, cultural, secular or social, are entitled to respect but cannot be determinative&#8221; (para 108). One important factor, in considering the child&#8217;s welfare, is whether an adoption order would be recognised in the country where the child is domiciled, or a national, or has been habitually resident. If it would not be, the court will have to consider the disadvantages of a &#8220;limping&#8221; adoption order (see In re B(S) (An Infant) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1968] Ch 204" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1968">[1968] Ch 204</ref>), which might make it difficult for them ever to visit Hungary. This might tell in favour of finding other ways of giving the children the security and stability they need.&#8221;</span></p>

This is neither a realistic or likely proposition as T has no intention of returning to her &#8220;marriage&#8221; or to K, has no means of support and no accommodation in which she and Z can live.</p>

Nor is this a Hague Convention case and the principles applied in those cases where the return of a child by a parent who alleges wrongful removal or retention, which may find some parallels here, are not directly analogous. Reference to case law in such cases is illustrative and does not create precedents to be followed here. Moreover, there is no dispute between the parties that the principle of paramountcy does not apply in Hague cases as it applies here (as there are general policy considerations which are to be weighed against the interests of the child in each individual case). An analysis of the plethora of decided cases, at every level, while it may be interesting, is of limited assistance. </p>

A case against his doing so has to be made. But the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case. What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run.

In truth and fact Z&#8217;s religion, in the sense of her parent&#8217;s religion is not known, but the importance of Islam in the life of an Egyptian is recognised. All her education has taken place in England in a school which is attended by children of many ethnicities and religions, including those of the Muslim faith. That her background is Egyptian is not disputed; nor does any party, including T seek to ignore it or set it aside. In the wider sense Egypt is Z&#8217;s home country; but, as far as this child is concerned her home is with T, and it is in England where she has spent most of her life.</p>

It would be wrong to say that the future of every child who is within the jurisdiction of our courts should be decided according to a conception of child welfare which exactly corresponds to that which is current here. In a world which values difference, one culture is not inevitably to be preferred to another. Indeed, we do not have any fixed concept of what will be in the best interests of the individual child. Once upon a time it was assumed that all very young children should be cared for by their mothers, but that older boys might well be better off with their fathers. Nowadays we know that some fathers are very well able to provide everyday care for even their very young children and are quite prepared to prioritise their children's needs over the demands of their own careers. Once upon a time it was assumed that mothers who had committed the matrimonial offence of adultery were only fit to care for their children if the father agreed to this. Nowadays we recognise that a mother's misconduct is no more relevant than a father's: the question is always the impact it will have on the child's upbringing and wellbeing. Once upon a time, it may have been assumed that there was only one way of bringing up children. Nowadays we know that there are many routes to a healthy and well-adjusted adulthood. We are not so arrogant as to think that we know best.</span></p>

There is nothing in those principles which prevents a court from giving great weight to the culture in which a child has been brought up when deciding how and where he will fare best in the future. Our own society is a multi-cultural one. But looking at it from the child's point of view, as we all try to do, it may sometimes be necessary to resolve or diffuse a clash between the differing cultures within his own family.&#8221;</span></p>

T described how she and Z were learning some Arabic by using language courses available online. T told me that the school is aware that Z is being raised as a Muslim (she is given Halal food at school and at home) and of her Egyptian heritage; this heritage has been celebrated while at school.

While it is self-evident that it would not be the same as Z being raised in Egypt, I find that T has demonstrated and is demonstrating real commitment to Z growing up with access to that part of her heritage and there is no evidence that T would not offer encouragement and support to Z to be involved with Islam, and to be a practising Muslim; it must be kept in mind that the religious aspect of Z&#8217;s life is not determinative and Z&#8217;s approach is sensitive to the need for the child to build her on own identity formed in part from her Egyptian-Arabic background and heritage; there is no indication that T intends to impose her own ethnicity, English heritage or the Christian religion on Z or that she has ever intended to do so.</p>

Z&#8217;s situation is not the same as her having been separated from a birth parent or from her biological family for that is an invariant wherever Z lives. Secondly, Z will, in due course, have to come to terms with the fact that she was abandoned and the harm caused to her by the consequent feelings of rejection and abandonment that will flow from the way that knowledge is imparted to her. Thus part of my consideration of her life-long welfare must be which option or placement can best provide her with support as she comes to terms with the circumstances of her birth, as that will affect her self-image and emotional resilience during her adolescence and into adulthood.</p>

There is nothing to suggest any significant emotional or psychological harm is caused by that act alone, there is no sense of rejection or abandonment for the child concerned. Such a child accepts the decisions made by the adult carer; it is not, by itself, a difficult concept for a child to grasp both at the time and into adulthood. An attachment to a country of birth, particularly for an infant as Z was at the time she left Egypt, is entirely conceptual rather than one based on actuality, quite unlike her attachment to T or the emotional consequences of coming to terms with her abandonment as a new born baby. Children brought up overseas learn an attachment to their native land and culture by the reinforcement of that part of their identity by their parents; T has already demonstrated that she will bring Z up to be proud and aware of her Egyptian roots.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no evidence before me of how the authorities in Egypt intend to support Z in learning about, and coming to terms with, her abandonment as a baby. It would, on the evidence before the court, apparently be left to which ever family she is placed with to explain her origins to her as they saw fit. I have no evidence about their attitude towards such children generally or specifically as it would relate to her.  I am unconvinced by the bald assertions made on behalf of the Ministry that there is no longer any discrimination against children and adults without families in Egypt; not least because that does not coincide with the oral evidence of Mr Basset himself. There was no objective or independent evidence before me, other than the opinion evidence of Mr Edge, about discrimination against &#8220;orphans&#8221;. It is not disputed that she would not be entitled to any inheritance from any family she was placed with in Egypt, unless they chose to provide for her, regardless of the number of years she was a part of that family. This is in contrast to her rights of inheritance should she be adopted by T under English and Welsh law. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is certainly arguable that as an adult Z might have a sense of loss as a result of not having grown up in Egypt, but that will be largely of abstract perception. The likelihood of harm to Z caused by that sense of loss is considerably less the likelihood of significant emotional caused to her harm as a result of Z&#8217;s separation from her secure attachment parental figure, both in the short and in the long term. I was particularly struck by the guardian&#8217;s evidence about how such a decision might be explained to Z both as a very young child and later as an adolescent and adult who may well be unhappy with the decision that was taken to remove her from a home where she knew and could feel that she was settled, happy and well looked after. In the evidence provided by the Ministry this question is never addressed; the explanation, such as could be discerned form the oral evidence of Mr Basset, amounted to telling Z that the Ministry, as an arm of the Egyptian government considered that Z &#8220;belonged&#8221; to the Egyptian state and insisted that she had to go back to Egypt to grow up there, although everyone had accepted that T had been looking after Z properly and well and that Z had not suffered any harm while living with T. It is instructive to consider how Z could come to terms with such an explanation.</p>

To begin with Z is highly unlikely to be able understand why she is no longer able to live with her &#8220;mummy&#8221;. It is almost impossible to construct an age appropriate reason that could make any sense to her, for unlike in the public law cases alluded to by Mr Setright, Z&#8217;s mother-figure (T) is not ill, she is not unable to care for her for any other reason such as addiction or imprisonment, T poses no risk to Z&#8217;s physical well-being by reason of her having injured Z, or another child; it is not necessary here to give further illustration of the accessible and readily comprehended reasons given to children about why they had to be removed from their parents, these are decisions which are manifestly taken to safeguard a child and in their best interests. The risk to Z from which the Ministry submit she needs safeguarding is the nebulous and to a child, incomprehensible, risk that her background, ethnicity and heritage will be compromised. As a result, certainly in the short and medium term, there is an undoubted likelihood that would be Z confused, distressed, deeply unhappy and resentful and, as a result act out, bringing a risk of breakdown into any new placement, particularly one where they may be some resentment against her already, such as within K&#8217;s family, or one where there is a perception that this child ought to be grateful for the home being offered to her.</p>

One cannot say when she will be told about this fact if she is moved to live in Egypt, as it was not dealt with on behalf of the Ministry, but there must be a risk that she would find out sooner rather than later, not least as a result of the prevailing social attitudes in Egypt. Evidentially, and in stark contrast, the court has heard that T has considered the need to deal with this issue sensitively and has said that she will seek out and take appropriate professional advice and support; the local authority would provide the help and advice through their adoption services. On being removed from T&#8217;s care the likelihood is that Z will blame herself, as it is well known that children commonly do in similar situations; Z will feel abandoned and look for reasons for that abandonment. To learn that she had already been abandoned at birth as well will add considerably to her feelings of rejection and the harm to her long-term emotional well-being will be compounded.</p>

The Ministry&#8217;s assertions that this is no longer likely are flatly contradicted by the 2015 findings contained in the report of the Health Ministry. The issue was simply not dealt with in respect of the proposed placement with any of the alternative families, including the family of K. If such mutilation were carried out on Z it would be a gross interference with her life-long physical and psycho-sexual well-being and is, on any terms, totally unacceptable; certainly under the terms of the UNCRC. She should not be placed at risk of it occurring and there is no evidence before this court that would provide any real assurance that this would not happen to Z as it happens to the majority of girls in Egypt.</p>

There is no other harm that could be, or has been, identified. Z was not brought to the UK by T as part of a deliberate deception on her part; it is accepted by this court that T had, when she arrived in the UK, intended to go back to live in Egypt with Z. For the reasons I have set out above T did not do so, but she remained committed to caring for Z for the rest of her life. Without delay or any attempt at concealing the presence of Z in this jurisdiction T made the applications that were appropriate under UK law; she applied for an adoption order as a means of providing Z with a family for the rest of her life.  While this court accepts, and is well aware, that adoption, particularly adoption without consent, is an anathema in many cultures and in many jurisdictions, this is not a case where consent of a parent would be dispensed with as there is no parent. The laws of the United Kingdom do not provide for an alternative permanent placement (excepting that provided for in surrogacy cases).</p>

In both his written and oral evidence he made clear that he was personally fearful of repercussions for himself as consequences of Z travelling to the UK and remaining here. He reneged on his initial express apparent agreement to T adopting the Z in the UK only once the view taken by the Ministry became apparent. At all times he has shown that his primary concern was his own welfare and reputation and the negative consequences for him as a result of the events of this case, and not for the welfare of Z. I wholly reject his explanation that he had only written to the child&#8217;s lawyers to agree to the adoption because he thought it was part of a plan by T to get immigration clearance extended for Z. I do so, in large part, because it is also part of his case that he, himself, fully understood the legal concepts of &#8220;adoption&#8221; because he had repeatedly explained to T that what had happened in Egypt was not adoption but fostering. He cannot have it both ways.</p>

His relationship with T came to an end in or around December 2014, certainly by the start of 2015, after which he took no steps to arrange any contact with Z by phone or by Skype or Facetime despite being in contact with the child&#8217;s guardian and solicitors. He did not attempt, at any time, to open an alternative channel of communication with the child, he did not send, or attempt to send, a card, a letter or a gift. Moreover, he has made no enquiries as to Z&#8217;s health, welfare or general well-being and made no attempt to keep himself informed about her welfare. K&#8217;s family have never shown any interest in Z and to suggest, as Mr Basset did, that Z has any kind of a close relationship with any of K&#8217;s children stretches the facts of this case to breaking point. Z does not see K&#8217;s children as her &#8220;siblings&#8221;; she barely knows them and they have never demonstrated any interest in her at all.

If, as he claimed at the hearing, he had had the intention of providing a home for Z within his family, he did little, if anything to promote or pursue this intention with the court. He did not pursue his &#8220;application&#8221; (he has not made any formal application to the court) to be considered as an alternative placement with the local authority. He did little to pursue this course with the guardian; (if he did send an attachment to an email to the child&#8217;s solicitor some months before the hearing in September 2016 he did not follow it up); nor did he file any evidence setting out his plans for Z including such basic matters as the provision for her accommodation, education and contact with T; nor did he offer evidence from his first wife, despite the fact that T had raised her conduct over Z as an issue early in the case. The fact that he has did not produce any evidence to contradict the evidence of T can only suggest that it is likely that there is no such evidence.  Based on K&#8217;s early acquiescence to the adoption, his prolonged inaction regarding Z&#8217;s placement with him and his lack of commitment to Z personally, in conjunction with the last minute attempts to produce a case during the currency of the hearing, there can be no other conclusion than that his application for Z to live with him was an issue of personal expediency for him and nothing else.</p>

It is unclear whether he has been "officially" approved by the Ministry or by Mr Basset alone and K&#8217;s account of his approval of his family differed from that of the Ministry. The written assessment provided to the court was, on any view, superficial. It did, nonetheless, reveals a considerable shortfall in income that is of concern within the context of assessment as it was based on his assuming the financial responsibility for the care of another child (accepting as he did that T had always provided for Z); it did not address practical issues such as educational provision, even where Z would sleep and more significant matters directly relating to Z&#8217;s welfare such as the attitude of K&#8217;s wife to FGM or how he and she would deal with the possibility that Z would face discrimination, or the attitude of his other children to having Z come to live with them. There is no evidence before this court which addresses K's first wife&#8217;s attitude towards having Z in her home. Accepting as I do T&#8217;s evidence about the way in which she was treated by K&#8217;s wife regarding Z&#8217;s placement, the only evidence there is points towards her having had scant regard for Z&#8217;s welfare in the past. From Z&#8217;s point of view, she would be placed with strangers including someone she has not seen or heard from for a long time who has never looked after her without her &#8220;mummy&#8221; being there anymore.     </p>

In addition to those I have already mentioned above which relate directly to Z and to his suitability as a possible carer for her, and which, I assume, probably accounted for Mr Basset&#8217;s reluctance to whole-heartedly support K in his oral evidence; the Ministry has chosen to overlook the deceptive and misleading information regarding the reasons for Z&#8217;s remaining in the UK that K gave to the Egyptian authorities repeatedly over many months in 2013 and 2014 when he failed to inform them that Z was the subject of court proceedings, a ward of court and that there was an application for her adoption being pursued by T. His deception of the authorities in Egypt included telling them that T&#8217;s mother was ill and that required T to remain in the UK. K told me in his evidence that T&#8217;s mother suffered ill-health and that he observed it himself. This was disputed by T, and her evidence was supported by the social worker and the guardian, who had both met T&#8217;s mother on several of their visit&#8217;s to Z and T at home. In fact, I am told that T&#8217;s mother is an active woman who forms part of T&#8217;s support network and is someone who loves Z and is loved by her as a grandmother-figure. Simply put, K lied about T&#8217;s mother, the reasons for Z remaining in the UK, deliberately misled the authorities about the likelihood of Z returning with T and deceived them by withholding information about the legal proceedings. </p>

He deceived T throughout their relationship by lying about his continuing marriage to his first wife. He told, or at the very least, allowed T to think that Z&#8217;s placement with them was akin to adoption and used that word in his explanations to her; this much was evident from his own oral evidence during which he used the word &#8220;adoption&#8221; frequently interchanging it with fostering. While T&#8217;s business was thriving he was able to live off her and, no doubt, his Egyptian family were better off as a result. I accept T&#8217;s evidence that K&#8217;s wife used Z as a lever to try to extract more money, so that T signed her car over to them. K must have been aware of what was happening at the time, as his relationship with T was evidently, from his point of view, largely a financial and business arrangement which suited him. K would have been keen to keep T happy and help her with Z because that is what she wanted to do. I have no doubt that he understood the import of the adoption application in this court and that he had at the outset agreed to it because it suited him; he had not financially supported T or Z and did not wish to take on the responsibility. I conclude that K never saw Z as part of his Egyptian family and that he and his first wife were not interested in taking an orphan into their home; if they were they could have done so before at any time during his involvement with the orphanage.</p>

I reject the proposition that Z return to Egypt with T; it is unrealistic and would leave T and Z stranded without support, accommodation or any financial provision in what is to both of them in essence an alien land. Although Z would remain in the care of her primary carer, T would be placed in an insecure and uncertain situation as to her own status, vulnerable to the possibility of prosecution, friendless, estranged from her &#8220;husband&#8221; and in a precarious situation generally as Egypt has continued to be subject to civil unrest and there is nothing to indicate that T could resume her former lifestyle, or re-establish her business. To place Z&#8217;s &#8220;mother&#8221; and primary carer in such a situation, and, as regards Z a position of such uncertainty with respect to her status vis-&#224;-vis the child would be undermining to the extent that it would place T at the extreme end of the spectrum with respect to the risk to her own emotional and psychological wellbeing which would, inevitably, directly affect the child&#8217;s welfare.</p>

The risk of FGM may be lessened while she remained with T, but as the estranged wife of K, T&#8217;s personal autonomy and authority will be considerably reduced, there is nothing to stop K or the Ministry from removing Z from T. The advantages are illusory, for although Z would return to her country, culture, religion and heritage of birth and will remain in the care of her &#8220;psychological mother&#8221; and primary carer their situation will be so precarious as to undermine any such advantages. Z may resume some sort of relationship with K but the integrity of her placement with T will be subject to his caprice and that of his family. </p>

On the evidence before me this would represent a leap into the unknown as to the ability of the members of the proposed families to provide Z with adequate accommodation, schooling and emotional support; their ability to assist and encourage Z in the formation of positive attachments with them; as to the likely between longevity of the placement. The likelihood of the successful integration of Z into the social and cultural fabric of the local community and wider society is speculative, involving as it does, tangible risks, identified in the evidence above, for, again, Z would remain a parent-less child at risk of harm contiguous with stigmatisation and discrimination; of FGM; and, of possible placement breakdown as a result of Z&#8217;s reaction to her sudden separation from T.

The former would maintain the status quo, and would have the advantage that she would remain a child of Egyptian nationality. In addition, Z would remain in the care of her psychological parent and primary carer; there would be no sudden change of her circumstances; and Z would continue to have her all her physical, educational and emotional needs met by T to a high standard. A CAO would give T parental responsibility for Z and provide a degree of certainty with respect to the legal relationship in the UK between T and Z. As it would not involve change to her nationality (she would remain Egyptian) perhaps Z would retain an ability to travel to her native land, if not during her childhood it seems as she would have to remain there, then as an adult; yet the CAO would not be recognised in Egyptian law so she would revert to her present status. Against that both Z and T would remain exposed to uncertainty about Z longer-term status in the UK and doubt about the security of her placement, her immigration status, her access to education (certainly at tertiary levels) and this would place continuing pressure and stress not only on Z herself but on T as her primary carer which would extended into adulthood. This solution would not, in any event, satisfy the concerns of the Ministry and, for these reasons, I accept the submission of the local authority that it would place Z in a psychological and practical limbo. </p>

Before I consider the advantages and disadvantages to Z&#8217;s welfare throughout her life I must give some consideration to T&#8217;s intentions and extent of the any breaches of the ACA, whether real, technical or of &#8220;the spirit&#8221; of the law in her application to adopt Z. The court is aware of cases where that there have been putative adopters or applicants for parental orders (including where an order is sough for an orphan or in suspect surrogacy arrangement) who have deliberately breached the statutory provisions and regulations and engineered a case so that at final hearing the court will be presented with a fait accompli and be unable to remove the child from the applicants because of the harm it would cause the child. I have been reminded of two case in particular; in <span style="font-style:italic">In Re R (No 1)</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">(Intercountry Adoption)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 1014" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 1014</ref> the prospective adopters deliberately delayed proceedings, by prevarication, they delayed telling the local authority of the presence of the child in the jurisdiction, then caused further delay in giving information to the local authority and the court and failed to provide translations of relevant documents for the court; the court dismissed their application for an adoption order, and instead warded the child.

Once she had decided that she and Z could not return to Egypt because of the worsening situation in the country and the loss of her business and income she informed the local authority and applied to the court for an adoption order in November 2013. At no point did she seek to conceal Z&#8217;s presence in the UK from anybody or any of the British authorities including the (then) UKBA as she immediately sought an extension to Z&#8217;s visa. Any delay in the case was caused as a result of the unsuccessful attempts to engage the Egyptian authorities. I accept T&#8217;s evidence that she believed that she and K had &#8220;adopted&#8221; Z in Egypt and that Z had been placed in their/her care indefinitely; she had assumed the duties and responsibilities of a parent. It was for that reason that T had taken up temporary employment on her return, so that she could provide for herself and for Z; she placed Z in nursery so she could work; any responsible parent would have done exactly the same. T had very good reasons not to return to Egypt and, what is more, initially and for some considerable time, K agreed with her and with the plan to adopt Z as a single parent.

By Article 5 of the Child Law, adoption is prohibited, although, fosterage, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">kafala&#8221;</span>, is permissible, and occurs when a child whose parents cannot look after the child or who has no known parents is brought up by another family. An orphaned child, such as Z, is the responsibility of, and comes under the authority of, the local Foster Care Committee which is set up and appointed by the Ministry of Social Affairs. All major decisions in the child&#8217;s life are made by the local Committee which acts in loco parentis as the child&#8217;s guardian until that child reaches 18 years of age. It is understood that an adoption order made by the English courts would not be recognised or enforced in Egypt, and that the making of such an order would be considered a serious breach of the foster agreement and a grave breach of trust by the adopting parent. It has been confirmed to me that change of name or obtaining of a new nationality would most likely lead to loss of Egyptian nationality.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case there is no application to have the case decided in Egypt and the jurisdiction of the court to make decisions regarding Z has not been challenged. Any decision taken about Z, or any other child, must take into account the realities of the individual child&#8217;s situation and this has to be placed in the balance when consideration of the adoption application and the welfare evaluation is being undertaken. I have applied concepts of harm and welfare that are widely drawn and would apply to any child in a similar situation; thus, it is not disputed by the Ministry that Z would be caused harm by her removal from Z&#8217;s care as that is universally accepted that any child would be distressed and suffer some trauma as a result of being removed from the home and the care of their primary carer to whom they are obviously attached; as is the likelihood of harm caused by stigmatisation, discrimination or FGM.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the recent Court of Appeal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/793" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 793" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 793</ref>, while the court was concerned with issues that were factually different from this case (the approach to be taken in determining a child's long-term welfare once the child has become settled in a prospective adoptive home and a viable family placement is later identified) the court McFarlane LJ considered the application of the Supreme Court judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref> in that context; his observations at [68] are of some relevance here: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[68] Since the phrase "nothing else will do" was first coined in the context of public law orders for the protection of children by the Supreme Court in Re B, judges in both the High Court and Court of Appeal have cautioned professionals and courts to ensure that the phrase is applied so that it is tied to the welfare of the child as described by Baroness Hale in paragraph 215 of her judgment: "We all agree that an order compulsorily severing the ties between a child and her parents can only be made if "justified by an overriding requirement pertaining to the child's best interests". In other words, the test is one of necessity. Nothing else will do." The phrase is meaningless, and potentially dangerous, if it is applied as some freestanding, shortcut test divorced from, or even in place of, an overall evaluation of the child's welfare. Used properly, as Baroness Hale explained, the phrase "nothing else will do" is no more, nor no less, than a useful distillation of the proportionality and necessity test as embodied in the ECHR and reflected in the need to afford paramount consideration to the welfare of the child throughout her lifetime (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref>). The phrase "nothing else will do" is not some sort of hyperlink providing a direct route to the outcome of a case so as to bypass the need to undertake a full, comprehensive welfare evaluation of all of the relevant pros and cons (see Re B-S <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1146" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1146" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1146</ref>, Re R <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/715" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 715" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 715</ref> and other cases).&#8221;</span></p>

The &#8220;cons&#8221; identified by the Ministry are relevant and must be placed in the balance, as set out in more detail above and are summarised here, they are that Z will be the kept away from her country of nationality and origin; her nationality of origin will be extinguished; she will be separation from the culture into which she was born and raised previously; there will be an erosion of her connection with religion of the Republic; and separation from K. Added to them is the fact that an adoption order made in this jurisdiction will not be recognised in Egypt and is antithetical in the child&#8217;s state of birth. Together they comprise a &#8220;limping adoption&#8221; as set out by the President at paragraph [104] &#8211; [111], Black LJ at [187] &#8211; [188] and Sir Richard Aikens at [192] in <span style="font-style:italic">Re N (Children) (Adoption: Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/1112" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 1112" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 1112</ref>. </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">As Goff J said in In re B(S), in a passage quoted by the President at paragraph 88 above, that it was not necessary to prove what the child&#8217;s domicile actually is or to go into the adoption laws of the relevant foreign country because the child&#8217;s domicile is not a jurisdictional requirement and nor is the English court applying foreign law in determining the adoption application. I agree with Goff J that strict proof of domicile/domiciliary law may not be necessary for the reasons he gave. However, it seems to me imperative that, when considering whether or not to make an adoption order, the court should consider what links the child has to other countries (perhaps especially, but not necessarily only, in terms of domicile or nationality), and should consider what risk there is that any adoption order that it makes may not be universally recognised and reflect upon the practical implications of this for the child. At paragraph 104 et seq, the President has set out and commented upon the checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> and I would endorse what he has said about it. Quite apart from the express terms of the checklist which focus attention on the child&#8217;s background, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> is quite wide enough to enable, indeed require, the court to consider and weigh in the equation matters such as the possibility of a &#8220;limping&#8221; adoption order which, although fully effective in this country, might be ineffective in other countries that the child and his adopters may wish or need to visit. By way of practical example, suppose that the child and his adoptive parents return to the country of which he and his natural parents are/were nationals in order to explore his cultural roots; would the adoption order be recognised there and if not, what consequences could flow? This is not to say that an adoption order could not be made if it were to be demonstrated that it would not be recognised in a country which may be of importance for the child in future but it would be a factor that would need to be weighed in the balance, along with all the others, in deciding what order is going to be most conducive to the child&#8217;s welfare throughout his life&#8221;. </span></p>

There is no doubt that the decision not to exercise any residual discretion to assist Z in travelling to Egypt when she is older, or as an adult, for the kind of trip envisaged by Black LJ is a disadvantage to her and will be throughout her life. This situation is one that will recur in cases before the courts and not only in adoption applications, for it can happen in cases of international surrogacy. It is most acute where there remains family and other ties in the country of the child&#8217;s birth. Z has no family at all in Egypt, except in the person of K she has no connection with any other person. The disadvantage of not being able to travel to Egypt (unless the Egyptian Government decides to exercise its discretion in her favour in the future) has to be balanced against the advantages to Z throughout her life of being part of T&#8217;s family (who she already considers to be her family).   </p>

Any placement in Egypt would not have the same effect, for reasons discussed in the body of this judgement. This would include her rights of inheritance and succession as an adult. T has shown undoubted commitment to Z who is already treated as part of the extended family; she has cared for Z to the highest standards and provided for her, physically, emotionally and financially. T has provided for Z&#8217;s education by has providing her with a place in a supportive school. T has shown that she is committed to ensuring that Z retains pride in and knowledge of her roots, learns Arabic and has made provision for Z to follow in the Islamic faith. In addition, the court takes cognizance of the fact that T has not wavered in pursuing this application at personal and financial cost. In this case an adoption order is a legal manifestation of T&#8217;s commitment to provide Z with a family and a place in the wider world which recognises where she came from; it provides a considerable foundation on which to base her childhood and from which she can grow safely and securely into adulthood and beyond; in considering Z&#8217;s life-long welfare, it is this adoption that is most likely to provide her with the most secure emotional and psychological base and family life that will endure into her womanhood.</p>
