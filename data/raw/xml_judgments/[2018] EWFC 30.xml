On 27 July 2017 Mr Justice Moor made a final order which required payment by the respondent of a large sum. He was also ordered to pay the applicant&#8217;s costs. The respondent did not comply. The applicant initiated enforcement proceedings. Those came before me on 10 April 2018 when a consent order was made which provided for the means of payment of the sums due. On 25 April 2018 I varied one of the time limits in the consent order.</p>

He said that only the High Court could make a charging order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Feehan QC produced a note on 24 April 2018 which explained that the proceedings had started with an application before a High Court Judge for a freezing order. The order was made on 15 February 2017 by Mr Justice Cobb and is headed &#8220;In the High Court of Justice, Family Division&#8221;. Further interlocutory orders, so headed, were made by Ms Justice Russell on 8 March 2017, by Mr Justice Holman on 4 May 2017, and by Mr Justice Bodey on 27 June 2017.  However, the final order of Mr Justice Moor on 27 July 2017 is headed &#8220;In the Family Court&#8221;, as is his judgment. It is not possible to tell in which court this case took place.</p>

My own order of 10 April 2018 is so headed, I having been assured by Mr Feehan QC that the enforcement proceedings had been properly issued in the High Court.</p>

He accepts that enforcement proceedings are within the powers of the family court but asserts that because an order for sale of the charged properties would be sought it was right that the enforcement application was brought in the High Court, since FPR PD 40A para 4.1 appears to suggest that only the High Court can order the sale of a property subjected to a charging order.   </p>

The proper course is to re-allocate the case for hearing in the family court by a &#8220;judge of High Court level&#8221; or, if appropriate, a judge of the Family Division. It is, for example, virtually impossible to conceive of a divorce or financial remedy case which needs to be transferred from the family court to the High Court (para 30(c)).</p>

FPR 33.1 states that the rules about enforcement in that Part apply to an application made in the High Court and the family court to enforce an order made in family proceedings. The specific relief sought by the applicants was a host of charging orders. FPR 40.4(1) states: &#8220;An application [for a charging order] must be made to the family court or to the High Court, as appropriate &#8230;&#8221;. But this is subject to FPR 5.4, so unless there are already proceedings in the High Court, the application must be made in the family court. </p>

It does, however, permit the use of the High Court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction to make incidental or supplemental orders to give effect to decisions within the jurisdiction of the family court. Thus, for example, the family court can: (a) issue a bench warrant to secure the attendance of a judgment creditor at an enforcement hearing: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re K (Remo: Power of Magistrates to issue Bench Warrant)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2017/27" uk:canonical="[2017] EWFC 27" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWFC 27</ref>); and (b) require a party to use his or her best endeavours to procure the release of the other party from mortgage covenants: see <span style="font-style:italic">CH v WH</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/2379" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 2379 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 2379 (Fam)</ref>.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment this analysis applies equally to an application for a sale following a charging order. It is a supplemental order giving effect to the substantive order. If such an application is stated to be reserved to the High Court by procedural rules then the family court manifestly has jurisdiction to make such an order, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>E(1)(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>. Therefore, pursuant to CPR 73.10C(3) that application must be made to the family court, it being the court that made (or should have made) the charging order. As drafted FPR PD40A para 4.1 is misleading. It is not to be construed as saying that only the High Court or the county court can order a sale of property the subject of a charging order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case is a classic example of lawyers rushing off to the High Court at the first sign of complexity.  This is a practice that must cease. The family court must be recognised as the sole forum for resolution of all family cases save for those specified in the Schedule to the President&#8217;s Guidance.</p>
