However, when one delved beneath these spoken words it was clear the sentiments expressed were hollow and unfounded.  The mother, like the father, does not regret any of her past actions during the course of these proceedings: she does not regret fleeing with A to the USA, later joined by the father, to give birth to B and she does not regret concealing the birth of C. She, like the father, does regret and resents the involvement of the local authority in her life and these court proceedings. She, like him, does not even begin to understand or accept the significant harm the children have suffered in their care and the significant harm they would each be at risk of suffering if they were returned to the parents&#8217; care in the future. I consider, the prospects of the mother making any positive changes for the better are remote, whether in the short, medium or long term.  </p>
