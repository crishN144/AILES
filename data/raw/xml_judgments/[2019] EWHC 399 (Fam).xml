	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 10th December 2018 I made orders pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, sitting in the Family Division, concerning Mr Douglas Meyers. All have agreed that Mr Meyers should be referred to by his full name. He has no wish to be anonymised and he considers, as do I, that the issues raised in this application require fully to be in the public domain. He is however, very keen to protect his son, who will not be named. The December orders required Mr Meyers to reside at a Care Home. To protect the privacy of other vulnerable residents at that establishment I do not intend to identify it. I made further interim orders preventing Mr Meyers from living in the bungalow which has been his home for 40 years. I also expressly prevented him from living with his son, who I intend to refer to as KF.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The application came before me in a very busy urgent applications list. In so far as it was truly urgent it had become so because opportunities for more timely and reflective intervention had been missed. Mr Meyers was unable to attend the court in person but participated effectively and in a forthright manner via a telephone link. I was greatly impressed by his contribution at that hearing. Mr Meyers is approaching his 98<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. He served throughout World War II in the Royal Navy. He did so with considerable distinction and is decorated. He is rightly proud of his own contribution and has a strong belief in the fundamental principles that were being fought for. Chief amongst those objectives, he reminds me, was the right to freedom. It is his own freedom that he considers he is now fighting for. His additional personal goal is to receive a telegram from Her Majesty the Queen on his 100<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. I record this fact because I consider it casts real light on his attitude to the future and life generally.  </p>

With courteous respect to the other residents he told me that they are <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;all suffering from dementia&#8217;</span> of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;one kind or another&#8217;</span>.   He finds this rather depressing and retreats to his room to listen to Radio 4 and the World Service. He tells me that he keeps up to date on current affairs and shared with me his views on Brexit. There are members of staff at the home whose company Mr Meyers rather enjoys and whilst he does not rhapsodise about the food he makes no complaint. In simple terms he wanted to go home and in time for Christmas. Though he was in a parlous state when first received in to the Care Home he is now entirely capacitious and, for his age, in rude, indeed, in remarkable health.  He is however, blind, a little hard of hearing and diabetic.  </p>

They identified damage caused by KF to the bungalow and the extremely aggressive and intimidating manner in which KF behaved towards carers.  </p>

The Local Authority sought a declaration that, having done all that was reasonably practical to provide Mr Meyers with care, it had discharged all duties owed by them to him.  </p>

Moor J. concluded that the Local Authority would be entitled to the declaration sought if Mr Meyers and KF did not vacate the property within 14 days and ordered that the declaration should take effect on 12 May 2017 in the event that either Mr Meyers and/or KF failed to vacate the property. Full renovations on the property were completed on 25 July 2017, including new electrical wiring, fresh plastering and painting and the installation of a new wetroom and kitchen. Mr Meyers and KF returned home following completion of the works.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In the event, the Local Authority was not able to secure carers to support Mr Meyers on his return home, due to the problems associated with both his own but primarily KF&#8217;s behaviour in the past. The extensive enquires taken by the Local Authority to secure a care agency are set out in the third statement of David Gibbons, Adult Social Care Department, dated 9 May 2018. Mr Meyers was offered the opportunity to return to the Care Home until care services could be secured or alternatively to visit the Care Home several times a week to be supported with personal tasks. He rejected both offers. The Authority&#8217;s social workers therefore commenced weekly welfare visits. At this hearing I have heard evidence concerning those and subsequent visits which I found to be deeply troubling and will return to below.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">After extensive negotiations, &#8216;START&#8217;, a care agency which had provided care to Mr Meyers in the past, agreed to re-implement a package of support predicated on the condition that the Local Authority agreed to purchase personal safety devices for &#8216;START&#8217; care staff to wear. They did so. &#8216;START&#8217; began daily visits to Mr Meyers on 20 November 2017. On 6 December 2017, &#8216;START&#8217; advised the Authority that due to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;constant intimidating behaviour&#8217;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;aggressive outbursts&#8217;</span> from KF and to what they described as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the uncooperative and disengaging behaviour of Mr Meyers&#8217; </span>they were withdrawing care services. The third witness statement of Mr Gibbons sets out, in detail, the occasions, during this period, when KF was intimidating towards staff and several occasions when Mr Meyers refused care and asked carers to leave the property. I should also record that the property was very cold, without any heating or hot water. There was no money available on the gas meter payment card and the emergency credit had been used. Mr Meyers appeared to be very hungry and his behaviour seemed erratic.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Since the withdrawal of services by &#8216;START&#8217; the Authority&#8217;s social workers stepped in to provide weekly welfare visits. Mr Gibbons&#8217; third witness statement sets out further instances of intimidating behaviour by KF towards social workers and a description of the deteriorating condition of the property. Pictures of the condition of the property, as at 20 April 2018, have been provided and reveal a very dangerous environment for Mr Meyers. The phrase &#8216;death trap&#8217; has been used and, in my judgement, accurately so. By May 2018 it had become clear to the Local Authority that Mr Meyers did not want its help or intervention. In any event, it had not been possible for the Local Authority to secure a contract with another care provider willing to run the gauntlet at the bungalow. Offers of respite, support and placements made to Mr Meyers were all refused. Believing that they could do nothing further, the Local Authority issued an application seeking the declaration, referred to above, i.e. the confirmation by the court that they had discharged all their legal responsibilities.  Moor J. was satisfied that he should grant the declaration and did so at a hearing on 5 June 2018.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Predictably, by September 2018, Mr Meyers and KF appeared to be struggling to cope. Mr Meyers had a number of hospital admissions and was contacting Care Line on a regular basis, reporting that he had not eaten nor had anything to drink. Matters came to a head on 27 September 2018 when Mr Meyers called Care Line 15 times, prompting a visit from the Local Authority. The description of the scene that confronted the Local Authority is set out in the first witness statement of Helen Cummings, dated 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2018.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is reported that the bungalow had no furniture and that Mr Meyers had neither sheets nor mattress and was effectively sleeping on wooden slats. For reasons which are unexplained, the glass panes from the patio doors had been removed leaving Mr Meyers&#8217; room exposed to the cold. Again, for reasons which are unclear but I suspect are a facet of KF&#8217;s own psychological distress, the boiler had been dismantled and there was, accordingly, neither heating nor hot water. There was no cooker, kettle, cups, fridge. There was very little by way of food. There is evidence of these household items having been burnt in the garden. Mr Meyers had not eaten, he was dehydrated and had a urinary tract infection. His mobility had deteriorated and the extent of clutter throughout the bungalow and on the floor left him in a precarious situation. Instinctively, I resist describing Mr Meyers&#8217; circumstances in graphic detail to avoid compromising his dignity, but, in order that my analysis and ultimately my decision can properly be understood, it is important that I record some key facts.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Meyers was naked from the waist down. It has emerged, during the course of this hearing, that this was frequently the situation when the Local Authority had visited in the preceding months (see para 9 above). He was surrounded by flies. Under the bed and on the floor, there was food, general clutter, blood and faeces. This desperate situation, I have been told, had been observed on a number of visits. Mr Meyers had trouble sitting and this remained difficult even when he was provided with a pillow. He reported that he had neither food nor drink for two days. He was certainly dehydrated. The urinary tract infection had led to hallucinations. He had not been taking his antibiotics. He was deeply resistant to returning to the Care Home. It took the social worker five hours to persuade him to do so. Ms Cummings points out that as a diabetic Mr Meyers&#8217; skin is always at risk of deterioration. As such, a bed sore which becomes septic can quickly put Mr Meyers&#8217; life at risk. In her statement, Ms Cummings makes the following observation which requires to be set out: </p>

The matter came before Francis J, who made an order restraining Mr Meyers from returning to his home or living with KF. Mr Meyers was also required, pursuant to the Court&#8217;s order, to live at the identified Care Home pending further order.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>There seems to have been little doubt, at this point, that Mr Meyers lacked the capacity to take decisions regarding his general welfare in consequence of the temporary disabling effects of the dehydration and urinary tract infection.  </p>

Mr Meyers also stated in unambiguous terms that he did not want KF to continue to live with him. He also made it clear that he would not return to live at his home until the next hearing. The injunctive relief granted on 28 September 2018 was continued and the matter was listed for a further hearing.  </p>

I was not prepared to take a final decision in December in a busy urgent applications list and I made interim orders preventing Mr Meyers residing at the bungalow or with his son.

There has been at least one occasion when Mr Meyers has locked his room to keep his son out. KF has regularly attended to visit his father at the Care Home. He is no longer permitted to enter because of his aggressive behaviour but Mr Meyers goes outside and sits in the garden with him. He has done this on most days throughout the winter months. Recently, in January, KF gave his father a shave in the garden. Whilst the staff have properly been concerned about Mr Meyers sitting in the cold for long periods there is, nonetheless, something rather tender in the relationship. </p>

Certainly, it is 'amorphous' (see paragraph 14 above) and, to the extent that the High Court has repeatedly been able to utilise it to make provision for children and vulnerable adults not otherwise protected by statute, can, I suppose be described as 'pervasive'.  But it is not 'ubiquitous' in the sense that it's reach is all-pervasive or unlimited.  Precisely because it's powers are not based either in statute or in the common law it requires to be used sparingly and in a way, that is faithful to its evolution.  It is for this reason that any application by a Local Authority to invoke the inherent jurisdiction may not be made as of right but must surmount the hurdle of an application for leave pursuant to s100 (4) and meet the criteria there.&#8221; </span></p>

It appears that Ms Scott concedes that Mr Meyers falls within the category of vulnerability entirely in consequence of this disability. I do not consider, even for a moment, that Munby J&#8217;s descriptive indications were intended to imply that all those who are blind are necessarily vulnerable and fall within the potential reach of the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdictional powers. I doubt that Ms Scott is intending to do so either but her reasoning is, if she will forgive me for saying so, too reductive. I do not consider that it is the fact of Mr Meyers&#8217; blindness that renders him vulnerable. On the contrary, it struck me that he confronts it with courage and with the characteristic phlegmatism of his generation. The sight of one eye has been lost for medical reasons but Mr Meyers joked that he had simply &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">outlived&#8217; </span>the other eye. This signalled to me a resistance, on his part, to despondency and down heartedness and a resilience both to his blindness and to the privations of old age generally.  </p>

The evidence of Dr Francis to this effect merely confirms my own impression. In interview with Dr Francis Mr Meyers was lucid analytical and insightful. He disclosed a number of illuminating facts: he has seven children; his eldest daughter threatened that the siblings would not have any contact with him if he continued to allow KF to live with him. Mr Meyers stated that he misses his children and would like to reconnect with them. He expressed the view that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;because [KF] is here, I lost out on everything, like a fool I still protected him, I wanted to help him but no more&#8221;</span> Mr Meyers reported that KF uses illicit drugs. These were initially, he said, for pain control but has now <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;become out of hand&#8221;. </span>He told Dr Francis that KF is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;addicted and needs help&#8221;</span>.

It was no doubt in recognition of KF&#8217;s own vulnerability that the younger Mr Meyers promised his terminally ill wife that he would look after him. In recent months and with consistency, Mr Meyers has been clear in expressing a wish to return to the bungalow to live with KF. That was the position articulated by him in the December hearing and again, at this hearing in February. Ms Dresner has described the relationship as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;co-dependent&#8221;</span>. By this, I take her to mean a primarily emotional inter-dependence. Everything that Mr Meyers says about his health and future indicates a man with a real resolve to live and thrive. His attitude to the diminishment of age is unfailingly positive. With limited sight and mobility, he nonetheless grabs all that is available to him with enthusiasm. He is interested in and engages with the world and the issues of the day. He has participated in these proceedings with real commitment. He displays his medals with pride and responds to the court in a way that reveals a real respect for the rule of law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The history of this case demonstrates that Mr Meyers&#8217; attitude to his son vacillates and is essentially ambivalent. I do not doubt that there is strong paternal love, alongside a real dependency on KF as the only family Mr Meyers perceives to be left to him. I have not seen any evidence of KF forcing his father, either physically or verbally to act against his will but I am clear that the intensity of this relationship occludes Mr Meyers&#8217;s ability to take rational and informed decisions. Mr Meyers, is, as I have said, determined to keep well and strong. His ambition to reach 100 years of age is keenly felt. The life force beats strongly within him. Return to the bungalow, whilst his son remains living there and in the absence of an appropriate package of care, as the Local Authority correctly submits, jeopardises Mr Meyers life in a real and not merely theoretical sense. When Mr Meyers left the bungalow he was malnourished, dehydrated and hallucinating in consequence of an infection. He nonetheless managed to raise the alarm. Next time he might not be so fortunate. Though he says he is, in effect, prepared to take the risk (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I would rather die as a result of [KF] than live a life without [him]&#8221;) </span>I cannot easily reconcile this with Mr Meyers&#8217; lusty and vigorous attitude to life generally. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">KF is needy, irrational, frequently out of control as well as manifestly emotionally dependent on a father who, despite the alarming history of this case, he obviously loves. KF&#8217;s influence on his father is insidious and pervasive. It triggers Mr Meyers&#8217;s sense of duty, guilt, love and responsibility.  These, in my assessment, are pronounced facets of Mr Meyers&#8217;s character, reflected in a different way in his sense of duty, love for his country and pride in his medals. In this particular context however, these admirable features of his personality have become confused and distorted in a relationship in which the two men have become so enmeshed that the autonomy of each has been compromised. In reality, KF exerts an influence over his father which is malign in its effect if not in its intention. The consequence is to disable Mr Meyers from making a truly informed decision which impacts directly on his health and survival.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am profoundly sympathetic not only to Mr Meyers&#8217;s challenging circumstances but to his eloquent assertion of his right to take his own decisions, even though objectively they may be regarded as foolhardy. As I emphasised in <span style="font-weight:bold">Redbridge London Borough Council v A </span>(supra), I instinctively recoil from intervening in the decision making of a capacitious adult. However well motivated the State may be in seeking, paternalistically, to protect people from their own unwise decisions, it is a dangerous course which has the potential to threaten fundamental rights and freedoms. Again, as I said in Redbridge London Borough Council v A, the inherent jurisdiction is not ubiquitous and should be utilised sparingly. Here Mr Meyers&#8217; life requires to be protected and I consider that, ultimately, the State has an obligation to do so. Additionally, it is important to recognise that the treatment of Mr Meyers has not merely been neglectful but abusive and corrosive of his dignity. To the extent that the Court&#8217;s decision encroaches on Mr Meyers&#8217; personal autonomy it is, I believe, a justified and proportionate intervention. The preservation of a human life will always weigh heavily when evaluating issues of this kind. </p>

For the avoidance of any doubt, Mr Meyers may live in his own bungalow, with an appropriate package of supportive care, conditional upon his son&#8217;s exclusion from the property. This, to my mind, is the desirable outcome to this case. In this way I restrict Mr Meyers&#8217;s autonomy only to the degree that is necessary to protect him, a measure which I have concluded is a proportionate interference with his Article 8 rights. As I have analysed above, it is the dysfunctional relationship between Mr Meyers and his son that serves to occlude his decision-making processes, concerning where and with whom he should live. The real issue is whether the framework of an order, giving effect to this, constitutes a deprivation of liberty at all. I am clear it does not.

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.46in"><span style="font-style:italic">The Court recalls that in proclaiming the "right to liberty", paragraph 1 of Article 5 (art. 5-1) is contemplating the physical liberty of the person; its aim is to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of this liberty in an arbitrary fashion. As was pointed out by those appearing before the Court, the paragraph is not concerned with mere restrictions on liberty of movement; such restrictions are governed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2) which has not been ratified by Italy. In order to determine whether someone has been "deprived of his liberty" within the meaning of Article 5 (art. 5), the starting point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see the Engel and others judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 24, par. 58-59).&#8221; </span></p>

The case law establishes that the court must consider a broad canvas of factual considerations, such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measures in contemplation. (see: <span style="font-weight:bold">Medvedyev and Others v France 3394/03 [2010] ECHR 384 (29 March 2010). </span> This requirement, i.e. to take account of the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;type&#8217;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;manner of implementation&#8217;</span> of the contemplated measures, enables the court to survey the specific context and the wider circumstances surrounding types of restriction rather than the paradigm of confinement in a cell. The context in which the measures are taken is an important factor. The European case law identifies how situations commonly occur in contemporary society where the public may be called upon to endure restrictions on freedom of movement or liberty in the interests of a common good.<span style="font-size:10pt"> See: </span><span style="font-weight:bold">Nada v Switzerland 10593/08 [2012] ECHR 1691</span>;<span style="font-size:10pt"/><span style="font-weight:bold">Austin and Others v The United Kingdom 39692/09 [2012] ECHR 459. </span></p>

It may be that those rights have sometimes to be limited or restricted because of their disabilities, but the starting point should be the same as that for everyone else. This flows inexorably from the universal character of human rights, founded on the inherent dignity of all human beings, and is confirmed in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Far from disability entitling the state to deny such people human rights: rather it places upon the state (and upon others) the duty to make reasonable accommodation to cater for the special needs of those with disabilities.  </span></p>

This is not a right to do or to go where one pleases. It is a more focussed right, not to be deprived of that physical liberty. But, as it seems to me, what it means to be deprived of liberty must be the same for everyone, whether or not they have physical or mental disabilities. If it would be a deprivation of my liberty to be obliged to live in a particular place, subject to constant monitoring and control, only allowed out with close supervision, and unable to move away without permission even if such an opportunity became available, then it must also be a deprivation of the liberty of a disabled person. The fact that my living arrangements are comfortable, and indeed make my life as enjoyable as it could possibly be, should make no difference. A gilded cage is still a cage.&#8221; </span></p>

To safeguard him, by invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, it is necessary to restrict the scope and ambit of his choices, not his liberty. It is important to highlight that there remain a range of options open to him. The impact of the Court&#8217;s intervention is to limit Mr Meyers&#8217;s accommodation options but it does not deprive of his physical liberty which is the essence of the right guaranteed by Article 5. </p>

I am bound to say that I do not see that this should represent an insuperable challenge, even anticipating, as I do, that Mr Meyers may not cooperate. To the extent that this interferes with his Article 8 rights it is, again as I have indicated above, a necessary and proportionate intervention. I propose that the Order should be drafted in terms which provide for these restrictions.  </p>

The Local Authority must now investigate, whether KF can be removed from the bungalow, by court order, so that Mr Meyers may return with a suitable package of care. Every effort should be made to promote a healthier relationship between Mr Meyers and his son. Finally, I have read that Mr Meyers&#8217;s youngest daughter may have expressed an interest in seeing her father. I hope so. More than that I regard it as intrinsic to the Local Authority&#8217;s duties here actively to promote the reunification of this family to support the care arrangements. The State working alone in cases like this can never be as effective as when working constructively and cooperatively with the family. The wider family may be able to unlock the unhealthy interdependency between Mr Meyers and his son, given the time, the space and the support to do so.</p>

I do not consider it has done so. I do not intend to be prescriptive as to what the Local Authority should do. Ms Scott however, has asked for clarification and I am happy to assist her. The ideal solution here, it seems to me, would be for Mr Meyers to return to his bungalow with a suitable package of support, his son having been excluded from the property. I should hope that the Local Authority will endeavour, within the framework of appropriate injunctive relief, to make provision for contact between Mr Meyers and his son. I will hear from counsel on the phrasing of the order.</p>
