	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.65in">During the course of contested financial remedy proceedings adult beneficiaries of a number of offshore discretionary trusts were joined as parties on their application: see my judgment <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2012/4277" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 4277 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 4277 (Fam)</ref>.  Subsequently, I made an order that these beneficiaries, as parties, should disclose copies of documents which had been provided to them for the purposes of an application which had been made to the Royal Court of Jersey by the trustee of some of those trusts.  The Royal Court had given the beneficiaries permission to make such disclosure, if they were ordered to do so by this court.  But, in doing so, the Royal Court expressed a number of concerns (as referred to later in this judgment) and invited this court not to require such disclosure.  The financial remedy proceedings have been resolved by a consent order but I have been requested by the parties to give a judgment dealing with my order for disclosure.  I also need to explain my decision to order disclosure given the terms of the Royal Court&#8217;s judgment, now reported at [2012] (2) JLR 51.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.65in">The focus of the wife&#8217;s claim, in reliance on the sharing principle, was the wealth held within what have been termed the &#8216;Category 3 Trusts&#8217; (&#8220;the Trusts&#8221;) &#8211; at one point worth &#163;360 million but said to have reduced to &#163;130 million.  These Trusts hold significant assets located within this jurisdiction, albeit a relatively small percentage of the total within the Trusts.  The Trusts were settled by the husband&#8217;s father in 2008, the assets deriving from previous settlements which had been distributed to the husband&#8217;s father.  These assets included, in particular, very substantial funds generated during the course of the marriage and previously held within a discretionary trust settled by the husband some years prior to the marriage, the original beneficiaries of which had been the husband, his spouse or widow and his children and remoter issue.  In 2005 changes had been effected to this earlier trust (and other trusts) by which the husband and his spouse had been excluded as beneficiaries, the former exclusion being revocable while the latter was irrevocable.  The reasoning behind these changes was one of the factual issues in the case. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.65in">As referred to above, in 2008 the Trusts were settled by the husband&#8217;s father.  It was the husband&#8217;s case that this restructuring of the trust structure was undertaken principally for tax reasons.  The wife&#8217;s case was that, even if there were tax reasons, in addition the husband sought to try to appear further to distance himself from wealth which he had generated and which had been held in the trust (referred to above) of which he and, following the marriage, the wife had until 2005 been expressly within the class of beneficiaries.  It was her case that this wealth is or could be made available to the husband.</p>

Neither the husband nor the wife is named as beneficiaries but each of them could be added to the class of beneficiaries.  If the husband was added as a beneficiary, the wife could not under the terms of all but one of the trusts be made a beneficiary; and vice-versa.</p>

In respect of the former, the Jersey trustee applied to the Royal Court for approval of its decisions (a) not to submit to the jurisdiction of the English court and (b) to disclose information about the Trusts&#8217; assets to the husband&#8217;s father in the knowledge that he was likely to disclose it to the husband.  These decisions were approved by the court at a hearing in private on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2011.

This was in respect of both the issues referred to in paragraph 8 above but in particular the latter, as the critical question for the court to determine would be whether the trustees were likely immediately or in the foreseeable future to exercise their powers in favour of or in some way for the benefit of the husband.</p>

	      <p class="BlockText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.99in">"[12]<marker name="tab"/><marker name="tab"/>There has been some debate at the hearing of this appeal as to the nature of the central question which, in this not unusual situation, the court hearing an application for ancillary relief should seek to determine.  Superficially the question is easily framed as being whether the trust is a financial 'resource' of the husband for the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25(2)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> ...  But what does the word 'resource' mean in this context?  In my view, when properly focused, that central question is simply whether, if the husband were to request it to advance the whole (or part) of the capital of the trust to him, the trustee would be likely to do so.  In other cases the question has been formulated in terms of whether the spouse has real or effective control over the trust.  At times I have myself formulated it in that way.  But, unless the situation is one in which there is a ground for doubting whether the trustee is properly discharging its duties or would be likely to do so, it seems to me on reflection that such a formulation is not entirely apposite.</p>

The qualification relates to the word 'immediate'.  In that case the trial judge knew that, if he was to proceed also to order the wife to pay the husband's costs, she would be unable to comply with his orders for her swift payment of a lump sum and costs without recourse to the off-shore trusts over which he found her to have 'effective control' ...  So the question in that case was whether her access to their funds was immediate.  In principle, however, in the light of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25(2)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1973, the question is surely whether the trustee would be likely to advance the capital immediately or in the foreseeable future."</p>

That represents an acknowledgement by Parliament that if justice is to be achieved between spouses at divorce the court must be equipped, in a society where the forms of wealth holding are diverse and often sophisticated, to penetrate outer forms and get to the heart of ownership.  For their part, the judges who administer this jurisdiction have traditionally accepted the Shakespearean principle that &#8216;it is excellent to have a giant&#8217;s strength but tyrannous to use it like a giant&#8217;.  The precise boundaries of that judicial self-restraint have never been rigidly defined &#8211; nor could they be.</p>

Nor will it put upon a third party undue pressure to act in a way which will enhance the means of the maintaining spouse.  This does not, however, mean that the court acts in total disregard of the potential availability of wealth from sources owned or administered by others.  There will be occasions when it becomes permissible for a judge deliberately to frame his orders in a form which afford judicious encouragement to third parties to provide the maintaining spouse with the means to comply with the court's view of the justice of the case.  There are bound to be instances where the boundary between improper pressure and judicious encouragement proves to be a fine one and it will require attention to the particular circumstances of each case to see whether it has been crossed."</p>

In that situation if the court decides that it would be reasonable for a husband to seek to persuade trustees to release more capital or income to him to enable him to make proper financial provision for his children and his former wife, the court would not, in so deciding, be putting improper pressure on the trustees."</p>

In the absence of this evidence from the trustee, the judge at trial in England will have to draw inferences as to the likelihood that the respondent has access to the trust fund.  In the nature of things the inferences drawn might not be accurate.  If they are not accurate, they would be likely to lead to one or other of the petitioner and respondent, both of whom are beneficiaries, being treated on a false basis by the English court.  In those circumstances, it seems to me that it could be open to the trustee to regard it as being positively in the interests of the beneficiaries that it should provide the evidence sought.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="BlockText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The English court&#8217;s decision in this case, at the trial of the financial remedy application, would have depended very significantly on the court&#8217;s determination of the two issues referred to above including the extent to which, if at all, the resources held within the Trusts are resources likely to be available to the husband and as such part of his resources for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>.  I appreciate that the husband would first have to be added, with the consent of the protector, to the class of beneficiaries but the likelihood of this occurring would be part of the factual determination &#8211; as was the case in <span style="font-style:italic">Whaley v Whaley</span>.  What the trustee considers to be in the best interests of the beneficiaries, and why, are, I would suggest, essential elements of this, factual, determination because it is the trustee who controls the availability of this wealth through the exercise of its discretion.  The trustee&#8217;s reasons for coming to its conclusion &#8211; its thinking &#8211; are highly relevant to this determination.  This evidence can also significantly inform the issue of whether the Trusts are nuptial.</p>

I would refer again to <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">RK v RK</span>.  In the latter, the trustees gave direct evidence explaining why they had reached their decision which I found, very substantially, to have been a reasonable position for them to reach.  In contrast in <span style="font-style:italic">Whaley</span> the trustee did not give direct evidence and the court found the trust assets to be resources available to the husband.  That case also demonstrated the regrettable experience of a trustee found to have assisted a party to proceedings in putting forward an inaccurate case of wealth denial.  Such an experience is not unique and trustees either positively, or passively by not participating, can and sometimes do assist (aid and abet) a party to English financial remedy proceedings when that party puts forward an inaccurate picture.  I am not suggesting that such was the situation in the present case but it is part of the landscape in which such litigation takes place.</p>

	    <p class="BlockText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">As referred to above, at present there is very little evidence which bears directly on the issue of whether and if so how the trustees might, or would not, decide to benefit the husband.  There is a letter of wishes &#8211; which is broad in its nature &#8211; and the bare assertion in the Affidavit filed by one of the adult beneficiaries that:</p>

On the current state of the evidence it would seem likely that the English court would be forced to rely on assumptions and inferences.  As referred to earlier in this judgment, this is not the optimum manner in which to achieve justice not only for the husband and the wife but also for the beneficiaries.</p>

During the course of the hearing Mr Hagen submitted that the trustee&#8217;s thinking as to what it considers to be in the best interests of the beneficiaries is &#8220;absolutely of the essence in this claim&#8221;.  Whilst this might be overstating it, he makes a powerful point in that the trustee&#8217;s views of what is in the best interests of the beneficiaries is likely to be significant evidence on the critical issue of the extent to which the resources in the Trusts are resources available to the husband and also in respect of whether they are nuptial settlements.  Mr Hagen made further submissions, by reference to documents from the Jersey proceedings disclosed from the BVI proceedings, that the Jersey material might be expected to assist this court in determining the issues in the case.  He was also able to make the point that the Royal Court refers to the interests of comity in circumstances where that Court has approved the trustee&#8217;s decision not to participate in the English proceedings although properly joined as a party.</p>

It may be that I have but, given the lack of evidence from the trustee as to its likely approach to the exercise of its powers, any evidence which appears to give the prospect of providing a window into this factual issue is relevant evidence potentially of considerable significance.  I repeat that, despite what the Royal Court says in paragraph 22 and whilst acknowledging that I do not know what disclosure was ordered at the earlier hearing, the information provided to the English court seems to me to contain limited evidence directly addressing the issue of the likelihood of the husband benefiting from the Trusts.</p>

I should also add that I, of course, recognise the specific concerns which flow from trustees being able and required to apply confidentially to the court for directions.  </p>

Given the circumstances of this case, such evidence was not likely to be forthcoming from any other source.  This extends to why the trustee did not consider it to be in the interests of the beneficiaries for the trustee actively to challenge the wife&#8217;s claims within these proceedings, either as a party or as a witness, when those claims are said to be, factually, wholly without merit and when the Trusts hold significant wealth within this jurisdiction.  As I have remarked on previous occasions and, I hope without naivety or irony, I remain puzzled as to why such a trustee should not consider it in the interests of the beneficiaries to provide the evidence which will rebut a case if the trustee has that evidence available to it; to adopt Coleridge J&#8217;s words &#8211; when it would be likely to have been able to produce evidence from its files to that effect.  If it does not, as referred to above, the English court will be left to draw inferences and make assumptions.</p>

Because the proceedings settled before any further substantive hearing took place I do not know what the material comprised.  However, given the circumstances of this case, I do not see that my order should, and would hope that it does not, impede or undermine the interests of comity.  In any event, I would also hope that co-operation between the English court and the Royal Court of Jersey, and other courts, in cases in which wealth is held in trusts or other similar vehicles will continue to develop.  Such co-operation should not undermine legitimate wealth protection but, I would suggest, in the context of financial remedy proceedings would assist the interests of justice for not only spouses and civil partners but also for trusts and beneficiaries.</p>
