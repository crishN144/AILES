The basis of M&#8217;s application is that she says they were made without jurisdiction. The child&#8217;s father is F. F supports M&#8217;s application.

Mr Justice Moor found at the conclusion of a fact-finding hearing in 2014, that the father had injured his first child, S, on a number of occasions; the last resulting in her death. The mother of S was found to have failed to protect her. Their second child was removed from their care and made subject to care and placement orders.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As a direct result of the findings Mr Justice Moor made against the father, the local authority undertook pre-birth assessments in relation to D and instigated all proper avenues of child protection discussion and enquiries. In the latter stages of that process, the mother had the benefit of a solicitor experienced in child protection. The judgments of Mr Justice Moor were shared with the family to ensure a proper factual basis for future working. At the end of the process of assessment, the conclusion within the local authority was that the mother was vulnerable by reasons of her own background and was unlikely to be a protective factor as she and the maternal family believed the findings of Mr Justice Moor were wrong and that the father was innocent as he claimed. The local authority therefore proposed a safety plan. A child protection case conference was to be held to see if the mother could parent the baby-to-be D away from the father. If that could be achieved then the risk assessment would focus on the father and what, if any role, he should play in the baby&#8217;s life. That plan was communicated to the mother.</p>

She left the UK and travelled to Iraq where she was met by the paternal family. The mother told the midwife she intended to return to the UK on 19 September 2019 and told her own solicitor she would return on 18 September 2019. </p>

On 18 October 2019, the court was informed that the order had been executed against the father and his passport and travel documents had been seized. The Tipstaff also managed to obtain the first real information about the child. Her name was confirmed and she was with her mother and paternal aunt in Northern Iraq. </p>

In fact, the father&#8217;s case has always been that he and his wife intended for their child to be born in the United Kingdom and be raised here and that was the evidence the father gave on oath.

In the meantime, I required the father to file in full his reasons for objecting to the wardship order; his position on the provision of a restricted travel document for his daughter; his reasons for requiring release of his own travel documents and any objection he may have for the release of his asylum application which the Home Office was at that time considering in relation to him.

Therefore, I decided on 18 March 2021 that no separate penalty was required. However, in relation to costs, I ordered him to pay &#163;1000 towards the costs of the local authority. I did so because the evidence he produced could have been produced much earlier, in line with the orders of HHJ Lloyd and Mr Justice Francis.

In answering that question, the Supreme Court decided that presence was a necessary precursor for habitual residence, with Baroness Hale stating the following at paragraph 55:</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">So which approach accords most closely with the factual situation of the child - an approach which holds that presence is a necessary precursor to residence and thus to habitual residence or an approach which focusses on the relationship between the child and his primary carer? In my view, it is the former. It is one thing to say that a child's integration in the place where he is at present depends on the degree of integration of his primary carer. It is another thing to say that he can be integrated in a place to which his primary carer has never taken him. It is one thing to say that a person can remain habitually resident in a country from which he is temporarily absent. It is another thing to say that a person can acquire a habitual residence without ever setting foot in a country. It is one thing to say that a child is integrated in the family environment of his primary carer and siblings. It is another thing to say that he is also integrated into the social environment of a country where he has never been.&#8221;</span></p>

The common law rules as to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court continue to apply. There is no doubt that this jurisdiction can be exercised if the child is a British national. The original basis of the jurisdiction was that the child owed allegiance to the Crown and in return the Crown had a protective or parens patriae jurisdiction over the child wherever he was. As Lord Cranworth LC explained in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hope v Hope (1854) 4 De GM &amp; G 328</span><span style="font-style:italic">, 344&#8212;345: The jurisdiction of this court, which is entrusted to the holder of the Great Seal as the representative of the Crown, with regard to the custody of infants rests upon this ground, that it is the interest of the state and of the Sovereign that children should be properly brought up and educated; and according to the principle of our law, the Sovereign, as parens patriae, is bound to look to the maintenance and education (as far as it has the means of judging) of all his subjects. The first question then is, whether this principle applies to children born out of the allegiance of the Crown; and I confess that I do not entertain any doubt upon the point, because the moment that it is established by statute that the children of a natural born father born out of the Queens allegiance are to all intents and purposes to be treated as British born subjects, of course it is clear that one of the incidents of a British born subject is, that he or she is entitled to the protection of the Crown, as parens patriae.</span></p>

The High Commission wanted to help her but felt unable to do so without the backing of a court order. Hogg J made the girl a ward of court and ordered that she be brought to this country.

It is, however, one thing to approach the use of the jurisdiction with great caution or circumspection. It is another thing to conclude that the circumstances justifying its use must always be dire and exceptional or at the very extreme end of the spectrum. There are three main reasons for caution when deciding whether to exercise the jurisdiction: first, that to do so may conflict with the jurisdictional scheme applicable between the countries in question; second, that it may result in conflicting decisions in those two countries; and third, that it may result in unenforceable orders. It is, to say the least, arguable that none of those objections has much force in this case: there is no applicable Treaty between the UK and Pakistan; it is highly unlikely that the courts in Pakistan would entertain an application from the appellant; and it is possible that there are steps which an English court could take to persuade the respondent to obey the order.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court with respect to children originated in an age where the civil courts had no statutory family jurisdiction. It is based on the concept of a quasi-parental relationship between the Sovereign and a child of British nationality. It enables the courts to make a British child a ward of court, even if the child is outside the jurisdiction when the order is made. The continued existence of an inherent jurisdiction in an age of detailed and comprehensive statutory provision is something of an anomaly. The basis of the jurisdiction is, moreover, difficult to reconcile with the content of the statutory rules about jurisdiction. It is based on nationality, whereas the statutory rules are based on habitual residence and presence. None the less, its survival was implicitly recognized by sections 1(1)(d) and 2(3) of the Family Law Act 1986, which prohibited the exercise of the jurisdiction so as to give care of a child to any person or provide for contact with or the education of a child, unless either the court had jurisdiction under the Council Regulation or the 1996 Hague Convention or, if neither of these applied, the child is present or habitually resident in the United Kingdom.

Such orders have been made in two classes of case, both of which can broadly be described as protective. The first comprises abduction cases before the enactment of a statutory jurisdiction to deal with them. The second comprises cases where the child is in need of protection against some personal danger, for example where she has been removed for the purpose of undergoing a forced marriage or female genital mutilation. All of the modern cases fall into this last category. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic">Secondly, the inherent jurisdiction should not be exercised in a manner which cuts across the statutory scheme. If, as Baroness Hale DPSC and Lord Toulson JSC suggest, the use of the inherent jurisdiction is not reserved for exceptional cases, the potential for it to cut across the statutory scheme is very considerable. I have no doubt that it would do so in this case. In the first place, it would fall to be exercised at a time when the child will have been with her mother in Pakistan for at least two years, and will probably have become habitually resident there. Secondly, it seems plain that if an application under the inherent jurisdiction had been made by, say, an aunt or a sister of the respondent, there could be no ground for acceding to it. It is necessary to make this point in order to remind ourselves that it is to protect her relationship with the child on the basis that she should be regarded as a co-parent that the appellant is invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The real object of exercising it would be to bring the child within the jurisdiction of the English courts (i) so that the court could exercise the wider statutory powers which it is prevented by statute from exercising while she is in Pakistan, and (ii) so that they could do so on different and perhaps better principles than those which would apply in a Court of family jurisdiction in Pakistan. Thirdly, this last point is reinforced by the consideration that the appellants application in the English courts is for contact and shared residence. This is not relief which the statute permits to be ordered under the inherent jurisdiction, in a case where there is no jurisdiction under the Council Regulation or the 1996 Hague Convention. I do not accept that the inherent jurisdiction can be used to circumvent principled limitations which Parliament has placed upon the jurisdiction of the court. For these reasons, in addition to those given by the judge and the Court of Appeal, I do not think that an order for the child&#8217;s return could be a proper exercise of the court&#8217;s powers. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic">Third, if there were grounds for believing the child to be in danger, or some other extreme facts justifying the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction, it would no doubt be possible in the exercise of the courts inherent jurisdiction to direct an independent assessment of the situation of the child in Pakistan. Unless the facts were already clear, that would be the least that a court should do before it could be satisfied that she should be compulsorily returned to this country. In the present case, that assessment would also have to take account of the impact on the child of her removal for the second time of her life from a place where she is by now presumably settled, as well as the impact on her of the disruption of her primary carers life which would be involved in requiring her to abandon her life and job in Pakistan to return to a country where she has no job, is estranged from her family and has no desire to reside. But we are not in that territory. The courts below have held that there are no such grounds, and we have no basis on which to disagree with them. The mere absence of statutory jurisdiction in the English courts cannot possibly be a reason for exercising the inherent jurisdiction. On the contrary, in a case like this it is a reason for not doing so.</span></p>

As I understand it, the suggestion is that she needs to be protected from the presumed unwillingness of the courts of Pakistan to recognise the status of the appellant in relation to the child in the way that the English court would now do if they had statutory jurisdiction. I cannot regard this as a peril from which the courts should rescue the child by the exercise of what is on any view an exceptional and exorbitant jurisdiction.</span>&#8221;</p>

It is not just a matter of procedural caution; the need to use great caution must have some substantive content.

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic">The final factor, which in my view supports the existence of a substantive threshold, is that the 1986 Act prohibits the inherent jurisdiction being used to give care of a child to any person or provide for contact. It is also relevant that it limits the circumstances in which the court can make a section 8 order. Given the wide range of orders covered by these provisions, a low threshold to the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction would increase the prospect of the court making orders which would, in effect, cut across the statutory scheme as suggested by Lord Sumption JSC in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In re B (A Child)</span><span style="font-style:italic">, para 85</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> This can, of course, apply whenever the jurisdiction is exercised but, in my view, it provides an additional reason for limiting the exercise of the jurisdiction to compelling circumstances. As Henderson LJ observed during the hearing, the statutory limitations support the conclusion that the inherent jurisdiction, while not being wholly excluded, has been confined to a supporting, residual role. </span></p>

The extent to which a local authority can exercise the inherent jurisdiction is limited by s.100(2) of the Children Act 1989 and thus, on behalf of the Guardian, it is hard to see how any order made on an application by a local authority under the inherent jurisdiction could ever offend the FLA 1986.

The application before me is an application to set aside. PD12D paragraph 8 applies to applications to set aside inherent jurisdiction orders. Such applications must be made promptly when the party becomes aware of new information or of the circumstances which give rise to the application - paragraph 8.3. An application to set aside an inherent jurisdiction order can only be made in the circumstances set out in paragraph 8.4 unless the circumstances in FPR r.18.11 apply. FPR 2010 r.18.11 applies if the applicant had no notice of the original application. Whilst the applicant had instructed solicitors who appear to have maintained contact with her after the application was issued, there is no evidence before me that she was actually served with the original application and no application for substituted service appears to have been made. Thus, rule 18.11 appears to apply although the application cannot be said to have been made promptly. Whilst no formal application has been made to apply out of time, I have decided to extend the time for application for three reasons: (i) it was the refusal of permission to appeal by Lord Justice Moylan and his reasons for refusal that prompted the application; (ii) all parties have been able to argue their case despite the efflux of time; and (iii) it is in D&#8217;s welfare interests that the issues central to this case are decided.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I start at the beginning of this case with the initial application made by the local authority on 27 September 2019. At the time the application was made, D was 5 days old. The short description of relevant information provided supplementing the application in the C1A is that the father had caused multiple injuries and death to his first child and that the mother is unable to accept the risks the father poses to D and thus is unable to protect her. It was said the mother had fled the country to avoid local authority intervention and care proceedings. Consequently, the local authority sought permission to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and an order to protect &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the safety and wellbeing</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>of D. On the face of the C66 itself at paragraph 3, it was stated that the local authority wanted the court to invoke the inherent jurisdiction to make orders to secure D&#8217;s return to the UK and to protect her from the harm she is likely to suffer in the care of either parent. The local authority relied upon a risk assessment which had been undertaken pre-birth dated 25 September 2019. I have re-read that assessment (found in the bundle for the hearings in March 2021 at D1/1 and following). It is comprehensive. It includes details which indicate that from the local authority&#8217;s perspective, the mother and the maternal grandmother had a history of being vulnerable to exploitative relationships (see D1/16-23). The assessor concluded that the father continues to pose a high risk to children. He has shown no insight and continued to deny the findings of Mr Justice Moor.  D&#8217;s mother and maternal grandmother did not accept that the father poses a risk to D. D was thus said to be at high risk of suffering significant harm following birth. At the time the assessment concluded the mother had left the country and disengaged with the assessment. The assessor recommendations included the following:</p>

For the purpose of this judgment, I have re-read his statement to that court dated 23 July 2020.

That was the initial finding of Francis J and I gave all of the parties an opportunity to consider whether this was raised as an issue and when the father was fully represented it was confirmed that there was no issue about jurisdiction. In fact, the father&#8217;s case has always been that he and his wife intended for their child to be born in the United Kingdom and be raised here and that was the evidence the father gave on oath. Declarations as to jurisdiction have already been made by consent when the father was legally represented and no reason or change of circumstances has been put before me to persuade me that I should reconsider earlier decisions made about this.</span></p>

The father&#8217;s oral evidence before me, as summarised in my judgment, appears to have centered on his view that Mr Justice Moor had been wrong to make findings against him in relation to S&#8217;s injuries and ultimately her death.

I have done so with an open mind. I do not agree with the submission that the order of 27 September 2019 set the tone of the case in relation to jurisdiction, which was then, in effect, unthinkingly followed. The chronology shows that the court did review the issue of jurisdiction specifically on 21 November 2019, again in August 2020 and then again on 9 December 2020. The very fact that the court changed the basis of jurisdiction from habitual residence to nationality shows the court was actively engaged with the issue and reviewed it regularly. In terms of my involvement in the proceedings, I accept that I relied heavily on the findings that had gone before when making the final wardship orders. Given that the last set of findings relevant to jurisdiction had been made by Mr Justice Francis on 9 December 2020 and nothing had changed since then, perhaps the question should be &#8211; why wouldn&#8217;t I? </span></p>

As far as this court is aware, she did not take any steps to have her voice heard until April 2023 when she made an application for permission to appeal. Until the Court of Appeal refused that application, the mother did not take the opportunity that had been there for her throughout on the face of the orders, all of which invariably stated that a party may apply to set aside or vary them upon giving 48 hours&#8217; notice.  I am left with the conclusion that the arguments which are now advanced on her behalf could have been determined so much earlier, if only she had engaged.</span></p>

A local authority can only make such an application with the permission of the court if the test within s.100(4) and (5) of the Children Act 1989 is met. On the facts of this case at the time the court was seized of the application, the court had reasonable cause to believe that if the inherent jurisdiction was not exercised D would be likely to suffer significant harm. Section 100(4)(b) of the Children Act 1989 was clearly met. In coming to that decision, I have very firmly in mind the submissions on behalf of the Guardian that it is hard to think of a case which meets that test but does not warrant the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction. I have reminded myself that at the time the court was seized, D was 5 days old.  She was out of the jurisdiction with her mother who had a history of vulnerability to exploitative relationships. The father had been found to have killed S and the risk the father posed to other children had been found by Mr Justice Moor to be &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">unmanageable</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000">because: (i) the injuries the father inflicted on S were over a considerable period of time and represented a sustained course of conduct; and (ii) he lacked insight.  The mother and the maternal grandmother did not accept the risks and believed the father&#8217;s proclamation of innocence. D was with her mother who had fled this jurisdiction and was living with the paternal family in Northern Iraq, a location to which she had no connection. She did not speak the language and the FCDO advised against travel there. Standing back and looking at circumstances at the time this court was seized, they were very grave indeed. At that time, the result which the local authority wished to achieve could not be achieved through the making of any other order. Public law orders were not available to them because D was outwith the jurisdiction.  Hence the provisions of s.100(4)(a) and (5) of the Children Act 1989 were met. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The previous paragraph highlights the tension at the heart of this case. The reason the local authority could not apply for any other order was because the child was not habitually resident in the jurisdiction, nor was she present. Hence the local authority could not bring public law proceedings to protect her. That is the very reason that on behalf of the mother it is argued that the court does not have any jurisdiction to make the orders or alternatively should not have exercised it because the wardship orders cut across the statutory scheme. It is, at the same time, the very reason the local authority made an application under the inherent jurisdiction. It is clear from all the papers in this case and from the reasons given on the face of the application itself that the local authority&#8217;s application was to protect and safeguard D. It is in that context that I have reminded myself that the local authority&#8217;s statutory duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need and to provide them with accommodation is based on the child in question being in that local authority&#8217;s area &#8211; ss.17 and 20 of the Children Act 1989 in relation to England, and ss. 21  and 75 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 in relation to Wales. Given that D had never been in their area, the local authority actually had no statutory duty in this case to act to safeguard and promote her well-being.</span></p>

The court was acting to protect a British national who could not be protected by any other statutory means. In the circumstances of this case, the inherent jurisdiction was being accessed as a truly residual jurisdiction to act protectively in relation to a child for whom it had jurisdiction.</span></p>

This case is, in my view, very different from those where the court acts to protect a child abroad from the risk of a forced marriage or from FGM. It seems to me that protective jurisdiction could be extended to include protecting her from her father, perhaps by stopping him travelling to be with her. However, in my judgment the orders in this case went too far. They sought to compel D&#8217;s return to this jurisdiction. Those orders seeking to compel return were made so that the local authority could exercise their public law duties to safeguard and protect her as a child in need in their area and so that public law proceedings could be taken in relation to her. In my judgment, that is the only reasonable conclusion I can draw from a consideration of the facts of this case. Those facts must be viewed in the context of the risk assessment of 25 September 2019 which clearly stated that if D was &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">in the UK or returns to the UK, care proceedings [are] to be issued upon the Local Authority being aware of the baby&#8217;s birth.</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;. That recommendation is in my view unequivocal. That assessment was the evidential basis upon which the C66 was issued by the local authority. In reality it sets out the reason the local authority applied for D&#8217;s return to the jurisdiction. It was to return her to the jurisdiction so that they could exercise a statutory duty to safeguard and protect her and so that public law proceedings could begin in relation to her. That is a use of the inherent jurisdiction which cuts across the statutory scheme in this case and its jurisdictional boundaries. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">I have reconsidered, in the light of the submissions I have heard, the orders that have actually been made in this case. The first order of Mr Justice Francis was a bare return order. On the face of it, that order would not have crossed the statutory scheme but once it is considered in the context of the recommendations of the risk assessment, the reality is that its purpose was to secure return so that public law proceedings could be instituted. The orders of HHJ Lloyd of 6 August 2020, Mr Justice Francis of 9 December 2020 and myself of 17 March 2021 all stated that &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">the first respondent must return with D [&#8230;] immediately to the UK for the purpose of a further assessment of her parenting capacity</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">. </span><span style="color:#000000">That was a court ordered assessment rather than one the local authority was required to carry out in the fulfilment of their statutory duties. I have therefore given careful consideration to whether those orders cross a statutory scheme or not. Ultimately, however, I have concluded that you cannot get away in this case from the risk assessment conclusions of 25 September 2019. Given that context, the reality of that assessment was that it would consider whether public law orders would be required in this case. The reality is that those orders cut across a statutory scheme, applying paragraph 61 of </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Re M.</span><span style="color:#000000"> The fact that in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Re M</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000">the issue was whether it cut across the statutory scheme of FLA 1986 does not, in my view, diminish the principle which lies behind the decision and paragraph 61 of the judgment. The court must look at the reality of the situation. The reality of this case is that the purpose of the assessment in the context of this case was to see whether public law orders were required. Those were orders which the local authority could not apply for in relation to D whilst she remained out of the jurisdiction. Given that as a matter of fact, the events since 25 September 2019 can only have aggravated the risk, the reality was that the assessment would be a precursor to public law orders. I agree with the submission that the reality of this case is that, from the start, the local authority have sought inherent jurisdiction orders with a view to securing public law orders in relation to D. In the circumstances of this case, although the residual inherent jurisdiction did exist in this case to protect D, I have decided that it ought not to have been exercised. I frankly acknowledge that from a child protection perspective that is counter intuitive.  I see the force of the Guardian&#8217;s argument that the orders have protected D from her father who on the findings of Mr Justice Moor is a risk to any child in his care. However, I have reminded myself that local authorities do not have a roving child protection mandate and that their duties and powers are circumscribed by their having the jurisdiction to exercise those powers and observe those duties. Hence, after long and hard deliberation, I have had to conclude that D was a child who had never been present in the jurisdiction and that the local authority was seeking her return to enable them to exercise a statutory jurisdiction which was not available to them had she remained abroad.</span></p>
