Her treating team are satisfied that she has good knowledge of her condition, and of the implications of not receiving insulin for the same, namely a risk of death. B has stated a wish to die.

For a number of days she also refused to be admitted to hospital.  However, within this context, it is important to note that the following steps were ultimately achieved by agreement: </p>

It is a condition whereby the uncontrolled rise in blood sugars and ketones due to a lack of insulin causes an electrolyte imbalance.  That condition can lead to brain swelling and, ultimately, death if left untreated.  The immediate management of DKA involves inpatient care, intravenous fluids and intravenous insulin. Subcutaneous insulin therapy may also be needed to maintain blood sugar levels.  Within this context, it is apparent that B&#8217;s treating team state that: </p>

I state this as a general and not as an invariable premise because of the possibility of cases in which a court would not authorise treatment of a distressing nature which offered only a small hope of preserving life.  In general terms however, the present state of law is that an individual who has reached the age of 18 is free to do with his life what he wishes, but it is the duty of the court to ensure so far as it can that children survive to attain that age&#8230;To take it a stage further, if the child&#8217;s welfare is threatened by a serious and imminent risk that the child will suffer grave and irreversible mental or physical harm, then once again the court when called upon has a duty to intervene.&#8221; </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0in">The court has before it cogent evidence that B has developed DKA.  She has already showed signs of confusion and vomiting. Testing at 0100hrs found her blood sugars and ketones to be markedly elevated with a sugar level of over 38 (versus normal of up to 10) and a ketone level of 2.5.  At this point B was refusing any insulin at all.  Later blood testing demonstrated a blood sugar level of 27.8 and ketone level of 5.5 and a blood pH of 7.19 (acidosis).  There is no indication that those readings have improved and the medical evidence before the court is clear that her situation is now parlous.  She has been admitted to the HDU. </p>

Whilst I have not had the benefit if psychiatric evidence in this case (an examination being pending) this court is aware that children who have to live with the unenviable burden of chronic medical conditions sometimes seek, particularly during their teenage years, to deal with the unremitting pressure of such a situation by seeking to exercise control of the seemingly uncontrollable in the only way available to them, namely by refusing to co-operate with their treatment. Within this context, I consider it significant that B has already consented to admission to hospital, to a series of blood tests and to insertion of cannula.  This suggest that her position in respect of treatment is not completely concrete and, further, suggests degree of co-operation.   </p>
