They were presented to and issued in a huge number of different county courts &#8211; 137 in all &#8211; ranging, alphabetically from Aldershot to York and geographically across the length and breadth of England and Wales, from Truro in south-west England to Canterbury in south-east England, Haverfordwest in south-west Wales, Llangefni in north-west Wales, Carlisle in north-west England and Newcastle in north-east England. Most of these county courts handled only one of these petitions, some had two petitions and two (Reigate and Peterborough) had three.  </p>

First, I deal with the law and practice applicable to divorce proceedings in the English court. Secondly, I deal with the law and practice applicable to the applications before me. Thirdly, I deal in some detail with the facts of the cases I am being invited to consider. Next, I set out the history of the current litigation, before setting out and explaining my conclusions. Finally, I deal with one case, <span style="font-style:italic">Rapisarda v Colladon </span>AL11D00099, which for reasons that will become apparent in due course requires to be considered separately.</p>

The person applying for divorce is called the petitioner; the other spouse is called the respondent. An order for divorce is called a decree. The first decree is called a decree nisi: it is a provisional order which does not itself terminate the marriage. The second decree is called a decree absolute: it is a final order which brings the marriage to an end.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first thing I must consider is the jurisdiction of the English court in matters of divorce. For reasons which will become apparent in due course, it is important to distinguish two different senses in which the word jurisdiction is used. The first, what I will call &#8220;jurisdiction to entertain the petition&#8221;, goes to the logically prior question of whether the English court has any jurisdiction at all to receive, hear and consider the petition. The other, what I will call &#8220;jurisdiction to grant a decree&#8221;, goes to the question of whether the English court, assuming that it has jurisdiction to entertain the petition, has jurisdiction to grant a decree of divorce. I will consider these in turn.</p>

As is apparent from what I have already said, the architects of the fraud made the maximum use of this facility, spreading the 180 petitions very thinly across a large number of county courts throughout the length and breadth of England and Wales.</p>

Petitions which are not defended are dealt with in accordance with what is called the &#8220;special procedure&#8221;: see rules 2.24(3) and 2.36 of the 1991 Rules and, with effect from 6 April 2011, rules 7.19 and 7.20 of the 2010 Rules. Two aspects of the special procedure need mention. Rule 2.24(3) of the 1991 Rules required the petitioner to file an affidavit &#8211; a sworn statement &#8211; setting out certain prescribed information. The corresponding provision is now rule 7.19(4) of the 2010 Rules, which requires the petitioner to file a statement, verified by a statement of truth, setting out certain prescribed information. The other relevant provision is rule 2.36(1)(b) of the 1991 Rules, now rule 7.20(2)(b) of the 2010 Rules, entitling the court to seek further information from the petitioner. The old rule provided that the court could &#8220;give the petitioner an opportunity of filing further evidence&#8221;. The new rule is rather more direct, the court being empowered to &#8220;direct &#8230; that any party to the proceedings provide such further information &#8230; as the court may specify&#8221;.</p>

The normal practice of the Queen&#8217;s Proctor is not to adduce evidence in support of the plea, and it is long established that there is no need for him to do so where there is no answer to the plea. That was foreshadowed in <span style="font-style:italic">Sheldon v Sheldon (The Queen&#8217;s Proctor intervening) </span>(1865) 4 Sw&amp;Tr 75, 164 ER 1444. It was so held by Bargrave Deane J in <span style="font-style:italic">Crowden v Crowden (The King&#8217;s Proctor showing cause) </span>(1906) 23 TLR 143, followed by Baker J in <span style="font-style:italic">Clutterbuck v Clutterbuck and Reynolds (Queen&#8217;s Proctor showing cause) </span>[1961] 105 Sol Jo 1012. But that of course assumes that the Queen&#8217;s Proctor has been able to serve the plea on the parties. In most of the cases before me that has been possible; in some cases it has not proved possible to serve the parties in such a way as to bring the plea to their attention (see further below). The Queen&#8217;s Proctor has therefore, and appropriately in the circumstances, adduced evidence in support of his plea. I wish to make clear, however, that the course adopted in this case is not to be taken as casting any doubt on the practice established by <span style="font-style:italic">Crowden</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Clutterbuck</span>, a practice whose propriety and continuing utility I unhesitatingly endorse.</p>

Going back to the distinction I drew in paragraph 7 above between &#8220;jurisdiction to entertain the petition&#8221; and &#8220;jurisdiction to grant a decree&#8221;, the perjury in <span style="font-style:italic">Callaghan v Hanson-Fox</span> went only to the latter, for it concerned the facts required to satisfy the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.

The fraud as found by Sir Stephen had various strands: The particulars set out in the petition were false in a number of material respects; the affidavit in support of the petition, in which the petitioner swore that everything stated in his petition was true, was perjured; the statement of the proposed arrangements for the child of the family, filed with the petition, was wholly misleading; the petitioner subsequently falsely told the court that the child had died when he knew full well that he was still alive; the acknowledgement of service purportedly signed by the respondent wife (and in which she purportedly admitted the adultery alleged in the petition) was false. </p>

In this case, I have no doubt that Lord Moynihan&#8217;s divorce petition was deliberately framed in a way which was calculated to deceive the court. All the subsequent representations and submissions which were made to the court were vitiated by fraud. He wished to obtain a divorce. He wished to do so even if his wife objected to it, as I believe she did or would have objected, if only on financial grounds. He quite deliberately set out to deceive the court. His affidavit verifying the petition was false, and in swearing it he committed perjury. He perverted the course of justice and succeeded in obtaining a decree. It is a gross case. The inevitable consequences to all are serious. I have no doubt that I should set aside and declare null and void the decree absolute and the decree nisi and dismiss the petition.&#8221;</p>

That is the crucial distinction between the two cases. When Sir Stephen in the passage from his judgment I have set out in paragraph 25 above spoke of the petitioner having &#8220;deceive[d] the court into accepting jurisdiction in his divorce suit&#8221;, he was plainly referring to jurisdiction in the sense of jurisdiction to entertain the petition.

It was in fact a mail box, mail box 201, one of a number of mail boxes located in commercial premises. As the investigating officer in charge of the police investigation, Detective Sergeant Jonathan Groenen, mordantly commented in his witness statement dated 29 October 2013, &#8220;It is not possible for 179 applicants or respondents to reside at this address.&#8221; Indeed, given the dimensions of the mail box it is clear that not even a single individual, however small, could possibly reside in it.</p>

This is one of the cases in which it was said that it was the respondent who resided at Flat 201. The petitioner, Agata Rapisarda, was said to reside in Italy. For reasons which will become apparent in due course, I will need to go into this particular case in more detail. For the moment I need refer only to the petitioner&#8217;s affidavit, again in Form M7 and filed in accordance with rule 2.24(3), purportedly sworn on 19 April 2011 before the same person who, eight days later, purportedly witnessed the petitioner&#8217;s signature in <span style="font-style:italic">Gargiulo v Armani </span>AF11D00099. I have evidence from the petitioner, which I have no hesitation in accepting. She made a witness statement dated 25 October 2013 and gave oral evidence before me on 9 April 2014. Until she came to London in April 2014 to give evidence, she had never been in this country. She has never been to Reading. She accepts that it is her signature on the affidavit but says that she was in Italy, in Verona, when she signed it. The solicitor&#8217;s details were not there when she signed the document. She thought that most probably the other parts had also not been completed. Whatever the reality in relation to that last point, it is quite clear from her evidence, which I accept, that this purported affidavit was never sworn by the petitioner as it purports to have been sworn.</p>

He accepted that it is his signature on the acknowledgement of service but said that the form was otherwise blank when he signed it. I shall return below to consider this in more detail. For the moment two obvious questions arise: Why was Dr Russo seeking the assistance of the petitioner, resident in Italy, in obtaining the signature of the respondent, then supposedly living in England at an address known to Dr Russo? And what is the significance of the instruction to &#8220;sign&#8221; but not &#8220;complete&#8221; and, indeed, of the fact that the respondent signed a blank form?  In relation to the latter point, an email from the petitioner to Dr Russo dated 7 April 2011 says &#8220;I received the document which is attached. Please let me know what to do.&#8221; Examination of the court file would suggest that this refers to the court&#8217;s notice dated 24 March 2011 of its receipt of the respondent&#8217;s acknowledgement of service, enclosing with it a form of request for directions for trial (special procedure) and a form of the appropriate affidavit to be sworn by the petitioner. Dr Russo&#8217;s response to the petitioner the same day was &#8220;Do not reply because &#8230; to avoid errors we fill forms&#8221;.</p>

In this case it was emailed to the respondent from <a class="Hyperlink" href="mailto:div@fredericarusso.com">div@fredericarusso.com</a> on 7 September 2010, with a covering message from Dr Russo. It gave the petitioner&#8217;s address as &#8220;England&#8221;, said that the parties had lived together at an address in Italy until 6 October 2008, and that (I quote the translation) &#8220;from 7-10-2008 [the petitioner] has had an address in England.&#8221; On 8 September 2010 the respondent emailed Dr Russo, saying &#8220;You (I don&#8217;t know who) have confused dates and addresses &#8230; The &#8230; corrections are given below.&#8221; He set out the petitioner&#8217;s address as being in Ravenna in Italy and said that the parties had lived together at that address from the date of the marriage, 28 September 2008, until 30 August 2010.

The parties were said to have married on 28 September 2008 and separated on 7 October 2008. The petitioner&#8217;s address was given as Flat 201. The affidavit in Form M7 purportedly sworn by the petitioner on 15 February 2001 (it was bogus like the others) alleged that she had lived at Flat 201 since 7 October 2008. It also stated that the reason for the parties&#8217; separation was that &#8220;We came to the conclusion that we had grown apart&#8221;. There are, taking the affidavit at face value, two curiosities about this: first, that the parties had &#8220;grown apart&#8221; within nine days of the marriage and, second, that the petitioner had allegedly taken up residence in this country the day she separated from her husband in Italy. Neither is impossible; each is somewhat unlikely. The decree nisi followed on 23 March 2011 and the decree absolute on 20 September 2011.       </p>

She brought it to the attention of District Judge Conway, who contacted a colleague in the Slough County Court (located near to Maidenhead). He arranged for a member of the court staff there to visit Flat 201, which revealed that there was no residential accommodation there. When this was reported back to District Judge Conway on 1 March 2012 she immediately notified both her local Designated Family Judge and the Queen&#8217;s Proctor. Later the same day her concerns were escalated to the relevant Family Division Liaison Judge and by him to the office of the President of the Family Division, at that time Sir Nicholas Wall. On 22 March 2012 the President&#8217;s office circulated a message asking courts to stay all such cases, without reference to the parties, pending investigations by the Queen&#8217;s Proctor and the police. </p>

Correspondence then ensued between the Queen&#8217;s Proctor and Holman J, Acting President of the Family Division in the absence of Sir Nicholas Wall P. On 21 November 2012, Holman J, as Acting President, notified all courts that the matter was now being investigated by the office of the Attorney General, and that until he (the Attorney General) had decided what action he might wish to take &#8220;no further action of any kind should be taken in any of these cases.&#8221;</p>

In relation to the 70 cases where the Flat 201 address had been used, there was plainly, to put matters no higher, real reason to believe that no one had ever resided there. It was accordingly entirely appropriate, as Mr Murray had submitted, for me to make an order in accordance with rule 7.20(2)(b) of the 2010 Rules, as I did on 19 July 2013, requiring further information and making clear that failure to comply might lead to the petition being dismissed. In 58 of these cases the letter serving the order had not been returned and service was effective. In none of these cases had any of the required information been supplied. In the circumstances it was therefore appropriate to dismiss the petitions in all of these 58 cases without further ado, as I did by the order dated 18 February 2014.</p>

I shall refer to this as &#8220;Flat 229.&#8221; A witness statement filed by the Queen&#8217;s Proctor in support of his application dated 12 June 2013 for the transfer of this case from Barnsley County Court to the High Court, set out reasons for believing that Flat 229, like Flat 201, was not a residential property but a mail box, together with various other reasons for believing that the same people were behind this case as the other cases. Accordingly, for precisely the same reasons as in the other 70 Class 1 cases, it was appropriate for me to make an order in accordance with rule 7.20(2)(b) of the 2010 Rules, as I did on 19 July 2013. The letter serving the order was not returned and service was effective. None of the required information had been supplied.

In those cases, and absent any response from the parties, the Queen&#8217;s Proctor, as I have explained in paragraph 15 above, would have been entitled to proceed without adducing any evidence in support of his plea. But the fact is that in some of these cases service has not been possible. So it was necessary in these cases for the Queen&#8217;s Proctor to prove his case by adducing evidence. That being so, I need not consider the effect of the plea any further. In the circumstances, and except for the 59 Class 1 cases where I have already dismissed the petitions for non-compliance with the order I had made under rule 7.20(2)(b) of the 2010 Rules, it is simpler if all these cases &#8211; the remaining 12 Class 1 cases, the 18 Class 2 cases and the 91 Class 3 cases, including <span style="font-style:italic">Rapisarda v Colladon </span>AL11D00099 which I deal with separately below &#8211; are determined by reference to the evidence.</p>

This is not a matter of judicial discretion; it is the consequence which follows inexorably as a matter of law from the facts as I have found them.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In short, what is said is that the respondent, an engineer employed by an Italian construction company, was working in 2010 and 2011, as he had been for many years previously, on sites in various countries in Africa and elsewhere. Prior to separating from the petitioner he had tended to spend little time in Italy, the greater part of the year being spent working abroad, although it appears that the matrimonial home in Verona was his &#8216;base&#8217; and where he kept his &#8216;things&#8217;. In 2009 he met a woman who lived in this country, in Beckenham on the outskirts of London. From March 2010 until August 2011 he shared a flat with a friend not far away from Beckenham in Bromley so as to be close to his girlfriend. A letter from the friend dated 20 October 2013 which the respondent produced says:</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">The respondent&#8217;s case is that throughout the period from March 2010 to August 2011 he always returned to this county when he was not working abroad and considered the Bromley address to be his main residence. He thought that during this period he spent something between 10% and 15% of his time in this country. He paid no tax in this country. I was left largely in the dark as to what had happened to his &#8216;things&#8217; after he had separated from the petitioner and where he kept them thereafter. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have to say that I am sceptical as to whether, even on his own evidence, the respondent can establish that he was ever habitually resident in this country. But even assuming that he can, I am persuaded by Mr Murray that it cannot avail either the respondent or the petitioner. The fact remains that in this case, as in all the others, the English court was deceived into believing that, in this case, the respondent lived at Flat 201, and the decree nisi and decree absolute were procured by the use of a purported affidavit which, like the others, was in fact and in law a forgery. As Mr Murray succinctly puts it, the fact is that the false address was presented to the court. On that ground, as Mr Murray submits, the Queen&#8217;s Proctor is entitled to the same relief in <span style="font-style:italic">Rapisarda v Colladon </span>AL11D00099 as in the other cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Quite apart from that, there are other difficulties in Ms Villarosa&#8217;s way. The use of the wrong address was not, as Ms Villarosa would have it, a &#8220;mistake&#8221;; it was deliberate. Moreover, even if I could in some way cure this defect in the petition it is far from clear that this could, without more ado, retrospectively cure the process culminating in the decree nisi and the decree absolute.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Villarosa submits that the petitioner and the respondent were innocent parties, who did not collude or in any way take part in whatever fraud may have been committed by Dr Russo or Nolton. I am prepared to assume in their favour that they were taken advantage of by others who were intent on making money dishonestly at their expense. But their plea of innocence will not wash. On the petitioner&#8217;s own account, she must have realised that there was something distinctly odd about the affidavit she was being asked to sign. So far as the respondent is concerned his (admitted) signature to the acknowledgment of service faces him with a dilemma from which he cannot escape. If, as he says, he signed the form in blank, then he must take the consequences. If, on the other hand, it had been completed when he signed it, how can he explain the fact that his address is shown <span style="font-style:italic">immediately below his signature </span>as Flat 201 and not, as he had notified Dr Russo by email on 1 February 2011, his true address in Bromley?</p>

I am grateful to all of them. They have embodied certain suggestions in a written note dated 2 June 2014, which I propose to put before the Family Procedure Rules Committee for its consideration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fraud in these cases was, I have no doubt, facilitated by rules which, as explained in paragraphs 2 and 10 above, enabled the architects of the fraud to spread the issue of 180 petitions very thinly across no fewer than 137 different county courts. For reasons unconnected with what this case has uncovered, that facility is shortly to be very drastically curtailed. As I explained in my recent <span style="font-style:italic">View from the President&#8217;s Chambers: The process of reform: an update </span>[2014] September Fam Law 1259, 1262, Her Majesty&#8217;s Courts and Tribunals Service is, with my active support, proceeding to centralise the handing of divorce petitions, concentrating this work in a limited number of locations where petitions will be issued and all special procedure divorces will be processed. I anticipate that by this time next year there will be fewer than twenty, possibly as few as a dozen, places at which a divorce petition can be issued.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This alone, however, will probably not be enough to prevent such frauds. There is no need for me to set out each of Mr Murray&#8217;s helpful suggestions, but there are two which I can usefully mention. One is that both the petition for divorce and, in special procedure cases, the notice of application for decree nisi should require the completion of a statement of truth in a specified form next to a prominently displayed warning of the penalties for untruth. The other is that part of the process in the court office for issuing a divorce petition should include a search of the court&#8217;s FamilyMan system to identify whether the address(es) given in the petition have been used in other cases. Each of these suggestions, it seems to me, merits careful consideration, though until such time as the court has up-to-date IT systems (which could no doubt be programmed to identify automatically any relevant addresses) I recognise that implementation of a standard search procedure will no doubt have resource implications.</p>
