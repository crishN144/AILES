In late 2015, she conceived a child, in circumstances which in all probability amounted to rape.  The perpetrator of the sexual assault remains unknown; neither Miss V nor her family can shed light on the circumstances in which the assault occurred. In 2016, she gave birth to a baby boy who is now in foster care.  </p>

Her receptive and expressive language skills are significantly delayed. She has an &#8216;understanding&#8217; age of about 3-5 years; she can say only a few simple words and phrases in her native language, and even less in English.  This complex range of medical conditions is attributable to an incident of significant trauma (a road traffic accident) which she suffered when she was three years old; this caused severe brain injury.  She apparently had no schooling in her home country, but accessed a specialist school on her arrival to England for about a year; this was a mixed experience for her, as she was allegedly beaten and bullied by other pupils.  For all her life she has been socially and emotionally extremely vulnerable, but is, paradoxically &#8220;very sociable&#8221; and &#8220;likes to go out to the park&#8221;; she is also described as capable of being &#8220;over-familiar&#8221; with adults, as she was with one of the assessing psychiatrists undertaking an assessment.</p>

Multi-disciplinary resources were urgently galvanised to deliver a co-ordinated package of care to support Miss V through the final trimester of her pregnancy and delivery of the baby.  The Health Authority sought the authority of the Court of Protection to arrange the delivery of the baby by caesarean section; Newton J made the relevant order in August 2016, and the baby was born on the following day.</p>

The circumstances of the conception are undetermined, although it is believed that the father may be a friend of one of Miss V&#8217;s brothers, visiting from their mutual home state. DNA testing has ruled out any family member. There is professional agreement that Miss V did not have the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse.</p>

Professionals speak of an extreme reaction to these events: a &#8220;significant physical and psychological trauma&#8221; (per her obstetrician, Dr. S) is amplified by the social worker who described Miss V as &#8220;agitated&#8221;, swearing and yelling, and pushing at her mother &#8220;out of frustration&#8230; pointing to her stomach and crying.&#8221; In her evidence before me, the social worker described the situation thus:</p>

I observed her shouting pointing at her stomach; she did not understand what happened to her body; it was extremely difficult for professionals to get bloods and blood pressure from her.  Any medical intervention she found traumatising and she was scared; a lot of intensive support was offered by the health professionals to help to prepare her for the birth of the baby.  Though physically she healed well after the baby, the removal of the baby had a devastating effect on her emotional and psychological welfare; she could not understand where the baby was and was constantly asking for her baby; she was physically lashing out at her mother; she was self-harming; not sleeping; not eating; throwing herself on the floor; the community care officer took her to the GP and she got anti-depressants; it has a long effect on her.  </p>

The parents could not calm or reassure her; she physically became very <span style="color:#000000">ill complaining of pains in her body and feverish.  She lost interest in the outside world, and became clingy to her mother.</span>  No matter who visited her, she only cried and asked for her baby.  After several months, there were times when she smiled with her mother, and engage with outside activities but only with her mother.  She became very fearful of the world&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the delivery of the baby, professional attention swiftly turned to the formulation of a plan to prevent a recurrence of the pregnancy.  Although it is believed that Miss V probably became pregnant while <span style="font-style:italic">in</span> her home, following an assault by a visitor, the plan requires that Miss V is never unaccompanied when <span style="font-style:italic">out</span> of her home, and never at any time in the care of unknown and unapproved persons.  The success of the plan, as a whole, depends heavily on high levels of co-operation between Mr and Mrs W and the Local Authority, monitored by announced and unannounced visits by professionals.  The community matron has undertaken some focused work with Miss V on sexual education and self-protection; Miss V appears to have been receptive to this.</p>

This application is no longer pursued.  </p>

The Local Authority have recognised that in difficult circumstances the family have adhered, or sought to adhere, to the plan.  They are a close family, which functions well together, and they have generally co-operated with a high level of intervention from social and health care workers.   They are willing to accept advice, and are not defensive.</p>

The patch is applied to the lower abdomen, upper outer arm, buttock or upper torso.  He summarises the pros and cons in this way:</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The principal benefits of the patch are that it is reasonably easy to apply; the failure rate is about 9%; hormonal contraception has a generally beneficial effect on menstrual bleeding, and on the skin; the presence of a patch is also verifiable; it is swiftly reversible;</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The disadvantages of the patch are (a) possibly allergic skin reaction around site, (b) the risk that Miss V may choose to remove the patch, or it may become detached, (c) that Miss V would need support at the point at which it is removed, and re-applied, (d) user error (the time at which the patch is applied, and/or replaced, needs to be reasonably diligently observed).  There is also some evidence (though it is described in the report at one point as no more than a &#8220;suggestion&#8221;) that some patch wearers suffer side-effects such as nausea and breast discomfort or tenderness, and period-type cramps.</p>

Dr. Rowlands proposes a 3-6 month trial, followed by review: &#8220;if she is free of side effects, local and systemic, then long-term use could be considered&#8221;.  If adverse side-effects manifest themselves, then this will need to be considered further (and possibly urgently), as will the ability of Miss V&#8217;s parents to manage this.</p>

They hark back to the description of Miss V&#8217;s distress following the delivery of her baby (see [9] above).  Even if the risk is small, the emotional, psychological and physical consequences for Miss V if that risk became the reality are so grave that all reasonable steps should be taken to reduce or eliminate risk.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The argument against the use of any form of contraception is that the safeguarding plan is already sufficiently robust that this additional protection is not necessary; further, it is said, even the least restrictive form of contraception has side effects which are likely to outweigh the potential benefits.  It is not appropriate &#8211; or specifically in Miss V&#8217;s best interests, argues Miss Powell QC &#8211; for contraception to be administered &#8220;just in case&#8230;&#8221;.  Moreover, it is said that it would not be in Miss V&#8217;s best interests to expose her to the side-effects of any of the forms of contraception discussed (including the contraceptive patch) unless the benefits outweigh the disbenefits (see [17] above).  Miss Powell, and Miss Gardner, point to the fact that the safeguarding plan would not be any tighter or more detailed if contraception is not administered, which demonstrates (they say) that of itself it adds little to the protections offered.  They further submit that if the less restrictive contraception (i.e. the patch) were to be administered, this would expose Miss V potentially to a greater risk of sexual exploitation (if the sexual predator knows that she has contraceptive protection), and that any abuse would itself be more likely to remain undetected (the earlier rape was in fact only detected because of the pregnancy).  For my part, I can say at this point that I am less persuaded by these latter arguments. </p>

If I were to conclude that contraception of some form would be in Miss V&#8217;s best interests, no party dissents from the proposition that the contraception should be by patch.  I am clear, as indeed are all parties, that long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) devices are not currently indicated in this case, at least in part because an invasive procedure would be required to achieve contraception (such as the insertion of an intrauterine device) and this would be strongly resisted by Miss V (see [45] below); accordingly, chemical sedation or general anaesthesia would be required to achieve this.  This materially informs the answer to the question posed in [24](iv).  Furthermore, Miss V is not a sexually active woman, and in the circumstances less restrictive options than a LARC device can be contemplated.</p>

Miss V appears to have some very limited understanding of the link between wearing the patch and avoiding pregnancy.  In her conversations with the community matron and the social worker she has repeatedly referenced the &#8216;patch&#8217;, and appeared to confirm to the social worker following sessions conducted in March 2017 that she knew that the patch would need to be &#8220;put on, remove and put the new one on&#8221;; further that it was to be applied &#8220;to stop me getting pregnant&#8221;.  Miss J, the Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative, on a visit to Miss V in the last few weeks, asked her &#8220;why have a patch?&#8221;, to which Miss V replied: &#8220;no baby&#8221;.  She said that it was &#8220;OK&#8221; and &#8220;good&#8221; to have the patch.  Although there is a limit on the weight which I can reasonably attach to these views, given her lack of capacity, I am nonetheless satisfied that she has a reasonable awareness of the contraceptive patch and its function and has indicated no opposition to wearing it.   I recognise that in some respects she is suggestible and has been able to repeat information she has learned in a &#8216;rote&#8217; way (there are examples in the documents), but in this regard, following extensive work with the community matron, I am satisfied that she shows some limited but genuine understanding of the issue.</p>

The Local Authority considers that the safeguarding plan is &#8220;robust&#8221;, or (as the social worker said) &#8220;as robust as it can be&#8221;.  I agree with her <span style="font-style:italic">qualified</span> appraisal of the effectiveness of the plan, for the plan depends heavily for its success on the co-operation of Miss V&#8217;s parents, and their constant supervision of Miss V.  However well-intentioned they are, and I do not question this, they are &#8211; as all humans are &#8211; fallible, and their fallibility is exposed particularly when under pressure, or when their attentions are diverted.   There have been lapses of the safeguarding plan over the course of the last 12 months, one as recently as last week.   Although Mrs W has deposed in her signed statement to the fact that her daughter &#8220;&#8230; is never alone, she comes everywhere with me&#8221;, this has been shown &#8211; even very recently &#8211; not to be true.  I am not overly critical of the parents for these lapses, because I accept that they live in a busy household, and it is unrealistic to assume that they can keep Miss V in eyeshot every minute of every day.   But Miss V is materially at risk from third parties if she wanders out of the house, down the street, unaccompanied and without her parents&#8217; knowledge.</p>

The very prospect of any medical intervention, even the simple task of being weighed and measured in a clinic, and of blood pressure being taken, has left Miss V &#8220;petrified&#8221; in the recent past.  It is incumbent on the court in the exercise of the discretion to reduce the need for such medical interventions, particularly since (and perhaps entirely predictably) Miss V displays a greater sense of mistrust of the professionals since the removal of the baby, and this adds another minor impediment to the effective monitoring of plan.  </p>
