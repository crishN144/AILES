It is one of a line of distinguished judicial observations that emphasise the fallibility of human memory and the need to assess witness evidence in its proper place alongside contemporaneous documentary evidence and evidence upon which undoubted or probable reliance can be placed. Earlier statements of this kind are discussed by Lord Bingham in his well-known essay <span style="font-style:italic">The Judge as Juror: The Judicial Determination of Factual Issues </span>(from The Business of Judging, Oxford 2000).

The mother reported that she had had a seven-minute seizure during which A&#8217;s limbs had gone floppy, after which she was unresponsive for 20 to 25 minutes. The mother administered midazolam. Upon initial assessment by paramedics A was scored 3/15 on the Glasgow Coma Score (&#8216;GCS&#8217;), meaning no eye opening and no verbal or motor response. A was still slightly floppy when she arrived at A&amp;E. The mother expressed a wish for A to be transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital as she was afraid that what happened to C would happen to A. The mother reported a seizure when A was on the ward, but when the nurses saw A, she was pink and well perfused. Later that day the mother was in the bathroom with A and shouted for help. When nurses entered, A was very pale, floppy and cyanosed around her lips. A began to scream and roll her eyes back. The mother again expressed her desire for a transfer to Great Ormond Street Hospital or Royal London Hospital, and a referral was made to the latter.</span></p>

Clinicians confirmed the presence of hypoxia, apnoea, pallor and altered consciousness but were unable to witness the commencement of the episodes or to capture the episodes on video telemetry despite careful observation in hospital and for a period in the paediatric intensive care unit. Inability to identify the commencement of the seizure made it difficult to identify the causation. Eventually, events around an episode were captured on video but not full video telemetry. The mother was observed to disconnect the monitoring equipment when B appeared to be well. He was taken by his mother to the toilet and, around 3.5 minutes later, was seen in her arms in an unresponsive state, floppy and blue. The mother had not summoned medical attention which was particularly concerning given his appearance on the video. The cumulation of events, lack of a medical explanation for his presentation and the witnessed event was consistent with induced illness; most likely the result of induced upper airways obstruction causing hypoxia, apnoea, altered consciousness and twitching.</span></p>

He referred to B being seen in his cot shortly before this when the mother went to the toilet without B. B is seen following his mother&#8217;s movements as she left the side of the cot to walk to the ensuite bathroom. Dr Appleton characterised B&#8217;s actions and presentation as &#8216;frozen watchfulness&#8217;, namely that the baby was anxious and scared that something was going to happen to him. This opinion was not set out in his report.</span></p>

They appeared to stop spontaneously. She has had no more episodes since 13th July 2021. Those in B started for no discernible reason on 13th February 2022. They increased in frequency and magnitude until 23rd April 2022. As soon as B was removed from his mother&#8217;s care, and the mother subsequently arrested, they stopped. There have been no episodes since then. None of that is consistent with an unknown cause. Something which just stops suddenly and does not endure&#8221;.</p>

It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child.</p>

He rarely, if ever, spoke with the treating clinicians to gain an understanding of his children&#8217;s respective medical conditions. In short he took no step to protect his children.</span></p>
