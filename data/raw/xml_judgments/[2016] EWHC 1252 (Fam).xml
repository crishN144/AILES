The parents, who are first cousins, are both Afghan nationals.  The father came to this country in 2000 and has since 2007 been a British citizen.  In 2006, he and the mother were married in Afghanistan and in December 2009, their first child Z was born there.  Z is a dual Afghan/British citizen.  When he was four weeks old, he was placed by his parents in the care of their mutual uncle and at the same time they themselves came to England in disputed circumstances.  Once here, the mother again became pregnant, but the parents&#8217; relationship soon broke down and she left the father.  In December 2010, she gave birth to D, a girl who is now aged five.  The mother now has indefinite leave to remain in this country and the parents, who remain separated, have been habitually resident here since January 2010.  The father has never met D.</span></p>

The father&#8217;s response was that the child had disappeared from the uncle&#8217;s home in January 2011 and that his whereabouts was unknown.  An order was made requiring the father to bring the child to England, but that order was overturned by the Court of Appeal in August 2011 on the basis that the English court lacked jurisdiction because Z was not habitually resident here.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In October 2013, the power of the High Court to make protective orders under its inherent jurisdiction on the basis of a child&#8217;s British nationality was identified in the decision of the Supreme Court in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Re A (Jurisdiction: Return of Child) </span><span style="font-size:12pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/60" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 60</ref>.  Following that decision, the mother renewed her efforts to invoke the assistance of this court, though it was not until December 2014 that she obtained legal aid to do so.  A location order was made and in consequence the father&#8217;s passport was seized.  In October 2015, the matter came before Newton J for a fact-finding hearing and in November 2015 he delivered a judgment in which he found that the father had travelled to Afghanistan and removed Z from the care of the uncle in January 2011.  He found that the father knows precisely where Z is to this day.  In reaching these conclusions, the judge accepted the evidence of the mother and the uncle and rejected the evidence of the father.  One salient feature of the evidence was that the father had in 2012 posted on his Facebook page a photograph of Z in which the child appeared to be 2&#189; years old.</span></p>

He continues to maintain that stance despite the judge&#8217;s findings.  Accordingly, this court as yet knows nothing about Z&#8217;s circumstances beyond the fact that he was habitually resident in Afghanistan until the age of one, at which point he was removed from the care of the uncle by the father.  It is not known whether he remains in Afghanistan or whether he has been taken elsewhere, perhaps to one of the other countries to which members of the father&#8217;s family have emigrated.  It is unknown to the court whether he is safe or not, or even whether he is alive.</span></p>

He is a British citizen whose whereabouts and circumstances are unknown to the court and to his mother.  Until that information is available, a high level of concern must exist about his welfare, if only because he has been separated from his mother against her will for almost the whole of his life.  The fact that there is no actual evidence of serious harm gives no reassurance as it is no more than the result of there being no evidence at all.  Even if it was a requirement that the jurisdiction can only be exercised in extreme circumstances (and in my view there is no such requirement), these circumstances are extreme.</span></p>

The considerations that might apply to an application for an order that Z should be brought to this country may be entirely different to those that apply to the present application.</span></p>
