The Court of Appeal ordered that the custody of David, a seven-year-old boy who has lived with his mother in England since the age of eight weeks, should be transferred to his father in Romania.  The order was registered for enforcement in this jurisdiction and the mother has appealed.  At the end of a hearing that took place on 19-20 June, I informed the parties that recognition of the Romanian order would be refused.  This judgment contains my reasons.</span></p>

Even though David has been habitually resident in England since arriving here, his parents have chosen to litigate about him in Romania and the Romanian court has, with one exception, entertained their litigation.  In broad terms, there have been eight main orders over the last six years, with every previous order being subject to appeal or to a rehearing.  The effect of this has been that in the eyes of the Romanian court David has been lawfully in his mother's care for three periods totalling 3&#189; years, while custody has been awarded to his father for four periods totalling 3 years.  This situation does not reflect David&#8217;s actual experience, which has until recently been that he has lived in the continuous care of this mother, but it means that his legal status has been perpetually provisional.  One obvious detriment is that he has been unable to go to and from Romania, with the loss of the family contacts and cultural experiences that he might have enjoyed had the legal position ever been resolved.</span></p>

David&#8217;s interests in this matter are not simply matters of detached principle.  The consequence of the fathers application succeeding would be profound for him, even if it might be in his interests, and I am therefore satisfied that this is, on its exceptional facts, an entirely exceptional case for the appointment of a Children&#8217;s Guardian and I so appoint Ms Odze.  However, in doing so, I make clear what is already obvious to the parties, namely that there will be no further welfare investigation into this matter pending the further hearing unless circumstances arise that lead the Guardian to feel that such further information-gathering is necessary. </span></p>

Where, as here, there is only one active party to the litigation, the case (factual and legal) is inevitably presented in accordance with that party&#8217;s view of the children&#8217;s interests, which may or may not be the only perspective.  In the absence of any argument from the mother to counter the father&#8217;s presentation, there was therefore a risk in this case that what was actually in the children&#8217;s best interests would not emerge and that the arguments, legal and factual, that would further those interests may be overlooked. It was for that reason that I decided, as I said in my earlier judgment, that in their interests they should be represented separately in the appeal. </span></p>

It is of course possible to envisage a decision so ridiculous in child welfare terms that it would offend public policy.  For example, this might arise if the beneficiary of the order was a gangster, a drug addict or a paedophile.  Such a decision would be so offensive to the court&#8217;s conscience that the article would most likely be engaged.  Here, however, even though a change in custody and country would be painful and might be damaging, David has a substantial relationship with his father and the mother has not raised any concerns about the father's abilities.  Romania is the country of origin of both parents and the country of residence of both sets of grandparents.  If the mother were unable to care for David for any reason, he would almost certainly pass into his father&#8217;s care. </span></p>

This was a report by a CAFCASS officer when David was two years old.  It was commissioned by this court during the father's first set of enforcement proceedings in order to inform the decision about the father having staying contact.  The author, Bola Ogunnaike, saw David twice.  She reported that he was too young to express his views but showed a good level of attachment to both parents.  It was likely that he felt more emotionally secure with his mother but he was happy and relaxed with his father.  A gradual introduction of staying contact was recommended, and this is what in fact happened.   </span></p>

This refers to an Initial Assessment carried out by David&#8217;s local authority over the course of a fortnight in April 2012, when he was 5&#189;  years old.  The assessment was carried out in response to concerns raised by the father about the mother's care.   David was seen on his own.  The report's author, Kim Brownlie, described him as a bright and articulate boy, who spoke positively about his relationship with his mother and was excited to describe games that he played with his father.  Ms  Brownlie found David to be a well-loved and happy child and the mother to be a caring and loving mother who was focused on his needs.  She considered the father's referral to be malicious and the local authority took no further action in relation to it.  I reach no view about the father&#8217;s motivation (the report&#8217;s author did not engage with him when reaching that conclusion), but note that this assessment took place in the context of a child protection investigation, and was not a report in relation to the father's proposal to take David to Romania.</span></p>

So, for example, someone in the father&#8217;s position could simply arrive from abroad and take the child from school to the airport without telling anyone.  Ms Renton disagrees saying that there is a working assumption that a further order of a High Court judge is required before the order can be enforced.</span></p>

Rule 31.7 provides that the court will not enforce a judgment until after the expiration of the time for appeal, showing that enforcement is a separate step from registration and implying that it is a necessary one.  However, it is unnecessary in this case to resolve the issue of whether registration of an order allows it to be acted upon without further authority.  It may be unsatisfactory for there to be ambiguity on the question, but this father did not in fact engage in self-help, but sought to enforce the Romanian order by means of a further order.  I accept that the registering of an order under BIIR is an important step; there is no need to go further. </span></p>

He describes this as a judicial act whereby the district judge ensures that the application is compliant.  If it is not, he must reject it, give directions (r.31.6), or dispense with production of documents (r.31.5).  The core documents that are required are the translated judgment and Annex II certificate.  These documents prove the foreign judgment and provide reassurance that the procedural safeguards in Article 23 have been met.  Mr Devereux submits that there can be no room for any significant defect in the process nor any retrospective curing of defects in the registration process under Art. 38(1) or r. 31(5).</span></p>

This will normally involve checking that the documents are in order and that there is no evident reason why registration should be refused.  It does not call for an exhaustive or sceptical examination of the underlying documentation with a view to unearthing possible grounds for challenge.  Issues of that kind will be determined on appeal.</span></p>

It seems to me that the degree of care with which these applications should be considered must bear some relationship to the consequences of registration.  If there are substantial shortcomings, registration should not occur without them being corrected.  If any significant departure from normal procedure is permitted, the reason for it should be expressed in the order.</span></p>

The process must be fair to both parties, even if special consideration is due to the position of the party who cannot be heard at the registration stage.  An insistence on faultless compliance could lead to absurd and unfair results.  </span></p>

It would be pedantic and unfair to the father to allow the mother&#8217;s appeal on procedural grounds beyond his control where they had no practical effect.
