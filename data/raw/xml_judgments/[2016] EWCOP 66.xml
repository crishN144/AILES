It provides for frequent reviews with a default of annual reviews even if there has been no event that triggers an earlier review which is entirely appropriate given the unusual facts of this case.  I say unusual, in that I have not, in a number of years that I have been sitting in the Court of Protection, encountered facts such as these before, but on reflection I am not so sure that the situation is in fact likely to be that uncommon.</span></p>

HIV, as is well-known, is a retrovirus, which in layman terms attacks one&#8217;s immune system.  Specifically, as has been explained to me by Dr&#160;E, it attacks the group of lymphocytes, or white blood cells, known as CD4 cells, and these CD4 cells are a vital organic protection for the human species in the fight against infection.  They are, as I have said, lymphocytes: white blood cells, and as most relatively well-educated people know, when you have an infection white blood cells are the first troops that arrive to fight the infection, and if they are compromised then your ability to fight infection is correspondingly damaged.</span></p>

As the volume of CD4 cells reduces so the likelihood of development of AIDS arises.  When the actual condition of AIDS arises it only takes a minor infection, a bout of pneumonia for example, for that to be lethal.</span></p>

For the majority there would be, in all likelihood, a progression to AIDS and a macabre demise.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">However, medical science has made extraordinary leaps forward in addressing this unpleasant phenomenon, and anti-retroviral drugs have been developed.  They are called anti-retroviral drugs because they attack retroviruses, of which HIV is one.  The way these drugs work is that they pin back the advance of the virus which would otherwise march forward, multiply and infect, destroying the CD4 cells.  They not only pin it back but actually reduce the quantity of infected cells.</span></p>

I would have thought that was almost impossible, but that is the evidence that I have received.</span></p>

Of course, it might be said that that is a pipe dream, because we do not know everyone who is infected, and in some parts of the world, in the developing world, it would be difficult to identify all those who are infected, let alone to treat them all.  However, it does mean, that in theory at least, elimination of this scourge is within mankind&#8217;s grasp.</span></p>

Her evidence demonstrated to me that, although people who suffer from this disorder do, from time to time, recover, the extent of relapses in this case, and their scale, means that in her opinion it is unlikely that in the foreseeable future she will recover from her psychiatric condition.  Her psychiatric condition means that she is unquestionably incapacitated under the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, in relation to the decision whether to engage in anti-retroviral treatment.</span></p>

For example, she does not believe that, now, she is HIV positive.  She believes that she is a participant in a film about HIV, in which she will be participating with her husband.  She does not, in fact, have a husband, but she believes that she is married to a celebrity sportsman.  She believes that the person who is her husband will come back for her and take her away to live in connubial bliss.  She believes that when blood samples are taken from her by the hospital staff it is done by them for the purposes of drinking her blood.  Above all, she is positive that she is not HIV infected, and were she to learn that she was being secretly and clandestinely administered with anti-retroviral treatment the evidence is that she would be exceedingly aggrieved.</span></p>

However, on the facts of this case, there can be no doubt that there has to be authorised a course of action that ensures that AB, in her best interests, receives the treatment that will likely save her.
