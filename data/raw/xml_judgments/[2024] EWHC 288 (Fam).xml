P was born in December 2017 and is now aged 6 years old.  The respondents to the appeal are P&#8217;s mother, EB (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;), and P&#8217;s father, TM (hereafter &#8216;the father&#8217;).  The appellants are P&#8217;s paternal grandfather and paternal step-grandmother.  Permission to appeal was granted by Sir Jonthan Cohen on 20 December 2023.</p>

No concerns were identified regarding the mother&#8217;s parenting capacity.  P was born on 22 December 2017.  All parties accept that P spent regular time with the appellants, including overnight stays, until this ceased in March or April 2021, when the father made an application to spend time with P.</p>

On 3 March 2022, the Judge made an order granting the father parental responsibility for P and providing that P live with the mother and have contact with the father in prison on four occasions per year, together with indirect contact by way of monthly letters.  By that order, the Judge further provided that the contact was to be facilitated by the appellants.  </p>

In her judgment on the appellants&#8217; current application, at paragraph 4, the Judge records the mother&#8217;s &#8220;initial reluctance&#8221; to co-operate with the child arrangements order of 3 March 2022 in favour of the father.  During the enforcement proceedings, CAFCASS recorded concerns expressed by the father&#8217;s probation officer that the appellant paternal grandfather was discussing with the father ways they could fraudulently evidence to the court that there was an ongoing relationship between the father and P, through fake letters and cards.   The appellant paternal grandfather refutes that allegation.  As a result of the enforcement proceedings, whilst the level of contact between P and the father in prison remained as originally ordered, the Judge directed that contact be facilitated by a person chosen by the mother. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 22 July 2022, the appellants applied for permission to apply for a child arrangements order with P.  At an initial hearing of the appellants&#8217; application on 16 November 2022, the appellants were granted permission pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(9)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> to apply for a child arrangements order.  At that hearing, the court ordered that a safeguarding letter be prepared by CAFCASS.  Upon receipt of that safeguarding letter, the court gave directions on paper for the preparation of a report pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.7</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (hereafter &#8216;the CAFCASS report&#8217;) and listed the matter for a Dispute Resolution Appointment on 14 June 2023, pursuant to paragraph 19 of FPR 2010 PD 12B.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the receipt of the order listing the matter for a Dispute Resolution Appointment, on 22 February 2023 the appellants issued a C2 application form requesting disclosure into their proceedings of the evidence from the previous proceedings between the father and the mother.  This court does not have a copy of that C2 application, but it is asserted in the appellants&#8217; initial grounds of appeal that the court did not process or deal with that application.  During the hearing, and in response to the court&#8217;s enquiry, Mr Pressdee and Mr Basi indicated that there was no order made requiring the disclosure of the evidence from the previous proceedings between the father and the mother into the proceedings dealing with the appellants&#8217; application.  The order made by the Judge at the Dispute Resolution Appointment, to which I will come in more detail below, appears to bear this out.  That order provides only that the safeguarding letters from the previous proceedings be disclosed into the proceedings commenced by the appellants (it is not clear whether this direction was made in response to the C2 application).  The CAFCASS report likewise suggests that the Family Court Adviser did not have access to the papers from the previous proceedings between the father and the mother. In the circumstances, it would not appear that those papers were available to the appellants, the Family Court Adviser or the Judge ahead of the final hearing on 4 October 2023.</p>

At a hearing of the second enforcement application on 1 March 2023, the mother agreed to facilitate contact during the Easter holidays.  That contact took place and was the first contact since the making of the child arrangements order on 3 March 2022.  The second set of enforcement proceedings concluded on 19 May 2023 with no amendment to the father&#8217;s level of contact and an agreement that the paternal grandmother would facilitate the contact in prison.</p>

In the CAFCASS report that was ultimately produced, the Family Court Adviser details the issues she had in meeting with P.  The report details that, following the direction for a CAFCASS report, the mother withdrew her consent for wishes and feelings work to be completed with P.  This resulted in District Judge Montanaro making an order on 26 May 2023 that, in its entirety, was in the following terms:</p>

This is a direction of the court not voluntary. Cafcass need to meet with the child to prepare that report. If the Mother contends that the report should not be prepared then she must make an application to the court and the matter will be listed for a hearing. The court indicates that it is highly unlikely it will discharge such direction at this stage as the court needs the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.7</ref> report to be able to reach conclusions and it is vital that Cafcass are able to see the child to do that.

Latterly, the mother agreed to a meeting at the CAFCASS Office and that meeting with P took place following a hearing on 14 June 2023 before the Lay Justices.  At that hearing, the court adjourned the Dispute Resolution Hearing to 15 August 2023 in circumstances where the CAFCASS report was still not yet available.  The order made on 14 June 2023 contains a recital recording that the mother had confirmed that she would co-operate fully with CAFCASS to ensure P could be seen and the CAFCASS report completed.  At the hearing on 14 June 2023, the court also made a direction that all parties file and serve Position Statements 5 days before the next hearing, outlining whether they agreed or disagreed with the recommendations in the CAFCASS report. </p>

Additionally [the mother] has presented as resentful at times in relation to [the appellants] and I am concerned that her decision making in this regard is led by her own adult feelings and issues rather than for concern about P&#8217;s welfare should he spend time with them.

Handovers should take place by an agreed third party or in a public setting where there is CCTV (supermarket entrance). [The appellants] should also be permitted to send cards/small gifts to P on special occasion such as Christmas and Birthdays.

The appellants assert that they were not provided at the Dispute Resolution Appointment with a copy of the document or the exhibit.  The mother did not seek to gainsay this assertion during her submissions.  The appellant paternal grandfather emailed the court after the hearing to request a copy of the document and the Judge responded noting that the mother should have served the document on the appellants, pursuant to the order of 14 June 2023, and stating that she could not see any objection to the document being provided to the appellants in circumstances where they were parties to the proceedings.  This court has been provided by the appellants with a copy of the document dated 18 August 2023 but not the exhibited letter, which the appellants contend has never been made available to them.  Whilst titled &#8220;Statement&#8221;, the document dated 18 August 2023 emailed by the mother to the court ahead of the Dispute Resolution Appointment would appear to be the Position Statement directed by the Lay Justices on 14 June 2023.

[The appellant paternal grandfather] turned up to my mum&#8217;s house with a cheap phone and sim card so that I had no excuse not to miss [the father&#8217;s] calls from prison.

If she is not, then he is likely to suffer emotionally as a result.  I am entirely satisfied that [the mother] is telling the truth when she says that she has experienced [the appellants] as being overbearing at times.  Whilst I acknowledge that there would be a benefit to P of being able to have a relationship with his wider paternal family, including a greater sense of his culture and heritage, that benefit has to be weighed against the possible detriment to him of having contact arrangements imposed upon his mother about which she is fundamentally opposed and in which she has little voice or say.   </p>

To put him through that every month as suggested by Ms A seems to me to be actively to expose him to harm and I am afraid that I do not believe, in reaching her recommendations, the Cafcass officer has sufficiently considered this side of the equation.  I do not accept the criticisms of [the mother] by the Cafcass officer are warranted. Ms A reached the view that [the mother] is negatively inclined towards [the appellants] for no reason, but [the mother] has set out in her statement her experience of them and I accept her evidence about that. Indeed, it is my assessment of them also.   </p>

It is not my impression that he has been willing to listen to the impact of all on this [the mother] and there is a considerable risk, in my view, that that dynamic will continue moving forward.  [The mother] has ensured that P spends time with [the father&#8217;s] biological mother and, therefore, his grandmother and, indeed, with [the father], so, he does have an appropriate link with his wider paternal family.  As a point of principle, I do not accept that it is right to provide the paternal grandparents to make up for the contact that [the father] would have had with him had the situation been different.&#8221;</p>

With respect to that recommendation, as set out in the foregoing passage of the judgment, the Judge concluded that the Family Court Adviser had not taken sufficient account of the dynamics in the adult relationships.  In addition, in setting out her reasons for rejecting the recommendation of the Family Court Adviser, the Judge concluded as follows:</p>

I am afraid I was forced to conclude that Ms A had not properly balanced any of these issues when making her recommendation for contact, and, for those reasons, I depart from her recommendation. Whilst she was undoubtedly right to say that the dysfunction between the adult relationships would be one that she would expect the adults to work on, I fear that that there is no willingness to be able to do that to make things better and P will continue to be caught in the crossfire.&#8221;</p>

They further submit that the Judge failed to account for the mother&#8217;s role in the prolonging of the proceedings by her non-compliance with the original order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By Ground 7, the appellants contend that the Judge erred in forming an unduly adverse view of the appellants. On behalf of the appellants, Mr Pressdee and Mr Basi submit that the Judge&#8217;s view that the appellants were &#8220;arrogant&#8221;, &#8220;domineering&#8221; and &#8220;supercilious&#8221; was not supported by the totality of the evidence, including the CAFCASS report and the appellants&#8217; evidenced communications with the mother. They further submit in reaching her conclusion regarding the appellants, that the Judge relied disproportionately on her own assessment of the appellants at court and, in particular, on what she viewed as the appellants&#8217; unjustified criticisms of the court process, in circumstances where there were objective grounds for the appellants to be concerned about the fairness of the process.</p>

Finally, by Ground 9, the appellants contend that the Judge failed to have sufficient regard to the recommendation of the Family Court Adviser, and in particular her evidence concerning the mother.</p>

In this regard, in addition to fairness <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>, the appearance of fairness will also be important.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important at the outset to acknowledge the very real challenges facing busy Circuit judges required to deal with private law proceedings, and which the Judge faced in this case.  In private law litigation in particular, and following the coming into force of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10" uk:canonical="2012 c. 10" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012</ref>, judges are now more often than not faced with self-representing parties who are entirely unfamiliar not only with the substantive law but also, and importantly, with the requirements of the Family Procedure Rules 2010, including the proper form and filing of evidence.  In this context, Circuit judges are regularly dealing with highly complex family situations without the assistance of lawyers to marshal the relevant evidence in accordance with the rules of procedure.  It is further important to recognise that the workload of the Circuit bench creates an imperative to get on with the case if possible and to avoid adjournments based on procedural matters, the result of which would be to cause further delay in reaching a decision for the subject child.  No judge wishes a family to have to be before the court for any longer than is strictly necessary.  All that said, I have concluded that the appellants&#8217; appeal must be allowed on Grounds 1 and 2 of the amended Grounds of Appeal.  My reasons for so deciding are as follows.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By FPR 2010 r.22.1, the court is empowered to control the evidence by giving directions.  Pursuant to FPR 2010 r.22.2(1)(b), any fact that needs to be proved at a final hearing is to be proved by oral evidence. Within this context, pursuant to FPR 2010 r.22.5(1), the court may give directions as to service on the other parties of witness statements of the oral evidence on which a party intends to rely in relation to any issues of fact to be decided at the final hearing.  Whilst FPR 2010 r.22.5(1) provides the court with a discretion as to service of such witness statements, having regard to the requirement in the Overriding Objective to deal with the matter fairly, as informed by principles of natural justice and the principles enshrined in Art 6, the court will ordinarily direct witness statements of the oral evidence on which a party intends to rely in relation to any issues of fact to be decided at the final hearing and will do so at a point that allows the other parties a proper opportunity to understand and answer the evidence against them.</p>

The case management orders, made on 16 November 2022, 26 May 2023, 14 June 2023 and 18 August 2023, suggest that at no point prior to the final hearing on 4 October 2023 were directions given pursuant to FPR 2010 r.22.5(1) for witness statements of the oral evidence on which the parties intended to rely in relation to any issues of fact to be decided at the final hearing from either the appellants, who were each applicants in these proceedings, or the mother, who by virtue of having care of P was the primary respondent to the application.  Although the appellants sent a statement to the court ahead of the final hearing, that statement was not directed by the court, was filed in breach of the order of 18 August 2023 and was not signed.  The document provided to the court by the mother dated 30 September 2023 was likewise not directed by the court, was filed in breach of the order of 18 August 2023 and contained no statement of truth.  It would not appear that at the final hearing permission pursuant to FPR 2010 r.22.1(3) was given to the appellants or the mother to rely on these documents as evidence in the context of a failure to comply with the provisions of FPR 2010 Part 22.</p>

However, FPR r.22.5(1) makes clear that a witness statement is a statement of the oral evidence on which a party intends to rely in relation to any issues of fact to be decided at the final hearing, signed by a person.  A witness statement must comply with the requirements of PD22A and FPR 2010 r.17.2(1) stipulates that a witness statement must be verified by a statement of truth. The document dated 8 August 2023 sent to the court by the mother, apparently in response to the direction for Position Statements made by the Lay Justices on 14 June 2023, was not directed as a statement of the oral evidence on which the mother intended to rely in relation to any issues of fact to be decided at the final hearing and contained no statement of truth.  </p>

Having regard to the contents of the case management orders, the appellants do not appear to have been afforded the opportunity to file and serve a witness statement of the oral evidence on which they intended to rely in relation to any issues of fact to be decided at the final hearing ahead of that final hearing on 4 October 2023.  Further, the mother likewise does not appear to have been afforded the opportunity to file and serve a witness statement of the oral evidence on which she intended to rely in response to any issues of fact to be decided at the final hearing.  In those circumstances, ahead of the final hearing the appellants had had no opportunity to see the evidence of the mother that might affect the court's decision.  Whilst there had been previous proceedings between the parents, beyond the safeguarding letters from those proceedings no direction had apparently been made for the disclosure into these proceedings of the witness evidence from those prior proceedings.</p>

Likewise, no party disputes that the Judge allowed the mother to rely on that document at the final hearing, although it is not clear whether the Judge expressly dealt with the question of permission pursuant to FPR 2010 r.22.1(3).  It is equally not disputed that the appellants had not been served with the document dated 30 September 2023 ahead of the final hearing, only learned of its existence at the final hearing and were accorded 20 minutes to read and consider the document, without the exhibits, before the appellant paternal grandfather was cross examined, including on the contents of the document.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The document produced by the mother contained what was, on any estimation, a serious allegation against the appellant paternal grandfather.  Namely, that the appellant paternal grandfather aided a breach of bail conditions. Whilst breach of conditions of bail is not a Bail Act offence, nor is it a contempt of court unless there is some additional feature (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Ashley</span> [2004] 1 Cr. App. R. 23), the allegation raised in the mother&#8217;s document was nonetheless a grave one, a positive finding in respect of which was capable of having significant ramifications for the appellant paternal grandfather.  In the circumstances, I am unable to agree with the Judge that this was a minor point.  Rather, it was a serious allegation of dishonest conduct on the part of the appellant paternal grandfather in the context of ongoing criminal proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of equal significance is the fact that the allegation had not previously been raised in the proceedings arising from the appellants&#8217; application for contact and was disputed.  As I have noted, the document from the mother dated 8 August 2023 did not contain the allegation, the mother is not recorded by the Family Court Adviser as having mentioned that allegation during the course of the preparation of the CAFCASS report and the Family Court Adviser&#8217;s account of the safeguarding information available from the previous proceedings makes no mention of such an allegation. Whilst the mother contends that the appellants knew of the allegation from the proceedings between the father and the mother, a point disputed by the father in his short submissions, I accept the submission of Mr Pressdee and Mr Basi that, even if true, this is not the point.  The allegation had not been raised in <span style="font-style:italic">these</span> proceedings and, much more fundamentally, the appellants did not know until they were at court on the day of the final hearing that the allegation was going to be raised against the appellant paternal grandfather in these proceedings, that the mother was going to be permitted to rely on that allegation and that the court was going to decide whether the allegation was made out on the balance of probabilities.  It is not disputed that the appellants were not given an opportunity to file and serve a witness statement in answer to the new allegation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, it is clear from the judgment that the Judge went on to use the finding that the paternal grandfather had aided a breach of bail conditions to inform a wider finding against the appellants of a willingness to lie and a finding that the mother&#8217;s perception of the appellants generally was justified.  The judge then used those findings, together with further extracts from the document of 30 September 2023 regarding the mother&#8217;s perceptions of the appellants, in reaching her central conclusion that it was not in P&#8217;s best interests to have any contact with the appellants beyond the indirect contact ordered by the Judge, given the personalities of the appellants, their attitude to the mother and the mother&#8217;s experience of the appellants in real life.   In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the unfairness to the appellants identified above affected the proceedings as a whole. I accept the submission that the approach taken by the Judge deprived the appellants of the opportunity to effectively influence the outcome of the hearing.</p>

Taken with the matters I have set out above, the absence of appellants having access to a court bundle further breached the common law principle of natural justice, as reflected in the Overriding Objective in FPR r.1.1 and the requirements of Art 6 of the ECHR.

This situation means, however, that in seeking to achieve fairness it is all the more important that the rules of evidence set out in FPR 2010, including those concerning the filing and serving of witness statements set out in FPR 2010 Part 22, are applied by the court to represented and unrepresented litigants alike.  </p>
