The mother and father are married; each parent has children from previous marriages and/or relationships.

I am bound to observe that the general preparation of the Applicant&#8217;s case was not the finest example of its type. The father failed to comply strictly with the direction (Order 6.11.18) to provide a list of the protective undertakings he was prepared to offer, and his generalised comments (cited below at [33]) fell rather short of the onus on him to &#8220;establish that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his return&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Art.11.4 BIIR</span>). Furthermore, his statements contained internally contradictory information, reflective, I believe, of a lack of care in their preparation. I make these points as the deficits in the preparation of his case &#8211; uncharacteristic of the generally high quality of case preparation which the Courts are accustomed to seeing from solicitors on the ICACU accredited panel &#8211; have rendered my task, in this essentially summary process where heavy reliance is placed on the filed documents, all the more difficult. </p>

In her statement of evidence, and in the preparatory documents for this hearing, the mother tentatively suggested that the father had consented to or acquiesced in her removal or retention of A in this jurisdiction, but she does not pursue either argument at the hearing.   </p>

Shortly thereafter the mother and A travelled to England.  There is a dispute on the face of the documents about whether the father knew or consented to the mother travelling to England; it is not necessary for me to determine this, as it is not now the mother&#8217;s case that the father consented to her bringing A to this jurisdiction permanently.  The mother travelled to visit her sister and the sister&#8217;s partner who live in Manchester.  It is the father&#8217;s case that the mother&#8217;s sister is a professional stripper, and that the sister&#8217;s partner abuses drugs.  Indeed, it is the father&#8217;s case (as I mentioned at [13] above) that the mother continues to make a living from working in strip clubs; she claims to work in a restaurant. </p>

The text of the report/statement is rather garbled, but the gist is clear enough.  He rightly suspected that the mother had travelled to England, and indeed he followed her here.  He booked into a hotel in Manchester.  He asked for and was allowed contact with A.  The mother and father had discussions about their future; the mother reports that she told the father that she wished the relationship to end.  It was, apparently, in response to this news that the father made an attempt on his own life.  On or about 15 April 2018, he took an overdose of the medication Xanax/Alprazolam<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

Of course, some time shortly thereafter she decided to pursue her life in England.

The father was directed by order of 6 November 2018 (Mr Garrido QC sitting as a DHCJ) to set out in a statement &#8220;what protective undertakings he offers in the event that the child is summarily returned either to Germany or Hungary&#8221;.  He had responded in his statement by saying &#8220;I am prepared to give all of the usual and any undertakings after the A&#8217;s (sic.) return, required by the respondent or the court to protect the mother and the child A in the short term if the mother returns with the child&#8221;.  In his second statement he confirms: &#8220;I will offer any undertakings further to assist in A&#8217;s return&#8221;.  I am conscious that I should not require the father to offer undertakings which are so onerous or elaborate that their implementation may delay a return, but the father&#8217;s very generalised offer here falls far short of what a court would need to see.  I am only expecting that the undertakings should provide for the necessities of A, such as a roof over his head, protection from harm, and adequate maintenance until, and only until, the court of habitual residence (or the court of the country to which the return order is made, if different) can become seised of the proceedings brought in that jurisdiction (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Child Abduction: Undertakings)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 1021" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 1021</ref>): </p>

It would be helpful if realistic time-limits for the compliance with the undertakings were included in the orders to return the child, but in the absence of a specified time, clearly the court would consider a reasonable time and not allow the case to drag on with repeated applications to the court&#8221; (ibid.)

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It is difficult to form a confident view about domestic violence during the parties&#8217; relationship and marriage. There is, however, incontrovertible evidence of a serious act of violence perpetrated on the mother after the wrongful removal or retention which lends some weight to the mother&#8217;s case that this was an abusive relationship.  Although at her visit to her GP in February (prior to the removal) the mother&#8217;s complaints of a history of violence were all self-reported (there was no independent contemporary verification of her account), the history certainly coincides with the father&#8217;s undoubtedly abusive conduct on 15 April.  I am therefore unpersuaded by the father&#8217;s case that in visiting her GP to make complaint, the mother was merely laying false ground for her departure, and his protestation that his conduct was &#8216;out of character&#8217; is less convincing than the mother&#8217;s account that this was part of a pattern.  Whether the domestic abuse was as bad as she says it was is a matter on which I cannot reach any firm adjudication, but I proceed on the basis that she has established to my satisfaction that the father has displayed violence to her both historically and recently. </p>

I am loath to use the word &#8216;exceptional&#8217; because to do so would be to overstate the position; further, &#8216;exceptional&#8217; is one of those words which once used tends to acquire quasi-statutory authority in a wholly unintended way. For my part, I would be prepared to accept that it will be an <span style="font-style:italic">unusual</span> case where the court will order a return to a third state, but it is in principle unobjectionable, and each case will be fact-sensitive.  As it is, the mother would, it seems to me be more greatly disadvantaged in the return order being made to Germany &#8211; a country where, she says, she never wanted to live. At least in Hungary she has family and some support. </p>
