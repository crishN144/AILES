First, I draw attention to the fact that Theis J was prepared to read down &#8211; and in my judgment correctly prepared to read down &#8211; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(4)</ref>(a) to enable her to make a parental order after one of the commissioning parents had died notwithstanding that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(4)</ref>(a), in contrast it may be noted to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref>, seemingly requires the relevant condition to be satisfied both "at the time of the application" and "at the time of &#8230; the making of the order." If that degree of 'reading down' is permissible in relation to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(4)</ref>(a) &#8211; and Theis J held that it was, and I respectfully agree &#8211; then the lesser degree of 'reading down' required in relation to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref> is surely a fortiori. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.24in"><span style="font-style:italic">The other point is this. Theis J focused on that aspect of Article 8 which protects "family life", but Article 8 also protects "private life", and 'identity', on which she appropriately laid stress, is an important aspect of "private life". So, any application for a parental order implicates both the child's right to "family life" and also the child's right to "private life". The distinction does not matter in the circumstances of the present case (see further below) but I make the point because it is, I suppose, possible to conceive of a case where, on the facts, it might be more difficult or even impossible to demonstrate the existence of "family life." &#8216;             </span></p>

It is clear N&#8217;s home with K and L is the only home she has known, whilst making the order will extinguish her legal relationship that exists in this jurisdiction with P and her husband, N has had no contact with them, and they have agreed to this court making a parental order. A parental order will secure in a lifelong way her legal relationship with K and L, with the emotional and psychological benefits that come with that security and will provide a legal reality to match her day to day life. The order is supported by Ms Julian, who has provided two detailed reports setting out her recommendation. </p>
