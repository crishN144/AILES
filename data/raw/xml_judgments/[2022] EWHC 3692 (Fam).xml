	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">This is my judgment in relation to this application for an inward return order.  I set out the background in very brief summary.  In July 2021, the mother, T, travelled to Iran with their two children, W, born in 2008, and X, born in 2012.  Their father, V, was living there.  The parents were married in the United Kingdom, participating in a religious marriage in 2007 and thereafter a civil marriage.  The children were born here and, at the time that they went to Iran, had been brought up here, both being in full-time education.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Return tickets for that trip had been booked for 24 August 2021.  On 3 August 2021, however, the mother sought to return to the UK with the children.  They were stopped at the airport by the immigration authorities and the children were not allowed to leave.  The mother made a decision to return to the UK.  She says that this was because she feared that the registration of her religious marriage in Iran would have the effect that the father could prevent her from leaving too.  The mother says that she left the children in the custody of her parents; the father says that she abandoned them at the airport and that the mother wanted to live a new life free of the children.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">I have seen a letter from the Family Wellbeing Service of the local authority confirming that the mother contacted them on 4 August 2021, i.e. the day after she left Iran, to say that her children had been stopped at the airport and to seek advice as to how to get them back.  There followed a period in which the mother says that she sought to negotiate with the father for the return of the children.  It appears that an application was made to the court in Iran for custody, and that was withdrawn in March 2022.  The mother says she was persuaded to withdraw it to protect the children.  However that may be, an application was not made to this court until 21 July 2022.  That application was for a passport order as the father was due to visit the UK.  That was granted by Judd J on 22 July 2022, the father&#8217;s passport was seized.  The mother made an application on the same day for an order for the return of the children.  The matter returned before Judd J on 7 September 2022, when the father was represented.  She gave directions for evidence in relation to the passport order and directed that the order and port alerts continue.</p>

By an application dated 15 September 2022, W, via solicitors, sought disclosure of the papers and an adjournment of the hearing listed for 16 September 2022 so that he could be advised as to joinder.  On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>September 2022, Peel J did adjourn the matter, noting that the father opposed the mother&#8217;s application for a return order on a jurisdictional basis in relation to habitual residence and also on the basis that Iran was the appropriate forum in any event.  He gave further directions and continued the passport order and port alerts.</p>

His standard safeguarding checks included a search of the Police National Computer, which revealed a long list of aliases for the father, together with a number of convictions.  He spoke to W and X by telephone.  He saw them briefly by video as well but the connection was apparently somewhat disrupted.  For present purposes, I need only say that Mr Lill was satisfied that the views expressed to him were the authentic views of the children and not influenced by the mother.  He concluded:</p>

Indeed, they are currently not living with an adult who has Parental Responsibility, and they are not attending school and have not done so on any significant basis for over a year.  In terms of their emotional welfare, the children, aged 14 and 10, are largely responsible for looking after each other and W feels responsible for his younger sister.  Both children raise a concern about the further risk of harm in the event that their father returns to Iran whereby it is unclear to what extent their basic needs would be met or if this would deteriorate&#8217;</p>

He directed that they should attend this hearing.  He left over the question of whether there should be oral evidence at this hearing to the trial judge.  Despite Newton J&#8217;s order, when the matter came before me last week, the children did not appear, the notarised consent had not been executed and the children had not been returned from Iran.</p>

I also directed oral evidence as to the location of the passports, which was agreed by the parties.  I did not permit oral evidence as to welfare generally for reasons that I gave at the time.  In summary, I made that decision because the court was not dealing with the final determination of a child arrangements order; I was considering whether summary return should be ordered.  In my judgment, in light of the evidence and the allegations made, the information that I required for those purposes was principally set out in the papers.  Moreover, no directions had been given for evidence or reports as to welfare more generally.  W, by virtue of the fact that he was not in court, was not in a position to give instructions to his lawyers in relation to matters that might have been raised in oral evidence.</p>

In evaluating this limb the following will be relevant; (a) the desirability of deciding questions as to a child&#8217;s future upbringing in the state of his habitual residence and the child&#8217;s and the parties&#8217; connections with the competing forums in particular the jurisdictional foundation; (b) the relatively ability of each forum to determine the issues including the availability of investigating and reporting systems.  In practice judges will be reluctant to assume that facilities for a fair trial are not available in the court of another jurisdiction but this may have to give way to the evidence in any particular case; (c) the availability of witnesses and the convenience and expense to the parties of attending and participating in the hearing; (d) the availability of legal representation; (e) any earlier agreement as to where disputes should be litigated; (f) the stage any proceedings have reached in either jurisdiction and the likely date of the substantive hearing; (g) principles of international comity, in so far as they are relevant to the particular situation in the case in question.  However public interest or public policy considerations not related to the private interests of the parties and the ends of justice in the particular case have no bearing on the decision which the court has to make; (h) it has also been held that it is relevant to consider the prospects of success of the applications.</p>

This has been their home for the majority of their lives.  There was no common intention to relocate them permanently when the family travelled to Iran.  They had return tickets and the father went so far as to contend in this hearing that, had he been asked for his permission for the children to return to the UK when they were stopped at the airport, he would have granted it.  Although both parents have Iranian heritage and both the parents and the children are dual British and Iranian citizens, the mother has lived in this jurisdiction for some twenty years and she works as a teacher here.  While she spent the first twenty-nine years of her life in Iran, she is now settled here.  </p>

This was so, even in those cases decided around the time that the Hague Convention was being implemented here, where it was held that the courts should take account of its philosophy&#8230;  The Court of Appeal, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (A Minor) (Child Abduction: Non Convention County)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] Fam 45" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] Fam 45</ref> has held that the Hague Convention concepts are not to be applied in a non-Convention case.

If such a case is promptly brought to the attention of a court in this country, the judge may feel that it is in the best interests of the infant that these disturbing factors should be eliminated from his life as speedily as possible.  A full investigation of the merits of the case in an English court may be incompatible with achieving this.  The judge may well be persuaded that it would be better for the child that those merits should be investigated in a court in his native country.&#8217;</p>

A fortiori, the hope that countries which have not yet become parties to such treaties might be encouraged to do so in future is irrelevant.

What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run.

A child may be deeply unhappy about being recruited to one side in a parental battle.

There is nothing in those principles which prevents a court from giving great weight to the culture in which a child has been brought up when deciding how and where he will fare best in the future.  Our own society is a multi-cultural one, but looking at it from the child&#8217;s point of view, as we all try to do, it may sometimes be necessary to resolve or diffuse a clash between the different cultures within his own family.&#8221;</p>

He felt scared as to what would happen if it were discovered that he was a British citizen, and he described feeling unsafe as a result of current civil unrest in Iran.  He had done limited online schooling in Iran, which he considered to be something of a waste of time because he spoke limited Farsi, and did not get out much.</p>

They have not physically attended school in Iran, having simply been enrolled in an online course, and they have little in the way of friends or contact with peers.  While it is said they will go to school in due course and will develop friends, that is speculative.  As I have said, there is a real question-mark about the extent of their language skills that would allow them to develop a sense of belonging in Iran.  There is a real risk in my judgment that W and X&#8217;s educational attainment will be adversely affected if they do not return to an educational environment with which they are familiar.  </p>

Both children have expressed fear of their father and alleged violence.  X has expressed concern about the behaviour of some of her father&#8217;s friends [detail removed].

It states that W has not instructed anyone to represent him and that any statement apart from the instant one is as a result of coercion.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">I am concerned as to how the statement made in Iran came to be made and, in this context, I have listened to recordings of telephone conversations between W and his father.  These were put in evidence in the form of transcripts by the father to indicate that W was being influenced by his mother.  Listening to the recordings places a different complexion on them.  W sounds bored and somewhat browbeaten.  The tenor of the conversation is rather more like cross-examination by his father, who puts leading questions and propositions to him repeatedly.  It appears to be more of an attempt by V to influence what W says about an incident that took place at the home of a relative.  I agree with what Ms Broadley says about this:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.98in">&#8220;He believes his father will never listen to him and his true wishes and feelings, and he has almost given up on any hope that his father will listen to him and return them home.&#8221;</p>

	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">I am troubled by those recordings and the father also readily talks about the mother to W in extremely negative terms.

This court will be able to direct their return to Iran if that is the proper decision to be made for their welfare.  If either were returned today, I am not preventing an order relocating the children to Iran being made in due course.</p>

In my judgment, I should indeed give effect to them.  They accord with his welfare.  He needs to be restored to the culture with which he is most familiar so that his life can return to what he reasonably regards as an acceptable form of normality while his future, going forward, is decided.  The further erosion of his connection to his home will be detrimental to his welfare.  He needs to be in an environment where his voice can be heard and his views effectively put before the court.  I do not accept that the risk of harm is such that he should be kept in Iran, or that his wishes are tainted by his activities in the UK.  The concerns identified are not such that they cannot be managed in this country if they remain concerns at all.  It is plainly in his best interests that he returns to his home country and the alternative is to risk his emotional and educational wellbeing.</p>

Her wishes are also clear, and while she is not said to be <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent, her wishes are consistent with her welfare.

She decided that she would need to return to the UK and gave, she says, the children&#8217;s British passports to her parents.  She was told by her father that these were later taken from her father by her husband.  Her father also went to collect the Iranian passports from the Iranian authorities and was told that they had been taken by the father.

I doubt that the order in which she presented passports was uppermost in her mind at the time, and nor was their role in the mechanics of the return of her children.
