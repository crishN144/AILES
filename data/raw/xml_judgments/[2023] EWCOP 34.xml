	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The tragic circumstances of this case are that X was involved in a car accident in January 2023. He suffered catastrophic injuries to his brain and brain stem, when the car he was travelling in hit a tree. By the time the paramedics arrived and he was free from the car, his brain had been deprived of oxygen for a considerable period of time. The paramedics were able to bring back his absent pulse and resuscitate him. He was taken to hospital by air ambulance and shortly after his arrival was admitted to the intensive care unit (&#8216;ICU&#8217;), where he has remained since. In addition to the significant brain damage he suffered caused by lack of oxygen, X sustained damage to his cervical spine and his spinal cord at the same high level. X is considered by all the doctors who care for him, together with those who have provided a second opinion, to be in a persistent vegetative state. The Trust consider that it is not in his best interests to continue treatment, as they do not consider there is any prospect of him recovering and, if anything, they have observed a decline in his condition. He is kept alive by mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration and supportive round the clock nursing care involving washing, turning and suctioning of tracheal secretions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X&#8217;s father, Y, and members of his family do not support this course. They are devastated by what has taken place. Prior to this accident X was a larger than life character, in a long term relationship with two young children. He was devoted to his family, as they are to him. They want him to have more time and have observed some signs of response through opening his eyes and moving his head in response to requests. They feel strongly that X would have wanted his life to be sustained, so he could continue to fight to remain with his family. X&#8217;s father, aunt, uncle and grandmother have been present during this hearing. They have listened carefully to the evidence and have conducted themselves with enormous dignity when the case and the evidence has involved someone so loved by them.</p>

The Official Solicitor recognises this is a finely balanced case and fully understands why the family feel as they do,  recognises the strength of that feeling but standing back, accepting the medical evidence and considering all the evidence, supports the application made by the Trust. As Ms Gollop K.C. submits, the determinative factor for the Official Solicitor was what is the benefit of continuing the treatment for X other than a continuation of his life that he is unaware of, and that is unlikely to change. </p>

There are periods of instability related to the suctioning of his airways and cough assist, to help clear his airway secretions, and when he is being turned and repositioned in bed. Sister TS said in oral evidence that happened about 3 or 4 times a day, when they would have to pause the re-positioning to allow his heart rate to rise again. This results in his heart stopping for about 30 seconds, followed by spontaneous return of the heartbeat. Due to the extent of his spinal and brain stem injuries he is completely dependent on the ventilator, as he is not able to initiate a breath on his own.</p>

The last extended one revealed non reactivity and loss of normal sleep pattern. Dr AC considers this demonstrates how little reserve there is to maintain cerebral function and how precarious X&#8217;s condition is. Ms Kirkbride asked about comments in one of the later EEG reports regarding response to stimuli, Dr AC responded that the wider clinical picture is what needs to be considered and this accords with the Royal College of Physicians National Clinical Guidelines &#8216;Prolonged disorders of consciousness following sudden onset brain injury&#8217; section 2.2.2.</p>

She states <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;He is colonized with resistant bacteria. His arms and legs are in contractures. He has lost a lot of muscle mass and is not able to move. His skin is fragile and he has developed skin ulcers which are difficult to heal&#8217;.</span> In her oral evidence she recognised X&#8217;s weight is not an issue, but said that is different to loss of muscle and agreed recent bed sores had healed.<span style="font-style:italic"/> In her opinion, if ventilation is withdrawn X would die within a few minutes, as he is unable to breathe on his own.</p>

She is not able to predict his life expectancy. Patients in a vegetative state who are able to breathe independently tend to have a life expectancy in ICU of between 12 &#8211; 18 months. As X is unable to breathe independently, she considers his life expectancy is much less, as the risk of infection is higher with mechanical ventilation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her most recent statement Dr AC notes that X&#8217;s pupils have stopped reacting to light and they have become fixed and dilated. She considers this is a clinical sign of further loss of brain stem function. Ms Kirkbride asked her about this in the context of the videos produced by the family, which appear to show X moving his head and opening his eyes. She said what she was referring to was reaction to the pupil to light, which is different from opening of his eyes as seen in the video. The second statement provides an update about the ceiling of treatment and the treating team&#8217;s view that they would only consider further treatment/interventions if a clinical need became apparent. For example, if X&#8217;s  heart stopped beating he would not be given cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as it would be very unlikely to be effective in re-starting his heart for more than a very short period. If he contracted an infection antibiotic medication would not automatically be given and it would require careful assessment of the consequent ICU interventions that would be required, like the insertion of a central venous line.</p>

He is in a vegetative state at the lowest end, on the border with coma. There has been no improvement in 5 months in ICU, but some signs of deterioration. In this sense there continues to be no possibility that he can benefit from the treatment on which he relies to stay alive and keep his heart beating.&#8217;</span></p>

He requires turning 3-4 hourly, at a minimum, but that is dependent on his cardiovascular and respiratory stability. It requires four members of staff to do this as his head and neck have to be supported by one member of staff to maintain his airway and prevent dislodgment of the breathing tube. He receives continuous nutrition via a nasogastric tube via a feeding pump, which requires regular checking. As X is fully dependent on a ventilator he requires a high degree of care. There is frequent suctioning, he has no cough reflex so requires chest physiotherapy to clear secretions as well. This is to avoid the risk of respiratory infections.

Her conclusion was that due to the combination of his profound injuries to both the brain and the spinal cord, he would not be able to be cared for outside a hospital or ICU setting. She has reviewed the videos that have been submitted by the family and provided a detailed analysis of the information she saw and concludes that in her opinion all of the movements observed are either spontaneous or reflexive and thus compatible with a vegetative state. She recognises the eyes may be sensitive to light but they open only fleetingly with frequent blinking. When his eyes open there is no evidence of tracking or fixation for any significant period of time.

Six months have now passed and the family are being informed he would not benefit from continuing such care. In those circumstances, it is understandable that they should feel such care should continue. As regards the issue of burdens, she submits there is no compelling evidence that the continuation of the treatment is burdensome. She recognises the evidence about the change in heart rate and the impact of X being administered the treatment, such as the sores in his mouth from the breathing tube, but that on its own would not be enough.
