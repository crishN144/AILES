The orders are domestic Adoption Orders and are not recognised by the law of England and Wales. Mr and Mrs D seek a declaration under the Common Law for the recognition of these Adoption Orders, in order that the adoptions fall within the definition of "adoption" within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/66/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 66(1)</ref>(e) and Chapter 4 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>.</p>

They have business interests and homes in India, USA and the UK and travel between the three countries. They have plans to expand their UK company, of which they are the sole directors, into Europe using the UK as the base for this. They both have indefinite leave to enter and remain in the UK and the USA. They are planning to live in the UK and to educate both children here. ND is already registered in school. They therefore need their status as the children's legal parents to be recognised in the UK. Having regard to the factual circumstances of this application I have not found it necessary to join the children as respondents or ask for their representation. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Mr and Mrs D were married on 28.7.92. They decided that they wanted to have children in about 1997, but were unable to conceive a child even after going through several medical procedures in India and in Europe. In early 2005 Mr and Mrs D approached the family placement team in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames to enquire about adoption in the UK. They were told that they were unable to make an application as they were not domiciled in the UK nor had they been habitually resident in the UK for the requisite period of time. Hence in the second quarter of 2005 they applied to the Family Service Centre Mumbai for consideration as adoptive parents. The Family Service Centre is a recognised placement agency approved by India's Central Adoption Resource Agency. Both ND and TD were destitute children and had been placed with the Family Service Centre by their birth parents who were unable to care for them. They were placed at four and six days old respectively. They are not related in any way to Mr &amp; Mrs D.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The home study report dated 22.8.05 which was prepared by the Family Service Centre for ND's adoption assessed Mr &amp; Mrs D to be a "loving and compatible couple" and suitable adoptive parents. An adoption order was made on by the Mumbai City Civil Court on 17.10.05. In accordance with the provisions of The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act it was Mr D who made the adoption applications for both children, as married women cannot apply to adopt under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref>. There is a certificate dated 17.10.05 which states that it shall be accepted as proof of ND's date of birth for all purposes and that Mr D is the adoptive father and Mrs D is the adoptive mother. Mrs D was required to and did consent to the process and she is recognised as an adoptive parent under the process. A further home study report was prepared prior to TD's adoption. The adoption order in relation to TD was made on 27.4.07, and the certificate in relation to his date of birth and Mr and Mrs D being the adoptive parents is dated 8.5.07. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai has now also issued normal birth certificates for ND and TD.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Both adoptions required a home study report by a qualified social worker, medical, financial and character references and proof of abandonment or parental consent to the adoptions. The adoption process is rigorous and directed to a "best interest" outcome for the children. There is a requirement that adoptions are monitored after the order has been made. The post adoption report in respect of ND dated 13.4.07 is very positive indeed and the Family Service Centre notes that but for the adoptions, these children would have remained living in an institution. The procedures followed during the adoptions was similar to those followed in UK domestic adoptions. In addition, in domestic adoptions in India under The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act three follow up reports are required during the first year after the order has been made. </p>

On 27.9.01 Mrs D was granted a five year work permit allowing her to work for the company in the UK, their UK partner having decided to pursue other opportunities. In November 2005 ND was given entry clearance to come to the UK as the dependent child of a work permit holder. In March 2006 Mrs D applied for and was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK for herself and ND, and Mr D was granted indefinite leave to enter as Mrs D's spouse on 25.10.06. </p>

This was refused, as were two applications for short term visitor's visas for him. The reasons given for refusal included that TD's adoption was not recognised in the UK, that they had entered with ND in breach of the adoption regulations and that they had not disclosed ND's adoptive status. An appeal against this decision and the subsequent confirmation of the decision is pending. During this period Mrs D has remained with the children, whilst Mr D has travelled to the UK, Europe and the USA as and when absolutely necessary for business purposes.</p>

Although these are not Hague Convention adoptions the procedures followed by the authorities and the court are similar to the procedures in Hague Convention adoptions and in UK domestic adoptions. Mr and Mrs D have also exhibited a report prepared by Professor Werner Menski, Professor of South Asian Laws in respect of Hindu adoptions in India for the purposes of the immigration appeal. As well as discussing the law and emphasizing that Indian law has developed procedures to ensure the safety and protection of adopted children, he gives his opinion that these adoptions are legally valid adoptions under Indian law, and points to the adoptions having taken place through a reputed and nationally recognised adoption agency in Mumbai. Professor Menski is of the view that Indian adoptions under The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act 1956 should be recognised in the UK. </p>

They are not "intercountry adoptions", as that (in UK terms) is the term used for the adoption of a child resident abroad by adopters habitually resident in the UK. As a result of the proliferation of such adoptions the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-Country Adoption was concluded at The Hague in May 1993. In broad terms, the Convention, which applies in both the UK and India, aims to provide safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child. </p>

At the present time, in order to qualify as an "overseas adoption" an adoption has to have been effected in a country specified in the Adoption (Designation of Overseas Adoptions) Order 1973. The designated countries include the USA, all Western European countries and 39 Commonwealth countries, but does not include India, also a Commonwealth country. As with "Convention adoptions", "overseas adoptions" are automatically recognised as adoption orders in England and Wales. Pursuant to section 89 an "overseas adoption" can be impugned by an order of the High Court on the grounds that it is contrary to public policy or that the authority which purported to authorize the adoption was not competent to do so. A "Convention adoption" can be annulled by the High Court on the grounds that it is contrary to public policy. Apart from these provisions, neither a "Convention adoption" nor an "overseas adoption" can be called into question in any proceedings in England and Wales.</p>

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1.5in">That was a legitimation case, but the like principle applies to adoption. But when is the status of adoption duly constituted? Clearly it is so when it is constituted in another country in similar circumstances as we claim for ourselves. Our court should recognise a jurisdiction which mutatis mutandis they claim for themselves; see Travers v Holley and Holley <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1953] 2 All ER 794" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1953">[1953] 2 All ER 794</ref> at 800. We claim jurisdiction to make an adoption order when the adopting parents are domiciled in this country and the child is resident here. So also, out of the comity of nations, we should recognise an adoption order made by another country when the adopting parents are domiciled there and the child is resident there.</p>

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1.5in">Apart from international comity, we reach the same result on principle. When a court of any country makes an adoption order for an infant child, it does two things. (i) It destroys the legal relationship theretofore existing between the child and its natural parents, be it legitimate or illegitimate; (ii) it creates the legal relationship of parent and child between the child and its adopting parents, making it their legitimate child. It creates a new status in both, namely the status of parent and child. Now it has long been settled that questions affecting status are determined by the law of the domicil. This new status of parent and child, in order to be recognised everywhere, must be validly created by the law of the domicil of the adopting parent. You do not look at the domicil of the child; for that has no separate domicil of his or her own. The child takes his or hers parents' domicil. You look to the parents' domicil only. If you find that a legitimate relationship of parent and child has been validly created by the law of the parents' domicil at the time the relationship is created, then the status so created should be universally recognised throughout the civilized world, provided always that there is nothing contrary to public policy in so recognizing it." </p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">"If the foreign adoption was designed to promote some immoral or mercenary object, like prostitution or financial gain to the adopter, it is improbable that it would be recognised in England. But, apart from exceptional cases like these, it is submitted that the court should be slow to refuse recognition to a foreign adoption on the grounds of public policy merely because the requirements for adoption in the foreign law differ from those of the English law. Here again the distinction between recognizing the status and giving effect to its results is of vital importance. Public policy may sometimes require that a particular result of a foreign adoption should not be given effect to in England; but public policy should only on the rarest occasions be invoked in order to deny recognition to the status itself." </p>

They are both fully legally valid and in fact irrevocable adoptions, fully following the required formal legal procedures and thus in my view entitled to legal recognition under the principles of private international law.'

ND was granted entry as the dependent child of a work permit holder &#8211; her mother; and was granted indefinite leave to remain in line with her mother when the mother qualified for such status on account of her residence in a work permit capacity in the UK. However, at the present time her adoption is not recognised in the UK and no-one has parental responsibility for her in the UK. </p>

(HC395 para 310(vi) a). Recognition of TD's adoption does not subvert or undermine the immigration rules. The application for recognition is made in order to comply with the immigration rules, to give ND and TD the status of adopted children in the UK, and to give Mr and Mrs D parental responsibility for them. TD must also satisfy additional criteria under the immigration rules (para 310 HC395). The recognition of the adoption does not guarantee TD will be granted entry clearance. The recognition order allows him to satisfy one criterion in the rules dealing with the status of his adoption order.</p>

The regulations were applicable if both parents were habitually resident in the UK at the time of ND's entry. Mr D's business meant that he was continually travelling between the US, India and the UK. Mrs D was residing in the UK but at that time with temporary immigration status and had no 'settled purpose' with respect to her residence.

If the applicants were not habitually resident, there was no breach of the AFE regulations. If Mrs D was habitually resident and ND was brought to the UK in breach of the AFE regulations (she had been adopted only one month prior to her first entry to the UK) such breach was inadvertent and innocent. The applicants were not alerted to the AFE regulations by their solicitors and there was no immigration notice, guidance or information concerning adopted children or the AFE regulations for persons and their family members seeking entry under the work permit scheme. Such immigration guidance is available only if the adopted children are seeking entry for settlement or for the purposes of adoption in the UK.</p>
