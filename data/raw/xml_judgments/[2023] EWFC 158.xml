The husband had ticked the box at paragraph 5 of his application form stating that he wished the application to proceed without a hearing. The wife by email to my clerk confirmed that she too was content for the matter to be dealt with on paper. I had before me a full bundle which included, inter alia, detailed (arguably over detailed) skeleton arguments.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-size:11pt">&#8220;Where the claim for substantive relief appears doubtful, whether by virtue of a challenge to the jurisdiction, or otherwise having regard to its subject matter, the court should judge the application with caution.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, where Permission to Appeal has not yet been granted, the court will evaluate this factor with particular scrutiny.

It is also the case that the husband has changed lawyers on 7 occasions and made 11 LSPO applications, from which he received substantial sums. The wife seeks further to argue that the appeal is wholly unmeritorious. However, as I have indicated, Permission to Appeal has been granted and it seems to me that I should not prospectively conclude that the appeal will fail.</p>

The LSPO would operate as in effect of a loan by the wife to the husband, and would be fully capable of readjustment once the appeal has been determined; see the decision of Sir Andrew McFarlane P in <span style="font-weight:bold">A1 M <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2021/303" uk:canonical="[2021] EWHC 303 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWHC 303 (Fam)</ref> </span>at para 9. Although it will be a matter for reconsideration at that stage, I see no reason in principle why the husband should not, if unsuccessful, be required to repay the sums advanced, and (if applicable) the wife&#8217;s costs out of the sum of &#163;252,500 which he is due to receive under the term periodical payments order, and perhaps also out of the &#8364;60,000 furnishings lump sum. He may say that to do so would be to interfere with the carefully calculated sums deemed by Sir Jonathan Cohen as appropriate for his needs, but the courts have repeatedly said that a party who is guilty of misconduct (including litigation misconduct) cannot be immune from the consequences of that misconduct, even if that means invading a needs based award: see for example <span style="font-weight:bold">Rothschild v de Souza <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2020/1215" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCA Civ 1215" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCA Civ 1215</ref></span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have reached the conclusion that a LSPO should be made. The next question is in what amount. The total sum sought is &#163;231,179 (see para 7 above).  I regard that as an excessive figure, even allowing for the fact that, as I have commented, this is a complex case. All documents for the appeal have been filed apart from the bundle, so that the main future cost is attendance. I have considered the legal costs budget attached to the application. I do not think this is a case where I can and should go line by line through the budget. I consider that I should approach it broadly. One figure which leaps out is the cost of leading and junior counsel in the total sum of &#163;126,000, although others also seem to me to be overstated. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I consider that a reasonable total sum would be &#163;175,000, instead of the figure of &#163;231,179. One way of looking at it is to adopt the approach taken in some cases (for example Cobb J in <span style="font-weight:bold">BC v DE <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/1806" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 1806 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 1806 (Fam)</ref></span>) of applying a deduction to the sums claimed to reflect a notional standard basis of assessment by way of cross check. The figure of &#163;175,000 adopts a discount from the sum claimed of about 25%. In any event, it is in my judgment a more reasonable overall figure. </p>

It has been reported in unanonymised form in a number of judgments, including the judgment delivered by Sir Jonathan Cohen following the final hearing. In the Court of Appeal, it will be heard in open court, absent any order to the contrary, and any judgment is likely to be unanonymised. In the circumstances, I direct that this judgment be handed down and released in unanonymised form. </p>
