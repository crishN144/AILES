	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment follows the hearing of the petition of the petitioner wife (&#8220;the wife&#8221;) for dissolution of her marriage to the respondent husband (&#8220;the husband&#8221;) on the grounds of the husband&#8217;s unreasonable conduct throughout their long marriage, but in particular during the last 10 years or so leading up to the departure of the wife from the matrimonial home in September 2006.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the hearing of the petition as a defended cause, the wife has been represented by Mr Charles Howard QC and the husband by Mr Mohammed Tawfick, who is a personal friend of the husband who has assisted him in earlier stages of the litigation. Mr Tawfick has had considerable legal training and experience. He is a qualified Egyptian lawyer (see his statement dated 2 October 2009). He appeared in the role of McKenzie Friend at the outset of the hearing and made an application on behalf of the husband that he be permitted to appear as the husband&#8217;s advocate and for that purpose to be granted the right of audience in the proceedings.  I granted that application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In that role, the first application made by Mr Tawfick was that the hearing of the divorce be adjourned and that the Court should order release of the sum of &#163;200,000 to be paid to the husband on account of his past and future costs from Bank of Ireland account Ref. 0-xxxxx, a frozen joint account containing the rapidly diminishing proceeds of sale of the former matrimonial home, alternatively  such lesser sum as might be appropriate to enable the husband to put solicitors in funds and to conduct the adjourned hearing (and subsequent disposal of the ancillary relief proceedings) with the benefit of leading and junior counsel.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a case in which, since the departure of the wife from the matrimonial home and her obtaining of a freezing order in respect of the husband&#8217;s assets in the United Kingdom, he has fought an extended and determined battle to avoid the jurisdiction of the English Court and to postpone and minimise the determination of any liability on his part to make financial provision for the wife.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background is that, although the parties are naturalised British citizens, they are both Libyan by birth. However, in 1980 the parties left Libya with the seven children of their marriage (three sons and four daughters) and came to England in order to settle here. They were in fear of their safety in the light of the husband&#8217;s political activities. Neither has ever returned to Libya.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Shortly after their arrival in England, in the light of further perceived threats to their safety, they felt unsafe and moved to Cairo where they lived for ten years until 1990. However, in 1990 they, together with five of their children came to England and sought and were granted political asylum, and subsequently indefinite leave to remain. In 1993 they bought a very substantial family home with seven bedrooms at 33 A Avenue in North London and the husband established a property development company in England which dealt in London property and operates to this day. They both applied for British citizenship, the wife obtaining it in the year 2000 and the husband in 2003. By that time the husband was spending much of his time in Egypt and the centre of the family&#8217;s interest moved from London to Cairo, in the sense that the majority of their time was spent there. However, they maintained the residence at 33 A Avenue where they would stay whenever they were in London, as they frequently were. In July 2006 the parties flew back to England from Egypt to 33 A Avenue, the wife being in need of medical treatment. At that time, the marriage had become unhappy, largely because of the husband&#8217;s relationship with a younger woman (see further below). The marriage then broke down entirely following the discovery by the wife of a letter to the husband from his lawyer giving him advice in relation to divorce. She resolved not to return with the husband to Cairo but to remain in England and bring divorce proceedings here. </p>

Thereafter, with no home of her own to go to, she led a somewhat peripatetic existence staying with various members of her family, in North London, in Belfast, and in Egypt.</p>

They were subsequently struck out by the Egyptian Court and, in April 2008, the husband recommenced     divorce proceedings in Egypt in the Nasr City Family Court (case No. 353/2008) again without the knowledge of the wife (see paras 2 and 3 of the judgment of Stephen Bellamy QC).</p>

The grounds for my refusal were that it was the clear evidence of Mr Edge, the expert in the Egyptian and Islamic law jointly instructed by the parties, that the Egyptian Courts did not enjoy and/or would decline to exercise jurisdiction and that, in any event, grounds of fairness and convenience dictated that the matter should proceed in England.</p>

He also applied without notice for a further release of funds from the joint account. This application was opposed by Mr Howard for the wife on the grounds that there was no affidavit as to the husband&#8217;s financial position to substantiate his absence of funds or his inability to raise them.</p>

The husband, assisted by Mr Tawfick, obtained an order correcting the position on 20 August 2009 and, on 25 August the husband issued an application for a stay of the divorce proceedings until the sum was paid.</p>

At the same time, Charles J heard an application on behalf of the husband, assisted by Mr Tawfick, to whom Charles J also granted rights of audience as an advocate on behalf of the husband for the purposes of that hearing.</p>

Having received no reply from the husband, on 4 November they received a letter  from Dawson Cornwell which stated that they had been reconsulted by the husband in relation only to the appeal (in respect of which an application for permission had already been lodged)  and that, on first consideration, Thorpe LJ had given an opportunity for the husband to instruct leading counsel to lodge a skeleton argument, the permission to appeal application being thereafter considered as a paper exercise (see further below). No stay had been granted. Dawson Cornwell stated that they had a conference with leading and junior counsel fixed for 6 November to deal with the matters to which the earlier release of the sum of &#163;35,000 from Court were limited.

Second, the resolution of the divorce proceedings between the parties following the break-up of their marriage had been unduly delayed since the wife presented her first petition over three years earlier, such delay creating considerable distress between the parties and exacerbating the family bitterness which already existed. </p>

The history also included ostensible and repeated statements by the husband that he recognises the wife&#8217;s right to proper long term provision for her maintenance on the one hand, while on the other hand he has resisted resolution of the matter within this jurisdiction, preferring to rely upon jurisdictional arguments to ensure that the matter is tried in Egypt where the maintenance rights of the wife are of a most restricted kind: see paragraphs 68 and 69 of my judgment dated 25 June 2009.</p>

He had had &#163;35,000 released to him for that very purpose which became available to him by end August 2009 and, having failed to use it for that purpose by 2 October 2009, was again put clearly upon notice by Charles J of the need for speedy process, being informed that the last minute applications made before Charles J bordered upon abuse of process. Nonetheless he had failed to deal swiftly with the matters for which the monies had been released, preferring to spend time and money on an application to appeal my judgment on the preliminary issue in relation to which he had failed to advance matters or to obtain a stay from the Court of Appeal.</p>

Thus, so far as the wife was concerned, she arrived at Court for a hearing, on the understanding that the husband was not instructing solicitors or counsel for the purposes of the hearing, the only outstanding application being the application of the husband previously made to Charles J that Mr Tawfick be permitted to act as his advocate in the proceedings generally, which application Charles J had directed should be made to me on the hearing date.</p>

In the event, Mr Tawfick was well able to commence his cross-examination at that time and, at the end of the afternoon session, the matter was adjourned until 2.00pm on the following day, thus affording Mr Tawfick the further opportunity of conferring with his client and preparing his cross-examination. In the event, Mr Tawfick finished his cross-examination and the wife completed her evidence by the end of the afternoon on 18 November. There was then discussion as to the availability of the parties&#8217; representatives, and the case had to be adjourned to 14 December 2009 for the taking of the husband&#8217;s evidence in the light of the imminent and (as he asserted) unavoidable departure of Mr Tawfick to Egypt in connection with important business matters. No mention was made at that time of the destination or intentions of the husband, albeit, as will be apparent from what follows, he was due to appear in the Nasr City Family Court four days later (on 22 November 2009) in his pursuit of Egyptian divorce proceedings.</p>

Article 29 of the Procedure Code provides that the Egyptian Court has jurisdiction over a foreign defendant who has a domicile, or an official or certified place of residence, in Egypt. <span style="font-style:italic">The wife does not.</span> &#8230;</p>

Mr Edge states that, as the wife has left Egypt, apparently never intending to return, she would not be considered to be domiciled or resident in Egypt under Egyptian law. Thus the Egyptian Court would have no foundation to exercise jurisdiction based upon Article 29.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application made by Mr Tawfick met with vigorous opposition from Mr Howard for the wife on the grounds that it would involve recognition by the Court of the Egyptian judgment as a valid overseas divorce in respect of which it was incumbent on the husband to establish the various matters set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/45" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 45</ref> and 46 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>. Mr Howard objected that the application was made with insufficient notice and involved the husband relying on matters in relation to which he had acted in contempt of court by pursuing his divorce in breach of the order of 21 July 2008, from which he had never appealed and in reliance on which the wife and this Court had since proceeded: see paragraph 64 of my judgment dated 25 June 2009. He also asserted that it was apparent from the face of the judgment that (a) the husband had misinformed the Court in certain respects (b) that he had made no attempt to inform the Court of the order of the English Court restraining him from proceeding with divorce proceedings in Egypt. Mr Howard protested that the wife, who was not represented, and had no lawyers acting for her in the Egyptian divorce proceedings, had been given no opportunity to consider her position in relation to a hearing of which she had no knowledge and which dealt with matters which she contested. In particular, he stated that the wife challenged the very basis upon which the husband&#8217;s Egyptian petition was founded in that she denied that the alleged telephone <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> had ever taken place. [In that connection it was clear, as was not disputed by the husband, that the <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> relied on had at no stage of these proceedings received mention by the husband or any of his representatives, whether to this Court, to the wife, or to her representatives, who were thus ignorant of it or its alleged pronouncement until receipt on 7 December 2009 of the translated judgment of the Egyptian Court.]</p>

Mr Tawfick made clear that he was disputing the content of Mr Edge&#8217;s report. In the event, I have felt able to resolve the question as to whether or not the Court should recognise the judgment of the Egyptian Court as a valid divorce pursuant to the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/45" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 45</ref> and 46, or should exercise my discretion nor to do so under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 51</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref>, by resort to the terms of the Egyptian judgment itself and the history and circumstances of the case, without reliance upon the further evidence from Mr Edge.</p>

Having fully reconsidered the question on the basis of the evidence made available to me, I remain of the view that the Court should not recognise the judgment of the Egyptian Court, but should, if satisfied that the wife&#8217;s grounds for divorce are established, itself proceed to pronounce a decree.

However, in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.46</ref> a distinction is drawn between overseas divorces obtained <span style="font-style:italic">by means of proceedings</span> (which means judicial or other proceedings: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.46(1)</ref> and s.54(1))<span style="font-style:italic"/>and overseas divorces obtained <span style="font-style:italic">otherwise</span> than by means of proceedings (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.46(2)</ref>). It is clear from <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/45" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.45</ref> that a divorce obtained outside the British Islands will only be recognised if it is entitled to recognition under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 46</ref>-49 or by virtue of any other enactment. The common law rules for recognition of divorce which survived the 1971 Act are thus effectively abrogated. However, the rule that the English Courts will not recognise a &#8220;bare&#8221; <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> pronounced abroad as constituting a divorce by means of proceedings survives (see <span style="font-style:italic">Chaudhary v Chaudhary </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1984] 3 All ER 1017" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1984">[1984] 3 All ER 1017</ref>). In this connection, as the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Quazi  </span>makes clear, while the pronouncing by a spouse of a &#8220;bare&#8221; <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> is insufficient to qualify as a divorce obtained by means of proceedings, it will be recognised as such provided that the party seeking recognition is able to demonstrate &#8220;at least the involvement of some agency (whether lay or religious) of, or recognised by, the state which has a function which is more than simply probative&#8221; and amounts to at least &#8220;the registering or recording of which has been done&#8221;: per Oliver LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Chaudhary </span>at 485F and 486C.</p>

In this respect, Mr Howard does not suggest that the judgment is other than an authentic judgment of the Egyptian Court, or that it is other than appropriate to refer to it for the purpose of identifying any finding of fact made (whether expressly or by implication) on the basis of which the Egyptian Court assumed jurisdiction: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/48/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.48(1)</ref>)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is to be noted that these were not proceedings in which both parties to the marriage took part. It is clear that they were proceedings in which the wife did not take part, albeit the Egyptian judgment recites that she was served with the proceedings. In this respect, although <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/48/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.48(3)</ref> provides that, for the purposes of subsection (1)(a), a party to the marriage who has &#8220;appeared&#8221; in judicial proceedings shall be treated as having taken part in them, it does not seem to me that this provision is applicable in the instant case. There is no statutory guidance as to the precise meaning of the word &#8220;appeared&#8221; in this context. However, it is plainly a word which requires something more than mere proof of service, whether by means of the active participation in the proceedings of the party concerned, either in person or through a representative, or at the very least by means of some formal step taken, at least equivalent to the entry of an appearance in English proceedings. It has not been suggested, let alone established, that the wife has appeared in the Egyptian proceedings in either sense; nor does the judgment record or refer to any such finding on the part of the Egyptian Court. Accordingly, the position is that any finding of fact apparently made in the proceedings, whether expressly or by implication, is not conclusive evidence of that fact; rather it is sufficient proof of that fact unless the contrary is shown: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/48/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.48(1)</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Approaching the judgments of the Egyptian Court in the light of Mr Howard&#8217;s primary submission, the first question is whether or not, because the Egyptian Judgment is (as on its face it appears to be) the confirmation of a <span style="font-style:italic">talaq </span>under Libyan law, that means that it is ineligible for recognition as an overseas divorce &#8220;obtained by means of proceedings&#8221;, for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.46(1)</ref>. In my opinion it is not. To characterise it, as Mr Howard does, as involving a &#8220;bare&#8221; <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> begs the question as to the meaning of that term in the context of the legislation. It seems to me that the matter is covered by the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Quazi.</span> In that case what might also have been described as a &#8220;bare&#8221; <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> under Pakistani law was nonetheless held to be a valid divorce obtained by means of proceedings, by reason of the fact that formal steps amounting to &#8220;proceedings&#8221; had been taken, as required by Pakistani law, for the purposes of confirming or recognising its validity. It does not seem to me a material distinction that in the instant case the (judicial) proceedings brought in Egypt for the purposes of confirming or recognising the form of <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> alleged to have been pronounced by the husband concerned a <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> in respect of which the applicable law, when considering its validity, was that of Libya (the husband being a Libyan citizen). It has not been shown that the Egyptian Court lacks jurisdiction in such a case, and it is plain that the Egyptian judgment itself purports to be the validation and confirmation by a competent court of a <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> required to be so validated under the Libyan law stated to be applicable under Egyptian law. </p>

In this respect, it is important to note that the relevant terms of the judgment are in the present tense i.e. they appear to deal with the position at the date of the hearing, cf. the reference to the husband&#8217;s case (&#8220;They currently reside in the Arab Republic of Egypt&#8221;). Whilst I am satisfied that, in relation to the wife, the contrary was the case at the time of the Egyptian <span style="font-style:italic">judgment</span>, the relevant date in relation to the question of recognition is whether or not the wife had a residence in Egypt at the <span style="font-style:italic">commencement</span> of the Egyptian proceedings i.e. in April 2008: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.46(1)</ref>(b) and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.46(3)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref>. At that time, neither the judgment of Stephen Bellamy QC (which was awaited but not yet handed down) nor my own judgment a year later, were yet available and, on the assumption that papers were prepared for the Egyptian Court on the basis of the husband&#8217;s contentions as to the wife&#8217;s residence in April 2008, it is no matter for surprise that the Egyptian Court, considering the matter on the basis of the documentation as at that date, should have found as it did. Nonetheless, I am satisfied that, as at April 2008, when the husband initiated the Egyptian proceedings, not only was the wife resident in England, but she had ceased to be resident in Egypt, for the reasons set out in my judgment of 25 June 2009.</p>

The wife denied it in evidence. However, I have not heard evidence from the husband on that issue which did not appear to me an issue suitable for summary resolution in the context of an application in which I was satisfied that non-recognition is justified on other grounds. The suggestion that the husband&#8217;s assertion in both the Egyptian and English Courts that he pronounced a telephone <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> is an invention is a serious matter. It justifies further and more detailed investigation than is necessary or appropriate in the context of an application to avoid resumption of the wife&#8217;s part heard divorce proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear to me that, not only was no notice given to the wife of the hearing before the Egyptian Court which gave rise to the judgment of 22 November 2009, but such notice was deliberately withheld from the wife by the husband. I do not know, because neither the husband nor Mr Tawfick has made clear to my satisfaction, exactly when the husband was first aware that the Egyptian Court was proposing to proceed with the case. However, I am satisfied he must have been well aware of the position, but deliberately concealed it, by the time of the uncompleted hearing before me on 17/18 November 2009. Further, in the letter dated 2 December 2009 to the wife&#8217;s solicitors from the husband&#8217;s advocate, Mr Mahmoud, there is in my view a degree of obfuscation in relation to the participation of the husband in those proceedings. There is an implied suggestion (though it is not expressly stated) that he was a reluctant participant in front of an impatient court. Mr Mahmoud refers to the divorce proceedings in London &#8220;where it was mentioned that Egypt was not a competent body to deliberate the divorce claim and that the English Court is the competent body &#8230; to apply the law&#8221;, which is plainly a reference to the proceedings relating to jurisdiction and my judgment of 21 July 2009; however no mention is made of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hemain</span> order dated 21 July 2008 which prevented the husband from taking any further steps to progress the Egyptian proceedings, let alone any suggestion that that order or my judgment were brought to the attention of the Egyptian Court.</p>

If it be the case (though this was not a point which was raised by Mr Tawfick or taken by Mr Howard) that the term &#8220;notice of the proceedings&#8221; in sub-paragraph (i) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.51(3)</ref>(a), was sufficiently satisfied by fact that the wife had notice of the original institution of the proceedings and that, for that reason, she cannot rely on the terms of sub-paragraph (i) as grounds for non-recognition, then I am nonetheless satisfied she can rely upon the terms of sub-paragraph (ii) for that purpose. It is clear to me that the wife has been deprived of an opportunity to take part in the proceedings which she should reasonably have been given, having regard to the nature of the proceedings and all the circumstances. If she had known that, despite the ostensible protection of the injunction she had obtained in this jurisdiction and the husband&#8217;s apparent acceptance of its terms, the husband might continue to pursue or participate in those proceedings, she should plainly have been afforded the opportunity to reconsider her position in relation to the Egyptian proceedings, and to receive advice from her advisors upon whom she was dependent as to whether to contest the matters of substance (i.e. the pronouncement of the <span style="font-style:italic">talaq</span> and the question of her residence) which were in issue. Further, she should have had the opportunity to appraise the Egyptian Court of the position in England and to take a point on <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> which is a doctrine applied by that Court: see the evidence of Mr Edge as reported in my earlier judgment of 25 June 2009 at paragraph 59.</p>

Had I been satisfied, upon a full and thorough examination of the position, that the husband had indeed obtained his Egyptian judgment by dishonestly asserting that he had pronounced a talaq over the telephone on or about 18 January 2008, I would have had no hesitation in acceding to Mr Howard&#8217;s submission. However, for reasons already stated, I have not felt it right to resolve that question. That said, I am satisfied that (1) the husband has been devious in relation to the hearing in Egypt, which he saw and took as an opportunity to avoid the risk of an adverse finding in these proceedings, and (2) he consciously and deliberately avoiding bringing to the attention of the wife, her advisors or the Court the imminent restoration of the Egyptian proceedings, in order to deprive the wife of the opportunity to play any part in those proceedings or for her to obtain a further direction from this Court in respect of his own attendance and participation at the hearing in Egypt.

First (paragraph 5.1), that throughout the marriage the husband had been verbally abusive towards her by the use of obscene and violent language in front of the children and other relatives of the family, coupled with a general complaint as to his humiliating and distressing behaviour. She stated that the husband told the children on numerous occasions that she was now too old as a wife and that he intended to marry a younger woman. In her short statement and oral evidence she further expanded upon these matters. </p>

However, there was no such allegation in the petition and no application to amend was made in that regard. Mr Howard made clear at the outset of the hearing that those matters would not be relied upon by the wife, her case relating to the last 10 years of her marriage between the mid 1990s and the year 2006, when she left the matrimonial home in London. It was the gravamen of her case that, during those last years of marriage the husband belittled her, undermined her confidence, showed no respect for her opinions and that, when she made any attempt to express her views about decisions which needed to be taken about the children or other family issues he would tell her in front of guests, servants or her children that she did not know what she was talking about because she was uneducated. She complained that during the latter years of the marriage the respondent showed little or no affection towards her and that marital relations ceased between the parties in the last 10 years of the marriage. </p>

Her case is that, on holiday in Egypt, she learned that the husband was having an affair with a much younger woman called Malak who was a member of his extended family. Under pressure from his family, the husband admitted his involvement and, under further family pressure and as a gesture of goodwill, agreed to transfer certain properties in Egypt to the petitioner by way of compensation. However (paragraph 5.3 of the petition and paragraphs 16-19 of the wife&#8217;s sworn statement), before such transfers took place, during September 2006, the petitioner became aware from the discovery of a letter in her husband&#8217;s study that he had visited a family solicitor to take advice about divorce proceedings and she left the matrimonial home. At the time, because the husband had told her in August 2006 that he intended to sell the family home without giving the wife the reassurance she sought that they would purchase a smaller house in London, the wife became fearful that the husband had no intention of providing her with financial support, his ultimate aim being to move his U.K. assets from the jurisdiction. She therefore applied for a freezing order which was granted in October 2006.</p>

So far as paragraph 5.1 of the petition is concerned, he puts the wife to proof of her allegations and states that, in 2003, (i.e. well before the arrival of Malak on the scene) his son Fahmi came to Cairo and informed him, on Fahmi&#8217;s and his two brothers&#8217; behalf, that unless the husband paid each of them &#163;150,000 they would make the mother institute divorce proceedings against him and ruin his life, the current proceedings being the accomplishment of such threat.

He asserts that his agreement to transfer the Egyptian properties to the wife in 2005 together with payment of Egyptian Pounds 200,000 (approximately &#163;20,000 sterling) was a gesture of goodwill and reassurance to the petitioner, so that she felt secure in the face of the lying reports which had been made to her by his children which suggested impropriety between himself and Malak. It was also his case in evidence that, apart from the upset caused to the wife by his relationship (such as it was) with Malak, which upset he understood to be assuaged by his agreement to transfer property to the wife, the marriage was a happy one throughout, apart from occasional arguments of the kind in which any happily married couple might indulge. He insisted in evidence that the assertion of the wife that sexual relations had ceased altogether during the last 10 years of the marriage was a mystifying lie, such relations having continued until a few days before her departure from the matrimonial home in A Avenue.</p>

Both became emotional from time to time, though again the husband appeared a good deal more emotional and volatile   than the wife.  Both gave their evidence in terms of generality and broad assertion rather than with any degree of detail; again this was truer of the husband than the wife; though it is fair say that, since his case was that every allegation of the wife was simple falsehood and to a greater or lesser degree the result of a conspiracy among the entire family, an absence of detail is perhaps to be expected.  In seeking to resolve this clash of evidence, I have lacked the advantage of another member of the family as a witness, it being apparent that none of the children is desirous of taking public sides against one parent or the other in court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nonetheless, having heard the evidence, I am confident that it is the wife whose picture of the marriage is a true one and indeed, in certain passages in cross-examination, her evidence hardened and became more vivid in respect of her treatment in various respects.  In particular, I am satisfied that, in the last ten years or so, the husband became particularly abusive, dismissive and insensitive towards the wife, belittling her and eroding her self-confidence and acting with extreme insensitivity towards her within the family. I am satisfied, as the wife made clear, that the husband would, in temper and outbursts of intemperate criticism, say that her family were sons of dogs and he would on occasion belittle and curse her, her background and where she came from.  He told her on occasions that she was animal in her thinking and incapable of grasping anything, threatening in the last years of the marriage to bring in another woman who was better than her. In particular, he said on a number of occasions that, now she was elderly with poor legs and poor knees, he would look for and bring in a younger woman who would service and help him better than she would and that, eventually, even over small problems and arguments, he would make hurtful remarks of that kind.  She stated that this left her feeling very low and depressed, so that she did not feel like a woman at all, and I have no doubt that was so.  She said, and I accept, that in the last 10 years of marriage he ceased to show her affection or to have marital relations with her.  She described herself as feeling devastated and broken, so that she did not feel like a woman.  </p>

In addition to telling her that she was not a good wife and that he was going to look for a better one, the husband would remark upon the condition of her skin and say that she was now &#8220;a leprous woman&#8221; and would infect him.  </p>

In my view they had the ring of truth. Mr Tawfick challenged the wife on a number of matters of detail (some of which were not directly related to the matters on which she relied) to show that at various points her evidence was inconsistent with earlier detail given in her statements. In some respects he was successful; however, as I have indicated, I accept the broad picture painted by the wife. On the general question of whose evidence is the more credible I have no doubt. There are two particular matters upon which it appeared by way of litmus test, that it was the wife who was generally telling the truth and that the husband&#8217;s vigorous denials were unconvincing. </p>

In this respect I simply did not believe the husband when he insisted in evidence that marital relations had subsisted until almost a few days before her departure. Second, I believed the wife in relation to the husband&#8217;s hurtful remarks about her vertiligo.  In seeking to deal with that particular matter, which emerged in her cross-examination, Mr Tawfick by his questioning, and the husband in his evidence, sought to argue that the fact that vertiligo is not in fact infectious was an effective answer to any suggestion that the husband would have made his remarks about leprosy or the likelihood of such infection. I readily accept that the husband knew vertiligo was not infectious. However, I do not believe that the wife fabricated her evidence in that respect, it was apparent that she had found the husband&#8217;s remarks deeply hurtful as he must have realised she would.</p>

The two are of course not necessarily inconsistent. However, when it was put to the wife by Mr Tawfick that L had spent long nights sleeping in a chair next to her in hospital room during the five operations she had had in London, the wife&#8217;s immediate and deep-felt response was that in fact he had only done so once and that such a demonstration of caring was scant excuse for the persistent insult and abuse which was his more normal treatment of her. Such remarks brought her evidence credibly to life.</p>

It was the wife&#8217;s evidence, and this did not appear to be in dispute, that she had first met Malak, who stayed in the family house at Alexandria when she came over to attend the wedding of Najla, which was in the event called off. At that time the wife was unaware of the formation of any affection or relationship between Malak and her husband, but she later became suspicious that he was having a relationship with a woman because of his habit of carrying his mobile telephone with him all the time and retreating (on occasions to the shower) to have conversations out of her hearing. The balloon went up when, at the mother&#8217;s suggestion, Najla, with her brother Mohammed, had followed the father in his car on an evening when he drove to an apparent rendezvous with Malak in surreptitious circumstances which gave rise for suspicion and, upon being observed, drove rapidly away.</p>

Others in the family became concerned over this matter and, at the suggestion of Mr Edrees, the brother of the husband, in order to show the wife goodwill and make reparation to her, the husband agreed to transfer three Egyptian properties into the wife&#8217;s name and to provide her with a sum of money equivalent to &#163;20,000 (sterling). This matter was the subject of considerable investigation and findings before Stephen Bellamy QC (see paragraphs 38, 39 and 52 of his judgment) in which he stated that he did not believe the husband when he denied forming a relationship with Malak and preferred the wife&#8217;s evidence. Whilst he made no finding that the relationship was an adulterous one, lacking the necessary evidence, he found that it was clear that the wife and various of the children of the family believed it was an improper one; hence the agreement to enter into the donation contracts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find myself in the same position. I have no doubt that the husband confessed to an improper relationship with Malak, though of what degree of intimacy is not clear. However, as the husband acknowledged in evidence, the revelation of the relationship was sufficient to render the wife extremely upset and it seems clear to me that the execution of donation contracts was agreed as a recognition and acknowledgment to the family of the hurt which he was well aware his conduct had caused the wife. It is plain that the relationship had been surreptitious and the husband was conscious of its impropriety. I am satisfied that the husband admitted a continuing relationship, conducted behind the wife&#8217;s back, in respect of which he apologised, adopting an attitude of contrition. In his evidence the husband produced an elaborate story, not previously advanced, that his rendezvous with Malak was an innocent one-off meeting for the purpose of making her a loan of money, they having agreed to meet at the rendezvous which he had made with her at a supermarket for that purpose. That explanation was thoroughly unconvincing. It was singularly absent from his affidavit by way of defence in the divorce proceedings and was first advanced in his oral evidence. When it was put to the wife in cross-examination that the husband had informed her that Malak had telephoned and asked for money from him which he offered to lend her, the wife vigorously and convincingly denied it, saying that this was the first time she had ever heard such a suggestion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite the husband&#8217;s agreement to execute the donation contracts, it does not appear that they were formally executed and I make no finding why that is so. According to the husband, the mother failed to nominate or authorise the lawyer he had chosen to complete the agreements. Whether or not that is correct, it is plain that, after her arrival back in England in August 2006, the wife became concerned at the husband&#8217;s determination to sell the matrimonial home in England and his unwillingness to reassure her that a smaller substitute would be purchased; his hurtful and unsympathetic conduct towards her continued; and, as a precipitating factor, she discovered the solicitor&#8217;s letter to the husband giving him advice in relation to divorce proceedings. In these circumstances, as stated in paragraph 19 of the wife&#8217;s sworn statement and unchallenged by the husband in his affidavit or evidence, when the wife tried to speak to him about her concerns and suggested transfer of the home into their joint names, he became angry, told her that he owed her nothing and he would never agree to such a transfer. He swore at her and said that he would sell the family home whatever it took. Shocked by his reaction and attitude, the wife left the home and subsequently instructed her solicitor to apply for a freezing order on her behalf.</p>

I do not doubt that there is now high ill feeling between the husband, his sons and, indeed his daughters. Certainly, they have afforded their mother refuge and support following her leaving the matrimonial home. It is notable that none was called by the wife to give supporting evidence in relation to a number of her allegations. However, I am not surprised at the unwillingness of the family to be involved in proceedings which, according to the husband (and I do not doubt) bring about a degree of shame upon the family and adversely affect their reputation in their social and cultural circle. Having heard and studied the parties in the course of their evidence, I am satisfied that the wife&#8217;s allegations of persistent hurtful and unreasonable behaviour towards her are made out and that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with the husband. It is in any event apparent that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</p>

Pursuant to the order of Mr Justice Charles dated 2 October 2009, forms E with attachments have now been exchanged and, at the end of the hearing when I indicated that judgment would be reserved, Mr Howard placed before me a draft order by way of further directions on first appointment. Mr Tawfick offered some assistance and in particular conveyed to the Court that the husband accepted the wife&#8217;s range of gross values for two properties in dispute namely 22 W Lane London NW6  (between &#163;850,000 and &#163;950,000) and 2 M Avenue (between &#163;250,000 and &#163;325,000). He also indicated the husband&#8217;s agreement to an order that he admit or cause to be admitted the valuer chosen on behalf of the wife, to the three properties in Egypt, namely Flat 6, Ibn Al-N Street; Flat 13, C Street; and Unit 5, L Village. However, Mr Tawfick indicated, as he was entitled to do, that he did not wish further to act as advocate on behalf of the husband in relation to the ancillary relief proceedings, and that the husband would be seeking to make application for the release of funds for legal representation in those proceedings. I indicated that if the husband wished to make such an application he would sensibly do so at the time when I handed down judgment. There then followed dialogue between the Court and the parties making clear that such an application should be supported by an affidavit in which a number of matters should be dealt with and it was agreed that the wife&#8217;s solicitors would put those matters into writing and forward them to the husband for the purposes of his swearing such an affidavit. In order to deal with any application by the husband and to finalise the terms of the directions to be given, the parties should fix a one hour appointment before me following the hand down. In the light of my imminent retirement, the substantive hearing of the wife&#8217;s application for ancillary relief will be listed before another Judge.</p>
