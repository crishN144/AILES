	  <content>
	    <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in">In my decision of <span style="font-style:italic">GW v RW [2003] 2 FCR 289</span> I made some observations about the responsibility of a party when filling in a Form E. There a husband had ascribed zero values to certain share options that were highly likely to eventuate above their strike price, but had included as hard liabilities loans he had taken out to buy the options. Even though the husband referred to the existence of the options in the text of his Form E I was critical of his presentation. I said at Paragraph 16</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.79in">The very point of Form E is to give an honest and conscientious estimation of the true net worth of the party at the time of swearing it. For these purposes sensible and fair figures have to be attributed to unrealisable or deferred assets. The maker of the Form E is fully entitled to qualify those figures in the narrative part of the section. But a proper figure has to be put in. It is unacceptable, in my view, that simply because an asset is not realisable on the day that the Form E is sworn, but is assuredly realisable, or likely to be realisable, at some future date, for a zero figure to be inserted.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in">The consequence of the husband&#8217;s presentation in that case was an example of what I have referred to during argument in this case as Newton&#8217;s Third Law of Motion, namely that every action produces an equal and opposite reaction. There the wife immediately instructed a forensic accountant who valued the husband&#8217;s options on an entirely incorrect basis at &#163;6m, when the correct figure, net of tax was about &#163;640,000. The case then moved to accusation and counter-accusation which took a great deal of time and costs to sort out. A great deal of this would have been avoided had the husband realistically and carefully filled in his Form E in the first place.</p>

	  <num style="font-size:11pt">3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in">The theory behind the new procedure is that it should be possible, if the Forms E are filled in truthfully, carefully and fully, and are accompanied by all the prescribed essential documents, for the case to be tried without further inquiry or disclosure. Of course, it is idealistic to think that this actually happens in practice and in the majority of cases further inquiry is authorised. But that does not mean that the ideal is not something to be strived for. For this reason the Form E has an almost numinous status, and where it is found that a party has deliberately filled in a Form E falsely or has misrepresented facts then he must expect judicial censure and penalties in costs.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in">In this case the husband (H), who is a Chartered Accountant, has filled in a Form E dated 18 March 2002 which I find to be deliberately false and misrepresentative. At trial he accepted primary responsibility describing the Form E as shoddy, unprofessional, something of which he was not proud, and a &#8220;cock-up&#8221;. But he has sought to turn the blow by blaming his previous solicitors (to whom I shall refer as Z partners), specifically a part-time assistant solicitor in that firm (to whom I shall refer as X) for the manner in which the Form E was finally prepared. He explicitly said that X did not follow his instructions. He has opened up the privileged solicitor and own client file and a considerable time in court has been spent scrutinising parts of it.</p>

	    <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in">In fairness to Z partners I directed that a statement setting out the gist of the allegations should be served on them; that X should be permitted to file a statement in response; that she should be allowed to give oral evidence; and that Z partners could make representations to me in their defence. Such statements were duly filed and I have heard submissions on behalf of Z partners from Mr Philip Moor QC.</p>

The final ancillary relief order was made by consent in the Epsom County Court on 9 January 1989. A <span style="font-style:italic">Mesher</span> order was made in respect of the final matrimonial home in Leatherhead. An order for spousal maintenance was made in the sum of &#163;27,173 less tax. There was an order for child maintenance and school fees.  The spousal maintenance order was expressed as a variation of an earlier interim order so that it qualified for the purposes of tax relief as an order made before 15 March 1988, when tax relief was severely restricted for orders made after that date. </p>

In May 2000 the consulting division was sold to Cap Gemini. H moved over to Cap Gemini in an important role. The terms of the sale gave H shares in Cap Gemini but were &#8220;strange&#8221; (the word used by his expert) in that the CGT payable exceeded the proceeds of the shares initially sold. This was because CGT was levied on the gain on goodwill and because large amounts of the proceeds of sale of the shares were retained by Ernst and Young to pay the costs of the sale. I was told that this was at the behest of the American partners who were indifferent to the interests of their foreign partners. That said, H retains shares in Cap Gemini some of which are restricted for a further period of time. Between the hearing in July 2003 and the final submissions on 8 September 2003 the price of these shares moved from &#8364;28.70 to &#8364;40.95, so that the value of these shares increased by about &#163;100,000.</p>

He told me on 8 September 2003 that recent developments may mean that he will be made redundant before that date. He produced no documentary evidence to support this contention.  Doing the best I can, I conclude on the balance of probabilities that he will stay in his job, and receive his income and bonuses until his planned retirement date. From the date of his 60<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday he will receive an annuity from Ernst and Young of &#163;73,000 gross for four years. This annuity was not mentioned in his Form E, and was not disclosed until January 2003. H said he had forgotten about it. Along with his annuity H has other pensions, which I will detail below, including one from Scottish Widows worth &#163;177,000 and which also was not mentioned in his Form E, because, so H asserts,  his pension advisers at Ernst and Young did not know about it.</p>

On 8 September 2003 he gave me more pessimistic evidence based on conversations with three head-hunters. Again he produced no documentary evidence to support his contentions. I consider it to be more probable than not that he will achieve some income in the future from non-executive directorships, although the amount and duration is uncertain.

He told me he did so because he and W2 had offered &#163;1.35m in July 2001 for a property in St Mary&#8217;s Road which was on the market for &#163;1.6m. On its own that would have been a slender basis for valuing his property, in a different street, for &#163;1.5m in March 2002. But he had been telling his solicitors in December 2001 that his home was worth &#163;2m. I am satisfied that H used an unduly low figure for the value of his home as part of a strategy of presenting his assets in the worst possible light.</p>

This was mentioned in Box 4.6 as part of W2&#8217;s assets. This fund had been held in the joint names of H and W2 for a long time. It derived from H&#8217;s earnings. Suddenly on 4 March 2002, 14 days before the Form E was sworn, it was put by W2 into an account of hers that had hitherto been dormant, and thence onto treasury deposit in her sole name. The explanation given was that H and W2 were belatedly reacting to advice given to H by his tax accountant at Ernst and Young as long ago as 17 November 2000 that this would be a sensible move to save tax on the interest. As I will explain below on 4 March 2002 H and W2 purported to suggest that they then believed that W2 was at serious risk of being held liable for &#163;2m arising out of the Baring&#8217;s action brought against Coopers and Lybrand. If this fear was true (and as I will explain, it was not) it would therefore have been madness for assets to have been moved into the sole name of W2.</p>

Accounting partners have to pay for litigation substantially out of their own capital and income and we face the possibility of a huge liability when this case is decided. If that litigation is unsuccessfully defended by Coopers and Lybrand any debt will attach to my wife&#8217;s assets. If her liability exceeds those assets I would regard it as my moral duty, to say nothing of practical wisdom not to see her go bankrupt, which will have a devastating effect on our finances.</p>

As is well known between 1992 and February 1995 Nick Leeson in effect gambled away almost all of Barings&#8217; money, which then collapsed. Barings then sued Deloittes as the auditors of the Singapore company and Coopers and Lybrand as the auditors of the whole Barings Group for not spotting this. </p>

From that point onwards she told me that she assumed that Coopers and Lybrand would be vulnerable and that the professional indemnity insurance cover would be insufficient to meet any claim.

This stated that Barings had issued a writ in 1996, which was served on and acknowledged by one of the partners in the firm. Barings then reissued the writ and wanted to serve it on all the partners of the firm at the relevant time. They applied to the court for an order that the firm disclose the names of all these partners. PWC invited W2 to allow the firm&#8217;s lawyers, Barlow Lyde &amp; Gilbert, to accept service on her behalf and to represent her. They stated that they believed that the firm had a strong defence to the claim and that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;any claims &#8230; will be dealt with in the usual way under the terms and conditions of the firm&#8217;s insurance arrangements&#8221;</span>.</p>

No further inquiry was made by W2, or H, or H&#8217;s legal advisers, about the status of the claim. Instead a hard debt of &#163;2m was inserted into the Form E. This is an astonishing state of affairs. Had even the most cursory inquiries been made then H and W2 would have discovered that in October 2001 the claim against Coopers and Lybrand had been settled on terms that involved no liability for the firm. The claim against Deloittes remained outstanding, and Coopers and Lybrand remained involved as a third party, but any resultant liability on their part would be covered by an arrangement with the liquidators. It was this aspect that was being heard at the time that the Form E was sworn.</p>

Thus W2 wrote a letter to the Office of General Counsel of PWC on 15 April 2002 asking what the status of the litigation was. She asked <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;is it settled, and will all payments &#8230; be covered by the firm&#8217;s professional indemnity insurance?&#8221;.</span> This phraseology betrays a certain knowledge that was not reflected in the Form E.</p>

	    <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in">I now turn to the contingent liability in respect of the Equitable Life claim put down as a hard debt of &#163;500,000. This arose from the adverse decision against Equitable Life in the House of Lords in 2000 whereby they were required to keep their promises to their guaranteed annuitants. Equitable Life later sued Ernst and Young as auditors for failing to spot this liability in the accounts and for failing to give proper advice about it. In particular Equitable Life claimed that the business could have been sold for &#163;2.9 billion if Ernst and Young had offered proper advice on the true cost of guaranteed annuity rate policies. </p>

The newspaper cuttings in the trial bundle announcing the decision to sue are dated 16 April 2002. I do not know when the proceedings were started, but when they were Ernst and Young immediately applied to strike them out as unarguable. They largely succeeded before Mr Justice Langley on 10 February 2003, who in particular struck out the &#8220;lost chance of sale&#8221; claim. An appeal was mounted. That appeal was substantially allowed on 25 July 2003 (after the evidence was heard in this case, but before submissions), and so the position is (subject to any further appeal by Ernst and Young to the House of Lords) that a Court is going to have to decide whether or not Ernst and Young is liable to pay damages to Equitable Life. I understand that the case will be heard in the autumn of 2004.</p>

Certainly he does not seem to have made any inquiry at all about professional indemnity insurance cover. It is impossible for me to find as more probable than not that (a) Equitable Life will prevail in its claim against Ernst and Young; (b) that H&#8217;s aliquot share of the damages will exceed his share of the professional indemnity cover; and that therefore (c) he should be treated as having a hard debt in this regard of &#163;500,000, or indeed any other figure.</p>

	    <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in">My conclusions in this area are, I regret, severe. I start first with general principles. Where there exists in a case a contingent liability it should certainly be mentioned in the Form E, as part of the narrative. But a figure should only be inserted in the computational box that forms part of the calculation of overall net worth if the deponent and his legal advisers are satisfied by credible evidence that on the balance of probabilities the liability is more likely than not to eventuate. Solicitors advising the makers of Forms E have, as Officers of the Court, an important responsibility to ensure that true and realistic figures are inserted in a Form E. And deponents have a greater responsibility to ensure that their Forms E are truthful and honest. The rubric at the beginning of the Form, warning of the consequences of falsehood, is not mere window-dressing.</p>

The argument seems to be that he and W2 were in effect operating a community of property and so her debts were his debts. But it is to be noted that H only inserted half the value of their home as his and omitted entirely any ownership of the fund of &#163;450,000 transferred to W2 a few days before the Form E was sworn.</p>

The first omission was a Scottish Widows policy worth &#163;177,000 deriving from H&#8217;s work at Coopers and Lybrand. This did not appear in the schedule of pensions produced by his pensions advisers at Ernst and Young that was appended to his Form E. Neither did it appear in earlier annual statements.

Only as a result of being pinned down by the tenacious questioning of W&#8217;s advisers did he have to come clean.

	    <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in">It is relevant to record that during the relevant period (January &#8211; March 2002) H&#8217;s principal solicitor, to whom I shall refer as Y, was often unavailable as a result of family illness. So often the day to day management of H&#8217;s case fell to X, an assistant solicitor recently returned from leave of absence who worked only one day each week. It is also relevant to record that X only met H on one occasion. On 25 January 2002 X sent H a blank Form E and asked him to prepare the first draft. There is nothing objectionable about this. I have seen one page from the draft as prepared by H in his hand in which he states that there exists a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;major contingent liability against joint assets &#8230; up to &#163;2m  .. (to discuss)&#8221;</span>. Thus it can be seen that the genesis of this liability is H. On 28 February 2002 Y raised certain questions on this draft, but none related to the presentation of this liability. On 4 March 2002 H attended at the offices of Z partners and had a meeting with another partner in the firm. He left him certain notes. On 7 March 2002 Y wrote to H and said that having been through the notes she wanted the Ernst and Young (sic) liability to be put in Box 2.12 and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;if you can put a figure to both liabilities so much the better&#8221;</span>. She also stated as regards the Coopers and Lybrand liability (sic) <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Are you saying you might have a possible liability yourself if Coopers and Lybrand are successful? If so, I think we should say so. In other words, you would have a liability either way&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in">On Friday 15 March 2002 X set about the task of taking in the numerous amendments. On the colour copy of the Form E her amendments are in red and (in one instance) black ink. She did not follow the instructions in W2&#8217;s letter of 14 March. She deleted the reference to 50% of the &#163;450,000 fund as part of H&#8217;s bank accounts and instated them wholly as part of W2&#8217;s assets. She says that she made a bona fide decision here in circumstances where she had not been aware that the money had very recently been in the joint names of H and W2 (even though earlier attendance notes showed this to be the case). Her view was that if the money was in W2&#8217;s name then no part of it should appear as H&#8217;s asset. She changed the figure for H&#8217;s share of the Baring&#8217;s liability from &#163;1m (being a half) to &#163;2m. She accepts this was a mistake and suggests that she had not read very carefully W2&#8217;s letter of 14 March 2002 on this point. In relation to this claim she added to W2&#8217;s words in box 4.6 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;faced by both me and my wife&#8221;</span>. Having made these amendments, which were of course wholly at variance with W2&#8217;s instructions, she then engrossed the Form and sent a copy to W&#8217;s solicitors. She sent the engrossed version to W2 for H to swear on his return. In the covering letter she explained that she had overridden the instruction as to the treatment of the &#163;450,000 fund because <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it is in your sole name&#8221;</span>. She did not give any explanation as to why she had included &#163;2m rather than &#163;1m, as instructed, for the Baring&#8217;s claim. </p>

But there is a clear line between fulfilment of that duty and advising a presentation that is misleading, especially where the client is seeking, indeed instructing, a presentation that is closer to the truth (but still misleading and false). X crossed that line, but I believe that she did so by mistake, mistakes borne of (a) her limited involvement and understanding of the case, and (b) undertaking the correcting exercise in too much haste. I accept the submission of Mr Moor QC that the errors I have identified were unintentional.</p>

	    <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in">In the schedule of assets attached to his skeleton argument dated 4 July 2003 Mr Marks QC presented H&#8217;s assets as amounting to &#163;1.902m. He calculated this by treating all assets as jointly owned with W2 whether or not they were in fact so held. Thus he reduced by 50% assets held solely by H, such as his shares and pensions. He justified this by arguing that if H and W2 to divorce W2 would have <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a virtually unanswerable claim to 50% of the total &#8211; including a 50% pension share&#8221;</span>. This is a perfectly respectable argument, but I do not agree with it. Whether or not W2 would get 50% on a divorce (which it is agreed has no likelihood of occurring) is debatable. But that is not the point. H&#8217;s assets are what they are. What Mr Marks has in effect done is to reduce H&#8217;s assets by inchoate claims that may be made against him in a divorce from W2. This is, I suggest, as impermissible as the inclusion of liabilities in his Form E of contingent claims against W2. There is however a great difference between an advocate&#8217;s trial schedule and a sworn Form E, and I want to make clear that I am not criticising Mr Marks QC in any way for putting forward his initial schedule. In a way I would have expected nothing less from him. </p>

First he had to decide what variation to make in the order for periodical payments agreed in 1997.  An increase was inevitable given inflation and the husband&#8217;s overall increased prosperity despite the decline in his income.  The judge&#8217;s second task was to fix the date from which the increased order was to commence.  That would dispose of the past and present account between the parties.  Then, and only then, should he have moved to the future, substituting a capital payment calculated in accordance with the Duxbury tables for the income stream that he was terminating.</p>

He relies on <span style="font-style:italic">Harris v Harris[2001] 1 FCR 68</span> for this proposition.

According to the mortality data upon which the table is based, more than one half of men aged exactly 78 can therefore expect to die before having lived for the period of time which is equal to the expectation of life at their age. As against that, the same data show that there is a 25% probability that a person aged 78 will live for at least a further 10.5 years, to age 88.5. For other ages and with other characteristics different conclusions will be just as predictable for the group in question, and predictably as accurate. </p>

For if a member of the battalion of men aged 78 (of an age where life expectancy according to ELT 15 is 7.2 years, and as was the husband at the date of the first instance hearing) marches on to age 85, the table gives a revised life expectancy of 4.8 years for the reduced company who arrive at that age. The platoon who then survive to 89 (and have thus already climbed well past the ridge envisaged when they were only 78) would be greeted with an extended vista of 3.7 years as the life expectancy offered by the table, beyond even which new horizon a squad of their number can indeed expect on to slog. Survival can thus be described as a continuously encouraging and refreshing process: each year the individual survives along the way increases the statistical chance that he will meet and perhaps survive what was the preceding year's prediction of his life expectancy. </p>

The tables with great statistical accuracy reflect what for a proportion of their population is the prospect of accident or ill health claiming earlier deaths so that as actuarial exercises they are not at all confounded by the personal disadvantage to the individual for whom the risk of such premature death materialises. But it would be a cruel disadvantage of another sort to outlive a <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury</span> fund. These are conventionally calculated upon a basis that does not take the subtlety of these progressively revising expectancies into account, nor the additional complexity that actuaries can also project the rate of future improvements in mortality experience. For most part and at most ages the effect of more sophisticated computations on the outcome would be marginal, and would still firmly relate to the group rather than to the individual. Moreover, that extra sophistication might of itself tend to encourage another illusory expectation, that <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury</span> is some alchemical touchstone rather than a rule (if at all) only of thumb.</p>

The rate of 3.75% is gross for the purposes of income tax, but is expressed net of an assumed figure of 3% for inflation. The true actual gross rate of return is 6.75%. It would be very difficult for any investor in present market conditions to achieve that anywhere. It is pertinent to observe that with inflation presently running at 3% a higher rate tax payer must achieve at least 5% interest if he is not to lose money on his investment. But there is not a single account available in the UK that presently pays 5%. It is arguable that over the remaining 24 years of W&#8217;s life expectancy an overall rate of 6.75% may be achievable. But as Lord Lloyd of Berwick pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Wells v. Wells <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 AC 345" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 AC 345</ref></span> (at 367B)<span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;every long period  starts with a short period&#8221;</span>.

After all, during their marriages they often lived in a risky environment where the family&#8217;s fortunes depended on the entrepreneurial skill of the husband. An older wife who is seeking a capitalisation after many years of maintenance dependency should not, arguably, have to assume such risks. W here is particularly nervous and vulnerable.

I understand that some personal injury practitioners are disquieted by the discrepancy, and argue that damages calculated by reference to the present rate are selling claimants short.

The concept of a secret judgment is one which I believe to be inherently abhorrent. Only in cases where there is a cause for secrecy, such as in a trade secrets' case, can it in general be right that a judgment should be regarded as a secret document. Even then it may be only a part of the judgment needs to be secret. I conclude, in the absence of binding authority to the contrary, that when judgments are given in chambers they are not to be regarded as secret documents. There is in principle all the differences between a judgment given in camera (ie a judgment which the judge has specifically ordered, for cause, to be treated as secret) and a judgment given in chambers merely for administrative reasons.</p>

Thus in the <span style="font-style:italic">Sutter</span> case, for example, it found that the publicity requirement under Art 6(1) was satisfied by the fact that anyone who could establish an interest could consult or obtain a copy of the full text of judgments of the Military Court of Cassation, together with the fact that Court's most important judgments were published in an official collection (ibid, para 34). </p>

Were it to be understood that candour would be likely to lead - in all but the very rare case - to exposure of under-declarations to the Revenue, the pressure wrongfully to dissemble within the proceedings might be irresistible to a far bigger congregation of litigants than is typified by the husband in these proceedings, who of course resolved not to be candid in any event. False presentations by respondents in ancillary proceedings have two repercussions, both seriously contrary to the public interest: (a) either the judge remains deceived, in which the case the award is likely to be inaptly low, or he perceives the deception, whereupon he may draw necessarily broad inferences of hidden wealth which, depending on their scale, could make the award inaptly high or indeed leave it still inaptly low; and (b) applicants are seldom minded to compromise their claims on the basis of presentations which they believe to be materially false and their stance, if justified by the court's findings, will often be upheld in relation to costs. Yet the family justice system depends upon the compromise of all but a few applications for ancillary relief.</p>

For present purposes the question arises as to how the court is to take into account liabilities to the Revenue arising from tax evasion, or the non-payment of tax. If the court is satisfied that there has been tax evasion the consequence is that it is satisfied that there are liabilities to the Revenue and one of the litigants has acted in breach of his statutory obligations and, in my judgment, dishonestly. Additionally, if the court is for other reasons satisfied that there has been an underpayment of tax it will also be satisfied that there is a tax liability. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.79in">Can the court proceed on the basis that those liabilities (or potential liabilities) do not exist, and thus either on the basis (a) that the evasion will not be discovered and possibly that it will continue, or (b) that the liability will not be met? In my judgment, in the absence of a compelling public interest that it should do so, it would not be right, or just, for the court to take either course.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.79in">Additionally, if the court took this course it would be accepting that it should do nothing about either (a) illegality which it is satisfied exists, or (b) the non-payment of a sum which it is satisfied is lawfully due to the Revenue. In my judgment, in the absence of a compelling public interest to the contrary, it would not be right for a court to close its eyes to such illegality or non-payment. Further, in ancillary relief cases by doing so the court would be acting on the assumption that such illegality or non-payment was likely to continue, and in my judgment, in the absence of a compelling public interest to the contrary, it would not be right for a court to take this course which can be said to be one which condones such illegality or non-payment.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.79in">If the court finds that such liabilities exist they reduce the assets lawfully available to the parties. In my judgment the court can, and should, take them into account. But if it does take them into account, in my judgment, in the absence of a compelling public interest to the contrary, it would not be right for the court to do so on the basis that the evasion or non-payment will continue, or will not be discovered. </p>

In the vast majority of cases the wife will have some suspicion, whether derived from the possession of <span style="font-style:italic">Hildebrand </span>documents or other material, that the disclosure is inaccurate. And so she will embark on an exhaustive process of discovery and interrogation to get to the truth. She will not settle until and unless she and her advisers have been given a truthful account. That stage is very often not reached until a full trial has been conducted. At some stage the wife and her advisers will have a real suspicion that the husband&#8217;s assets include untaxed monies. They will then have an obligation to report their suspicions to NCIS under Part 7 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29" uk:canonical="2002 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Proceeds of Crime Act 2002</ref>. NCIS will in turn report the suspicions to the Inland Revenue. And so it is inevitable in an ancillary relief case, where tax evasion is alleged and exposed, for the Revenue to be informed.</p>

However he makes a further point which I consider to be valid. He says that the rubric at the beginning of Form E contains dire warnings about the consequences of false disclosure, but that those warnings do not extend to the prospect of public censure. He says that if such a consequence was in prospect H, and certainly W2, should have been warned about it. He says that H and W2 did what they did in the belief that the case would be heard in private; and that any judgment, if reported, would be anonymised. He has pointed to a number of cases heard at first instance where very bad conduct by a party has been found, but where the case was nonetheless reported on an anonymous basis. </p>

Maybe they would. It is this consideration that has persuaded me, exceptionally, to obscure their identities in this judgment.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">[25] In my judgment, therefore, rules 2.69B and 2.69D can be managed and, where the court considers it unjust to apply rule 2.69B, it can make a different costs order to reflect the justice of the case. Mr Pointer QC, in his thoughtful and comprehensive skeleton argument, sets out in a bar chart a series of permutations arising from a court order to a wife of &#163;1 million.  I take one hypothetical situation. If a husband offers &#163;800,000 and the wife asks for &#163;1,200,000, neither has achieved the figure of the order and each is wide of the mark by the same amount. In broadly comparable situations, not tied to exact percentages since each case must be decided on its own facts, the result might be termed, as Mr Cusworth for Mr Norris suggested, a draw. In my view, in some offer and counter-offer cases, the proper approach might well be, under the present procedure, to make no order as to costs and leave each party to pay his/her own costs.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">[27] The current procedure on costs in family financial disputes is regulated by the two statutory codes, the CPR and the FPR, each of which gives the judge or district judge a broad judicial discretion. I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment of Thorpe LJ in this case, and would respectfully agree with paragraph 61 of his judgment in which he says that the harmonious integration of the separate codes is to be best achieved by treating CPR 44.3 as covering all cases.  The exercise which the court undertakes under CPR 44.3(4) requires consideration of all the circumstances, including the parties&#8217; respective conduct and success and, under subsection (4)(c), any offers made. In so far as the court is looking at  a <span style="font-style:italic">Calderbank</span> type case, the exercise under subsection (4)(c) is better dealt with under the fuller provisions to be found in FPR rules 2.69, 2.69B and 2.69D. Reading the two sets of rules together, the court has a general and wide discretion to depart from the starting point of 'winner takes all'.</p>
