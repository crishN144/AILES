	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a desperately sad and worrying case. It has had, as I must shortly describe, a most unusual, unfortunate and convoluted history. But the underlying issue in this case can be stated in a single sentence. Should a little boy, D, live with his parents, or, if they cannot adequately look after him, should he, as the local authority, Swindon Borough Council, argues, be adopted outside the family. </p>

It has the most profound personal, emotional, psychological, social and, it may be in some cases, cultural and religious, consequences.&#8221; For the parents it means the permanent loss of their child. Whatever the ultimate decision, D and his parents will have to live with the consequences for the remainder of their lives, in D&#8217;s case, given his age, potentially into the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> century. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[2] <marker name="tab"/>D was born on 11 December 2011 and is therefore now aged 2&#189;. His mother was assessed in 2012 as being on the borderline of a mild learning disability. His father was found to have a more significant cognitive impairment, with an IQ of around 50. In the earlier proceedings described below, a psychological assessment concluded that he lacked capacity to conduct litigation. He has, however, managed to function successfully in his adult life, with some assistance from local authority adult social services. He has worked in the same job for over 12 years and has contributed towards the financial support of the family.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[3] <marker name="tab"/>When D was born, the local authority started care proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. After he was discharged from hospital, D and his parents underwent a 16-week residential placement in a local authority foster placement which was completed successfully. Afterwards, the family moved into a new home with a package of support from the local authority and other agencies. They have extended family on both sides to whom they are close, and a network of friends. They attend a local church. In the summer of 2012, the parents were married.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[4] <marker name="tab"/>At the final hearing of the care proceedings, the local authority&#8217;s care plan, dated [28 September 2012] recorded that D had been in his parents&#8217; care since birth and was settled, happy and developing. It recommended that D remain in their care under a full care order. That order would be subject to review after a year when it was thought it might be appropriate to move to a supervision order. The plan specified the level of professional support to be provided for the family. It further provided that, if the placement broke down, D would move initially to a foster placement. The local authority would then carry out a viability assessment of his maternal grandparents to see if they were able to look after him, although an assessment carried during the care proceedings had concluded that they were not.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[5] <marker name="tab"/>The care plan was endorsed by the children&#8217;s guardian. In her final report, she indicated that, while she supported what she described as the local authority's &#8220;courageous attempts&#8221; to try to enable D to be looked after [by] his parents, she was &#8220;not yet entirely confident that they will be able to provide D with the safe, emotionally attentive care that he will need on a long term basis&#8221;. She identified &#8220;a number of risk factors in D&#8217;s care circumstances which can be monitored but not removed or effectively counteracted by the considerable support and monitoring resources that have been and are continuing to be provided&#8221;. She thought that, as D becomes more mobile, these risk factors would be more difficult to manage.</p>

On 31 March 2014 the local authority gave the parents notice that they intended to remove D on 25 April 2014. On 11 April 2014 the father filed an application seeking the discharge of the care order in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. On 22 April 2014 the local authority filed an application for a recovery order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/50" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 50</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>. Both applications came before District Judge Goddard on 24 April 2014. During the hearing an oral application was made for an injunction to restrain the local authority removing D. The district judge refused the application for an injunction and made the recovery order. D was removed from his parents the following day, 25 April 2014. He has been in foster care ever since.</p>

He remitted the application for an injunction for hearing by Judge Marshall, but declined to direct D&#8217;s return to his parents in the interim. The hearing before Judge Marshall took place on 29&#8211;30 May 2014. She declined to order D&#8217;s return to his parents. On 17 July 2014 the Court of Appeal (Black LJ) refused the father&#8217;s application for permission to appeal Judge Marshall&#8217;s order.</p>

The order made on that occasion recited that: &#8220;This is a case where permanent placement outside the family must be considered as a possible outcome&#8221;. In addition to making arrangements for interim contact, Judge Marshall directed that the local authority&#8217;s application for a placement order in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> was to be issued by 28 October 2014. She directed that expert evidence be obtained from an independent social worker, Helen Randall, in a report to be provided by 30 September 2014.

By then the proceedings had become, as they continued for some time to be, bogged down in issues about public funding for the parents. It was in relation to those matters that my two previous judgments were directed. I need say no more here about that, except to remind the reader of the mother&#8217;s anguish following a further hearing before me on 2 December 2014 (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re D (No 2)</span>, para 22) that D had not even been mentioned during the course of the submissions and discussions in court on that occasion. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t&#8221;, she said, &#8220;seem right that so much time has to be taken up about the legal aid when it should be about D.&#8221; Who could possibly disagree?

I need at this point to identify a number of other important documents to which particular reference has been made and which constituted the essential material when what was supposed to be the final hearing began before me on 9 February 2015. First, there was the report of the children&#8217;s guardian, CM, dated 23 October 2012, which was before District Judge Cronin and the local authority&#8217;s care plan dated 28 September 2012 which was approved by District Judge Cronin. Then there were reports on D from Dr JK, a consultant paediatrician, dated 6 March 2014 and 30 June 2014 (there is now a more recent report dated 17 April 2015). There was an autism diagnostic report on the mother dated 16 September 2014 by SEQOL. There was a viability assessment focusing on the parents&#8217; parenting of D, dated 30 January 2015, prepared by LE of A+bility. There were statements of MB, who had been D&#8217;s social worker, dated 20 May 2014, 16 October 2014 and 20 November 2014. There was a statement from TG, who had been the mother&#8217;s social care worker, dated 20 August 2014. There were statements of a family nurse, CP, dated 9 July 2014, and of the health visitor, LW, dated 17 July 2014. There were statements of the mother dated 29 May 2014 and 22 December 2014. There were two statements in support of the parents from Mrs P (I shall explain below who she is). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final hearing on 9 February 2015 had scarcely got under way when there was a most unexpected development. MC, who had been acting as the parents&#8217; advocate, put herself forward as a prospective carer for D under the umbrella of a special guardianship order. It was apparent that this required careful investigation. So the hearing had to be abandoned, though not before I had heard the evidence of GS, the group manager of the local authority&#8217;s family placement services. I gave further directions. In particular I directed that a special guardianship report was to be prepared by the Cambridge Centre for Attachment. The report, by Dr BG and JK, is dated 15 May 2015. Their supplemental report is dated 16 June 2015. Those reports, which were positive in their support of MC&#8217;s application, needed to be read in conjunction with a special guardianship support plan dated 1 June 2015 prepared by the local authority. The mother had put in a further statement. Finally, there was a report dated 22 June 2015 from the guardian, CM. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the final hearing resumed before me on 22 June 2015, the position was therefore as follows. The proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> had come to an end on 7 November 2012 when District Judge Cronin made a care order. The proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/50" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 50</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> had come to an end on 24 April 2014 when District Judge Goddard made a recovery order. The injunction proceedings had come to an end on 17 July 2014 when the Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal from the order made by Her Honour Judge Marshall on 9 June 2014. There were three extant matters: the father&#8217;s application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>; the local authority&#8217;s application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>; and MC&#8217;s application for a special guardianship order. In fact, only the first and third of these were being pursued, for both the local authority and the guardian were at one in supporting MC&#8217;s application for a special guardianship order in the event that D could not be reunited with his parents. In other words, the local authority was no longer pursuing a plan for adoption. So the issue lay as between the parents on the one side, seeking, by means of the father&#8217;s application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, to have D returned to their care and, on the other side, the local authority and the guardian, arguing that D should not be returned to his parents&#8217; care and that his interests would best be served by my making a special guardianship order in favour of MC.</p>

There was then a further most unexpected, and in the event most unsettling, event. Only a few days later, MC suffered a further family bereavement. Initially, it was thought that this would not disturb, even if it might lead to some reconsideration of the timescales involved in, D&#8217;s possible placement with MC. Whilst there was this continuing uncertainty, it seemed to me inappropriate to finalise the judgment on which I had started. On 11 August 2015 MC&#8217;s solicitor wrote explaining why, after much careful consideration, MC had sadly had to conclude that, in the circumstances she was now having to deal with, she was not in a position to offer D the care and attention he needed and that she had accordingly, with regret, reached the conclusion that she should withdraw her application for a special guardianship order. It was, she believed, the best decision for D.</p>

That remained the local authority&#8217;s plan as late as 3 February 2014. By 19 March 2014 the local authority had changed its mind. It is necessary to explore why.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should explain at this point who the key individuals are who have worked with the family. MB was D&#8217;s social worker from November 2011 until May 2015. She was a most impressive witness who had plainly gone out of her way to do everything possible to maintain D&#8217;s placement with his parents. D and his parents were lucky to have the assistance for so long of so dedicated a social worker who, if she will allow me to say so, exemplified everything that is best in the profession. More recently, since May 2015, and therefore after D&#8217;s removal from his parents, his social worker has been PL. TG was mother&#8217;s social care worker from July 2012 until early 2014. She again was an impressive witness who, as was evident, had done everything possible to support and encourage the mother. CP is a family nurse and health visitor who was the family&#8217;s nurse from September 2012 until January 2014. LW is a health visitor who had a brief involvement with the family in early 2014. AP was until early 2014 the social work team manager for the family. MR took over that role in early 2014. AS is a solicitor in the local authority&#8217;s legal department.</p>

They have been, and they suggest that they can in future be, a vital part of the family&#8217;s support network. Their significance is exemplified by the role allotted to Mrs P in the A+bility assessment (see paragraph 52 below).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the autumn of 2013 the local authority was becoming concerned. On 5 September 2013, there was a meeting between MB, TG, CP and AP &#8220;to measure progress from previous meeting and highlight concerns.&#8221; Their concerns overall (&#8220;How worried are we? 0 being worst and 10 being best&#8221;) were measured as follows: CP 3, MB, 4 and TG 5. On 8 October 2013, there was another meeting between the same four professionals &#8220;to decide whether we continue to support D with his parents or consider other permanence options in light of increased concerns around D&#8217;s slow progress in his development.&#8221; Amongst the concerns identified were a &#8220;decline in D&#8217;s development&#8221;, the mother &#8220;distancing herself from professionals&#8221; and the fact that she &#8220;does not see that D is falling behind and &#8230; does not see the need for change [and] is not motivated to do anything differently.&#8221; The decision of the meeting was &#8220;to continue to support family for a period of 3 months following LAC review when a definite decision will be made as to whether or not other permanency options should be considered.&#8221; This was carried forward at the next LAC review on 22 October 2013, which decided that there should be an updated core assessment to &#8220;assist professionals in determining D&#8217;s permanent living situation.&#8221;</p>

Both before me, as previously before Judge Marshall, and indeed to an extent, as we have seen, in the letter dated 19 March 2014, emphasis has been placed on a number of incidents when, although in fact he suffered no physical or other harm, D was exposed to risk. Six have been identified: an occasion, when he was about 18 months old, and recorded by TG in her note of a visit to the mother on 6 June 2013, when the mother had allowed D to climb the stairs, without following him to catch him if he fell (she was at the top of the stairs taking a photograph of D on her phone<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

No clear answer to this is provided by the local authority&#8217;s records, and I have no evidence on the point from MR, or, indeed, from anyone other than MB. Judging from what MB said in her letter of 19 March 2014, in her statements dated 20 May 2014 and 16 October 2014, and in her oral evidence, it would seem that what triggered this fundamental change was a combination of the concerns which had been growing since 2013, the report of LW of what she and CP had seen on 14 February 2014, the report from Dr JK dated 6 March 2014 and, not least, a reappraisal of the case by a new pair of eyes, the recently involved MR.

It is apparent from reading her judgment that this material weighed heavily in Judge Marshall&#8217;s analysis and in her decision that D should not at that stage be returned to his parents. Given the much fuller picture which is now available to me, these are matters which I must approach, as I do, afresh and without reference to Judge Marshall&#8217;s analysis.</p>

The SEQOL report dated 16 September 2014 concluded that she does not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for an autism spectrum condition but &#8220;has a number of features of autistic thinking in terms of a preference for routines and some difficulties with flexibility of thinking.&#8221; The report noted that she:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The A+bility viability assessment dated 30 January 2015 assessed both parents in accordance with the PAMS parent handbook. Each parent was assessed by reference to two profiles: the child profile and the parent profile. Under the child profile, the areas assessed were: feeding; healthcare &#8211; general; healthcare &#8211; hygiene; parental responsiveness; stimulation; guidance and control; responsibility and independence. The scores could be poor, adequate or good. The mother was assessed as poor in all areas except the first, where the assessment was adequate/poor. The father scored rather better, being assessed as good at stimulation, adequate at responsibility and independence, and adequate/poor at feeding. Under the parent profile, the areas assessed were: household routines; time telling; telephone skills; travel skills; budgeting; shopping; cooking; washing; general safety; safety outside the home; safety abuse &#8211; physical, emotional and sexual; parents mental healthcare; parents physical healthcare; relationships and support. In many areas the mother was assessed as being adequate (seven) or good (two). Of note, she was assessed as being poor in the areas of general safety (she &#8220;found it difficult to think about what she might do in certain situations, other than ask her neighbour for help&#8221;) and safety outside the home (she &#8220;gave a very basic answer to road safety &#8220;Look both ways&#8221;&#8221;). The father was assessed as adequate in five areas though poor in the others (including in the areas of both general safety and safety outside the home). In summary, it was pointed out that both parents have difficulties with the areas of feeding, healthcare (general and hygiene), parental responsiveness, guidance and control, shopping, cooking, general safety and safety outside the home. On the other hand it was noted that in some areas where one parent has difficulties the other has a strength, so that they therefore complement each other. One example, borne out by much evidence, is the father&#8217;s skill in playing with D. </p>

A &#8220;high level of professional support&#8221; would be needed throughout a transition period whose timescale was &#8220;difficult&#8221; to predict, depending in part on &#8220;how well [the parents] respond to professional input, guidance and advice in order to achieve a good enough level of parenting.&#8221; The assessment set out proposed timetables of support for, respectively, weeks 1-6, 7-12, 13-18 and 19-24. I need not go into the details. What was proposed initially was significant support for much of the day, seven days a week, with significant daily input from Mrs P, moving gradually to a re-balancing of the support with a shift from A+bility to Mrs P. Looking &#8220;into the future&#8221;, the assessment indicated that the parents:</p>

Sadly, I have great concern about any further direct contact between D and his parents for this very reason as I anticipate that [they] will not be able to accept D being placed for Adoption. It is for this reason that I cannot recommend future direct contact for D and parents. However, I have considered D&#8217;s need to understand his identity and life story. For this reason, I will be recommending bi-annual letterbox contact for D and his parents throughout his future, and for [his grandparents] to include a letter with [the parents&#8217;] letterbox contact once per year, with [their] agreement.&#8221;</p>

I also observed [her] to be &#8216;easily distracted&#8217; which clearly impacted on her ability to supervise D safely at times; an example of this was the occasion when she and D were at the Children&#8217;s Centre. [She] told me that she had asked a young child to &#8216;look after&#8217; D and was herself chatting and having a cup of tea, not noticing that D had left the centre until alerted by her mother. D on that occasion was found in the road &#8211; thankfully unharmed.</p>

He reported that D had been seen by the disability learning team and that his assessment for autism spectrum disorder was due to start shortly. He described D&#8217;s speech as improving well and his behaviour at playgroup as quite active. He reported on D&#8217;s contact with his parents, noting that the contact supervisors had on occasions highlighted concerns which, although infrequent, were significant and revealing of the parents&#8217; relationships with and understanding of D. He summarised this as the parents continuing to show emotional detachment from D, manifested on occasions in their threatening to terminate contact early, shouting at D, behaving impatiently, and displaying irritability and petulance. PL summarised the advice from the local authority&#8217;s adoption team as being, in effect, that D would not be difficult to place, given the availability of adopters suitable for children of his age and with his characteristics. That corresponded with the evidence I had previously heard from GS.</p>

Despite considerable daily professional support his well being was becoming compromised and his development was falling behind. The standard of support provided is in my opinion, in accord with the needs of parents with learning difficulties. The professionals used simple language and modelled the tasks. They gave positive encouragement and [the parents] liked and engaged with those working closely with them. At times D&#8217;s care was just good enough and at others it was not. Both parents can be resistant to advice and would prefer to be left alone. They have now taken against the social worker and the foster carer who they blame for the removal of D.&#8221;</p>

The support these parents will require to ensure D is properly parented would be immense and would restrict their day to day life. Sadly even if the parents would accept such a plan, in the current climate of cuts in services and frequent changes of professionals, it would be a risk to D and unrealistic that such support would be available over a very long period of time.</p>

Long term foster care, even if the parents work with the foster carers, is risky and I suspect it would be challenged by the parents. Even with an exceptional placement the chances of it being very long-term are problematic. Mr and Mrs P are not offering such a placement. Adoption is the last resort but will provide permanency, stability and security for D and meet his primary attachment and care needs. It will be very distressing for the parents who in my view are just too limited and vulnerable to be able to parent D. They are unlikely to understand or agree that they cannot care for D to a good enough standard.</p>

She and her husband have been foster carers; at one stage they were D&#8217;s foster carers. Mrs P is involved in many projects with her church and in the community. She arranged for the mother to start working with her in the charity shop she runs. In her first statement Mrs P said this:</p>

Relying upon all the expert and other evidence, the local authority says that D is a child with additional needs who needs more than good enough parenting; that the parents, because of their own difficulties, are unable to meet his specialist needs and to provide the stimulation and skilled parenting he needs; that they are unlikely to be able to keep up with D&#8217;s developmental needs, so that he might regress in their care, undoing the progress he has made in foster care; and that the level (and duration) of the support that would be required if D were to return to his parents would not provide him with the love and consistency of care that primary careers could provide. As Ms Griffiths put it, D needs to be parented by a &#8216;parent&#8217;, not by professional carers. The local authority also has continuing concerns about the parents&#8217; ability to ensure D&#8217;s safety and about their limited ability fully to embrace the support of professionals.</p>

As she submits, this impacted on the family in two ways: first, the father has not had the support he required, and thus continued to struggle with day to day tasks for himself; and, secondly, this meant that the mother was overburdened by being required to support him &#8211; which must have impacted on her ability to look after D. This is not, Ms Fottrell says, a small point, for it undermines the local authority&#8217;s case that the parents were fully supported when D was living at home. It is not enough for the local authority to assert that it was committed to D remaining at home and that it provided support. The key issues, she says, are (i) whether the local authority offered the right support and (ii) whether it was entitled to expect, as it did, that the support could be reduced and eventually withdrawn. Her answer to each is clear: No.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Fottrell identifies what she suggests are two fundamental flaws at the heart of the local authority&#8217;s case. First, she says, there is an inherent contradiction given that the nature of the parents&#8217; learning disabilities is, as she puts it, inherent and unchanging, a fact known to everyone when the original order was made: so the need for ongoing support on an indefinite basis underpinned the care plan approved the court in November 2012. It is therefore, she submits, unfortunate and somewhat harsh for the local authority and the guardian now to be saying that the parents have failed to &#8216;improve&#8217; their parenting. She suggests that this goes to demonstrate either that the support envisaged was not provided to the extent required or that the local authority&#8217;s expectations of the parents were either unclear or unrealistic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, she challenges the assertion that D needs better than good enough parenting: it is, she says, circular and dangerous and runs the risk of a parent with learning difficulties being held to a different and more onerous standard. It would, she suggests, exclude a parent with learning difficulties who requires support from being able to parent their child if the child also has learning difficulties. She points to what Gillen J said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G and A </span>and observes, correctly, that the court has to comply with both Article 8 and Article 14 of the Convention. It cannot be right, she says, for the court to sanction a local authority&#8217;s intervention in the family life of a parent with disability in a way which would be discriminatory under Article 14. Moreover, as she points out, there is a <span style="font-style:italic">positive </span>obligation on the State under Article 8 and that, she submits, in a case such as this, imposes a broad obligation to provide such support as will enable the child to remain with his parents.</p>

She challenges the assertion that the parents need support round the clock &#8211; a proposition, she submits, not made out on the evidence. And she points out that D has never suffered any physical injuries. Insofar as there are said to have been what can be characterised as &#8216;near misses&#8217;, she poses the question: Are these the kind of incidents, familiar to every parent, where the reaction is &#8216;there but by the grace of God &#8230;?

They were always going to need assistance. They were what they are. And D&#8217;s needs and the challenges he would present as he grew older were obviously going to change. It was a fundamental tenet of the care plan that a robust and suitable tailored package needed to be provided to address these realities. This is emphatically <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>the kind of case where a care plan has been made on one basis but where the parents&#8217; circumstances have changed. On the contrary, these parents, with all their deficits, are the parents who, if provided with proper support, were &#8216;good enough&#8217; when the care order was made. Moreover, as they emphasise, these are the parents who were still being assessed by AP, the team manager, as late as 29 January 2014 (see paragraph 36 above) as being able to provide &#8216;good enough&#8217; parenting.</p>

The support to be provided by Mr and Mrs P was never put on a formal basis. The recommendations of the LAC review on 3 February 2014 (see paragraph 37 above) remained in large part unimplemented.

As they point out, during the seven week period between 3 February 2014 and 19 March 2014 (see paragraphs 32 and 48 above) the local authority not only did not put in the services identified at the LAC review; it completely changed its view of the case. </p>

But the point in fact, they say, goes further. The failure, for example, to follow through the recommendation in relation to the SEQOL assessment (see paragraph 37 above), means that once the assessment was finally provided in September 2014 (paragraph 51) it was too late to implement it, because by then D had been removed.

They submit that what matters is that the child has a clear and secure knowledge of who his or her parents are. The fact that some parents either <span style="font-style:italic">need </span>or <span style="font-style:italic">choose</span> to have assistance with the way in which their children are brought up does not, they say, alter that. </p>

What such parents need, they submit, is that a reasonable adjustment is made for the deficits in their parenting which arise from their own inherent difficulties rather than from neglect or failure or indifference. The fact that such adjustments are made, and that such parents may be receiving a high level of help and support, does not, they say, mean that they are not bringing up their children.

No doubt, they say, in all these cases the parents hope for continuity throughout the child&#8217;s childhood, but, as they point out, that is not the real world. Nannies move on, staff change, teachers leave, so the children are exposed to differing professionals providing care for them at differing stages during their childhood.</p>

They reject the guardian&#8217;s approach that the parents will need 24 hour wrap-around support. That is not what the mother is seeking, nor is it what she, or the father or D need. Finally, they suggest that there has been an undue emphasis on risk, particularly in relation to D&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">safety</span>. Quite apart from the fact that all the incidents relied upon predated the local authority&#8217;s volte face, they point out that risk cannot be eradicated from children&#8217;s lives, although of course it can and should be reduced. They urge a sense of proportion: of course, a child can fall and poke himself in the eye with a dinner knife, but so too with a pencil, a crayon or a toy. The parents can learn to manage by modelling, which the mother, they say, will accept and learn from. Moreover, as they point out, risks change through time: road safety with a small child becomes internet safety with an older child; bath-time is hazardous for a very small baby but the risk diminishes over time to nothing for the older child. The parents, they urge, with proper training and support will be able to manage the changing risks. The mother, as they point out, has changed in her view of D&#8217;s needs and limitations. Earlier on, she was unwilling to accept that there was anything wrong or that he had any difficulties; in her evidence, she was able to acknowledge that that this was not so, saying that &#8220;it&#8217;s on both sides of his family, so it&#8217;s not that surprising.&#8221; </p>

The very striking contrast between the level and quality of the services provided by the local authority&#8217;s children and adult services redounds as much to the credit of the one as to the discredit of the other.

Ms Fottrell, Ms Morgan and Ms Sprinz submit that the impact was not just felt by the father but also went to and adversely affected the mother&#8217;s ability to look after D. The guardian and Ms Randall take a rather different view, though focusing more on the question of the extent to which additional support would have enhanced the <span style="font-style:italic">father&#8217;s </span>ability to act as secondary carer. My conclusion, in the light of all the evidence, is that at worst all this would have had no more than a marginal impact on the parents&#8217; ability to look after D. The gap between what was actually provided to the father and what ought to have been provided, significant though it was, would not have sufficed to bridge what in my judgment was, as I shall explain, the very large gap between D&#8217;s needs and what the parents were actually able to do for him.</p>

Nor, even if she was unaware of it, does this impact in any significant way upon Ms Randall&#8217;s analysis and conclusions. Both MB and TG were very keen &#8211; almost desperate &#8211; to see the mother succeed. They had poured much professional skill, time and effort into that endeavour. They would not have reduced their input if they had thought that it might prejudice the mother and her ability to look after D, and there is nothing to suggest that it reflected a decision imposed upon them by others to which they objected. Again, the gap between what they had previously been providing to the mother and what was now being provided would not have sufficed to bridge what, as I have said, was in my judgment the very large gap between D&#8217;s needs and what the parents were actually able to do for him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, the question of D&#8217;s physical safety. It is important both to keep this in perspective but at the same time also to understand the real focus of the local authority&#8217;s concerns. I start with two obvious but important points. The parents have never done nor, I am satisfied, would they ever dream of doing anything to harm D. And the fact is that, with the sole exception of the occasion when his finger was trapped in the drawer &#8211; something that could happen to any child in the care of the most attentive and careful if momentarily distracted parent &#8211; D has <span style="font-style:italic">never</span> suffered any physical harm while in their care. Moreover, the specific incidents to which the local authority understandably draws attention are none of them, viewed in isolation, anything particularly out of the normal; indeed, probably familiar, if we are honest about it, to any parent. On occasions, children do escape. On occasions they find things which may cause them injury if they fall over. On occasions they make more or less perilous journeys up or down potentially dangerous staircases. On occasions parents, in exasperation, throw things.</p>

I accept the mother&#8217;s explanations as to why, and in my judgment quite reasonably, she took the view that D did not need medical attention after his finger was trapped in the drawer. Whatever she may have said to TG, and the words TG reports are capable of more than one meaning, I reject any suggestion that this was a deliberate attempt by the mother to cover up. She would, I am confident, always have put her child&#8217;s safety first. That is simply the kind of mother she is.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So what is the real focus of the local authority&#8217;s concern in relation to safety? Looking to the various views expressed by A+bility (paragraph 52 above), by MB (paragraph 61), by TG (paragraphs 67-70), and by Ms Randall (paragraphs 78-79, 81), all of which are to much the same effect and point in the same direction, and which I have no hesitation in accepting, the problem is a group of difficulties the mother has: in anticipating possible risks (particularly if they are novel); knowing how to react quickly and effectively in the face of potential hazard; not always being able to anticipate or control D&#8217;s actions; not being able to transfer past experiences or training into practical precautions next time round (as TG put it, progress &#8216;in the moment&#8217; tended not to be carried through over time); not being able to bring her theoretical awareness of risk to bear effectively when confronted with a live situation; and not being able to multitask in situations where she might be distracted from her focus on D. TG&#8217;s description (paragraph 67) of the contrast between the mother&#8217;s fluent explanations and her inability to translate this into practical terms is striking and illuminating, as indeed is the whole of TG&#8217;s evidence on the issue of danger.</p>

I am acutely conscious both of what the mother said in the witness box (paragraphs 83 and 87) and of the powerful points (paragraph 115) made by Ms Morgan and Ms Sprinz. The context is of course vital. And I do not think that the mother sets out to be difficult with professionals or those trying to support and assist her. But the detailed reports by MB (paragraph 61), by TG (paragraphs 69-70), by Ms Randall (paragraphs 75, 77, 78, 80-82), and by the guardian (paragraph 96), all of which I accept, demonstrate all too clearly the difficulty the mother has in accepting guidance, advice or support when it does not fit in with her own views. This is not the mother&#8217;s fault. It is not because she wants to be difficult or challenging. It is, as Ms Randall perceptively commented (paragraphs 77, 78, 81) something which stems from the mother&#8217;s learning difficulties, her personality and character traits and the rigidity of her thinking. But whatever the reasons for it, the effects are clear and the implications for the mother&#8217;s ability to work with outsiders, both now and in the future, obvious. I do not overlook Mrs P. Her remarkable ability to work with the mother is testament to Mrs P&#8217;s personality and skill, but even that relationship has had its ups and downs.</p>

The guardian, as we have seen, contemplates that the parents will need 24 hour wrap-around support. The parents make clear that that is not what they are seeking, nor, they submit, is it what they need. I am not sure that the guardian was going quite so far as to suggest the need for literally round-the-clock support but the point in the final analysis is, in my judgment, of limited significance. For, on any view, the kind of package contemplated by A+bility and proposed by both the parents and Mrs P would necessitate, and, even on the very best assumptions, necessitate well into the future, a very high level of intensive support throughout much of the waking day. </p>

There is, I think, a risk of this becoming mired in semantics. The reality is clear and simple. As Ms Randall put it, D has complex special needs (paragraph 76). The guardian expressed the same view when she said that D&#8217;s care needs are over and above those of other children of his age (paragraph 95) and said that, because of his own difficulties, D will need additional support both through childhood and as a young adult (paragraph 100).

Although this is a conventional way of expressing it, the real point surely is this. What is required is parenting which is &#8216;good enough&#8217;, not for some hypothetical average, typical or &#8216;normal&#8217; child, whatever that means, but for the particular child and having regard to <span style="font-style:italic">that </span>child&#8217;s needs and requirements. Where, as with D, the child has needs over and above those of other children of his age, then what is &#8216;good enough&#8217; for him may well require a greater level of input. D, in my judgment, plainly will. That is the point, and that is what is relevant, and in this case highly relevant. The descriptive label is merely that, a convenient form of professional shorthand. I make clear that in coming to this conclusion and in expressing myself in this way I have very much had in mind and taken into account Ms Fottrell&#8217;s submissions.</p>

He would, she said, need &#8220;extra support&#8221; from carers with some expertise in working with such a child.

Her assessment was clear: D&#8217;s needs would not be met to an adequate standard if placed with the parents, the support that Mr and Mrs P would realistically be able to provide would not be sufficient to enable him to live at home, and potentially D might end up beyond parental control (paragraph 61); whilst D and his parents had been supported he nevertheless had suffered and was at risk of suffering significant harm and, even with continued support, it was likely that he will continue to suffer significant harm if placed back in their care &#8211; so, returning D to his parents care is not, in MB&#8217;s view, a viable option (paragraph 62); and even the high level of proposed support would not meet her concerns (paragraph 64). She added that D had found the high level of support previously provided &#8220;confusing&#8221; as so many people were involved and this had impacted on his ability to form attachments (paragraph 64). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Randall was similarly bleak in her assessment: D was being negatively affected by the inability of his parents to meet his needs and, despite considerable daily professional support, his well being was becoming compromised and his development was falling behind (paragraph 75); the patterns of their past parenting, the individual difficulties of each parent, and the lack of change in their style of parenting made it too risky to recommend that either parent could care for D (paragraph 76); the support the parents will require to ensure D is properly parented would be &#8220;immense&#8221; and it is unrealistic to imagine that the necessary support would be available over the very long period of time involved (paragraph 76); support at the required level would not provide D with the significant primary attachment he needs, it would mean that others, rather than the parents, would in reality be caring for him, and the parents would struggle to accept and work with those providing the care (paragraph 80); in summary, neither parent has the ability to acquire and develop the necessary parenting skills or make the necessary changes to meet D&#8217;s developmental needs and well being either in the immediate or in the long-term future (paragraph 81). In her oral evidence she described the mother as resisting help and advice, struggling to absorb what she was being told and not able to learn (paragraph 82).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The guardian&#8217;s view was to very much the same effect: the mother continues to struggle to manage D&#8217;s practical and emotional needs and needs to be supported and encouraged at all times (paragraph 94); neither parent should be given responsibility for D without being accompanied by a responsible adult or a professional worker; parental capacity appears to have remained static if not diminished (paragraph 95); the mother struggles to manage some of D&#8217;s practical needs and to demonstrate consistent emotional warmth to D and finds his behaviour difficult to manage; and the parents have been unable to adapt and keep up with D&#8217;s changing care needs, the mother&#8217;s limited ability to do this being of critical concern (paragraph 96). She added that the mother may have reached her limit (paragraph 97). She was clear in her overall evaluation: she said that she was &#8220;absolutely clear&#8221; that D&#8217;s care needs are not able to be met by the parents, or by the mother on her own; that they would not be able to look after D unless a responsible adult was with them at all times; and the support Mr and Mrs P could provide &#8220;would not be the 24/7 wrap around support that these parents would need&#8221; (paragraph 98). If that level of support was provided, she would question who was looking after D; while he was still at home, the family were receiving so much support that D was being looked after by others for increasing amounts of each day: &#8220;This may have assisted his parents but will not have met D&#8217;s emotional needs&#8221; (paragraph 99).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proper approach in these circumstances is that mapped out by Gillen J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G and A</span>. The concept of &#8220;parenting with support&#8221; is crucial. As Ms Morgan and Ms Sprinz correctly submit, parents must, in principle, be supported and provided with the assistance that, because of their particular deficits, they need in order to be able to care for their child. As Ms Fottrell put it, the <span style="font-style:italic">positive</span> obligation on the State under Article 8 imposes a broad obligation on the local authority in a case such as this to provide such support as will enable the child to remain with his parents. This principle is not challenged by the local authority in the present case, nor does the local authority seek either to toll the bell of scarce resources or to argue that there are others with even more pressing claims than D and his parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In response, the local authority and the guardian make three essential points, with each of which I am, sadly, at the end of the day, driven to agree:</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The first is that the proposed package will simply not work, is simply not sustainable for as long as it would have to be maintained in place to meet D&#8217;s needs. Despite the best intentions of the parents, they have, the mother in particular, great difficulty in accepting guidance, advice or support when it does not fit in with their own views. The experience of what happened between November 2013 and March 2014 is, unhappily, an all too likely predictor of what will happen again. I am driven to conclude that the parents &#8211; through absolutely no fault of their own &#8211; will simply not be able to maintain over the &#8216;long haul&#8217; the effective working partnership with the support team which is essential if the package is not to collapse.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The second is that, even if the package can somehow be maintained, the gap between what the parents can offer D and what he needs is very large indeed and, sadly, in my judgment, simply too large to be capable of being bridged by even the most extensive support package. I refer, without further citation, to what I have already set out (paragraphs 145-149). I am driven to this conclusion after the most careful consideration of all the evidence, including, of course, the important evidence of Mrs P, which points in the other direction.</p>

His parenting would, in reality, become parenting by his professional and other carers, rather than by his parents, with all the adverse consequences for his emotional development and future welfare identified by MB, by Ms Randall and by the guardian.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to this last point I must, of course, address the powerful and perceptive submissions of Ms Morgan and Ms Sprinz (paragraphs 116-119). There is much in what they say with which I agree. And in many cases their analysis would indeed point in the direction to which they would have me go. But at the end of the day the outcome will always be case specific, dependent upon the particular, and often, as here, unusual, facts of the particular case. In the present case there are, in essence, two reasons why on this point I am unable to follow Ms Morgan and Ms Sprinz. The first is that this is only one of three quite separate reasons why, as I have said, no sustainable and effective package can be devised &#8211; so this particular point is not, in fact, decisive. The second reason flows from their submission (paragraph 116) that what matters is that the child has a clear and secure knowledge of who his parents are. But that, in the light of what MB, Ms Randall and the guardian have all told me, would at best be very questionable here.</p>

I am satisfied that &#8216;nothing else will do&#8217;; that D&#8217;s welfare throughout his life requires that he be adopted; and that his parents&#8217; very understandable refusal to consent to his adoption must be dispensed with. I make clear that in coming to these conclusions I have had very much in mind what has been said by Ms Morgan and Ms Sprinz about the risk that D may not be adopted (paragraph 121).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The answer, in my judgment, is to be found in a telling phrase used by the guardian and a question posed by Ms Fottrell. As long ago as November 2012 the guardian had described the local authority&#8217;s plan as &#8220;courageous&#8221;. The sad reality is that it turned out to be too courageous. Ms Fottrell, as we have seen, posed the question of whether the reason D was removed in March 2014 was because the necessary support had not been provided by the local authority or because the local authority&#8217;s expectations of the parents had turned out to be unrealistic. In my judgment it was the latter. Despite the very intensive support provided by the local authority, it gradually became apparent, contrary to everyone&#8217;s hopes and expectations, that the parents were not able to manage. Matters came to a head in March 2014 when, in effect, if one wants to put it this way, MB admitted defeat and realised that her, and her colleagues&#8217;, hopes and expectations were not going to be, in reality could not be, achieved. </p>

They are not to be criticised. It is not in any sense their fault. They have struggled against great odds to be, as they would want to be, the best possible parents for D. But ultimately it has proved too much for them. Their own difficulties are simply too great. My heart goes out to them. </p>

Criticism has been made, as we have seen, of the local authority&#8217;s failure to disclose to Judge Marshall some of the materials relating to the local authority&#8217;s decision-making between January and March 2014, of the way in which, it is said, the parents were simply presented with a <span style="font-style:italic">fait accompli</span> on 19 March 2014, and of the local authority&#8217;s failure to implement the seven-point plan agreed on 3 February 2014. It is submitted that this involved breaches of the parents&#8217; and D&#8217;s rights under Article 8. Applying the relevant principles to which I have already referred, and assessing matters overall, I do not agree. The local authority can, to the extent I have previously indicated, properly be criticised in certain respects, but that does not mean that Article 8, though undoubtedly engaged, has actually been breached: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Care: Assessment: Fair Trial)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2002/1379" uk:canonical="[2002] EWHC 1379 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWHC 1379 (Fam)</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 2 FLR 730" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 2 FLR 730</ref>, paras 129, 240-242.</p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">An increasing number of adults with learning difficulties are becoming parents. The Baring Foundation report records that whilst there are no precise figures on the number of parents with learning difficulties in the population, the most recent statistics come from the First National Survey of Adults with Learning Difficulties in England, where one in fifteen of the adults interviewed had children. Whatever the figure it is generally recognised that their number is steadily rising and that they represent a sizable population whose special needs require to be adequately addressed. The Baring Foundation report refers to national policy in England and Scotland committing government to &#8220;supporting parents with learning disabilities in order to help them, wherever possible, to ensure their children gain maximum life chance benefits.&#8221; Nonetheless the courts must be aware that surveys show that parents with learning disabilities are apparently more likely than other parents to have their children removed them and permanently placed outside the family home. In multidisciplinary jurisdiction such as the Family Division, it is important that the court is aware of such reports at least for the purposes of comment. It is important to appreciate these currents because the Children Order (Northern Ireland) 1995 places an emphasis on supporting the family so that children can remain with them and obligations under disability discrimination legislation make public services accessible to disabled people (including parents with learning difficulties). Moreover the advent of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> plays an important role in highlighting the need to ensure the rights of such parents under Articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (&#8220;the Convention&#8221;). </p>

Government policy emphasises the importance of people with a learning disability being supported to be fully engaged playing a role in civic society and their ability to exercise their rights and responsibilities needs to be strengthened. They are valued citizens and must be enabled to use mainstream services and be fully included in the life of the community as far as possible. The courts must reflect this and recognise their need for individual support and the necessity to remove barriers to inclusion that create disadvantage and discrimination. To that extent courts must take all steps possible to ensure that people with a learning disability are able to actively participate in decisions affecting their lives. They must be supported in ways that take account of their individual needs and to help them to be as independent as possible. </p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">It is important that a court approaches these cases with a recognition of the possible barriers to the provision of appropriate support to parents including negative or stereotypical attitudes about parents with learning difficulties possibly on the part of staff in some Trusts or services. An extract from the Baring Foundation report provides a cautionary warning:</p>
	    </blockContainer>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;For example, it was felt that some staff in services whose primary focus was not learning difficulties (eg in children and family teams) did not fully understand the impact of having learning difficulties on individual parents&#8217; lives; had fixed ideas about what would happen to the children of parents with learning difficulties and wanted an outcome that did not involve any risks (which might mean them being placed away from their family); expected parents with learning difficulties to be &#8216;perfect parents&#8217; and had extremely high expectations of them. Different professionals often had different concepts of parenting against which parents were assessed. Parents&#8217; disengagement with services, because they felt that staff had a negative view of them and &#8216;wanted to take their children away&#8217; was also an issue, as were referrals to support services which were too late to be of optimum use to the family &#8211; often because workers lacked awareness of parents&#8217; learning difficulties or because parents had not previously been known to services&#8221;.</p>
	    <blockContainer>
	      <num>(4)</num>
	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">This court fully accepts that parents with learning difficulties can often be &#8220;good enough&#8221; parents when provided with the ongoing emotional and practical support they need. The concept of &#8220;parenting with support&#8221; must underpin the way in which the courts and professionals approach wherever possible parents with learning difficulties. The extended family can be a valuable source of support to parents and their children and the courts must anxiously scrutinize the possibilities of assistance from the extended family. Moreover the court must also view multi-agency working as critical if parents are to be supported effectively. Courts should carefully examine the approach of Trusts to ensure this is being done in appropriate cases. In particular judges must make absolutely certain that parents with learning difficulties are not at risk of having their parental responsibilities terminated on the basis of evidence that would not hold up against normal parents. Their competences must not be judged against stricter criteria or harsher standards than other parents. Courts must be acutely aware of the distinction between direct and indirect discrimination and how this might be relevant to the treatment of parents with learning difficulties in care proceedings. In particular careful consideration must be given to the assessment phase by a Trust and in the application of the threshold test. </p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Parents must be advised by social workers about their legal rights, where to obtain advice, how to find a solicitor and what help might be available to them once a decision has been taken to pursue a care application. Too narrow a focus must not be placed exclusively on the child&#8217;s welfare with an accompanying failure to address parents&#8217; needs arising from their disability which might impact adversely on their parenting capacity. Parents with learning disabilities should be advised of the possibility of using an advocate during their case eg from the Trust itself or from Mencap and clear explanations and easy to understand information about the process and the roles of the different professionals involved must be disclosed to them periodically. Written information should be provided to such parents to enable them to consider these matters at leisure and with their advocate or advisers. Moreover Trusts should give careful consideration to providing child protection training to staff working in services for adults with learning disabilities. Similarly those in children&#8217;s services need training about adults with learning disabilities. In other words there is a strong case to be made for new guidelines to be drawn up for such services working together with a joint training programme. I endorse entirely the views of the Guardian ad Litem in this case when she responded to the &#8220;Finding the Right Support&#8221; paper by stating:</p>
	    </blockContainer>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;As far as I am aware there are no &#8216;family teams&#8217; in the Trusts designated to support parents with a learning disability. In my opinion this would be a positive development. The research also suggests that a learning disability specialist could be designated to work within family and childcare teams and a child protection specialist could be designated to work within learning disability teams. If such professionals were to be placed in the Trusts in Northern Ireland they could be involved in drawing up a protocol for joint working, developing guidelines, developing expertise in research, awareness of resources and stimulating positive practice. They could also assist in developing a province-wide forum that could build links between the Trusts, the voluntary sector and the national and international learning disability community.&#8221; </p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The court must also take steps to ensure there are no barriers to justice within the process itself. Judges and magistrates must recognise that parents with learning disabilities need extra time with solicitors so that everything can be carefully explained to them. Advocates can play a vital role in supporting parents with learning difficulties particularly when they are involved in child protection or judicial processes. In the current case, the court periodically stopped (approximately after each hour), to allow the Mencap representative to explain to the parents what was happening and to ensure that an appropriate attention span was not being exceeded. The process necessarily has to be slowed down to give such parents a better chance to understand and participate. This approach should be echoed throughout the whole system including LAC reviews. All parts of the Family justice system should take care as to the language and vocabulary that is utilised. In this case I was concerned that some of the letters written by the Trust may not have been understood by these parents although it was clear to me that exhortations had been given to the parents to obtain the assistance of their solicitors (which in fact was done). In terms therefore the courts must be careful to ensure that the supposed inability of parents to change might itself be an artefact of professionals ineffectiveness in engaging with the parents in appropriate terms. Courts must not rush to judge, but must gather all the evidence within a reasonable time before making a determination. Steps must be taken to ensure that parents have a meaningful and informed access to reports, time to discuss the reports and an opportunity to put forward their own views. Not only should the hearing involve special measures, including a break in sessions, but it might also include permission that parents need not enter the court until they are required if they so wish. Moreover the judges should be scrupulous to ensure that an opportunity is given to parents with learning disabilities to indicate to the court that something is occurring which is beyond their comprehension and that measures must be taken to deal with that. Steps should also be taken throughout the process to ensure that parents with learning disabilities are not overwhelmed by unnecessarily large numbers of persons being present at meetings or hearings.</p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Children of parents with learning difficulties often do not enter the child protection system as the result of abuse by their parents. More regularly the prevailing concerns centre on a perceived risk of neglect, both as the result of the parents' intellectual impairments, and the impact of the social and economic deprivation commonly faced by adults with learning difficulties. It is in this context that a shift must be made from the old assumption that adults with learning difficulties could not parent to a process of questioning why appropriate levels of support are not provided to them so that they can parent successfully and why their children should often be taken into care. At its simplest, this means a court carefully inquiring as to what support is needed to enable parents to show whether or not they can become good enough parents rather than automatically assuming that they are destined to fail. The concept of &#8220;parenting with support&#8221; must move from the margins to the mainstream in court determinations.</p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Courts must ensure that careful consideration is given to ensuring that any decision or judgment is fully explained to such parents. In this case I caused a copy of the judgment to be provided to the parties at least one day before I handed it down to facilitate it being explained in detail before the attendance at court where confusion and consternation could be caused by a lengthy judgment being read which the parents could not follow at the time.&#8221;</p>
