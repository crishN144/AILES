They had become engaged the previous year, in April 2000, and during the Summer of that year they looked for a property to become their future matrimonial home. In July 2000 they discovered Brooklands Farm ("Brooklands"). They viewed it and decided they wanted to live there as their home. The property was purchased by a company called WP Ltd, a Bahamian company, all the shares in which are owned by a Guernsey trust called the F Trust.</p>

A, their one son, was born on 13 November 2003. Sadly the marriage became unhappy and the Wife presented a petition on 20 May 2004. Her Form A is dated 5 July 2004. It seeks a property adjustment order but not in respect of the matrimonial home, The Wife vacated Brooklands on 19 December 2004.</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">That is an assertion which if correct, has potentially far reaching implications both for the determination of this case and, I suspect many others. So, the point having been raised, the Deputy District Judge, quite rightly, determined that such an issue should be discreetly resolved in the High Court prior to the application to vary proceeding further. Accordingly by order of 2 June 2005:</p>

The Wife, the Husband and the Trustees all filed statements dealing with their knowledge of and the circumstances leading to the purchase of 'Brooklands'. The Trustees also provided documents and information relating to the creation of a short-hold tenancy between the Husband, the Wife and the Trustees. I have not heard any oral evidence. Apart from one file of documents containing the statements and documents to which I have referred, the hearing was confined to argument by counsel who had each filed skeleton arguments on behalf of their respective clients.</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The Wife maintains that looking at all the circumstances surrounding the purchase of Brooklands the property is held by the Trustees of the F settlement on the terms of an anti-nuptial settlement capable of variation by the court. Both the Husband and the Trustees resist that interpretation. Whilst they accept that the purchase of a matrimonial home might in some circumstances constitute an anti nuptial or post nuptial settlement, in this case, they maintain, the terms under or by which the Husband and Wife occupied 'Brooklands' were no more than as tenants of the Trustees pursuant to an assured short-hold tenancy. That tenancy agreement was eventually reduced to writing and signed on 25 March 2004, some 2 months before the Wife presented a petition for divorce. That is, essentially, the issue between the parties.</p>

From paragraph 28 onwards of that statement it can be seen that for the following 3 years discussions took place about the terms of the tenancy and the rent which should be payable. It was a painfully slow process which culminated finally, in two tenancy agreements being signed on 25 March 2004.</p>

That exhibit shows that throughout the entire period of the alleged tenancy some &#163;50,926 was apparently paid as rent leaving arrears, at the time when possession proceedings were begun in June 2005, of some &#163;63,599 i.e. rather more than half the rent was outstanding.</p>

However, that it is not in any way to be critical of the Trustees. The main purpose of establishing the tenancy was to provide, as I understand it, comfort to the mortgagees who required a proper legal arrangement to ensure that the interest on the bank loan was met in a secure and timely way. In fact the trustees, until comparatively recently, had sufficient other resources (also originating from the Husband) to defray the mortgage repayments so one way or another there was no special urgency so far as the trustees position was concerned.</p>

	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">"The F Trust was created by a trust deed dated 19 January 1989 and executed by Mr F of... Sark as its settlor. Mr F acted as a 'straw man' in creating the settlement on behalf of either Mr R or Mrs R and a life tenancy was created in favour of Mrs R. On the death of Mrs R in July 1998 small payments (&#163;2000 each) were made to Mrs R's two daughters... in satisfaction of their entitlements as beneficiaries. The remaining beneficiaries were Mrs W' s children and Mrs L's son, AN. The W children decided that they would like to receive benefit immediately by way of distribution of part of the trust fund, and each was paid one third of the remainder (approximately &#163;30,500 each) in September 1998. The Trustee of the F Trust wrote to AN on 30 July 1998 to explain to him the financial consequences of his grandmother's death and also the options of receiving immediate benefit or of retaining the trust structure. The W's were Guernsey resident and for them the continuation of an interest in the Trust would have conveyed no tax advantage but would have incurred on going management costs. In AN's case he was UK resident for tax purposes but non-domiciled. There were, therefore, potentially significant advantages in retaining the trust structure and after due consideration the Trustee resolved that the Trust should continue. As such the remaining funds are held on a discretionary basis. He then made a request that the Trustee invest the sum of &#163;28,500 in the purchase of shares in AN &amp; Co. Ltd. After due consideration, the Trustee complied with this request. Since that time the trust fund has basically been illiquid.</p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">The payment of the distributions to the other beneficiaries effectively ended their interests in the trust fund, and the Trustee although understanding that his children would ultimately benefit in the event of his death became concerned to have clear instructions from Mr N as to his wishes with regard to how the trust fund should be dealt with in the event of his death or incapacity."</p>

It was agreed that Y Ltd should investigate the possibility of acquiring this through an off-shore vehicle and of obtaining funding from Ansbaka Bank in Germany.

If it is, it is a settlement on the parties within the meaning of the section. The particular form of it does not matter. It may be a settlement in the strict sense of the term, it may be a covenant to pay by one spouse to the other, or by a third person to a spouse. What does matter is that it should provide for the financial benefit of one or other or both of the spouses as spouses and with reference to their married state."</p>

Certain indicia of the type of disposition with which the section is concerned can be identified reasonably easily. The section is concerned with a settlement 'made on the parties to the marriage'. So, broadly stated, the disposition must be one which makes some form of continuing provision for both or either of the parties to a marriage with or without provision for their children."</p>

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">"Beyond this the authorities have consistently given a wide meaning to settlement in this context and they have spelt out no precise limitations. This seems right because this approach accords with the purpose of the statutory provision. Financial provision that is appropriate so long as the parties are married will often cease to be appropriate when the marriage ends. In order to promote the best interests of the parties and their children in a fundamentally changed situation, it is desirable that the Court should have power to alter the terms of the settlement. The purpose of the section is to give the Court this power. This object does not dictate that settlement should be given a narrow meaning. On the contrary the purpose of the section would be impeded, rather than advanced by confining its scope. The continuing use of the archaic expressions 'antinuptial' and 'post-nuptial' does not point in the opposite direction. These expressions are apt to embrace all settlements in respect of the particular marriage whether made before or after the marriage."</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The wife's case is advanced in the skeleton argument of her counsel. In essence it is that Brooklands was bought in contemplation of marriage and by its purchase a licence to occupy it as their matrimonial home indefinitely was settled on the husband and wife. The fact that at some stage a tenancy may have been created for rent did not alter the fundamental relationship of trustee and beneficiary which pre-existed it and continued on after it came to an end. Accordingly an anti nuptial settlement within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S24</ref> was created and so can now be the subject of variation by the Court.</p>

Once that had been created, they assert, the relationship between themselves became one purely of landlord and tenant. The tenancy overrules the underlying trustee &#8212; beneficiary relationship. The fact that the details and terms of the tenancy were not assiduously negotiated or enforced is neither here nor there; all the necessary indicia of such an arrangement were in place throughout. They point to the extensive negotiations which went on over the period when the parties were in occupation relating to the terms of the tenancy. In particular, the Trustee asserts that so far as they were concerned they considered the Husband and Wife no more than tenants. I do not do justice to the careful arguments advanced by the Husband and the Trustee both in written form and orally. However that is the thrust of the point which they make.</p>

I have already indicated that the intervention of the rental arrangement or tenancy agreement was more form than substance created, as I understand it, largely to satisfy the requirements of the lending house who provided the mortgage.

As I see it, the settlement stood behind that tenancy which, in a sense, was only a part of the terms of the settlement.</p>
