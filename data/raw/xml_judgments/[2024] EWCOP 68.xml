If the treatment is not in his best interests, the court will not be able to give its consent on his behalf and it will follow that it will be lawful to withhold or withdraw it. Indeed, it will follow that it will not be lawful to give it.

	      <p class="paragraph" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.03in">The doctors and nurses have been caring for XY for six months in the intensive care unit.  They have ensured that she is fed and medicated appropriately, that her tongue is protected by a specially made mouthguard.  They have turned her regularly to the extent that she has no pressure sores.  They have clearly welcomed the family&#8217;s involvement and kept them informed of their plans with regular meetings.</p>

She has had six months when she might have improved or recovered to an extent, but has not.  I have pondered long and hard about the wishes of the family and friends for XY to have more time.  I have given weight to their views.   I have attempted also to put myself in XY&#8217;s place in this tragic situation.  </p>

The futility of continuing further treatment and the increasing deterioration of XY&#8217;s brain outweigh the family&#8217;s views and what they consider might have been XY&#8217;s views in the circumstances. </p>
