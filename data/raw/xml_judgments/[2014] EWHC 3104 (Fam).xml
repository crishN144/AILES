In March 2014, at a time when she was either unable or unwilling to seek a divorce, the wife issued proceedings under the Married Women&#8217;s Property Act 1882, and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>, in relation to the legal or beneficial ownership of certain properties and her right to occupy a flat in Northern London.  The husband has countered by a claim for possession of the flat in question.   (He may not be the legal owner but is the effective claimant.)</span></p>

The wife was initially uncertain as to the effect and validity of that procedure in Saudi Arabia, but after taking advice she has accepted that she became, and now is, validly divorced from her husband.  This, of course, had the immediate effect that it was no longer open to her in any event to seek a divorce here or anywhere else world-wide.  So she issued an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13</ref> of Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> for leave or permission to apply for financial relief after an overseas divorce pursuant to the provisions of that Part.  Leave was granted at a without notice hearing by Sir Peter Singer, sitting as a judge of the High Court.</span></p>

Those dates were a pre-trial review with one hour allowed on Monday, 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2014, and a four day final hearing fixed to start on Tuesday, 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2014.  As he was, and is, fully entitled to do, the husband has issued an application to set aside the grant of leave or permission by Sir Peter Singer.  That application now requires to be heard at an on notice hearing, which is currently listed to be heard on 26 November 2014, when a judge will decide whether or not the grant of leave or permission should be set aside.  If it is set aside then, subject to any further appeal, the wife&#8217;s claim under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref> will of course reach a dead end.  If the grant of leave or permission is not set aside, then the court requires to consider sooner or later not only the wife&#8217;s claims under the Married Women&#8217;s Property Act 1882 and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>, and the husband&#8217;s cross-claim for possession of the flat, but also exercise of the discretionary powers of the court under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>.</span></p>

The whole order may, of course, be considered by anybody with a proper interest in this matter, but I can mention in summary form the material parts of it.  Paragraph 18(b) required the wife to file and serve points of claim and other material in relation to her applications under the Married Women&#8217;s Property Act 1882 and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>, by 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2014.

The first limb of the application to strike out is based on the fact, as is admitted, that the wife was two days late in filing her points of claim, and one-and-a-half days late in filing her reply.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The case and argument of the husband was very fully set out in a skeleton argument prepared for today by his leading counsel, Mr Tim Amos QC, dated 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2014, and is, as one would expect, robustly argued.  In fact it is not possible to say in relation to the supply of answers to the questionnaire that there has been any failure to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order since, as I have already explained, the court order did not itself fix any timetable within which the questionnaire should be answered.  The highest that it can be put in this case is that the wife supplied her answers later than the date that she had agreed to do so in inter-solicitor correspondence.  There has, of course, been a failure to comply with a court order in relation to filing and service of the points of claim and of the reply.  As I have indicated, the first failure was one of two days, and the second one of one-and-a-half days.  These parties were married (in fact twice, for they divorced and re-married) for around 33 years.  The mother bore two children, although sadly one of them later died.  She is currently resident in a very valuable property in North London.  It is said (although I do not have the slightest idea as to the truth of the matter) that her husband is a wealthy man.  He is now aged 89; she is aged 63.  Subject to the success or otherwise of the husband&#8217;s application to set aside the grant of leave or permission to apply for financial remedies under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>, her other claims are effectively her only remedies for seeking to establish her financial position for many years to come.  It would, frankly, be utterly disproportionate and unjust to strike those claims out on the basis of aggregate slippage of three-and-a-half days. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I turn now to the later application that was issued by the wife.  This also was strenuously resisted by the husband through Mr Amos&#8217; skeleton argument to which I have referred.  It seemed to me, frankly, obvious when I looked at these papers this morning that there was everything to commend the course proposed by the wife in her application notice.  As I understood the written argument of Mr Amos, it was that chronologically, and also logically, the wife&#8217;s claims under the Married Women&#8217;s Property Act 1882 should be considered first, the argument being that it is necessary first to determine what assets do or do not belong to one or the other party.  For many, many years, however, the approach in the matrimonial courts has been that it is wasteful of time and resources to consider separately and discretely matters of ownership when there is before the court an all embracing claim for the exercise of discretionary powers.  I absolutely understand Mr Amos&#8217; point that unless and until the court has heard and adjudicated upon the husband&#8217;s application to set aside the grant of leave or permission to apply under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>, there is no way of knowing whether the wife&#8217;s claim for discretionary relief will, in the end, subsist and be effective.  To my mind that is all the more reason why it is essential to have as early a resolution as possible of the question whether or not the grant by Sir Peter Singer of leave or permission to apply should be set aside.  Further, it is an obvious application of the overriding objective in the rules that all these issues should be corralled together and dealt with as early as possible with as few hearings as possible.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I stress again the ages of these parties and the duration of their marriage.  I sincerely wish a long life and every good fortune to the husband.  I have no evidence whatsoever as to his health or well being, but it is a fact that he is aged 89, and it is only human nature that a person of 89 may be vulnerable to death or ill health.   It is, therefore, of a special importance in this case that all these issues between these parties should be heard as soon as practicably possible.  This is not the sort of case which can wallow or luxuriate in a delay of a year or more whilst procedures wend their weary way.  Further, the husband himself has made very clear in his documents that he badly wishes to be able to sell the flat in North London in which the wife is currently residing.  As I understand it, he feels, amongst other matters, that it may diminish in value, and in any event he is anxious to discharge a large mortgage upon it.  So it is objectively very much in the interests of both these parties that all issues between them are brought to a head and a speedy resolution.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I made all these suggestions to the advocates at a very early stage at the outset of this hearing.  I have made enquiries of the Clerk of the Rules during the course of the day.  I have established that the hearing that was fixed on Monday, 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September as a pre-trial review for one hour can in fact be enlarged to an entire day with nothing else at all listed before the identified judge.   Mr Amos strongly submitted that he did not wish his application for</span><br/><span style="font-size:14pt">a set aside to be squeezed for want of time, nor proper consideration of directions in the various sets of proceedings to be squeezed for want of time.  But even Mr Amos accepted that if one full day is allowed and made available, that should be ample both for full, fair and just consideration of the application to set aside the grant of leave or permission, and also consideration of all necessary directions in all proceedings that then remain after the court has considered whether or not to set aside the grant of leave or permission.  It seems to me, therefore, that there is absolutely no downside to either party, and every possible advantage to both parties (and also to other litigants and court time generally) if the issue whether or not the grant of leave or permission should be set aside is advanced from the hearing currently fixed for</span><br/><span style="font-size:14pt">26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2014 to 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2014.

I have also been able to arrange with the Clerk of the Rules today that the four day hearing that had been fixed to start on Tuesday, 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2014 can in fact be enlarged or expanded to a seven day hearing beginning on Monday, 10</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2014 and ending on Tuesday, 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2014.  No party has suggested that seven days will not be ample time for the court fully and fairly to consider all issues between these parties including discretionary relief under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref> in the event that the husband&#8217;s application to set aside the grant of leave or permission is not successful.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt"> I have made crystal clear to Mrs. Carew Pole, who appears on behalf of the wife today, that I fix that very rapid timetable for the overall advantage of the wife as well, of course, as of the husband.  It is enormously to her advantage, bearing in mind in particular the age of her husband, that all these issues are very rapidly resolved.  The alternative, if the existing timetable had remained, would be some final hearing date of her application under Part III, if it survives, many months hence during 2015.  It would also necessarily involve  two separate lengthy hearings, both in November 2014 and again sometime in 2015.  So there is the enormous advantage to her of speed and of course reduction in costs.  There is an advantage to the public in that one seven day hearing will be required rather than two lengthy hearings.</span></p>

I have made quite clear to Mrs Carew Pole today, in the presence and hearing of her client, that now that this accelerated timetable has been fixed it must be adhered to.  If that involves compromise by her and her advisors on the degree of enquiry, they must accept that compromise as the price of the greater advantage of an accelerated global hearing.</span></p>
