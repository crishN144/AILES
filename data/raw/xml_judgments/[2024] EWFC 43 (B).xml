D filed an initial report dated 25 April 2023 and answers to questions on 12 June 2023. F&#8217;s evidence has not been challenged by any of the parties; she has not attended court to give oral evidence. D summarises her conclusions by saying that the mother described to her the history of adverse and traumatic childhood experiences which she says are likely to be predisposed to psychological and interpersonal difficulties. It is reported that the mother has described development within a frightening and unpredictable environment due to high expressed parental emotion, exposure to domestic violence and sexual abuse, characteristics of insecure attachment with her mother, low self-worth associated with her physical health condition and internalising blame and responsibility for abusive parental interactions. In D&#8217;s opinion the mother&#8217;s pattern of difficulties and symptoms are consistent with complex post-traumatic stress disorder which is developed due to cumulative traumatic experiences occurring within relationships during childhood. The mother&#8217;s medical records indicate that her difficulties have historically been understood within the context of an emotionally unstable personality disorder. D is of the opinion that the mother is susceptible to forming future unhealthy relationship patterns and re-engaging in previous relationships.</span></p>

However, the nature of her difficulties is complex and enduring. This is indicated by the fact that despite multiple therapeutic and medical interventions the mother continues to experience significant difficulties in emotional regulation, trauma symptoms and her relationship with food. D says that whilst the mother may be motivated to change, emotional stresses and triggers are likely to continue to impact upon her level of emotional stability.</span></p>

It is D&#8217;s view that processing of multiple traumatic experiences underlying the mother&#8217;s psychological difficulties may provide an alternative therapeutic approach. D goes on to recommend that the mother is referred to step four mental health services who she says are able to work with individuals with complex psychological and mental health needs and to offer trauma focused intervention such as eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy (EMDR) as well as a psychiatric medication review.</span></p>

The independent social worker has been criticised within the final hearing for not spending sufficient time with the mother to assess her properly and for not visiting the mother when she carried out her addendum assessment. The court does not agree with these criticisms. It is the court&#8217;s view that F to her credit, focused very quickly on the key issues of this case and highlighted the need to address these before the mother&#8217;s parenting ability could properly be assessed.

The dilemma for the mother is that if she does not receive the therapy that she so clearly needs her ability to care for A will be significantly compromised. If the mother does receive the therapy, her abilities to care will similarly be compromised because she will be undergoing a major piece of work designed to help people relive the trauma and reprocess its effect on them to enable them to overcome the symptoms of PTSD. The advantage of course would be that A would be able to be brought up for some time at least by his mother with all the benefits that brings. This is not a small advantage in this case because not only does the mother have all the basic skills to care for A she is completely devoted to him and has demonstrated to anybody who has witnessed her care the highest level of understanding and empathy.</span></p>

All the evidence shows that this contact has been an excellent standard and that A has continued to enjoy the contact very much. The local authority&#8217;s position is that contact should be reduced to once a week. I endorse Miss Miles submission that the case of the local authority lacks analysis. The Guardian supports the local authority on the basis that the current level of contact will probably lead to instability in the placement. The Guardian emphasises the difficult relationship between the mother and the grandparents and the fact that as A grows older there will be more calls on his time. Further the Guardian&#8217;s concern that once the mother starts therapy the quality of contact may suffer for the reasons set out above supporting her lack of endorsement for return of A to the mother&#8217;s care.</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s precise requirements for therapy have not been finally determined and its provision is uncertain. In the event that the local authority seeks to reduce contact during therapy I would expect it to firstly obtain a formal opinion from either D or the therapy provider as to the efficacy of contact continuing at the current rate and as part of the opinion to ask how the local authority might increase its level of support to ensure the contact is safe for A. In my original draft (as circulated to counsel), I indicated that the final order would incorporate a provision for contact taking place three times each week.</span></p>
