	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with an application issued on 11 July 2023, made by the applicant father (&#8220;F&#8221;) pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> for a summary return order under the 1980 Hague Convention. The application concerns P (aged 11) and Q (aged 9) whom F asserts have been wrongfully removed from the USA by the mother (&#8220;M&#8221;), in breach of his rights of custody. F attended this hearing remotely from the USA. </p>

It has not been possible to piece together the background history with any degree of clarity. Ms Guha KC and Ms Geddes on behalf of F have challenged the chronology provided by M and produced a lengthy, detailed schedule to discredit or highlight inconsistencies in almost all of the factual assertions made by M. Likewise, Mr Setright KC and Ms Gasparro, on behalf of M, have identified numerous inconsistencies in F's evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the Guardian, in his written submissions, Mr Gration KC suggested that the court might wish to hear oral evidence from each parent to resolve key disputed factual issues. Having regard to the rarity with which the court will accede to applications to permit oral evidence given the summary nature of these proceedings, I invited further submissions. No party sought to call M or F and I did not consider it necessary for either to give oral evidence. I have however, heard oral evidence, as directed by Cusworth J, from the Guardian, Ms Odze and the single joint expert, Mr Richard Harris, an attorney practising in Colorado, who attended remotely over two days.</p>

I shall refer to the key evidence as I see it below. I emphasise at the outset that if I have not referred to something in this judgment, that does not mean I have not considered it. Similarly, I was referred to a significant number of authorities in written and oral submissions by the parties, which I have considered, but it is not necessary for me to refer to each and every one.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given the extensive amount of disputed facts, it has been necessary to recount the history and evidence in some detail. F was born in Bolivia in February 1985, is now 39 years old and works as a truck driver. He has both Bolivian and US citizenship. M was born in Dubai in November 1982 according to her medical records, (the same date as in a Bangladeshi passport produced by F, which M claims is a forgery, denying any connection with Bangladesh). M is 41 years old. She is a US citizen but arrived in England in September 2020. Her current immigration status is that she has leave to remain in the UK with P and Q until September 2026, after which she intends to apply for indefinite leave to remain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties do not agree the circumstances of where, when and how they met. M asserts that the parties met whilst she was a minor, in Dubai, and F was there for business. However, F would also have been a minor at that time. M says she agreed to travel to Bolivia with F, and did so, apparently using a travel document permitting her to travel across Emirate States, if accompanied by adults.</p>

M denies this and does not accept the documentation is genuine, although in the American Bundle she is recorded as having told the Colorado Police in August 2020 that she had been married in London in 2010 in a mosque.

F says that they were also married in a civil ceremony in Bolivia. M denies this and claims that the copy of the marriage certificate provided by F is also a forgery. Permission was sought by F (and granted by me) to disclose a translation of the certificate into English. The apostilled document states the date of marriage to be 15 February 2012.</p>

She states that they moved to Florida in 2009 whereas F says that M joined him there in August 2012. Their children were born in Florida. M and F agree they lived a relatively peripatetic lifestyle. M says that domestic abuse continued whilst they lived together in the USA and that F was a member of a criminal gang, &#8216;MS-13&#8217; operating in the USA and other countries. The documents disclosed by the FBI show that F was convicted for traffic violations, including knowingly driving without a license, between 2004 and 2006. There is no mention of any gang or drug related convictions. F denies M's allegations and asserts that M has threatened him and made false allegations against him to seek revenge because he wanted to end their marriage. He has produced screenshots of text messages (which M says are not genuine) in which she makes threats to ruin his life and ensure that he is incarcerated.</p>

F was charged with assault and entered a not guilty plea. M, P and Q moved to a refuge in Miami and a &#8216;stay-away order&#8217; was granted by the court on 27 April 2017.</p>

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.74in">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Mother&#8217;s designation of sole decision-making authority likely gave her the right to remove the children&#8230;without the consent of Father. I use the term &#8220;likely&#8221; because no express order was in effect on 9/1/2020 permitting the removal. However, such authority is, in my opinion, presumed when a parent has sole decision-making responsibility. Under the terms of the PPO...Mother was granted both &#8220;care and control&#8221; and &#8220;sole decision-making responsibilities&#8221; of the minor children...&#8221;  </span></p>

Under Colorado law, decision-making responsibilities include the ability to solely decide all &#8220;major&#8221; decisions involving the children&#8217;s upbringing. These decisions typically comprise areas such as the children&#8217;s education, health, and religious upbringing. In my opinion, obtaining a passport is such a &#8220;major&#8221; decision as it might impact where the children might reside. </span></p>

He was given time to consider it (and a copy of the <span style="font-style:italic">Abbott</span> decision) before giving oral evidence. Having done so, he noted that F had been given notice of the PPO hearing and an opportunity to participate, with counsel in attendance on his behalf; and that the MRO granted by the criminal court prohibited contact with P and Q, which meant that even though &#8216;parenting time' had been allocated, there was no violation of F&#8217;s rights by M's removal of P and Q, because the MRO remained effective and the PPO could not override it.</p>

At most, he said parents have an &#8216;equal responsibility&#8217; to work out the details of contact but there is no <span style="font-style:italic">obligation</span> to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Guha asked if F had a general right to prevent removal of P and Q from the USA. Mr Harris stated that whilst F did have such a potential right, a parent would have to file an application to exercise such custody rights or prevent removal, in the District Court, if they had concerns, usually in the context of divorce or separation. When cross examined by Mr Gration as to whether F had a right to veto the removal, Mr Harris told the court that F no longer had a right to prevent removal or make major decisions, including where the children should live. Furthermore, although parenting time or rights of access were &#8216;allocated&#8217; in principle, the effect of the MRO rendered those rights entirely nugatory. Mr Harris confirmed that F retained the <span style="font-style:italic">potential </span>right to vary the PPO, but did not make any application to do so until 2 March 2022.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Guha questioned why such a major decision as a permanent relocation to another country is not specifically referred to in the definition of decision-making responsibility. In his reports, Mr Harris referred to Colorado State law: &#8220;Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 14-10-124 - Best Interests of the child&#8221; which defines <span style="font-style:italic">parental responsibility allocation</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">decision-making responsibility</span> and to the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act which states as follows &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Decision-making authority&#8221; means the power to make major decisions regarding a child, including decisions regarding the child&#8217;s education, religious training, health care, extracurricular activities, and travel</span>.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In oral evidence, Mr Harris agreed with Mr Setright that State law had not intended to provide a comprehensive list of all major decisions. He expressed a personal opinion, that there was a &#8216;gap' or lack of clarity in the legislation but was firm in his answer that under the current law, decision-making responsibility would include an ability to decide to change country of residence even though not expressly referred to in any legal definition of a &#8216;major decision&#8217;. Mr Harris said that a PPO hearing could thus have &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">the ramification of determining relocation and residence, as an unintended effect</span>&#8217;.</p>

Without P and Q being physically present or there being an emergency basis for  exercising the court's jurisdiction, the parties would have to submit an agreement (a stipulation) in order for the Colorado court to act. If a return order were made, under the Uniform Child Abduction Prevention Act, a suite of protective measures and remedies would then be available to M in Colorado. </p>

Mr Harris is licensed to practise law only in Colorado, but explained that the parties could submit a stipulation consenting to the jurisdiction of that &#8216;new' State.

The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) is a uniform state law regarding jurisdiction in child custody cases, which specifies which court should decide a custody case and how the courts exercise jurisdiction, and most States have adopted this. Mirror (protective orders) made are enforceable before returning the child and parent, before they arrive in the jurisdiction.</p>

Ms Odze felt that both children gave authentic accounts, noting that there were evidential inconsistencies and issues which could not be resolved unless there was a fact-finding hearing. She noted that P and Q would have some &#8216;shared lived experiences&#8217; with M who was their sole carer, but in her view, the objections of both P and Q were based on their lived experiences, some of which were corroborated by extrinsic evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Regarding the first stage of the test, I have had the benefit of written reports and hearing extensive oral evidence from Mr Harris, an expert on the domestic law applicable in Colorado at the time of removal. It is agreed that both P and Q were habitually resident in Colorado prior to their removal, so for the purpose of Art.3 of the Hague Convention, the question is whether F had rights of custody which were actually exercised, or would have been but for the removal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered the totality of Mr Harris's evidence, I conclude that F did not have rights of custody under Colorado domestic law at the time of removal. Mr Harris stated that in the absence of the PPO, which conferred on M sole decision-making responsibility for all major decisions, both parents would have had an equal and separate right to make an application to the District Court for custody and to prevent removal. The PPO dated 1 September 2020 granted care and control, but more importantly, sole decision making responsibility to M, and she was entitled to make all major decisions for the children without involving F, including the decision to relocate to the UK. Mr Harris was clear that there was no legal requirement for M to inform F, or the court, in advance of her plan to relocate (even though in his own personal practice, he would advise his clients to do so). Accordingly, F had neither a right to determine their place of residence nor prevent the removal of the children.</p>

F was allocated undefined parenting time, i.e. visitation, in the PPO hearing, but these were extinguished by the operation of the MRO granted by the criminal court that prohibited any contact between F and the children. The effect of the MRO was fully understood by the magistrate at the PPO hearing, (at which F's counsel was in attendance) as can be seen in the transcript. The option to appeal via the District Court was flagged. Mr Harris confirmed that the MRO could not be overridden by the county court dealing with the PPO but there were options open to F regarding the orders. I have seen no evidence that F sought to vary or enforce the order for parenting time with P and Q and F only applied to dismiss the injunction in March 2022. </p>

Even if I were to adopt this approach, it is apparent that P and Q have not settled, not least because they have endured yet further moves (in July and December 2023). Although they may have adjusted to their new environment in recent months, and enjoy some degree of security and stability, essentially P and Q have had to &#8216;start again' in a completely new physical environment which encompasses place, home, school, people, friends, activities and opportunities. Having regard to these factors and the emotional and psychological constituents of settlement, the defence would not have been made out, assuming that I had determined that F had had Convention rights of custody.</p>

Although she could not rule out that P might be influenced by M, Ms Odze&#8217;s view was that P had described her own views based on her own lived experience. Ms Guha challenged Ms Odze on this, suggesting that M had coached P and Q, fabricated the evidence and alienated them from F. Ms Odze did not accept this, referring to the accounts given by P and Q separately to the authorities in June 2020, which confirmed that they had witnessed domestic violence. Ms Odze went further, stating that some &#8216;sharing&#8217; of M's narrative with P and Q is unsurprising given that M has been their sole carer for 3.5 years. The views held by P and Q are embedded and strongly held, regardless of whether they have arisen from a mixture of their own lived experience or shared experiences with M. Nevertheless, they are now their own authentically held beliefs and can only be disentangled by a fact-finding hearing to understand to what extent, if any, M had alienated P and Q from F.

This is particularly concerning where, I am told, P has had recent involvement with mental health services, having previously expressed suicidal ideation.

In any event, it would be impossible to imagine Q returning to the USA alone without acknowledging that would place him in an intolerable situation. All these issues considered together point clearly towards refusing return. I would have reached a clear conclusion, taking the discretion in the round and having regard to all the circumstances, that if F had been able to establish rights of custody, the objection defence for each child would have been established and neither should be returned summarily to the USA. </p>
