	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This matter concerns a young girl, C, who is just 3 years old. Her parents are J (mother) and P (father), who I shall refer to in this judgment as the mother and father.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother has made an application for leave to take C to live with her permanently in France. She plans to live in Montpellier. She was born in France and most of her family live there, her parents and sister live within about 2 hours from Montpellier. Her main reasons for doing so are to be closer to her family, to improve her employment prospects and to provide a better life for C. Her proposal outlined at the start of the hearing is if she is granted leave she would not move until August to ensure all the practical arrangements are in place</p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in">3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s revised contact proposals, in the event she is granted leave, were outlined at the start of the hearing. They can be summarised as follows: Alternate weekends on a rolling cycle of two taking place in France with the father travelling to Montpellier and then every third occasion taking place in England for an extended period with the mother bringing C to England; Half the school holidays either to be spent in France, England or Italy.  During the hearing there was some information about the French school holidays and it looked like the pattern would work that the third longer occasion would fit in with half terms, save for the summer term when there is no half term, but the school summer holidays start earlier. In the event of the court granting the mother&#8217;s application the parties will need to discuss the finer detail of this.  </p>

	  <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in">4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Her application is opposed by the father. He was born in Italy, moved and settled in England about 6 years ago. Although his family remain in Italy he wishes to remain living and working here. He fears if the mother and C move there will be a significant reduction in the contact he has with C which is contrary to her welfare. He considers the mother can find employment here and the plans that underpin her application do not stand up to close scrutiny.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This type of application is inherently difficult as it involves a decision for which there is no half way house, either permission is granted and the child moves to another jurisdiction which will invariably change the relationship with the left behind parent, or if refused may result in the parents who made the application feeling resentful that their move has been stopped in its tracks. There are powerful arguments on both sides in this case. I agree with the assessment of Mr Rautenbach, the Cafcass officer, that this is a finely balanced decision.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">One sad feature of this case is the level of legal costs. There was no Form H filed by either party at the start of the case and I directed they should be filed with the closing submissions. The mother&#8217;s costs are &#163;14,280 (of which &#163;9,909 have been paid). The father&#8217;s costs are said to be &#163;106,718 (of which &#163;106,718 have been paid). </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At the time the mother made her application in September 2014 she was an unrepresented party and did not get solicitors again until she filed her statement in November, although there is a reference to her having seen solicitors in June 2014. She filed one statement. The father has filed two statements and been represented at two directions hearings prior to the two day hearing before me. The father said his legal costs have been funded by his grandfather. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Whatever the courts decision it is frankly incomprehensible that this level of legal costs have been incurred in a case that, although finely balanced was not complex. The great sadness is this money could have been used for the benefit of the family as a whole.</p>

His father disappeared from their lives. This had a huge impact on the father; he did not see his father until some 16 years later. He subsequently discovered he had in fact been living in the same city, unbeknown to the father. His sister had no relationship with her father, as she was too young to have any memory of him when the parents&#8217; separated. This experience has undoubtedly influenced the father.  He came to England in late 2008 to pursue work in the film business, having trained as a film editor in Italy fulfilling his long term ambition to work in the film industry.</p>

The mother says the father was working long hours and she felt he did not prioritise his time to be with her and C. The father states he had to work long hours and had a long commute each way. Due to the nature of the industry he was then self employed and needed to respond to the demands of his work in the hope of securing a more permanent position. He alleges the mother had an affair, which she denies.</p>

That did not work; the mother and C moved out in January 2014 and secured their own flat. Shortly afterwards the father moved to a flat. There remains a dispute between the parties about the refund of the deposit of the property they shared. The mother says it was funded by her father and should be returned to her, the father disputes that saying the mother had not contributed to the rent and he was therefore entitled to retain some of that money.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">According to the mother, prior to June 2014 the father&#8217;s contact with C was dependant on his work commitments and his other interests such as football. The father accepts that he worked long hours but states there were times other than the weekend when he was available to see C and he spent all the free time he could with her. He denies he played football in preference to spending time with C.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is broadly agreed from 6 June 2014 the regime of the father&#8217;s contact with C has been each weekend, alternately starting on a Thursday or Friday evening and alternately returning C on Monday or Tuesday morning. The father contends this change came about due to him being offered a permanent contract on 1 May whereby he had fixed hours (40 hours per week). The mother contends this was after the father had received some legal advice, was aware of her wish to return to live in France and so was, wholly or partly, a tactical move by him to increase the amount of time he spent with C to thwart her plans.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">One matter that is agreed is that in her relatively short life C is a well travelled child. During the first 32 months of her life she went abroad no less than 18 times. Whilst a few of these trips were for long weekends, the vast majority were for trips of between 10 &#8211; 21 days approximately equally split between France and Italy. The trips to Italy were to visit the paternal family, whilst the parties were together these trips were undertaken jointly. Since the separation they have been with the father taking C to visit his family. The trips to France have been by the mother and C mainly to visit the mother&#8217;s family, although over the last nine months they have also been to visit Montpellier where they have stayed with her boyfriend Z. According to the mother this relationship started in about March 2014, he is the son of a friend of her mothers and the families have known each other for many years. The mother has not sought to hide this relationship from the father and arranged for them to be introduced at a relatively early stage. The father fears that the mother&#8217;s real plan is to move in with Z and that he will become the father figure for C in place of the father.</p>

After her trip to France in August 2013 to attend her sister&#8217;s wedding she also spent some time in Montpellier with a friend she had known in London. That friend is a French national who had returned to France to live in Montpellier about 3 years ago. The mother states, when she returned from this trip she informed the father that she wished to return to live in France.

There is limited information known about him other than he has two children of his own, one of whom he has a shared care arrangement with.

On the train back from mediation on 18 August the mother informed the father that she had registered C to attend a nursery in Montpelier for a week to try it out and to ensure that if her application was successful C would have a place secured in that nursery. Although the fact of a nursery placement had been flagged up in the emails from the mother in June there had been no prior discussion between the parties about the detail and the mother accepts the father was shocked when he heard this on the 18 August. She acknowledges she should have spoken to the father about this before. She says she asked the father to accompany her to France to see what the facilities are in Montpellier. The father refused due to lack of finances and time off from work.</p>

The mother responded that she had felt depressed since the separation although she perhaps did not realise it at the time. She said she had been prescribed anti depressants in early 2014 related to a medical issue. She said she began to feel more depressed after the application was issued as she was feeling more isolated. She told the doctor she did not want anti-depressants or counselling as to use her words <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I didn&#8217;t want to be this kind of mother on benefits and anti-depressants&#8217;</span>.

She has undertaken a gluten free baking course and considers that gives her an opportunity in France due to the lack of people with such expertise. Although she said in her application she had a job it transpired this was no more than a prospect of a job. The letter in the papers refers to a caf&#233; opening in Montpellier although the mother accepted no premises had been identified yet. The person behind this enterprise is a friend of the mothers that she knew in London who had returned to France.

In relation to the other job details she had (a secretarial position in an international logistics company) she agreed this was not what she wanted to do long term, but it was a firm offer which she had since discussed with the author of the letter to put back the start date until September 2015. Whilst she accepted the person who offered the job had worked with Z previously, she denied any suggestion that this job was arranged through Z.

It was suggested that she was effectively making up her case as she went along, trying to plug the gaps as her case did not add up financially.

I consider the mother has at times overstated her position, although I suspect that may in part be due to the language difficulties. However I do not consider her to be an inherently untruthful witness. There were some aspects of the mother&#8217;s evidence where she had been inconsistent. For example, in relation to her plans with Z but that has to be viewed in the context where she has not sought to hide the relationship. Her reference to not wanting to live off benefits was in the context of her wishing to live free from benefits which she considered in the long term more likely in France than England. The father has done the same; there were aspects of the father&#8217;s evidence where he perhaps overstated his position. For example, the time he spent with C prior to June 2014; it is clear the demands of his work then were such that during that period the mother shouldered much of C&#8217;s day to day care. I consider it more likely than not he did play football to the extent described by the mother. He has often become focussed on the minute detail of the case without stopping and looking at the wider picture and the reality of the mother&#8217;s position. I suspect this may be in large part due to his own experience with his father.</p>

Her position is different from that of the father; she came here for a short period with no real intention to settle. All her family, save for possibly one sister, remain living in France. Importantly her parents and the sister she is particularly close to will live near to her if she goes to France.  The father made a conscious decision to come here; he was driven by his passion for his work and his ambition to make that a successful career, which to his very great credit he has done. He plans to remain living in England. All his family remain living in Italy. </p>

However, they have to be looked at in the context that the mother is returning to her country of origin, where her family are well established and live relatively close by. Her family have provided significant support in the past, with her mother making regular visits here and she is clearly close to her sister who has a daughter the same age as C. I have no doubt that support will continue. The somewhat sterile debate about the time it takes to get from where the maternal family live to Montpellier was unhelpful. The immediate wider family are all within a 2 &#189; hour journey. The fact that her plans have evolved reflect, in part, the time taken for the application to be heard, her developing relationship with Z and her own re- evaluation of what she proposes. I do not consider these changes, in the circumstances of the case, signify her plans being inchoate. Her current position, if she is given leave to go, is she would not move until August, to enable her to get her own accommodation in Montpellier secured and the other practical arrangements in place. This seems a child centred position for her to take, as it will ensure the move takes place with settled arrangements being in place to minimise the disruption for C. It will also have the benefit of giving time to make the necessary practical arrangements for the father&#8217;s contact.</p>

His written statement and his oral evidence gave a detailed account of his feelings for C, their relationship and how they spend their time together. In addition, he fears that the mother marginalises his relationship with C and Z will either become a replacement father figure or if that relationship founders with Z she will move on elsewhere, with further disruption to C. Whilst it is right he will spend less time with C if they move and the logistics of contact may take time to settle down I agree with the analysis of Mr Rautenbach that both parents are committed to the relationship being maintained and will do all they can to ensure that is done. In relation to the mother this view is supported by the fact that she agreed to an increase in time that C spends with her father in June, at a time when she had reached the decision to make an application to move to France. Whilst she did seek a reduction at the hearing in October this needs to be seen in the context of C being with her father every weekend, which in my experience is unusual where the mother had limited unencumbered free time with C. It was inevitable this timetable was dictated in large part by the father&#8217;s work commitments. Prior to June 2014 whilst the father did see C regularly this was also to a large extent dictated by his work commitments, which were extensive. </p>

Mr Williams submits the letter from the mother&#8217;s GP is litigation driven and does not accurately reflect the resilience of the mother. The mother set out her feelings in her statement at paragraphs 43 to 45, which I accept. In her oral evidence the mother was revealing about her feelings. She had sought some medical help before (for an unrelated medical matter), had been resistant to having any medication or counselling and said she had not confided in her family as she was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;more confident that the doctor would not judge me&#8217;.</span> She said the doctor gave her numbers of organisations she could speak to if she felt down and alone. She was clear in her oral evidence about the lack of support she had here, how she felt isolated and her description of feeling an outsider when she attended mother and baby groups was both compelling and revealing. In my judgment if this application is refused the mother will find it very difficult to settle and remain living in Sevenoaks. There is very little to keep her there. She has mentioned moving to other areas and although she has made no specific plans I strongly suspect that is what would happen. The father does not suggest there is much to anchor him in Sevenoaks if the mother and C were no longer living there. His commute to work is long and expensive and it is likely he would move back to London.</p>

Whilst it is correct there has been some fluidity about them but that has to be viewed in the context of the mother returning to her country of origin where she has a good established family network. Her plan to delay any move until August is sensible, rational and child focussed. It will enable her to make all the necessary practical arrangements. She has said her plan is not to move in with Z straight away, which I accept. He has commitments to his own children. She has her friend who lives in Montpellier and has established herself there. It is clear there are flats available, she would be entitled to state benefits and the administration job offer she has remains open in September. Whilst she over stated the position in her application form and statement about the work she had in a cafe, that is something that may be available in the future where she can use her bi-lingual and baking skills. In her oral evidence she accepted the educational opportunities in either country are the same.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the effect on C of any change in her circumstances, inevitably a move to France will mean that the current shared care regime will not be able to continue. That needs to be carefully evaluated with the proposals the mother has made for contact together with the other welfare considerations. Whilst the frequency of contact will be reduced as will the ability for the father to share some of C&#8217;s day to day experiences (such as school) the mother&#8217;s proposals will mean the father sees C every two weeks and on every third occasion that is likely to be for an extended period. The current regime in Sevenoaks is unlikely to be sustainable long term if the mother&#8217;s application is refused as other factors will intervene such as the possibility the mother will move to another area where she will feel more settled, C starting school and any changes in the father&#8217;s work. Whilst the cost and logistics of contact taking place in France can&#8217;t be ignored nor can the practicalities of obtaining accommodation for contact to take place in, there are regular flights which can be booked in advance and there are clearly family resources the father can draw on if required. The father is resourceful and determined, as is the mother, if they both put their minds to it they will ensure the contact between C and her father will work. A benefit of the move to France is that C will be closer to the wider maternal family, whilst this can&#8217;t be considered as a substitute for the presence of the father it is a factor that needs to be weighed in the balance. Having observed the mother in oral evidence I consider the impact on her, and consequently her care of C if the application is refused would be considerable. She feels isolated in Sevenoaks. I consider it unlikely she would remain living in the area, she would probably move to an area more attuned to her which will involve further disruption and not have the benefit of maternal family support in the area. </p>

The mother speaks English, she wishes for C to attend, if possible, a bilingual school.

She feels isolated in Sevenoaks, she has limited support and her description of how she felt when attending mother and toddler groups was clear. That is unlikely to change, she can see little prospect of viably returning to work bearing in mind the cost of child care, accommodation and other associated costs. Whilst she is determined and robust she came across as being vulnerable too, her description of not being able to confide in others about how she was feeling supported what she said about lack of support. She puts on a brave face which is likely to mask the reality and I consider there is a real risk if her application is refused her ability to provide consistent care to C would be adversely affected.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>Balanced with this has to be the impact on C&#8217;s relationship with her father if she moves to France and their relationship becoming more distant, both physically and emotionally. Whilst their relationship would undoubtedly change and the father would be greatly disappointed by the move I consider the parents&#8217; commitment to ensure the relationship is maintained is resolute and supported by visits to the paternal family. By seeing her father in France or England fortnightly I consider her relationship with her father will be maintained, albeit in a different context. Mr Williams has referred me to the research undertaken in this type of situation which suggests that contact arrangements are not maintained. I have considered that risk. The parents are aware of it and it is incumbent on them, with the support of the wider family on both sides, to ensure that does not happen so that C can continue to enjoy her close relationship with her father and the wider paternal family.</p>

Whilst there have been occasions when, on reflection, the mother accepted she should have done things differently, for example only informing the father of the nursery placement in France the day before they went, I consider she understands the importance of the father&#8217;s relationship with C. This is illustrated by the contact plans she has put forward and the fact that she maintains a good relationship with the wider paternal family. The father is clearly capable of caring for C, although there have been times when he has sought the mother&#8217;s advice. Prior to June 2014 he was not as available as the mother has been to care for C due to his commitment to his job. I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence about the demands that placed on him prior to securing a permanent position.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There should be a child arrangements order specifying C lives with both the mother and father in France and England. The father suggests there should be an agreement from the mother not to cohabit with Z and maintain her own apartment for at least 2 years. That is something the mother may wish to consider, it will ensure there is clarity about the immediate future, it will help C make the adjustment and allow the father and C&#8217;s relationship to more easily adjust to the change. There will obviously need to be a clearly defined framework for the time C spends with her father in France and England. When she is at nursery it looks like the pattern could be two weekends during term time in France and then a longer period in England during the half term and longer holidays. There is likely to be more flexibility in the shorter term as C has not started school. The father will meet the cost of the weekend contact in France, the mother will meet the cost of the half term contact and the parties will share the cost of C&#8217;s travel for the longer school holiday periods of contact. Arrangements will need to be put in place to register the order in France.</span></p>
