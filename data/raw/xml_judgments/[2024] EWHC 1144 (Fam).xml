Having heard the evidence, the learned District Judge found that the Respondent was not present at the marriage on 14 December 2009 and accordingly the parties were not legally married. It against that decision and the orders that flow from it that the Appellant seeks leave to appeal with appeal to follow before me. </p>

The Appellant and Respondent agree that they finally separated in 2013. The Appellant sought an Islamic divorce in January 2022 which was granted in April 2022.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On 18 June 2022, the Appellant applied to the court online for a final order of divorce from the Respondent. The date of marriage asserted by Appellant on the Petition was 14 December 2009. In July 2022 the Respondent completed the &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Response to a Divorce Application - Acknowledgement of service by the Respondent</span>&#8217;<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> On the face of that document, he disputed the divorce and indicated that he did not agree that the court had jurisdiction. He asserted that he and the Appellant had<span style="font-style:italic"> never had a registered marriage or a civil registration in the UK or anywhere else. </span>He asserted in that document that they had had an Islamic Nikah in 1998 (note - it is now agreed the correct year is 1999) which was ended through the shariah council. The Respondent married his current wife under Islamic law in November 2009 and says he did not enter into a registered marriage with the Appellant in December 2009 as she asserts. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On 14 August 2022, the Respondent made an application challenging the veracity of the marriage certificate upon which the Appellant relies, and which shows a marriage having taken place at X Registry office on 14 December 2009. It appears from the papers before me that that application led to extensive delay. The reasons for that delay are set out in paragraphs 27-33 of District Judge Buckley&#8217;s judgment. By the time of the hearing before District Judge Buckley, the Respondent&#8217;s position was that it was an authentic marriage certificate but that he had not been present at the marriage.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Eventually a fact-finding hearing to determine whether the Appellant and Respondent were validly married on 14 December 2009 took place before District Judge Buckley over three days namely on 27 and 29 November 2023 and 20 December 2023. At that hearing, both parties were represented by direct access counsel. Both parties had the benefit of a McKenzie friend. District Judge Buckley had the benefit of two bundles. One for the fact-find which ran to 411 pages and another prepared for the recently concluded Children Act proceedings between the parties of 763 pages. He had before him the judgment which had been given in the Children Act proceedings.  In addition, he had police disclosure which he had received in two tranches, and which ran to over 113 pages. At the hearing, the learned judge heard oral evidence from both the Appellant and Respondent. In his judgment he states that both were <span style="font-style:italic">robustly </span>cross-examined before him. He had written closing submissions on behalf of both parties. The learned District Judge then reserved his judgment which was handed down on 18 January 2024. </p>

A written copy of the judgment given by District Judge Buckley was to be served on the Registrar at X Registry office. The learned District Judge refused the Appellant&#8217;s application for permission to appeal.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On 5 February 2024, the Appellant renewed her application for permission to appeal. By that application she asked the court to set aside the order of 18 January 2024 and sought a stay. Having read her Notice of Appeal it is apparent that the Appellant was concerned that without a stay, the judgment could be used against her in other proceedings between the parties, such as non-molestation proceedings. She was further worried that the Respondent would dispose of assets because there could be no financial relief application without a valid marriage. </p>

She transferred the appeal to the High Court, made directions for the filing of skeleton arguments and appeal bundles, listed the appeal in open court subject to the usual Reporting Restriction Order and made participation directions. HHJ Harrison did not grant the requested stay.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Thus, the application for permission to appeal with appeal to follow came before me on 20 and 21 March 2024. At the hearing the Appellant had the benefit of a McKenzie friend and the Respondent, the benefit of direct access counsel and a McKenzie friend. The hearing did not proceed as smoothly as the carefully crafted directions of HHJ Harrison had anticipated. Despite directions aimed at an agreed and page limited bundle for use at the appeal, a second appeal bundle of 221 pages together with a bundle of authorities were submitted late on behalf of the Respondent. The Appellant told me she had not had time to consider this material. Much time was thus lost as the Respondent&#8217;s counsel kindly highlighted those documents which were additional to the appeal bundle the Appellant had submitted and the Appellant read the additional papers submitted on behalf of the Respondent. The net result was that oral submissions did not begin until the afternoon of the first day and ran comprehensively into the second day. At the conclusion of the oral submissions, I reserved judgment. </p>

In oral argument, Counsel on behalf of the Respondent replied to each Ground of Appeal assiduously. I do not purport within this section of the judgment to reiterate all that has been said on his behalf, but I take its totality into consideration. Within this paragraph I simply highlight some of the key submissions in response. Firstly, for the reasons given the learned District Judge did not state that the marriage certificate in isolation cannot be relied upon. The judge correctly stated the law and applied it. He did not reverse the burden of proof and paragraphs 37 and 68 of his judgment demonstrate that he did not. The court did have in mind the Respondent&#8217;s conviction for perverting the course of justice even if it was not mentioned in his judgment because it had been raised in argument by Counsel for the Appellant before the District Judge. In any event, it was almost 30 years old at the time of the hearing. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The District Judge erred in relation to the central factual issue. At paragraph 70 of his judgment, he found there was nothing before him to say that the marriage certificate was not an authentic document. Then at paragraph 75 he found that that the Appellant would have had access to all the identification documents which would have been needed by the Registrar. He then speculated that the signature on the marriage certificate may not be the Respondent&#8217;s, but he did not go on to find that it is a forgery. Later in his judgment, the District Judge concluded (paragraph 134) that the Respondent was not present at X Registry on 14 December 2009. The problem with that conclusion is that if the Respondent was not there, his signature on the marriage certificate must be a forgery.  If the signature is not a forgery, then the Respondent must have been present. The learned District Judge&#8217;s findings on this central issue are thus inconsistent and cannot stand.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Further, a significant proportion of the learned District Judge&#8217;s judgment is devoted to assessing the parties&#8217; credibility. Paragraphs 47-66 and paragraph 112 of the judgment all relate to the Appellant&#8217;s credibility. He deals with the Respondent&#8217;s credibility in particular at paragraphs 61-67 and 83. Reading the judgment as a whole it is clear that the learned judge&#8217;s assessment of the credibility of the parties was pivotal to his decision making. In my view that assessment was flawed. The assessment ought to have taken into account the Respondent&#8217;s previous conviction for perverting the course of justice. The issue and its relevance to the judge&#8217;s assessment of the credibility of the Respondent had been raised in argument on behalf of the Appellant at first instance. However, the conviction and its potential impact on the assessment of the Respondent&#8217;s credibility is not mentioned anywhere within the judgment. Given the nature of the offence, even allowing for the significant passage of time, I consider that that was a material omission in the context of a case where if the marriage was not valid, it must have been a fraud. Had the District Judge considered the conviction, he could then have proceeded to determine what if any weight to attach to it.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Further the learned judge erred in his consideration of the respective motivations of the parties. At paragraph 83 of his judgment the District Judge asked himself why the Respondent would want to enter into a civil marriage with the Appellant the month after his Islamic marriage to his second wife. However, the learned District Judge erred in that he failed to consider any positive reasons why the parties might want to enter into a civil marriage at that time. For instance, he failed to consider that at that time the Appellant was heavily pregnant with the parties&#8217; second child and may have been feeling insecure given the recent second Islamic marriage of the Respondent. Further, whilst the judge did place the marriage in the context of recent domestic abuse of the Appellant by the Respondent and thus queried why she would want to marry him then, he failed to factor in that the parties remained husband and wife until 2013. Further, the judge failed to consider whether in December 2009 the Appellant would have even contemplated the possible advantage of a civil marriage should she and the Respondent separate in the future. It seems to me that that should lead to a necessary consideration along the lines of: &#8216;if she entered into this marriage for financial advantage, why she did not seek divorce until 2022 and why, when she did, did she seek the Islamic divorce first?&#8217;. Further, and I consider materially, nowhere in the judgment does the learned judge consider whether the Respondent has denied participating in the December 2009 marriage to defeat the Appellant&#8217;s claims for financial relief. </p>

In such circumstances, I consider it would not be appropriate for me to substitute my decision for that of the District Judge. I have therefore decided that the fact-find shall be remitted for re-hearing by a High Court Judge of the Family Division.  </p>
