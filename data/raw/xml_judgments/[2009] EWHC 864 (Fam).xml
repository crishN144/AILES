		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The first is the question of the costs of the proceedings, that is, the costs of both the ancillary relief proceedings and the Chancery proceedings (using those terms as I defined them in paragraph [13] of the judgment) with the sole exception of the costs of the discrete issue in relation to the loan account referred to in paragraph [336] of the judgment. That issue is fixed for hearing before me on 30 April 2009 and it is convenient that the costs of that issue should themselves be dealt with as a discrete issue following judgment on that matter.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The other is the question of whether I should vary the terms of the injunction granted initially by Roderic Wood J on 12 October 2006 (paragraph [14]), and subsequently amended by orders made by Bennett J on 20 November 2006, by Holman J on 16 July 2007 and finally by myself on 14 October 2008. That injunction prevents the company securing any borrowing against 17 Kensington Heights. It does not, it is to be noted, prevent the company entering into such borrowing; only from charging the property.</p>

But the course of oral argument revealed that a point which Mr Wagstaffe had raised about the possible impact of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/22/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/22" uk:canonical="1999 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Access to Justice Act 1999</ref> raised somewhat more complicated issues than had originally been anticipated and issues, moreover, on which I was likely to be assisted by further submissions. It was agreed that both sides should lodge further skeleton arguments on the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/22/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> point.

It suffices to recall that I was concerned with two separate sets of proceedings, the ancillary relief proceedings and the Chancery proceedings (paragraph [13]); that the company and the children were wholly successful in the Chancery proceedings, the wife succeeding against them only (and even then only in part) in her claim against the company for relief under section 24(1)(c) of the 1973 Act (paragraphs [302], [337(i)]); and that the wife succeeded in her claim for ancillary relief against the husband in the amount she had claimed (paragraphs [333], [337(ii)]). </p>

So they were in origin, and it is convenient for analytical and descriptive purposes to use the two separate labels. But it is important to remember, first, that on 12 October 2006 the company was joined as a respondent to the ancillary relief proceedings and, second, that on 20 November 2006 the two sets of proceedings were consolidated (paragraph [14]). So from that comparatively early stage in the litigation the wife, the husband, the company and the children have all been parties to the one single consolidated action.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It should be emphasised that there is one potentially important strand of this litigation which remains outstanding, namely the loan account issue. As to this, of course, if the wife is successful in establishing that the company is indebted to the husband (and thus now to her), that indebtedness was a fact which, says Mr Wagstaffe, ought to have been disclosed; certainly by the husband and arguably by the company which, as second respondent to the ancillary relief application, was also, he submits, bound by the duty to give full and frank disclosure. At this stage, as he says, it is impossible to say what the court&#8217;s conclusions on that issue will be. However there is, he submits, at least a reasonable prospect that the wife will succeed in showing that a substantial sum is (now) owed to her. In these circumstances, he says, the uncertainty surrounding this issue means that the court should be cautious when it comes to making costs orders at this stage. Indeed, he submits, it may be premature for me to be making any costs orders at this stage at all. </p>

The loan account issue is an entirely discrete matter and one which, moreover, was first raised by the wife only at the very end of the original hearing &#8211; which is, indeed, why it has to had to be &#8216;hived-off&#8217; as a discrete matter. No injustice, in my judgment, will be done to anyone if I deal here and now with the other costs issues. I do not see how the outcome of the loan account issue, whatever it may be, is going to affect the other costs issues I have to decide; and full justice in relation to the costs of the loan account issue can, I am confident, be done once the outcome of that issue is known. The parties are entitled to have a decision now as to the costs of the various issues which, unlike the loan account issue, were dealt with at the original hearing and in relation to which I have given judgment. </p>

Alternatively, he says that if any order for costs is made against the wife in favour of the company and the children, then those costs (i) should form part of the costs she is entitled to recover from the husband and (ii) should not become enforceable until she has in fact recovered them from the husband.</p>

Although, to this extent, the wife did &#8220;succeed&#8221; in extending her occupation of 17 Kensington Heights, this was, says Miss Evans-Gordon, a minor matter in the context of the litigation considered as a whole and, she submits, added little by way of cost and should therefore be discounted.</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">At the outset Mr Wagstaffe draws attention to what he says is the importance of bearing in mind that the Chancery proceedings were essentially satellite litigation to the ancillary relief proceedings. The fact that the company has been embroiled in this litigation at all is, he says, down to the husband and the husband alone. The issue of whether the husband (directly or indirectly) owned the relevant assets in full or only as to 30% was the forensic focus of the trial because, and, he says, only because, of the husband&#8217;s stance in the ancillary relief proceedings. What Mr Wagstaffe calls the husband&#8217;s intention to set his face against the court&#8217;s jurisdiction is, as he says, well documented. Had the husband (a) given proper disclosure and (b) not made it plain that he had no intention of complying with the court&#8217;s orders, then, he says, there would quite simply have been no necessity for the company to be involved in any way, shape or form. The court has found that the fair award in the circumstances of this case exceeds &#163;7 million. It is only the knowledge that the husband would resist tooth and nail the enforcement of whatever award the court found to be appropriate that put the question &#8216;who really owns what&#8217; in issue.</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly, Mr Wagstaffe submits that although, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, it is easy for the company to say that the wife should not have pursued her claims against the company, given that she did not have that advantage the question for the court to consider is whether it was reasonable for the wife to adopt the stance she did and to maintain it thereafter. She did not of course, he says, pretend to have first-hand knowledge of the arrangements between the husband and the company as regards the ownership of the properties; and until the company&#8217;s disclosure was provided in early 2007, she necessarily relied in formulating her claim entirely upon what she was told by the husband. Mr Wagstaffe puts the point quite generally. If A is repeatedly told by B that he (B) owns 34 Acacia Avenue, B can hardly be surprised if A&#8217;s case at trial is that B owns 34 Acacia Avenue, and B must accept the costs consequences which follow from that. So far so good. But Mr Wagstaffe goes further. He says that it matters not for this purpose whether the proceedings are between A and B only, or in some way or another involve C (or C Ltd), for, he submits, if what B told A is in fact false, it is difficult to see why A should carry the can (in costs terms) for B&#8217;s conduct. Given that there was, on any true and fair view, he says, &#8216;a case to answer&#8217; (to borrow that phrase from another jurisdiction), the wife&#8217;s stance at the outset of these proceedings can scarcely be criticized. </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Mr Wagstaffe acknowledges that it was, of course, incumbent upon the wife to re-evaluate her claim when, for instance, the company&#8217;s disclosure was provided and when the witness statements were filed. But that said, he submits that even when the company&#8217;s case had been deployed to its fullest extent &#8211; which he says was not in fact until shortly before the trial &#8211; it is difficult to blame the wife for not being persuaded that the position was other than as the husband had represented to her during the marriage. The extensive disclosure, he says, begged far more questions than it provided answers &#8211; for instance why the proceeds of sale of the properties sold by the company were remitted to the husband and only the husband. He submits that, whatever the court&#8217;s conclusions of fact and law after many authorities, documents filling 15 lever arch files and the written and oral evidence of a number of witnesses had all been carefully analysed over two weeks, it could certainly not be said that the wife&#8217;s claims as regards the company were doomed from the outset to fail either in fact or in law.</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Moreover, Mr Wagstaffe submits, the company is far from blameless when litigation conduct is being considered. He asserts that what he calls the disorganised state in which the company&#8217;s papers were disclosed added considerably to the costs and certainly did nothing to reduce the length of the trial. Its disclosure was also late, coming relatively shortly before the abortive hearing before Holman J in the summer of 2007. The absence of accounts from 1993 onwards has already been commented upon. He says that the overall costs have been expanded because of the need to litigate in two Divisions. Although the company&#8217;s initial stance was the sensible position that it would seek to intervene in the family proceedings, its subsequent decision (a year later, and after the husband disengaged from the family proceedings) to bring a freestanding claim in the Chancery Division has never been explained, but was on the face of it, he says, purely tactical and certainly caused unnecessary costs to be incurred. Nor, he says, should I lose sight of the performance of the company&#8217;s witnesses; as he says, save in relation to Mrs Penny, who did her best (even if some inaccuracies perhaps crept into her evidence), my conclusion was that each of the company&#8217;s witnesses had been less than completely open with the court &#8211; none more so, as he says, than the husband himself. </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Finally, on that note, he says, it is equally important to bear in mind the dual role that the husband plays in this litigation: qua husband on the one hand, qua director of the company on the other. Plainly, as he accepts, and not least in view of my findings, the husband and the company are not interchangeable entities; but, he says, where the dominant personality behind the company has displayed such a hostile animus towards the wife and has so blatantly flouted so many court orders, it is wrong to put that conduct wholly out of account when considering whether the company should have its costs. This, he suggests, goes even beyond the position where two parties for instance act in cahoots in the way contemplated in <span style="font-style:italic">KSO v MJO and JMO (PSO intervening)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2008/3031" uk:canonical="[2008] EWHC 3031 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWHC 3031 (Fam)</ref> at para [68]; this, he says, is a case where one man, albeit wearing two separate hats, and albeit that he is not alone when wearing the second of them, has made this litigation inevitable.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Mr Wagstaffe points out that the wife <span style="font-style:italic">did </span>succeed in her claim against the company under section 24(1)(c) to the extent that the court has varied in her favour the settlement in relation to 17 Kensington Heights. On the face of it, he says, she might well be entitled to seek her costs against both the husband and the company as regards that issue. To minimize the impact in costs terms of the fact that the wife won on this issue and that the company lost, the company needs in essence, he says, to rely on the limited nature of the variation actually ordered. True it is, he concedes, that the variation was fairly narrow in scope, but the court should not put out of its mind, he submits, the fact that at the forefront of the reasons for not varying the settlement in a more substantial manner (at least in terms of the period in which the wife was to be permitted to retain her home) is the plain truth that both the company and the husband would simply have refused to pay the mortgage. So, for the company to get any benefit from the fact that the wife&#8217;s success was not more profound, it essentially needs to rely upon its own wrongdoing, or at least the likelihood of such. The company is contractually bound to pay the mortgage for the duration of its term: there is no provision in the mortgage agreement which permits it to default if it cannot get a rental income from the property or if it is occupied by the wife against the company&#8217;s wishes. The court&#8217;s perception was of course, he says, that the company would be likely to breach those covenants if a more substantive variation was ordered, so the reality is that the company held a gun to the court&#8217;s head &#8211; and all this, he says, despite the fact that at an early stage in the proceedings it is recorded (in the preamble to Bennett J&#8217;s order of 8 February 2006) that the husband agreed to make funds available to enable the company to pay the mortgage. It would, he submits, be unattractive for the company to say &#8216;well the wife hardly got any real benefit from taking this point&#8217; when it would have frustrated the court&#8217;s order even if she had.</p>

If anything, she suggests, given the finding as to the property comprised in the nuptial settlement (a bare licence to occupy) I was generous to the wife by, in effect, expanding the bare licence to one terminable on six month&#8217;s notice. She says that the company makes no complaint about this, but it absolutely rejects any suggestion either that it did or that it attempted to put any pressure on the court, whether by submitting that the court had no power to order third parties to transfer their own property into the nuptial settlement for the benefit of the wife (as was in fact held) or otherwise.</p>

On those issues &#8211; the only issues in relation to which they were parties &#8211; they were wholly successful. The company, in contrast, was involved not merely in meeting the wife&#8217;s claim to pierce the veil of incorporation but also in meeting her claims that the properties, although vested in the company, belonged beneficially to the husband and that she was entitled to relief under section 24(1)(c).

No doubt it was the husband&#8217;s actual and anticipated stance which in large part drove the wife down the path of litigation with the company and the children, but that is not of itself something which should immunise her from the consequences of her chosen litigation strategy, given, to repeat, my findings that the company and the children and the husband were separate entities in fact and in law and that they were not acting in cahoots in the litigation.  </p>

She has an award of &#163;7 million which the husband so far refuses to pay, and which she will not find it easy to enforce (if she can do so at all). She has the benefit of such sums as are owed to the husband by the company, though its position is of course that it does not owe the husband anything. Mr Wagstaffe submits that in these circumstances it would not be unprincipled for the court to determine that it would be unreasonable to require her to pay anything as things currently stand and to decline to make an immediate costs order on that basis alone. Looking to the future, the reality, he says, is that unless and until the wife is able to enforce her award (including any award of costs) against the husband, she has no ability whatsoever to satisfy any costs order in favour of the company and it cannot, he says, be reasonable to require her to pay what she does not have. Moreover, as he reminds me, the aggregate of the wife&#8217;s housing budget and her <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury</span> fund exceeded &#163;5 million. It is not reasonable, he says, to expect the wife to pay any costs (if, contrary to her submissions, she is ordered to) unless and until her need for income and accommodation have been met.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Wagstaffe submits that Miss Evans-Gordon reads too much into the two authorities she particularly relies upon, <span style="font-style:italic">Lockley v National Blood Transfusion Service</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 WLR 492" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 WLR 492</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Hill v Bailey</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2003/2835" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 2835 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 2835 (Ch)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 1 All ER 1210" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 1 All ER 1210</ref>. First, however, he seeks to set them in what he says is their proper context. A litigant, he says, has in general terms no automatic right to set-off sums he has been ordered to pay another party against sums that the other party has been ordered to pay him. A right of set-off may arise under a contract (as for instance many banking contracts make provision for) but it is important to note, he says, that in that situation the effect of the set-off clause in such a contract does not simply illustrate or draw attention to a pre-existing right of set-off, it creates the right of set-off. In litigation, he says, the question of set-off usually arises because the court specifically directs that, for example, a defendant be entitled to set off sums which he is owed by the claimant against the judgment in the claimant&#8217;s favour which has just been entered against the defendant. The important point, he submits, is that unless the court specifically directs a set-off, or there is some other basis for a set-off (for example, a contractual entitlement to set-off), there is no automatic right or entitlement to set-off sums owed by X to Y against sums owed the other way.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So, he says, in the present case, there is no pre-existing right of set-off which the company or the children are entitled to exercise, whatever. Of course, as he accepts, the court has the power to order such a set-off, but unless and until it does, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/22/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref>, he submits, continues to offer the usual protection to a publicly funded litigant. What Miss Evans-Gordon&#8217;s submissions amount to, he says, is in essence a suggestion that the company and the children are &#8211; at present and without more &#8211; entitled to set-off any sums they are obliged to pay the wife against any costs order in their favour, and thus that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/22/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> is not engaged. This however, he submits, is quite incorrect: at best, he says, they are entitled to invite the court to direct a set-off, and they have not (so far) done so. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/22/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 11</ref> is therefore fully engaged.</p>

Indeed, he says that, correctly understood, that case does actually provide the answer to the point, though not the answer for which Miss Evans-Gordon contends. The case concerned a solicitor&#8217;s partnership dispute. One of the defendants was found to be liable to the claimant (who was legally assisted) in the sum of some &#163;36,000. The claimant was awarded his costs down to a certain date; thereafter, the defendant was awarded two-thirds of his costs against the claimant. Master Dyson, who had heard the claim at first instance, directed that the parties&#8217; costs be taxed and ordered that the sums due under the costs orders he had made be set-off as against each other. The defendant took the view that the costs payable to him dwarfed the sums he owed the claimant and therefore decided not to pursue his taxation. Eventually proceedings were taken against him by the claimant, who had had his costs taxed and who sought to enforce the aggregate amount due; this prompted the defendant belatedly to seek to have his costs assessed. The Taxing Master however took the view that the application for a determination of the claimant&#8217;s (assisted party&#8217;s) ability to pay was time-barred and dismissed the defendant&#8217;s application. The defendant successfully appealed to Lightman J, sitting with two assessors.</p>

The right of set-off arose accordingly, he says, not from the fact that the defendant expected to recover &#163;X from the claimant in circumstances where in fact he was separately indebted to the claimant in the sum of &#163;Y; it arose from the direction made by the Master. It was that fact, according to Mr Wagstaffe, which caused Lightman J to hold that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/22/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> was not engaged: the claimant was not required to &#8216;pay&#8217; any costs to the defendant; rather, the set-off direction conferred upon the defendant a defence to the sum claimed by the claimant from him.</p>

What the wife seeks to recover from the company and the children is in truth, he says, no more than recovery of assets belonging to the husband whether they are presently held by the company and the children or not. The husband owned 30% of the company and (on the wife&#8217;s case) was entitled to recover from it the loans he had advanced to it; those are the assets which the wife will recover (acknowledging, as she does, that the value of the first will be eroded by the extent of the second). Moreover, he says, the wife can expect to recover the cash value of the husband&#8217;s 30% shareholding, because the children have agreed to buy it from her &#8211; but that is wholly separate from the question of who is entitled to what as determined in the company&#8217;s (and the children&#8217;s) claims against the wife. </p>

Those costs arise out of the proceedings they brought seeking various declarations and consequential remedies. Though consolidated by Bennett J&#8217;s order, the two claims are, he says, conceptually quite different, the claim by the wife to fair financial provision from the husband being quite independent from the relief sought against her by the company and the children. So, he submits, the wife&#8217;s right to recover against the husband sums which happen to be held by the company, and her right to recover the sum payable &#8211; pursuant to an agreement &#8211; to her on the purchase of the shares in the company which the husband formerly held, are simply not impeached by the company&#8217;s (or the children&#8217;s) claims for costs.</p>

He submits that in pursuing the issue of a set-off, the company and the children have unfortunately blurred the distinction between the company and its shareholders in a way which is, as he wryly comments, quite at odds with their case in the substantive proceedings. What they seek (collectively) is to set off the entirety of the sums that the company and the children will need to pay to the wife &#8211; which are two separate things &#8211; against the entirety of the costs (if any) which she will have to pay them &#8211; which are also two separate things. No distinction is drawn between what is payable by, or to, the company on the one hand and the children on the other. He illustrates the point with a worked example which there is no need for me to set out but which, as he submits, serves to demonstrate why, as he puts it, this cannot be right. The flaw, as he points out, is in the assumption that A should be able to set-off sums which B owes to C against his own liability to B. </p>

Miss Evans-Gordon is rightly content for separate costs orders to be made in respect of the company and the children and for there to be separate set-offs, the one as between the wife and the company and the other as between the wife and the children. She refers to the evidence previously filed in which the company stated that the costs division between it and the children was approximately 75% to 25% and says that the company is content to stand by that division. More generally, she says, the amount that may be set-off by either the company or the children is a matter for determination as and when any potential set-off arises, but it does not affect the principle that costs should be awarded to them as the successful parties.</p>

Essentially for the reasons given by Mr Wagstaffe it seems to me that the children are not entitled to any set-off. The wife has not recovered anything from them by reason of the litigation. All her claims against them have failed, and they are not concerned <span style="font-style:italic">qua </span>litigant with the loan account issue, however its outcome may affect their financial interests. The only thing which the wife has achieved vis-&#224;-vis the children is their agreement to buy-out their father&#8217;s (now the wife&#8217;s) 30% shareholding in the company, but that, as Mr Wagstaffe correctly points out, is a product of an agreement between them quite separate from anything that was ever in issue between them in the proceedings. </p>

These obligations are, as Miss Evans-Gordon puts it, and for the reasons she gives, intimately connected. To adopt Scott LJ&#8217;s terminology, the one claim does &#8216;impeach&#8217; the other.

This is true, but does not affect the basic nature of a Mareva order &#8230; the Mareva jurisdiction is a jurisdiction which found its origin in the prevention of abuse and should not be transmuted into a rewriting of our established law of insolvency. Obviously the court must be satisfied that the debts, actual or prospective, which a defendant wishes to pay are genuine and not a disguised means of dissipation. But if the debts are genuine and presently payable and the source of payment is the property of the defendant not subject to any proprietary claim by the plaintiff, in my judgment the court should permit the defendant to pay them. Unless the court does so, it will be conferring on the plaintiff what is sometimes called a &#8216;negative pledge&#8217; and exposing the defendant to bankruptcy proceedings at the suit of the creditor.

But the company, he says, has chosen to forego that for the convenience of the family. Miss Evans-Gordon points out that 57 Forest House has never been let out and, perhaps more compellingly, that on Mr Wagstaffe&#8217;s own figures it would hardly suffice to raise the necessary sums. Moreover, as she observes, the matter now being litigated, and which necessitates the raising of further funds to meet the ongoing costs, was raised only at the very end of the previous hearing, so there is no warrant for any complaint that the property had not been let out earlier. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Wagstaffe accepts that, on one view, it is matter between the company and its shareholders whether or not the directors maximise its income or seek to hold the husband to his agreement, just as it is a matter for the company and the children whether or not they seek to reach a compromise with the wife or for Isam to determine the terms upon which to continue to advance money to the company (if, indeed, the money is coming from him). But, he says, when the court is being asked to exercise its discretion, these are all matters which nonetheless impact on the exercise of that discretion. Put shortly, he says, the company should first be having recourse to 57 Forest House and the husband before seeking to charge 17 Kensington Heights.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I cannot accept Mr Wagstaffe&#8217;s arguments. Whatever their factual merits &#8211; and they are far from being as clear-cut as he would have me accept &#8211; they do not begin to meet the central thrust of Miss Evans-Gordon&#8217;s case based on the principles explained by Morritt J in <span style="font-style:italic">Investment and Pensions Advisory Service</span>. To that, in truth, Mr Wagstaffe had no effective answer. In my judgment, none of the matters he relies on suffices, either on its own or taken in conjunction with the others, to deny the company the relief it seeks &#8211; relief which, as Miss Evans-Gordon correctly points out, is entirely consistent with the approach adopted at an earlier stage of the litigation by Holman J.</p>

In all other respects the injunction will remain in force for the&#160;time being. </p>
