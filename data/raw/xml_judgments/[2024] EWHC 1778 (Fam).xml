In their skeleton argument, Mr Gration KC and Mr Basi, Counsel on behalf of E, explain, in some detail, why that ground was included at the time when the appellant&#8217;s notice was lodged and why it has subsequently been abandoned. It is unnecessary for me to rehearse their reasoning in this judgment, suffice it to say that the appeal is now advanced on the second ground alone. It is important to make the point that central to this appeal is the importance to giving effect to E&#8217;s wishes and feelings and his entrenched and voluble resistance to returning to Ireland.</span></p>

It is plain that Mr Justice Jordan considered that E&#8217;s best interests lay in his being returned to Ireland, to be placed in the interim non-special care placement that has been identified for him pending the availability of a special care bed.

I also have to recognise that there are other duties in play, in addition to those which prohibit carrying on or managing an unregistered children&#8217;s home. I gave an idea earlier (see para 30 et seq) of the duties placed upon local authorities to protect and support children. How can a local authority fulfil these duties in the problematic cases with which we are concerned if they cannot obtain authorisation from the High Court to place the child in the only placement that is available, and with the ability to impose such restrictions as are required on the child&#8217;s liberty? It is such imperative considerations of necessity that have led me to conclude that the inherent jurisdiction must be available in these cases. There is presently no alternative that will safeguard the children who require its protection.&#8221;</span></p>

E has been unable consistently to cooperate with it and there are allegations of challenging behaviour and absconsion. I agree with the observations of Mr Justice Jordan that the position for E in the UK is itself properly characterised as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;high risk&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. I also recognise the description of E presenting as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;an intelligent, insightful and articulate young man&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. He has conducted himself, at the hearing before me, with poise, charm and good manners. I too have found him to be articulate but, like Jordan J, I recognise from the papers that there is another side to his personality which is considerably removed from my own experience of him. I am also bound to note that he faces serious criminal offences in Ireland. Seven bench/arrest warrants have been issued in consequence of his non-attendance. These allegations include allegations of assault, theft, and threats to kill. </span></p>

This submission is pitched very high, but I recognise it to be faithful to E&#8217;s instructions. Inevitably, Mr Gration emphasises E&#8217;s clearly and consistently expressed wishes to remain in the UK and that E, at 16, is of an age where his wishes should be heard clearly and understood. </span></p>

This included exposure to parental mental ill health, substance abuse and consequential emotional rejection.

There is a history of placements breaking down and of E placing himself at risk absconding from placements e.g., crossing the border to Northern Ireland, where he is said to have been discovered in the company of adults who had supplied him with illicit substances. E made allegations of physical and sexual abuse against named residential care staff. He later withdrew the complaints. I draw no inferences of any kind from this withdrawal. </span></p>

Prior to this absconsion, he made a serious allegation of sexual assault which was investigated by An Garda Sichana. There can be no doubt that E&#8217;s views since arriving in England have been consistently and clearly expressed. He is strenuously opposed to returning to Ireland and into the care of the CFA. He has expressed himself to be at serious risk in Ireland and stated that he fears that his life will be at risk. He has described himself as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;petrified&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> by the prospect of returning to Ireland.

E is intelligent enough to recognise the quality of representation he has received and, I believe, is appreciative of it. All this said, there can be no doubt that for non-recognition to be achieved under </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Article 23(2)(d), </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">it will be necessary to establish exceptional circumstances and on the clearest of evidence. The exception provided for in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Article 23(2)(d)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> is to be regarded as a very narrow one. The application of the principles of international comity in this sphere do not generate a tension with the principles of child welfare, on the contrary, they both support and promote the child&#8217;s interests. Thus, recourse to the public policy clause requires clear evidence that recognition or enforcement of a judgment of another contracting state would be so at variance and to such an unacceptable degree that it contravened or infringed some fundamental principle in the State where enforcement is sought. </span></p>

On the contrary, the approach of the High Court in Ireland, has been so strikingly similar to the approach of this court that the two are almost interchangeable. I have already commented as to how the transcripts there resonate so closely with the exchanges in this court. E&#8217;s essential position was placed in unambiguous terms before the Irish Court at the time the further Special Care Order was made on 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> May 2024. Mr Justice Jordan took those matters into account and having carefully analysed them, concluded that it was appropriate and in E&#8217;s best interests for him to be returned to Ireland and to be placed, in the interim, in the placement provided, it being clearly indicated that the placement is to endure only until a Special Care bed is made available for him. The approach of the Irish Court was to bear down on the CFA and to emphasise the importance of a continuing drive to identify appropriate care. It is a scenario with which I and very many Judges of the Family Court will be all too familiar. </span></p>

Whilst I entirely understand this young man&#8217;s determination to be free of his past in Ireland, I am entirely satisfied that his circumstances and his allegations can be most effectively litigated in the Irish Court.
