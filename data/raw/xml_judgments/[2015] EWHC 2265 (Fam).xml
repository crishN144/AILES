The children were placed with foster carers, together. They remain, together, in foster care. On 9 March 2015 the local authority applied for care orders in relation to all four children. Interim care orders were made by the Circuit Judge on 12 March 2015. The order made by the Circuit Judge records that &#8220;The mother neither consents to nor opposes the making of interim care orders in respect of the children.&#8221; The matter came back before the Circuit Judge on 26 March 2015 and then before Peter Jackson J on 22 April 2015. Peter Jackson J directed that there was to be a finding of fact hearing before me on 29 June 2015.</p>

The core allegations, set out in paragraphs 53-55, 65, were that MX had no intention of staying in Turkey; that she intended to travel from Istanbul to the Turkish border with Syria with the children; that once she had crossed the border into Syria she intended to join up with ISIS militants and to supply them with items of use to the group&#8217;s combative activities; and that her sole purpose and intention was to take up arms with ISIS militants and/or live for the foreseeable future in the Islamic caliphate ISIS claims to have established in the region. It was said (paragraphs 57-58) that, in essence, MX&#8217;s plan was to take the children to a war zone, and that she knowingly intended to place the children at risk of significant harm. It was further alleged (paragraph 69) that &#8220;The mother is a radical fundamentalist with links and contacts with ISIS militants and those who seek to recruit others to their cause.&#8221; </p>

On the previous Thursday, 25 June 2015, MX&#8217;s counsel, Mr Karl Rowley QC, circulated a position statement on behalf of MX. This set out her position in relation to the findings sought by the local authority as being that:</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;she does not seek to oppose the making of a finding that she was intending to attempt to enter Syria and live in territory governed by the Islamic State. That is not to say that she accepts the truth of the allegations but she does not wish to resist the making of findings on the balance of probability. In these circumstances she does not require cross examination of the local authority witnesses and does not wish to give evidence herself.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unsurprisingly, that radical shift in MX&#8217;s position gave rise to a certain amount of discussion in court when the hearing began on 29 June 2015. There is no need for me to go into that here. In the upshot, it was left that MX would prepare and file a statement, pending which I had no alternative but to adjourn the hearing until the next day. The statement was circulated the next day, 30 June 2015, shortly before the court was due to sit. It represented another radical shift in MX&#8217;s position. She acknowledged that she had not been fully open with the court and professionals. Her case now, in short, was that she had travelled to Turkey to meet up again with, and possibly marry, a man she had met in this country collecting money for Syrian refugees and whom she understood to be a doctor in Turkey. She denied any intention of travelling to Syria and said &#8220;I do not agree with or support or favour anything ISIS do &#8230; and have no wish to be involved with ISIS in any way.&#8221;</p>

I have concluded, however, that I should nonetheless re-visit the question of whether the children, both in the X case and in the Y case, should remain in the interim care of the relevant local authority. The arguments, certainly in the detail in which they have now been put before, had not previously been deployed. In each case there is going to be a significant period of delay before the re-fixed finding of fact hearing. And in a matter as important as whether a child should be in the interim care of a local authority or remain living at home while the proceedings are ongoing, the court must be careful not to attach undue weight to the previous forensic stance of the parents.

The second proposition which appears from the final sentence of para [39] is that separation is only to be ordered if the child's safety demands immediate separation. In the subsequent case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span> in para [27] I stated that a local authority in seeking to justify the continuing removal of a child from home necessarily must meet a very high standard.

The reality, he suggests, is that nothing short of actual incarceration of the children would ensure the complete eradication of all risk of their being removed to Syria. In truth, he says, the local authorities and the guardians are prepared to countenance a level of risk in the present placements while requiring from the proposed placements with the parents the certainty that all risk has been eradicated.</p>

He submits that without someone having a tag fitted and trying to go out being a parent, it is impossible to predict just how the parenting function will be affected and how adversely. What I am being invited to endorse is in reality, he says, an explorative leap in care cases of this nature, and this, he submits, is something to be factored in when looking at the balancing of what is or is not reasonable, necessary and proportionate. The true comparison, he says, is between a significantly compromised family life if the children return to their mother with the family life they will have if placed with the paternal family. Here, he suggests, the reality would be that the children&#8217;s day-to-day life will amount to imprisonment at home.</p>

And I must resist any temptation to conduct some kind of pre-trial assessment of the merits. In the circumstances I can say only this. In both the X case and the Y case the local authority has been able to assemble a very strong prima facie case against the parent or parents. The parents may be able to demonstrate &#8211; the burden of proof remains, of course, on the local authority throughout &#8211; that there are innocent explanations, but these are not cases that suggest, as some care cases do, obvious deficiencies in the case being put forward by the local authority, let alone the kind of case that can simply be &#8216;laughed out of court.&#8217; In each case the prospect of the local authority making good its assertions is real, very real, not fanciful. </p>

The port alert system, one part of which is familiar to family judges and practitioners, operates by the electronic matching of names on what I shall refer to as the stop list with the names on passenger manifests previously supplied to the relevant authorities by passenger carriers. The system is not fool-proof. There are in principle two methods of evading border controls: one is by the use of a false passport (I do not propose to go into the various techniques in use though two will be familiar to those who have read the book or watched the film <span style="font-style:italic">The Day of the Jackal</span>); the other is by clandestine departure, for example avoiding a port and leaving by small boat or light aircraft. </p>

Most monitoring is by a radio-frequency monitor, placed in the tagged person&#8217;s home, which automatically alerts the monitoring control if the tagged person either interferes with the tag (or the monitor) or leaves the premises during a defined curfew period. A more sophisticated system of GPS monitoring is also available, which is programmed to track the tagged person&#8217;s movements at defined intervals (if desired, a period measured in minutes or even parts of minutes) and programmed to send an automatic report to the monitoring control of those movements at pre-determined intervals (which, again, can be a matter of minutes rather than hours). It also alerts the monitoring control if the tagged person either interferes with the tag or travels outside a previously defined zone. The equipment is designed to &#8216;fail safe&#8217;, so it may occasionally send a false report that someone has absconded or interfered with the equipment when in fact neither has happened. Mr Fearnly was not aware of any occasion on which the equipment had failed to report when it should have done so. </p>

Thus, routinely, orders are made for passports and travel documents of both child and accompanying adult to be handed over and retained to the order of the court, and injunctions are granted to inhibit removal of the child from the address at which he or she has been located, and restraining removal from England and Wales. The port alert procedure can be activated in cases where there is a &#8216;real and imminent&#8217; risk of removal. Sometimes further requirements are imposed, such as an obligation to report at specified times to a local police station.

This is ultimately a matter for judgement and evaluation, in relation to matters, in particular those dealt with DS Y, DS Z and Mr Fearnly, which I am in as good a position to assess as any of the social workers or guardians, none of whom can bring to this particular exercise in evaluation either professional training or (as they all accepted) any previous experience of any remotely comparable case. Accordingly, I have to come to my own conclusion, though obviously feeding into my overall evaluation the expert views of the social workers and the guardians as to the impact on the children of their continuing separation from their parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of the day, and having given the matter the most anxious thought both during and since the two hearings, I have concluded that the comprehensive and far-reaching package of protective measures proposed by Mr Rowley and Miss Woodward <span style="font-style:italic">does </span>provide the necessary very high degree of assurance that the court needs, that I need, if the children are now to be returned to parental care. Taking into account all the points pressed upon me by those opposing such an order, I am at the end of the day persuaded by Mr Rowley and Miss Woodward that I should make the orders they seek, and essentially for the reasons they have articulated.</p>

I cannot go quite as far as Mr Rowley when he asserts that it is reduced to an effective nullity by the protective measures he proposes, but taking a realistic view, though not forgetting that we are here in the realm of unknown unknowns, my considered assessment is that the degree of that risk is very small, indeed, so small that it is counter-balanced by the children&#8217;s welfare needs to be returned to parental care. I should add, to make plain, that in relation to their welfare (leaving flight risk on one side), the benefits all of these children will derive from being returned to their parents clearly, in my judgment, outweigh any and all of such contrary welfare arguments as have deployed by the local authorities or the guardians.</p>

The orders will contain the additional provisions proposed by Mr Crabtree and Mrs Crowley. The orders will spell out that nothing is intended to prevent the police exercising any powers which would otherwise be available to them, including, in particular, their powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. I invite counsel to consider two further matters: whether the proposed oaths on the Quran should be sworn before a notary or an imam, and what, if any, provisions should be included in the orders to enable the relevant local authority to remove the children in an emergency if there has been some breach of the order and there is no time to apply even by telephone to the duty judge. I am inclined to think that the local authorities should have that power, but strictly confined to circumstances of emergency and subject to an unqualified obligation to make an application to the court immediately.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">As far as I am aware the power for family courts to make a tagging order comes from the judgment of Mrs Justice Parker which makes clear that tagging is available in the High Court where there is an agreement between the parties that tagging should be used. We are not aware of any power in the family courts to impose tagging against the will of the party or parties involved. The description of tagging in the judgment is based on a curfew rather than the GPS system. As you are aware we have updated guidance on tagging and electronic monitoring in the family courts which was published earlier this year. The responsibility for the tagging contracts lies with NOMS. I am certain that in working with colleagues on drawing up the revised guidance we did not consider that GPS was within the scope of the powers available to the family court.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">We (MoJ family justice policy) and NOMS have concerns about the use of GPS technology in the family courts. In criminal cases GPS tagging is currently available on an exceptional basis only, where individuals are deemed to pose an exceptional risk, primarily where there are security concerns. Each case is the subject of an approvals process and a unique protocol agreement backed up by robust process to manage monitoring and respond to any breaches. The use of GPS in family cases also has resource implications that have not been considered in the context of any previous guidance.  In addition, there are concerns around what the expectations around the monitoring would be, whether there would be requirements such as exclusion / inclusion zones, what breach process and enforcement action would look like, and critically who would be responsible for enforcement. </p>

This is a device that is fitted on the leg and allows the Electronic Monitoring contractor to monitor compliance against a curfew. It is normally referred to as a curfew or tagging order in family proceedings and is only available in High Court matters.</p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It is usually ordered in children&#8217;s cases when there is a real risk of one of the parents&#8217; abducting the child. These matters clearly need to be dealt with as a PRIORITY and should be processed on day of receipt.</p>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is responsible for the electronic monitoring contract and there is a contract in place with Capita, operating as Electronic Monitoring Services (EMS), who monitors these orders on behalf of agencies. If possible EMS need to be contacted by 15:00hrs to ensure that the tag can be fitted the same day but if they receive the order after this time then they will endeavour to install that same day but they are permitted, under the contract, to install the tag the following day. </p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Depending on the contents of the order the service provider will normally contact the named person on the order to notify them of the breach. This is why it should usually be a solicitor to the case as they will be able to take immediate action. If the named contact is a member of court staff you should notify a member of the judiciary immediately to <marker name="tab"/>get further directions. </p>
