	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust for the court to give permission for the respondent, Ms AB, undergoing an above the knee amputation of her left leg. In this matter Ms AB is represented by her litigation friend, the Official Solicitor. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter came before me on 21 July 2015 when the Official Solicitor applied for permission to instruct his own independent medical experts to advise on (i) whether Ms AB lacked the capacity to consent to the medical procedures proposed by the applicant trust and to advise on (ii) whether the procedure proposed was or was not in the best interests of Ms AB. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The hearings on 21 July and on the return date of 24 July were held in open court. On both occasions I, was invited by the applicant Trust and the Official Solicitor, to make a reporting restrictions order to prevent the press and broadcast media from identifying Ms AB as the subject of this application and the name of the treating hospitals. The press and broadcast media had been served with notice of the same. No representations were received to oppose those applications save that Mr Farmer of the Press Association questioned why the applicant trust should not be named. He submitted that there were no compelling reasons why the trust should not be named. I agreed with that submission. I decided, having conducted the necessary Article 8 and Article 10 balancing exercise, that neither Ms AB nor the treating hospitals should be named in any reporting of this case. Thus I made reporting restriction orders in respect of the same. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 December 2014 Ms AB attended her general practitioner when it was noted she had a &#8216;mixed diabetic ulcer &#8211; foot&#8217;. The next medical note records her attendance at the A and E Department of Hospital A on 3 January when she presented with scalds to both feet from a water boiling accident on Christmas Day. She then attended A and E on Boxing Day but refused to allow the wounds on her feet to be treated. On examination there was a 4 cm burn to her left foot in line with the first metatarsal and a burn on her right foot over the metatarsal phalangeal joint. There was no obvious neuropathy. She was prescribed Flucloxacillin and had an appointment made with Hospital B on 5 January 2015. On the following day, however, Ms AB attended Hospital A, A and E Department following a fall and was admitted after it was discovered that she had sustained several rib fractures and a fracture of her right humerous. Bilateral leg wounds were also noted and antibiotics were prescribed. </p>

On 3 March she was re-admitted with high blood sugars but was discharged home the same day. The hospital notes record that bilateral leg ulceration was noted, that she had a podiatry appointment the following day and that the hospital had contacted Ms AB&#8217;s general practitioner in respect of a mental capacity assessment being undertaken. </p>

Ms AB, however, left the hospital before a bed could be found. She attended again on 6 May after a referral had been made by the podiatry clinic. A 2.5cm x 2.5cm heel ulcer was noted probing to the bone. She was admitted for the administration of intravenous antibiotics but self discharged against medical advice. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She re attended A and E on 18 May when a casualty officer noted a necrotic inflamed left foot. She was admitted under the care of the orthopaedic surgeons. She was apyrexial and was found to have a large necrotic area over her left heel extending up the lateral malleolus and her foot was generally oedematous. She was commenced on intravenous Tazocin and DVT prophylaxis. An x-ray of her left heel was reported as probable calcaoneal osteomyelitis. A request was made for vascular and psychiatric advice because the orthopaedic surgeon was of the view that an amputation was required but Ms AB was adamant that she did not want her leg to be amputated. </p>

	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Later that day she was seen by Dr B, a consultant psychiatrist, who was of the opinion that she was suffering from a moderately severe depressive episode, she was able to understand information about the proposed treatment (ie amputation) and was able to retain this information but was unable to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment. He concluded she lacked the capacity to make decisions about her medical care and treatment. He recommended she commence a course of Olanzapine and Mirtazapine. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Her general condition appeared initially stable and on 1 June oral Co-Amoxiclav was substituted for the IV Tazocin for a period of four weeks. There were problems controlling her diabetes. Generally, Ms AB was not co-operative with the clinicians and nursing staff who were treating and caring for her. She would remove the dressings on her left foot, would pour alcohol on the wound and refuse to take her insulin. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 2 June Dr B noted she was in a much better mood. On 3 June the vascular surgeons noted less pus discharging than had been the case on her admission. Ms AB agreed to accept care in a nursing home when Dr B saw her on 9 June and plans were made for her discharge. Unfortunately over the succeeding days she continued to refuse to take her insulin and there were real difficulties in maintaining normal blood sugar levels. </p>

This insight and agreement lasted for but 10 minutes when she reverted to her otherwise consistent stance that she could treat herself and was opposed to her leg being amputated. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 18 June she was found on the floor by nursing staff. There was no history of a loss of consciousness and she denied hitting her head but the following day the vascular surgeons noted she appeared more sleepy than usual. A CT scan was reported as essentially normal. That evening, however, she became more unwell. A temperature of 38&#176;C was noted, there was a continuing discharge from her left heel and blood tests showed a raised white cell count. Swabs previously taken had grown Group B Strep, anaerolous and coliforms. Sepsis was suspected and she was commenced on a course of IV Tazocin, given intravenous fluids and repeat bloods were arranged. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By 23 June Ms AB was afebrile and her blood sugars were normal. The vascular surgeons noted increasing pus from the left heel wound and bone destruction. When Dr B saw her later the same day he recorded that she denied any problems with her foot, believed it was getting better and was unaware of any possible complications. He again noted she lacked the capacity to make decisions about her medical and surgical treatment. Further he increased the dose of Olanzapine. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 1 July a best interests meeting was held. All present agreed Ms AB required an urgent above knee amputation of her left leg, save for the Independent Mental Capacity Advocate, The IMCA. She concluded that the options of amputation or death from septicaemia would have far reaching consequences for Ms AB. If she underwent an amputation she would be wheelchair and/or bed bound for the rest of her life. The IMCA was concerned about the impact on Ms AB&#8217;s mental health. The impact of either option was so great she considered that a best interests decision should be made by the Court of Protection. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 8 July Ms AB was examined by Mr R, a consultant vascular surgeon, at the request of Mr L who wanted a second opinion on the issue of amputation. He noted the destruction of the majority of the left heel&#8217;s soft tissue and infection of the calcaneus, implying that the foot was not technically salvageable. Whilst the infection was controllable with strong antibiotics the only other possible treatment was a major amputation. </p>

I am of the opinion that there is nevertheless no absolute obligation upon the doctor who has the patient in his care to prolong his life, regardless of the circumstances. Indeed, it would be most startling, and could lead to the most adverse and cruel effects upon the patient, if any such absolute rule was held to exist. It is scarcely consistent with the primacy given to the principle of self-determination in those cases in which the patient of sound mind has declined to give his consent, that the law should provide no means of enabling treatment to be withheld in appropriate circumstances where the patient is in no condition to indicate, if that was his wish, that he did not consent to it.&#8221;</span></p>

The decision-maker must make a decision based on the best interests of the person who lacks capacity. They must not be motivated by a desire to bring about the person's death for whatever reason, even if this is from a sense of compassion.

The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit&#8230; Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counterbalancing dis-benefits to the applicant. An obvious instance in this case would be the apprehension, the risk and discomfort inherent in the operation. Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of certain and possible losses. Obviously, only if the account is in relatively significant credit will the judge conclude that the application is likely to advance the best interests of the claimant.&#8221; </p>

Given her history of non-cooperativeness with many of the medical staff, it is very unlikely that she will engage in rehabilitative efforts by the physiotherapist and occupational therapist. It is possible under those circumstances that she will need care in a highly specialist nursing home registered for caring for people with mental disorders for the rest of her life.&#8221;</p>

Major amputation would remove the source of infection and the dead tissue, which would significantly improve the quality of her life. On the other hand, the risks of undergoing such surgery may be summarised as follows; the possibility of wound infection or dehiscence, a need for further surgery, and anaesthetic and cardiopulmonary risks associated with the procedure &#8211; risks which are augmented by non-compliance with treatment. It is anticipated that she may interfere with wound integrity and may not comply with antibiotic treatment, insulin administration and/or physiotherapy after the operation. There is, of course also a risk of deterioration in her mental health from undergoing amputation against her wishes. </p>

In my opinion, there is little doubt that this belief is delusional, that is, it is firmly held despite available evidence to the contrary. Ms AB has another belief, associated with the first, that she could overcome her current health problems if she were allowed to go home and treat her foot as she sees appropriate. These beliefs were confirmed by the other informants I spoke to, and have also been noted consistently in the clinical records. </p>

In this context, I note that some of her comments during my interview with her suggested that she was as suspicious that I was not independent of the clinical team treating her, despite my reassurances to the contrary.&#8221;</p>

While she continues this medication, the risk of recurrence of depressive symptoms is minimised, although she may have further episodes of depression in the future. The prognosis of her psychotic symptoms (the delusions) is more uncertain. Some people, particularly those who develop delusions later in life, as Ms AB has, fail to show an adequate improvement with antipsychotic treatment. However, the discovery that Ms AB has been successfully hoarding medication that she should have been taking offers the possibility that she has had antipsychotic medication less consistently than expected, and at the lower dose than prescribed.&#8221;</p>
