	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Unlike the majority of private law hearings that I undertake, I have had the benefit of legal representation for both parties. I cannot state clearly enough my view that legal representation of all parties in private law family cases saves substantial court time and cost. It frees up more time for other cases, resulting in a more efficient system, providing greater access to justice for desperate families who are having to wait far too long to access the courts. The issues encountered with failed disclosure have, in this case, been resolved swiftly and economically through co-operation between the lawyers, and by the lawyers making timely and focussed applications to court, unlike in those cases where one or more of the parties are unrepresented. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I sit at the coal face of family justice. Huge numbers of private law family litigants are now unrepresented because of the restriction in the availability of legal aid for these cases. In my caseload, where at least one party is unrepresented, it takes on average up to four or five hearings over the course of around 18 months or more to have a finding of fact hearing ready to proceed. In many cases, one of those parties is having no contact with their children during that time. In this case, it has taken only two hearings and around nine months for the hearing to be setup and concluded, notwithstanding the substantial delays for police disclosure presently plaguing the system in this geographical area. That is still far too long, but it is substantially quicker than those cases involving unrepresented parties. The additional cost in terms of time, judicial availability and financial cost to the court service and the legal system caused by unrepresented parties, together with the obvious inequality of arms that results from one side, usually the alleged perpetrator, being unrepresented cannot be understated. The delay is almost universally harmful to the children and adults involved in these cases.</span></p>

There has still been no progress in respect of any such prosecution. It would appear that no charging decision has yet been made. During this hearing it became clear that there had not been full police disclosure in respect of her allegations of rape. Given the continuing police investigation, and the nature of some of the police documents disclosed by the parties, there were obviously witness statements in existence that the police had not disclosed, which the parties had not picked up on. I was concerned that it would not be appropriate for me to make findings in respect of the Mother&#8217;s allegations of rape without the full police disclosure.

There are many reasons why victims of abuse would not have reported that abuse at the time.

She said that it had been happening from early in the relationship but that she did not tell social services until 2017. An assessment report from 2015 at F1 was put to her and Mr Iqbal asked why she did not mention these behaviours at that time. She said that she did give her version of events, but it was not recorded in the assessment. Even in 2019 when she was making a number of allegations against the Father which are recorded at F31, it was put to her that there was no suggestion that he restricted what she wore. She said that she reported a lot, and she is shocked that there is no mention of it. Her evidence as to when he started restricting what she wore was vague. When pressed she seemed to only point to what she was wearing when the hockey stick incident occurred in 2015, when she was wearing a tracksuit. That incident is referenced at F1.</span></p>

She said that there was no physical abuse at that time but there was a lot of verbal abuse. She did not say then that this was a retraction forced on her by the Father. She later went on to say that he was begging her to save him and not to tell the truth. At this point in her evidence, she got very emotional. It was very difficult for me to follow this evidence. The Assessment from 2019 shows that the social workers were not clear on whether the Mother was retracting allegations previously made to the Health Visitor due to pressure from the Father or if she had been exaggerating to the Health Visitor.</span></p>

They show the Father being asked to bring shopping and food to the house. They show the Father&#8217;s brother being asked to do the same and to transfer money to the Mother for her rent and to her friend when she needed money as the Mother did not have it.

They key concerns that she holds relate to his alleged abuse towards her in front of the children, his behaviour towards the children and the risk of his absconding with the children. I formed the view that it would be disproportionate to adjourn the hearing to obtain further disclosure which could take months to obtain when those allegations are not central to the likely welfare considerations. Neither party sought to argue otherwise, and they agreed that the Court need not make findings on those allegations.</span></p>

The Mother&#8217;s case now in relation to that incident is that she was the victim of an attack by the Father where he strangled her and threatened to kill her, so she retaliated by hitting him with a hockey stick. She told her health visitor and the police and applied for a non-molestation order. Ultimately, she says that she withdrew the non-molestation order application under pressure and minimised the incident to the social workers. The Father&#8217;s case is that the Mother attacked him.

This report was made a couple of days after he had reported her to the police for attacking him. She complained that he was being emotionally abusive, and she was worried he would take the children away. If he had been repeatedly physically abusive throughout the relationship it is difficult to understand why she would not have disclosed that to the police. At H19 she was not holding back, yet she denied physical abuse. In a DASH Questionnaire completed at that time there is further evidence that she was complaining of emotional abuse and not physical abuse.

Her decision not to proceed with her allegations of financial control impacts upon my view of this allegation. I do not find that she was socially isolated by the Respondent. It is naturally isolating to live away from your extended family with young children. A large period of the time that forms the subject of her complaints was during lockdown which was isolating in any event. The Father was in the UK, dependent upon his visa applications being successful with a limited support network. Her text message to H in the bundle at D88, telling him that she is going to go back to Manchester for a few weeks to rest is telling. She has no fear in telling him that. This is a number of years into the marriage and both the older children had been born. If the Father and his brother were intent on isolating her then this message tells a different story.</span></p>

The Mother&#8217;s account that she married a man who had told her that he wanted a paper marriage because she now believed that he wanted a genuine marriage is difficult to accept. Her account that he then told her that he only wanted her for the visa is undermined by the fact that they consensually had three children together. At no point has she suggested that she got pregnant under coercion from him, and when she was asked about why he would have more children with her if he only needed one to secure his status, she suggested that he was trying to make the marriage work.</span></p>

She has produced one message where he used the word &#8216;bitch&#8217; towards her, but his explanation was that this was usage of the word in the modern pop-culture sense appears to be more likely than her evidence that it was used abusively given the lack of any outraged or upset response to the message on her part.

There is no corroborative evidence of bruising at all, from friends, family, GP records or the police or social services. She describes being strangled, and having the Father threaten to kill her in the hockey stick incident in 2015. In DASH Questionnaires subsequent to 2015 she denies any previous attempt to strangle. That is surprising given her evidence that it was daily and that a serious instance of it occurred in 2015.

I do not know what she told the court in her non-molestation application, however that application was withdrawn. I do not know what she told the health visitor at the time because there is no written evidence from her. I could well have found that the minimisation of these events to social services and the police and the withdrawing of the non-molestation application were as a result of pressure from the Father or her family, however I am unable to do so as I did not find her to be a compelling consistent witness. I find it more likely that this was an incident in which both parties were aggressive and, in fact, both parties were hurt during the confrontation that took place. Whilst the Mother contacted the police, and they advised her to apply to the Court for protection, it is difficult for me to understand why they record her as the perpetrator if they received a clear account from her that he was abusive towards her.</span></p>

The Mother&#8217;s concerns relate to historical events when the parties were in a relationship and concerns that the Father was harassing her after the relationship ended.</span></p>

There was no preventative order in place and, in his eyes, there was no good reason to prevent him from seeing the children as he had been from separation until 28 December 2021.</span></p>
