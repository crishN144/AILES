The existing law erects a presumption against a child giving evidence which requires to be rebutted by anyone seeking to put questions to the child. That cannot be reconciled with the approach of the European Court of Human Rights, which always aims to strike a fair balance between competing Convention rights. Article 6 requires that the proceedings overall be fair and this normally entails an opportunity to challenge the evidence presented by the other side. But even in criminal proceedings account must be taken of the article 8 rights of the perceived victim: see SN v Sweden, App no 34209/96, 2 July 2002. Striking that balance in care proceedings may well mean that the child should not be called to give evidence in the great majority of cases, but that is a result and not a presumption or even a starting point.</span></p>

Children are harmed if they are taken away from their families for no good reason. Children are harmed if they are left in abusive families. This means that the court must admit all the evidence which bears upon the relevant questions: whether the threshold criteria justifying state intervention have been proved; if they have, what action if any will be in the best interests of the child? The court cannot ignore relevant evidence just because other evidence might have been better. It will have to do the best it can on what it has.</span></p>

A fair trial is a trial which is fair in the light of the issues which have to be decided. Mr Geekie accepts that the welfare of the child is also a relevant consideration, albeit not the paramount consideration in this respect. He is right to do so, because the object of the proceedings is to promote the welfare of this and other children. The hearing cannot be fair to them unless their interests are given great weight.</span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.21in"><span style="font-style:italic">In weighing the advantages that calling the child to give evidence may bring to the fair and accurate determination of the case, the court will have to look at several factors. One will be the issues it has to decide in order properly to determine the case. Sometimes it may be possible to decide the case without making findings on particular allegations. Another will be the quality of the evidence it already has. Sometimes there may be enough evidence to make the findings needed whether or not the child is cross-examined. Sometimes there will be nothing useful to be gained from the child&#8217;s oral evidence. The case is built upon a web of behaviour, drawings, stray remarks, injuries and the like, and not upon concrete allegations voiced by the child. The quality of any ABE interview will also be an important factor, as will be the nature of any challenge which the party may wish to make. The court is unlikely to be helped by generalised accusations of lying, or by a fishing expedition in which the child is taken slowly through the story yet again in the hope that something will turn up, or by a cross- examination which is designed to intimidate the child and pave the way for accusations of inconsistency in a future criminal trial. On the other hand, focussed questions which put forward a different explanation for certain events may help the court to do justice between the parties. Also relevant will be the age and maturity of the child and the length of time since the events in question, for these will have a bearing on whether an account now can be as reliable as a near-contemporaneous account, especially if given in a well-conducted ABE interview.</span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.21in"><span style="font-style:italic">The age and maturity of the child, along with the length of time since the events in question, will also be relevant to the second part of the inquiry, which is the risk of harm to the child. Further specific factors may be the support which the child has from family or other sources, or the lack of it, the child&#8217;s own wishes and feelings about giving evidence, and the views of the child&#8217;s guardian and, where appropriate, those with parental responsibility. We endorse the view that an unwilling child should rarely, if ever, be obliged to give evidence. The risk of further delay to the proceedings is also a factor: there is a general principle that delay in determining any question about a child&#8217;s upbringing is likely to prejudice his welfare: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(2)</ref>. There may also be specific risks of harm to this particular child. Where there are parallel criminal proceedings, the likelihood of the child having to give evidence twice may increase the risk of harm. The parent may be seeking to put his child through this ordeal in order to strengthen his hand in the criminal proceedings rather than to enable the family court to get at the truth. On the other hand, as the family court has to give less weight to the evidence of a child because she has not been called, then that may be damaging too. However, the court is entitled to have regard to the general evidence of the harm which giving evidence may do to children, as well as to any features which are particular to this child and this case. That risk of harm is an ever-present feature to which, on the present evidence, the court must give great weight. The risk, and therefore the weight, may vary from case to case, but the court must always take it into account and does not need expert evidence in order to do so.</span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.21in"><span style="font-style:italic">But on both sides of the equation, the court must factor in what steps can be taken to improve the quality of the child&#8217;s evidence and at the same time to decrease the risk of harm to the child. These two aims are not in opposition to one another. The whole premise of Achieving Best Evidence and the special measures in criminal cases is that this will improve rather than diminish the quality of the evidence to the court. It does not assume that the most reliable account of any incident is one made from recollection months or years later in the stressful conditions of a courtroom. Nor does it assume that an &#8220;Old Bailey style&#8221; cross examination is the best way of testing that evidence. It may be the best way of casting doubt upon it in the eyes of a jury but that is another matter. A family court would have to be astute both to protect the child from the harmful and destructive effects of questioning and also to evaluate the answers in the light of the child&#8217;s stage of development.</span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.21in"><span style="font-style:italic">The family court will have to be realistic in evaluating how effective it can be in maximising the advantage while minimising the harm. There are things that the court can do but they are not things that it is used to doing at present. It is not limited by the usual courtroom procedures or to applying the special measures by analogy. The important thing is that the questions which challenge the child&#8217;s account are fairly put to the child so that she can answer them, not that counsel should be able to question her directly. One possibility is an early video&#8217;d cross examination as proposed by Pigot. Another is cross-examination via video link. But another is putting the required questions to her through an intermediary. This could be the court itself, as would be common in continental Europe and used to be much more common than it is now in the courts of this country.&#8221;</span></p>

It is understood that some 40,000 do so during the course of each year. The child will typically be protected from full exposure to the court room by the use of special measures, for example, answering questions over a live video link. Conversely, for many years the practice and culture in family proceedings was that such children, even if aged in their late teens, would never be required to give live evidence in the Family Court. </span></p>

The Supreme Court held that the practice and culture of the Family Court that had hitherto applied, which amounted to a presumption against a child giving evidence, could not be justified and should be replaced by the court undertaking a bespoke evaluation in each case on the question of whether a complainant child should or should not be called to give live evidence. Baroness Hale JSC gave the judgment of the court. The following key passages are of importance:</span></p>

The need to give appropriate consideration to a child giving evidence in a case where that issue arises will soon be given further endorsement by amendments to the FPR 2010 and Practice Directions in accordance with recommendations from the President's working group on children and other vulnerable witnesses. In the meantime the decision in this case should serve as a firm reminder to the judiciary and to the profession of the need to engage fully with all that is required by Re W and the Guidelines.&#8221;</span></p>

Ms Clarke has provided an analysis and has spoken to all three children. She spoke to V twice and she said she did want to give evidence initially, although what became clearer is that she really wants to tell the judge about the welfare issues rather than the fact finding issues. V is very bright and able to say what she thinks. V is allied to and very close to her parents and had a significant role at home.  The Guardian questions the necessity of the children giving evidence. The crux of the Guardian&#8217;s resistance falls at paragraph 19 of her report where she is very concerned about the pressure V would feel and the impact on her emotional stability and welfare. The Guardian is also very concerned about the impact on the sibling relationship if they give evidence. </p>

The second time she met X she was more chatty. X says she wants to give evidence but is not very clear about what she wants to say. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Veitch argues that given the children have given ABE interviews, the court has heard their voice and their evidence. The benefits of hearing evidence in this case do not outweigh the disadvantages to the children. If they do give evidence, they would not be cross-examined in the way that adults are, and he refers to paragraph 20 of the FJC guidance, i.e. (i). avoid suggestion or leading questions, including &#8216;tag&#8217; questions; (j). avoid a criminal or &#8216;Old Bailey&#8217; style cross examination. Mr Veitch argues the forensic benefit of calling the children is therefore very limited. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">V and W have been assessed to be competent and instruct their own solicitors. X is not and is only 13 years old.  Given their ages, their wishes should be given significant weight.  They all in their own way want to give evidence; want to attend court; meet the judge and specifically W clearly wants to give evidence.  V and X are more equivocal, but not resistant to giving evidence, and want their voices heard. I note that they have been consistent in that regard.  They have all had it explained to them what the process involves.  I take note of the fact that they are all bright children and none of them show any additional vulnerabilities above the fact of their age.  This case involves decisions about the children themselves which, in whatever way, will change their lives forever.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The family justice system consistently tells judges to listen to the voice of the child.  In my view the Court should be slow where the children are competent in respect of the legal proceedings, and wish to give evidence, to refuse to allow them to do so. I am in this case trying to listen to what these children actually want.  I would find it difficult to say they should or should not live with their parents without letting them give evidence.  X&#8217;s views carry slightly less weight as she is not competent and is much less clear that she actually wants to give evidence. However, she is 13 and capable of expressing her views. I would find it very difficult to explain to X or V why they were not giving evidence but W was. Further, if I were to hear some of the children but not all of them, that in my view is more likely to create tension within the sibling group than if I hear from all of them. </p>

Given the issues in the case I would find it very difficult to say to them that they can speak to me, but they cannot give evidence and I cannot take into account what they say as evidence. On the facts of the case, I think that would be a course of action that would be fraught with difficulty, as well as hard to explain to the children </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second group of issues are the forensic importance of the children giving evidence. In my view, in this case the children&#8217;s evidence is important particularly over the issues of what happened with Z and the conflict between W&#8217;s account and that of his parents. I also agree with Mr Day that as the other allegations entirely turn on W&#8217;s evidence, there is a particular benefit in hearing that evidence. </p>

I appreciate the fact I do have the ABE interviews and none of the counsel are making points that they are seeking to undermine them.  However, there are different accounts here and I think this should be tested in evidence. If I do not allow W to give evidence, then I have no doubt that the parents&#8217; counsel will say that I cannot put the same weight on W&#8217;s account as I can to the parents&#8217; and the Intervenor&#8217;s evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third group of factors is the impact on the children&#8217;s welfare. This is the Guardian&#8217;s principal concern.   She is concerned about the impact on the sibling relationship and the wider family relationship if the children give evidence.  I accept that this is a risk and I acknowledge the children giving evidence may exacerbate tensions that may already exist.  However, I note the point Ms Hodges and Ms Sapstead make that the children have found a way to live together despite their differing accounts. At the moment they are getting on together and apparently not discussing the proceedings. Tensions and strains between the siblings are quite likely to happen in the course of these proceedings in any event, whatever the outcome. I take the view that difficulties in the sibling relationships are just as likely to be exacerbated if they do not give evidence. Not to call them and then give judgment accepting one version of events above the other is just as likely to damage their relationship. I do, however, agree with the Guardian that the impact of giving evidence may be greater on the children than they presently understand. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Weighing all these factors up together, I have reached the conclusion that it is appropriate that all three children be called to give evidence. Although the children have expressed different views as to how they wish to give evidence, I think they should all do so in the same way.  I am conscious that X is not competent, and that no intermediary has been found as yet.  The court, with the assistance of the Guardian, can work out appropriate measures for X.  </p>
