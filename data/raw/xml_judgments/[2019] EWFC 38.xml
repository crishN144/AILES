The intention behind the application was for the family to be reunited in one country and to regularise the status of C within the family and her status in the United Kingdom.  The applicants gave notice to the local authority as they are required to do under the relevant provisions and the report, pursuant to rule 14.11 (3) Family Procedure Rules 2010 (FPR 2010), was prepared by Mary Fernandes dated 16 October 2018.

Although his name is on the birth certificate that was registered in Sierra Leone, he does not acquire parental responsibility under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(1)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> as that only applies in circumstances if parents are not married where the child&#8217;s birth is registered or reregistered under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/20/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref> or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/20/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/20" uk:canonical="1953 (1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953</ref> after December 2003.  C&#8217;s birth was not registered under the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/20" uk:canonical="1953 (1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref>.  Consequently, EF does not have parental responsibility in this jurisdiction as a result of being on the birth certificate in Sierra Leone.  In any event, as C was habitually resident in Sierra Leone at the time of her birth, the applicable law in relation to that is very likely to be that in Sierra Leone.  The relevance of his parental responsibility is whether (1) he should be served with this application and (2) whether his consent to the application is required or can be dispensed with under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/52/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 52(1)</ref>(a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">An additional feature of this case is even if EF did have parental responsibility, did it continue after the adoption order made in Sierra Leone in 2007.  I am satisfied that it did not. In those circumstances, he is not a parent with parental responsibility either because he did not acquire it or, in any event, it was extinguished by virtue of the adoption order in 2007.  In those circumstances, he does not need to be served with the application or become a party. Even if I am wrong about that analysis regarding his status, I am satisfied that under rule 6.36 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010, the court would have dispensed with the need to serve him due to his lack of contact with C since 2002, and there are no current details as to his whereabouts since then.  Likewise, if he is not a parent as he has no parental responsibility, his consent is not required to be considered by the court and, in any event, I am satisfied the court would have concluded he could not be found pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/52/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 52(1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>.   </p>

The adoption order in Sierra Leone was made in 2007 but it is not an order which is automatically recognised in this jurisdiction, as it is not included in the list in The Adoption (Recognition of Overseas Adoptions) Order 2013 SI1801/2013.  There is provision in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/57/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> for an application to be made for a declaration that an adoption made abroad is recognised here.  The procedure, application, and principles applicable to such applications are well established.  As no such application has been made, it means that as a matter of law here the status of the Sierra Leone adoption order remains unrecognised and invalid.  The consequence of this is that as a matter of law here, C&#8217;s parents remain CD and EF.  CD has parental responsibility pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/2/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2 (2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and, as I have already set out, EF does not have parental responsibility. </p>
