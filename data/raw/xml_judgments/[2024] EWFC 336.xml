	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Does the second condition (attributability) depend on the parent giver being alive at the date of the application? In theory, the argument may be that if the parent who caused harm prior to the date of the application is deceased, then it is not possible to attribute harm at the date of the application and accordingly it is not possible to make a threshold finding. I confess to find it somewhat difficult to follow this logic. There is, so far as I am aware, no temporal requirement for the second condition, namely the attributability of harm; in other words, it is not a condition that the attributability must be referable to parental care at the date of the application (which might exclude a deceased parent who is in no position to give care). There does not appear to be a case directly on the point. However, it seems to me that s31 should be interpreted purposively, and support for that approach can be found in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re J <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2017/44" uk:canonical="[2017] EWFC 44" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWFC 44</ref></span> where the parents of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children were either missing or deceased, and certainly were not in the position of carers at the time of the application.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, the attributability requirement is not to be confined to, or aligned with, the date of the application. C was at the date of the application suffering significant harm. That harm was, on the evidence currently available, attributable to the actions of her mother a mere 7 days previously. It would be extraordinary if, in such a situation, the Local Authority could not take steps to protect the child. It would lead to the anomalous situation that the court would not be able even to inquire into threshold, however, desirable that might be, or seek protective orders. The purpose of Part IV of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> is to enable children who are suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm caused by parents to be protected from that harm by Local Authority intervention. To neuter s31 because the parental perpetrator of harm is no longer alive would be an unexpected, and unfortunate consequence. But in my judgment that is not the intention of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, nor is it what <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> says. A plain reading of the words in s31(2)(b) that the harm must be attributable to &#8220;the care given to the child&#8221; must include past care, i.e before the date of the application, which led to the application itself. The wording does not expressly add &#8220;at the time of the application&#8221; or some such rider. Nor does it say that a parent must be alive at the time of the application. If my analysis is correct, then it matters not whether the parent is alive, or dead, or missing. What matters is whether the LA can establish (i) harm at the date of the application (or, if earlier, when protective measures implemented and carried through to the date of the application) and (ii) attributability of that harm i.e that it is a consequence of parental acts or omissions. </p>

In the first, the local authority will be unable to satisfy the threshold criteria for making a care or supervision order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. In such cases, the application must succeed. But for cases to fall into this first category, the inability to satisfy the criteria must, in the words of Cobb J in Re J, A, M and X (Children), be &#8220;obvious&#8221;. </p>

In those circumstances, an application to withdraw the proceedings must be determined by considering (1) whether withdrawal of the care proceedings will promote or conflict with the welfare of the child concerned, and (2) the overriding objective under the Family Procedure Rules. The relevant factors will include those identified by McFarlane J in A County Council v DP which, having regard to the paramountcy of the child&#8217;s welfare and the overriding objective in the FPR, can be restated in these terms: (a) the necessity of the investigation and the relevance of the potential result to the future care plans for the child; (b) the obligation to deal with cases justly; (c) whether the hearing would be proportionate to the nature, importance and complexity of the issues; (d) the prospects of a fair trial of the issues and the impact of any fact-finding process on other parties; (e) the time the investigation would take and the likely cost to public funds.</p>

If, for example, the threshold criteria are not crossed, or become much less clear cut for whatever reason, it may then be the appropriate route; see, for example, <span style="font-weight:bold">Re K <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 1</ref></span> where Hedley J elected to make a wardship order in respect of severely disabled children rather than explore threshold where there was some doubt as to whether the threshold criteria would be met and it was held to be inimical to their interests to pursue threshold findings. Another example might be if the lines of communication between the Hospital Trust and the LA become frayed or unworkable. </p>

There is no question of the court simply abdicating responsibility unless and until C&#8217;s future is settled.  This is plainly a complex case, and the court will need to scrutinise carefully the care plan and various options.</p>

Here, I am not persuaded that there are any such gaps. Accordingly, in my judgment, to make a wardship order risks cutting across the statutory regime under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and, in particular, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s100(4)</ref> and (5) thereof. </p>
