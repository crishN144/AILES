The husband&#8217;s costs of the ancillary relief proceedings are estimated at &#163;32,551.55 (he has no additional costs of the bankruptcy proceedings). The trustee in bankruptcy&#8217;s expenses of the bankruptcy (excluding legal fees) amount to &#163;43,859.72; his legal costs of the proceedings come to a further &#163;29,851.46 &#8211; a total of &#163;73,711.18.

On his own admission, as set out in a statement in mitigation prepared for the subsequent confiscation proceedings, the offences had started in September 1996 when he stole &#163;1,000:</p>

I did it several more times for the same reasons but slowly became addicted to stealing the money.

So the net equity, after allowing for notional sale costs of 3%, is &#163;139,635. In May 2003 the mortgagee had issued possession proceedings in the Willesden County Court. A possession order was made on 18 August 2003. The husband applied to have the possession order set aside on the ground that he had not had proper notice of the proceedings. That application was struck out by the District Judge on 4 December 2003 and on the next day, 5 December 2003, the building society wrote to the wife announcing its intention to obtain a warrant for possession. Eventually, however, in February 2004, the wife was able on the basis of the income support she was receiving, and with some help from her relatives, to reach an accommodation with the mortgagee (I need not go into the details. The negotiations can be followed though correspondence which for present purposes began with a letter from the building society to the wife&#8217;s solicitors dated 13 June 2003 and ended with another letter from the building society dated 11 February 2004.) So the home was saved, at least for the time being.</p>

In September 2003 the wife surrendered some policies with Legal &amp; General and received &#163;2,601.05. The same month the husband surrendered his policies with Legal &amp; General and received &#163;2,676.38 (using the money, it would seem, to fund a university course on which he had enrolled).

Mr Matthew Brett on his behalf submits that the bankruptcy order was properly made and that there is no basis for it to be annulled. The husband denies that his petition was designed to frustrate the wife&#8217;s ancillary relief claims but asserts that, as a matter of law, the question of motive is immaterial to the question of whether the bankruptcy order was properly made. He says that he made full and truthful disclosure to the bankruptcy court. He says that a bankruptcy order was virtually inevitable, if not on his own petition then on the petition of a creditor. Given the state of their finances, the fact that neither of them was working and the fact that he had no income, there was no way the debts could have been paid without recourse to the equity in the matrimonial home, and, he says, it is inconceivable that the wife would have agreed to him paying the debts out of the equity of the property. She has throughout, after all, sought the whole of the property for herself. He was therefore on 20 October 2003, he says, &#8220;unable to pay his debts&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/272" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 272</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Insolvency Act 1986</ref>.</p>

Otherwise he will simply be made bankrupt again. From the husband&#8217;s point of view, therefore, he says, it does not make very much difference whether or not his bankruptcy is annulled. But on either basis there is, he says, no way in which a sale of the matrimonial home can be avoided.</p>

This is relevant for two quite different purposes. First, and before embarking upon the exercise of my discretionary jurisdiction under the 1973 Act, I have to know what is available for distribution. Equally important, however, it goes to the crucial question of whether or not the husband was able to pay his debts at the time he issued his petition in bankruptcy in 2003.</p>

The money has all gone, he says, even if it is no longer possible to be precise as to when and how it has all been spent. I am inclined to believe what the husband says.

All the indications, moreover, are that there is no hidden money. I do not think that the husband, who came over as rather pathetic and limited, would have had the imagination, or indeed the capacity, to squirrel away large sums of money. And if he had had access to hidden funds in the summer and autumn of 2003, then surely he would have used some of those funds to fob off the most pressing of his creditors and keep them at bay. After all, most of them indicated that they were prepared to consider any proposals that he might wish to put forward with a view to meeting his liabilities. And there is nothing in the picture of his rather sad existence in his parents&#8217; house &#8211; tolerated but hardly welcomed &#8211; to suggest that he is somehow managing to live the life of Reilly at the expense of his creditors and his wife. </p>

I have no doubt that this is the proper interpretation of the phrase in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/272" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 272</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. One of the justifications for this interpretation, quite apart from the sanctity of contract, is to avoid just the sort of prevarication that potentially derives from an excess of assets over liabilities, but a lack of liquidity. The counterpart to this approach to solvency is that even if one&#8217;s liabilities exceed one&#8217;s assets on a balance sheet basis, it does not follow that a person is insolvent, albeit that it is all the more likely to result in the state of the individual&#8217;s relations with his bankers constituting the ultimate test of solvency.&#8221;</p>

Initially he rested this argument solely on the ground that the proper inference from the facts must be that the debtor's motive or purpose was not that of protecting himself from undue pressure by creditors, or to secure a fair distribution of his assets between them, but to baulk the claim the wife was making for a transfer of property order. In my judgment, however, even if this were his main or sole motive (and it may well be that it was) still that cannot alone make the petition an abuse of process. But then Mr. Muir Hunter submitted that the petition was an abuse of process if at the time the debtor believed that he was able to pay his debts or filed his petition without directing his mind to that question one way or the other. There is, however, in my view no evidence to establish either of those postulates. I turn back to the question whether he was in fact able to pay his debts.&#8221;</p>

An administration order is a class remedy for the benefit of the company&#8217;s creditors &#8230; The fact that the making of an administration order may thwart the genuine claims of a third party is not a reason for not making it &#8230; It frequently happens that a purpose of the making of an administration order is to stop the prosecution of legal proceedings against the company's property.

Here the circumstances were very different. The bankruptcy order was made three days before the first appointment, many months at the very least before it would be realistic to expect any final determination of the ancillary relief proceedings. Moreover, as Mr Brett says, it is inconceivable that the wife would have agreed to the husband paying off his debts out of the equity in the property, something that in reality could probably have been achieved only by a sale. For what lender would want to lend to a divorcing couple neither of whom was working and who were already saddled with a very substantial mortgage. </p>

Any order I might make would, in my judgment, have to make provision for the payment of the debts owing to the commercial creditors and it is difficult to see how (unless members of the wife&#8217;s family were willing to come to her rescue) this could be achieved without a sale of the matrimonial home.</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">So any ancillary relief order is liable to be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the husband is made bankrupt within the next five years: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/341" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 341</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Insolvency Act 1986</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a further issue which would have arisen had I decided to annul the bankruptcy order: the matter of the trustee in bankruptcy&#8217;s costs. The starting point is that if, as here, an annulment application is made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/282/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 282(1)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Insolvency Act 1986</ref>, then it is the petitioner &#8211; usually the petitioning creditor, sometimes (as here) the debtor himself &#8211; who should pay the trustees&#8217; costs of the bankruptcy if there is an annulment: <span style="font-style:italic">Butterworth v Soutter </span>[2000] BPIR 582 at page 585. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event of the annulment application being successful, the trustee in bankruptcy sought an order that the husband to pay his costs (including his legal costs) of administering the husband&#8217;s estate. But he also sought an order giving him a first charge on the husband&#8217;s assets to secure those costs, on the basis that the charge, as I understand it, should rank ahead of any award made to the wife under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>. I can see the force of the latter submission. And in any event, even if I refused to give the trustee the charge he was seeking, there would presumably be nothing to prevent him petitioning for the husband&#8217;s bankruptcy on the basis of his unpaid costs and then attacking my order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/339" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 339</ref>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So there are powerful arguments for saying that any order I might have made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> would have had to make provision, one way or another, not merely for the debts owing to the husband&#8217;s commercial creditors but also for the costs payable by him to the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>

What is pretty apparent, however, is that the wife&#8217;s attempt to preserve the matrimonial home was probably always doomed to failure and that the result of these ruinously expensive proceedings has been to diminish very drastically indeed the part of the &#8216;matrimonial pot&#8217; which remains available for distribution to the parties. </p>
