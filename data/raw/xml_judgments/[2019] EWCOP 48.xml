The family has a history of involvement with the applicant Local Authority, the London Borough of Southwark. NP has been on a child protection plan, under the category of &#8216;neglect&#8217; since August 2018. During the course of their assessments the Local Authority received information that NP had been sexually abused by a male whom the mother had invited in to the family home. The Local Authority regard M as being entirely uncooperative with the services provided for the family.  </p>

It requires to be said that her condition has, periodically, reached life-threatening concern. In hospital NP was persuaded to submit to a re-feeding programme and within a few days she was assessed as ready for discharge. The hospital however, considered it unsafe for NP to be discharged into M&#8217;s care because of her strikingly ambivalent support for the refeeding regimen. Additionally, the home conditions are described as &#8216;squalid&#8217;. Ms Scott, who appears on behalf of the Local Authority, summarises the concerns, at this time, thus: </p>

She was noted to be unkempt, frail and her general level of hygiene caused real cause for concern. She was observed to resort frequently to talking in a whisper. This was not however, continuous and the social worker, Ms Carleen Leslie, records that some professionals had speculated as to whether NP is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;selectively mute&#8217;. </span>The records reveal that those responsible for NP&#8217;s care were concerned about the dynamic of the mother and daughter relationship. It was noted that M had been unhelpful in supporting NP to eat. I note that in recent </p>

Of particular note is a recording that M complained that NP was being encouraged to eat <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;too much&#8217;. </span> The records reveal that M described the refeeding programme as being like <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the amount an obese person would eat&#8217;</span>. This led to the consultant paediatrician and the social worker concluding that it would not be appropriate for NP to return to M&#8217;s care. M&#8217;s counsel, Mr Nesbitt QC informs me that she disputes a number of these key observations made by different professionals and asserts that they arise from general misunderstanding and confusion. </p>

She was transported by a vehicle which permitted her to remain seated in her wheelchair. Ms Leslie recalls that on arrival NP did not speak or interact with staff members beyond nodding her head and speaking in the whisper that I have described. In the intervening period NP has continued to attend her appointments with the NHS Foundation Trust at the Maudsley Hospital with a senior clinical psychologist, Dr Rachel Loomes and a Consultant Child and Adolescent psychiatrist, Dr Darren Cuthina.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Initially, the plan had been for NP to stay at the residential unit on an interim basis until a bed could be identified at an eating disorder clinic. On arrival at the residential unit NP&#8217;s weight was reported to be 31.1 kilogrammes. She declined all reintroductory small meals, preferring nutritional supplements (fortisips) of which she would take eight a day and diet coke. However, following a health appointment on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2019 NP agreed to resume eating <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;normal food&#8217;</span>. The plan was that she would take seventy five percent of her calories in this way and the remainder by the supplement drinks. This agreement appears to have been an agreed compromise arising from NP&#8217;s refusal to be admitted to an eating disorder clinic. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Of note is that NP and M have failed to participate with the review processes put in place. In July 2019 M contacted Ms Leslie&#8217;s manager to explain that NP would not be consenting to a Looked After Child health review. I record that Ms Leslie&#8217;s statement, prepared for this hearing reads: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;however NP later provided her consent to having a health review as she said this had been requested by her mother&#8217;s solicitor&#8217;. </span>In the early weeks of her time at the unit it is recorded that NP would frequently take trips outside of the placement to the local shops and shopping centre. She was accompanied by staff. However, in August 2019, NP refused to leave her room other than for appointments or college. The reality, therefore, was that she spent most of the day in her room with the curtains drawn entertaining herself with her electronic devices. NP and her mother are often seen whispering together. The staff however, consider that M does try to encourage her daughter to go out. On Saturday 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019 M brought the family dog and they went for a walk in the park. </p>

Whilst there she will not eat but does take the fortisips, water and diet coke. She is putting on weight at a rate of between 500 grams and 1 kilogramme per week. This illuminates a striking contrast between NP&#8217;s failure to gain weight whilst living with her mother between April and June and her consistent improvement whilst cared for by professionals. M asserts that NP was eating with her in exactly the same way that she had been in the unit. This, as Dr Cutinha pointed out in his evidence, to which I will refer shortly, can simply not have been the case. Following my order on </p>

Whilst there was some ambiguity in respect of aspects of NP&#8217;s decision-making capacity, this became settled during Dr Cutinha&#8217;s evidence. Ms Paterson distils the Official Solicitor&#8217;s position in relation to NP&#8217;s best interests in crisp and unambiguous terms <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the OS considers that NP should remain at the residential unit. The increase in her weight while resident there, is in stark contrast to her potentially life-threatening weight loss whilst she was living with her mother. Furthermore, the description of the family home suggests that the environment itself presents a threat to NP&#8217;s wellbeing. It is also unclear whether NP would still be at continued risk of emotional and or sexual abuse if she returned to live with her mother.&#8217;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">At the hearing, on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019, the parties and the Court were, as Ms Paterson correctly reminds me, dealing with a crisis. NP&#8217;s long-term health and indeed her life were in peril. Accordingly, the orders made on that day reflect the need to act urgently but they do not establish any litigation case management. I agree with Ms Paterson that detailed directions would have been difficult in those circumstances. As Dr Cutinha described it, the objective in June was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;to put out the fire&#8217;</span>. In the days before this hearing the Official Solicitor recognised that nothing had been done in the interim, by way of updating the court, in a way which would enable it to take informed decisions for the immediate future. Thus, an ex parte written application was made for me to permit the filing of a statement by Dr Cutinha expressing his opinions both in the sphere of welfare and capacity issues and to provide for disclosure of records and assessments. I entirely understand why this was done. I granted the application on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019 (the date the application was received). In my remarks below, I do not intend to be critical of anybody at all, quite the contrary. However, the situation illustrates a problem that is particularly acute in cases concerning anorexia but also has much more general application, namely the challenge to the Court of Protection in ensuring that decision making is driven by P&#8217;s needs and not the exigencies of the litigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Despite these valiant efforts to share relevant information in anticipation of the forthcoming hearing, significant features of the material that I have reviewed above was not available to Dr Cutinha. Accordingly, he finds himself making recommendations, for example in relation to the extent of NP&#8217;s contact with M, with only partial information. I have previously commented (see: <span style="font-weight:bold">London Borough of Tower Hamlets v NB (consent to sex) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2019/27" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCOP 27" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCOP 27</ref>)</span> on the<span style="font-size:10pt"/>danger of what I have called <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;conceptual silos&#8217;</span>, in which parties/experts/professionals fail adequately to share information which will inform their own decision making. This I emphasise again, is not intended to be a criticism here but, I hope, a constructive observation. It is rooted in the difficulty that the Court of Protection has in adhering to established case management processes. This arises, as I have alluded to above, in consequence of the dynamic nature of the cases that come, particularly, before the Tier 3 Courts and which frequently involve (as here) a reaction to crisis.  I address this in greater detail in para<span style="font-weight:bold"/>30 et seq., below. </p>

This, he said is an informal term for Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorder (OSFED) in the DSM-V Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Edition, American Psychiatric Association.<span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"/>He considered the diagnosis &#8216;Atypical&#8217; because of NP&#8217;s presentation, history and clinical features.

It was unclear about the presence, strength, or severity of NP&#8217;s eating disorder <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;cognitions&#8217;</span>. Dr Cutinha wondered, to some degree, whether it was possible that NP&#8217;s weight loss had been due to other emotional, social or <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;relational factors&#8217;</span>, or a combination of them, rather than an eating disorder.<span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"/>The fact that NP has been able to gain weight relatively easily and quickly, with minimal resistance, has added further weight to the working diagnosis that NP&#8217;s presentation is atypical. </p>

If I may say so, his willingness to vary his own professional arrangements and his obvious desire better to understand how he could most constructively assist the Court of Protection was extremely impressive, as is his obvious professionalism and expertise. He told me that the treating team received the case in crisis and that their first job was to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;try to put out the fire&#8217;</span>. In this he echoed (though he had not heard it himself) Ms Paterson&#8217;s observation in respect of the Court&#8217;s approach at the June 2019 hearing.  Dr Cutinha analysed the focus as having now changed to seeking to identify the underlying cause of the disorder. </p>

It plainly altered the whole framework of NP&#8217;s life and it seems clear to me, from what I have read, that her grief was intense. She would have been sixteen years old. Dr Cutinha was asked whether there had been any indicators of eating disorder before that. Absent the medical records it is difficult to see how he could answer that question with any confidence. I am bound to say, that in an equivalent enquiry in the Family Division disclosure of this material to the doctors would automatically be considered. Additionally, in some eating disorder cases there may be unnoticed physiological or contributory factors. This too may be illuminated by sight of the medical records. I have already indicated to Ms Paterson that I consider that the records should be obtained here and shown to the treating clinicians. My impression of Dr Cutinha is that he saw the sense of this and is open-minded.</p>

Despite the positive progress that NP has been making, he considers her eating continues to be very restricted. For example, so far, it has not been possible to persuade NP to replace her supplement drinks with normal / solid food. She has been unable to increase the range and variety of her food. NP says that when she gets to a weight where she can maintain her weight, she would not want to eat any more normal / solid food than she is eating now. </p>

NP&#8217;s BMI then was 12.0. Whilst NP was staying at home, NP&#8217;s mother had always maintained that she had been giving NP all the food that was on the meal plan that we recommended and NP was eating it all. However, NP did not gain any significant amount of weight whilst receiving treatment at home.  </span></p>

NP&#8217;s meal plan was increased to 3000kcal / day. This is more than our standard weight gaining meal plan of 2500kcal / day. NP&#8217;s weight still did not increase, even though NP was reported as eating everything on her meal plan. It was not clear whether NP&#8217;s mother was not giving her the food, not supervising NP&#8217;s eating, NP was refusing to eat, hiding food, or vomiting after meals, or some combination of all of these factors. NP&#8217;s mother never reported that NP was resisting her attempts to support her eating. Similarly, there were no concerns about hiding food. NP had vomited after meals on one or two occasions, however, this was not being a regular occurrence.&#8217; </span></p>

Quite what has happened was a matter of speculation but Dr Cutinha hypothesised that NP may have found it difficult to eat at home because of a post-traumatic stress disorder relating to the sexual abuse she alleges within the home. The reasoning behind this being that she may associate home with trauma and feel unable to eat. It is observed that when in </p>

I do not seek in any way to undermine the hypothesis but I am struck by the fact that at college, which NP plainly enjoys, she will only take the fortisips, water and diet coke. I was also told when she came to court that she declined her breakfast, any lunch or any liquid throughout the day. I should record also, that it was apparently her decision to come to court. I had not been expecting her attendance.  </p>

Dr Cutinha is not particularly concerned by that at present, his experience being that such treatment is likely to be far more effective when patients are restored to a reasonable weight. He reminds me and I consider it to be important to highlight to the variety of professionals who may read this judgment, NP continues to be very underweight, notwithstanding her positive progress. In the three months from April to June 2019, when NP was being treated as an out-patient, she was only able to acquire 0.2 kilograms. In the three months from June to this hearing she has gained 9.1 kilograms. This simple fact, to my mind, speaks volumes. Moreover, having reviewed the records from the unit Dr Cutinha notes that NP has always managed to complete her meal plan satisfactorily. There have been no concerns about NP resisting attempts to help her eat, hiding food or vomiting after meals. To date, she has not lost any weight.  </p>

She finds it difficult to eat in front of other people, and she says that if she needed to maintain weight, once reaching a healthy weight, she would not want to eat more than the amount of normal food that she is currently having. </p>

Dr Cutinha thought that the relationship with her mother eclipsed NP&#8217;s capacity to process her reasoning. NP also wishes to be able to re-join her brothers and this too was considered to impact on her capacity to weigh up risk.  I should record, though it is no longer an issue that needs to be determined, NP was assessed as having capacity to choose between her current placement and an Eating Disorder unit. In this, it was noted she could understand, recall, communicate and evaluate pertinent information to make these decisions.  </p>

I confess however, that I do not find it easy to understand why this would not be a global consideration i.e. across the whole sphere of NP&#8217;s decision-making. It plainly is not, given the above. However, the relationship between NP and her mother is extremely troubling and I accept that it impacts significantly on her capacity to understand the potential consequences to her treatment if she were to return home.  </p>

Her physical presentation had also changed. She seemed less upright and confident. She proffered no explanation for her change of decision. What was striking to me is that before lunch she had seemed quite insistent on speaking to me privately. From what I had read I was not expecting her to generate an application to speak to me.

Their mutual gaze remained almost entirely uninterrupted throughout the whole of Dr Cutinha&#8217;s telephone evidence. It was intense, dramatic indeed almost melodramatic. NP watched her mother&#8217;s reaction to what Dr Cutinha was saying. There was virtually no reaction on M&#8217;s part but I noticed on two occasions that she raised her eyebrows where she did not agree with his evidence and withdrew her smile. It was subtle and barely perceptible but it was, in my view, a calculated antilocution. M&#8217;s counsel, Mr Nesbitt, saw none of this and urges me not to give it any weight. I consider it would be irresponsible to disregard it, particularly as the mother / daughter dynamic is so central to the case. I record my observations in order that they are not lost but I go no further than interpreting them as a facet of a relationship which appears to the professionals to be off kilter or dysfunctional. It also requires to be said that the evidence points to Ms Leslie being rather more alert to this than Dr Cutinha. Ms Leslie&#8217;s concerns were put to the doctor in cross-examination. He seemed perturbed by them but was, for understandable reasons, unable to process their potential significance in the witness box. </p>

In a court arena where conflicts of expert evidence arise regularly and in which such evidence is commonplace this is, to my mind, very unusual. Additionally, I note that I am rarely called on to make Disclosure Orders and have frequently been concerned by blockages in channels of communication which ought otherwise to have been regarded as integral to informed decision taking. At real risk of labouring the point, I emphasise again that I am not here intending to be critical.

	      <p style="margin-left:1.27in;margin-right:0.03in">In Court of Protection proceedings, the Court will frequently be asked to take evidence from treating clinicians. Invariably, (again especially at Tier 3) these will be individuals of experience and expertise who in other cases might easily find themselves instructed independently as experts. Treating clinicians have precisely the same obligations and duties upon them, when preparing reports and giving evidence as those independently instructed. Further, it is the obligation of the lawyers to ensure that these witnesses are furnished with all relevant material which is likely to have an impact on their views, conclusions and recommendations. (see: <span style="font-weight:bold">Re C Interim Judgment: Expert Evidence) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2018/89" uk:canonical="[2018] EWFC 89" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWFC 89</ref></span>). This should not merely be regarded as good litigation practice but as indivisible from the effective protection of P&#8217;s welfare and autonomy;</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.27in;margin-right:0.03in">Evidence of clinicians, experts, social workers, care specialists etc is always to be regarded as individual features of a broader forensic landscape in to which must be factored the lay evidence. One expert or clinician is unlikely ever to provide the entire answer to the case (see: <span style="font-weight:bold">Re T <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 838" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 838</ref></span>). It follows that Experts meetings or Professionals meetings should always be considered as a useful tool to share information and to identify areas of agreement and / or disagreement;</p>

In considering the evidence, it is always helpful to reflect that yesterday&#8217;s orthodoxies may become today&#8217;s heresies.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">for the period of that treatment. The preponderant evidence points compellingly against the inclusion of M in any of NP&#8217;s therapy at present. NP is still very underweight and there is significant evidence to suggest that M has been ambivalent in the encouragement of the regime designed to promote NP&#8217;s return to a healthy weight. Similarly, given the progress that has been made so far, I do not consider that the time has yet come to increase NP&#8217;s contact with her mother. This mother / daughter dynamic requires to be more fully explored by the relevant professionals. It has already been identified as potentially associated, in some way, with the cause of the underlying disorder. It is undoubtedly a fact that NP does not thrive in her mother&#8217;s household. To promote the relationship in the way suggested strikes me as having the real potential to send entirely the wrong messages to NP and to jeopardise the progress she has made, which ought properly to be identified as tentative. Investigation of the mother and daughter relationship requires careful and properly considered planning. Any alteration to the core arrangements presently in place is, in my judgement, pre-emptive. Ms Paterson has suggested that the case should return to the Court in November. I agree. I should be grateful if counsel, having regard to what I have said in paras 30 et seq., would draw up draft case management directions. </p>
