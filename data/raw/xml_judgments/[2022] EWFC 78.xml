I made this order having found as a fact that the English Court was the court first seised of divorce process.  I found then that the divorce petition was &#8220;lodged&#8221; with the English Court on 12 January 2020, several weeks before the husband&#8217;s petition had been lodged in the courts of Bulgaria (4 February 2020).</p>

The parties have been litigating for more than 2 years, in England and Bulgaria, principally over issues of jurisdiction and interim relief concerning the dissolution of the marriage and arrangements for their child. There is little to show for their efforts. Neither party has shown any real restraint in how they have placed material before the court; they have been indifferent to court-imposed timetables and/or restrictions on the volume of documentary material lodged, and have shown questionable focus on the actual issues.  The hearing of the husband&#8217;s application was given a time estimate of 2 hours.  I heard oral submissions, and both before and after the hearing have considered the 1,000 or more pages of submissions and evidence in order to reach a view.</p>

On 4 February 2020, the father applied for a divorce (and child arrangements and financial relief) through the Bulgarian Court. Confusingly, on 21 February the English Court issued a second divorce petition on the mother's application (bearing the same case number). The mother claims that the Bulgarian divorce proceedings have not been served on her, a fact disputed by the father who points out that the mother applied successfully on 16 March 2020 within the Bulgarian proceedings for those proceedings to be transferred to her local court. The father has confirmed, by an Answer filed in England on 16 March, his intention to defend the English divorce proceedings on the basis of the divorce proceedings in Bulgaria; the English divorce proceedings have therefore currently been stayed.&#8221;</p>

They plainly sought evidence which (a) would explain the anomaly of two petitions apparently being issued in the English Court, and (b) would unsettle my finding that the wife&#8217;s divorce petition was lodged (within the meaning of <span style="font-style:italic">Article 16 BIIR</span>) on 12 January 2020.  They have obtained copies of most of the documents which were contained in the Family Court file (I myself went through the file in its entirety and ordered the release of a significant number of the documents), and with my permission they have obtained further printouts from the FamilyMan system (this is the Family Court&#8217;s Case Management System).</p>

By way of example, it has been confirmed to the court by the Operations Manager at the relevant Court and Tribunal Service Centre (CTSC) (at which HMCTS provides centralised administration in the processing of divorce applications) that automatically generated e-mails sent by the CTSC to the wife in January/February 2020 &#8220;will not be retrievable.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reproduce the salient parts of this communication here because Mr Birch relies on the use of the words &#8220;rejected state&#8221; in the narrative above as signifying the CTSC&#8217;s repudiation of the petition completely. As will be later apparent, that is not, in my finding; it appears that there was (contrary to the position now) no confidential document holding space on the digital system, and therefore nowhere for the administrators at the CTSC then to &#8216;file&#8217; a petition which requested the storage of confidential information.  I do not find that this means that the petition was refused; the e-mail is clear that the CTSC had moved the petition &#8220;into a status awaiting clarification from the Petitioner&#8221;, taking no subsequent step (such as returning the fee) to indicate that this was indeed the CTSC&#8217;s intention.  I should add in preparing the chronology above, I have drawn on the original and contemporaneous documents materials, and not on the comments or interpretations offered by the HMCTS employees which are contained in subsequent e-mails to counsel and to NP.  </p>

It is not a matter for me to determine whether, as a matter of Bulgarian law, the petition was or was not effectively lodged in that country on 4 February.  Moreover, it would be quite wrong for me to go behind Judge Kostadinova&#8217;s ruling (quoted in &#167;30 of my earlier judgment) in which she said that: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000">The proceedings in the present case were instituted by the claimant [NP] on 04.02.2020&#8221;.</span></p>
