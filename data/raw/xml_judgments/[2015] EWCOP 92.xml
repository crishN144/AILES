He confirmed that NB&#8217;s placement at P House could be kept open for a shared care arrangement but he questioned how well outreach staff would be able to cope with transition journeys because they would not know NB well, explaining that NB had &#8220;said &#8216;no&#8217;&#8221; to two agency staff whom he had tried to recruit. It was his view that &#8220;leaving home is different to leaving class&#8230;it&#8217;s a different level of anxiety&#8221; for NB. When asked by Mr Reeder, he agreed that a shared care arrangement &#8220;creates more risk&#8221; of encountering behavioural challenges such as might lead to breakdown of the placement at P House. </p>

I have no doubt at all of the strength and sincerity of VW&#8217;s wish to have NB live with her, or her belief that this would be in NB&#8217;s best interests. It is very clear to me that VW loves NB, wants to do her best for her, and is willing (in Mr Reeder&#8217;s words) to &#8220;step up to the mark&#8221; for her. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">However, it is also clear to me that the relationship between VW and NB is informed by their historical separations. They have lived apart longer than they have lived together, and VW expresses a conviction that such separation will be overcome (in respect of all her children) with a sense of grievance. In return it is common ground between the parties that NB is particularly demanding of her mother&#8217;s sole attention. In reality, the demands of caring for NB are great. The practical experience of living together since NB returned to the family home on reaching majority is that there have already been two occasions (in March 2014 and in April 2015) when VW felt unable actually to provide the care which NB requires. Faced with competing demands, VW was not able to give NB&#8217;s needs priority. I agree with Mr. McKinstrie and Ms. Ezekiel, that there must be a significant risk that VW would again reach a point of feeling unable to cope, with further emotionally damaging consequences for NB. </p>

Her most recent written wish was to &#8220;leave P House and go to a different care home or live with family&#8221; (C610). Ms. Ezekiel considers that she really now wants to live somewhere other than P House where she will be cared for.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Weighing all of the advantages and disadvantages of each option in the balance, I consider that the risks inherent in the shared care proposal significantly outweigh the benefits; and the disadvantages of remaining at P House whilst a permanent placement is found are less grave. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">VW may of course ask why, if there was nearly a shared care arrangement by consent in April, can there not be shared care now? The answer is in the changed circumstances. Unfortunately, NB&#8217;s life does not stand still whilst court proceedings are underway. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">In April this year, there was an urgent need to move from the known <marker name="tab"/>quantity of LG without any other placement having been tried. In those <marker name="tab"/>circumstances, shared care seemed to offer relative stability and security. In a <marker name="tab"/>situation of very limited options, it seemed to provide &#8220;the least worse&#8221; <marker name="tab"/>option. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">Now the position is different. VW&#8217;s domestic situation is more complicated <marker name="tab"/>&#8211; as she herself recognised when explaining why she subsequently resiled <marker name="tab"/>from the shared care agreement before it could be put into effect. It was her <marker name="tab"/>own considered conclusion (C530) that the shared care would in fact have <marker name="tab"/>broken down. On the other hand, the available alternative is less uncertain. <marker name="tab"/>NB has now tried, and is showing positive signs of settling at P House, so <marker name="tab"/>there is a known quantity against which a return home can be compared. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I acknowledge that these conclusions will come as a disappointment to NB and to VW. I would like to emphasis that the decision is based on NB&#8217;s best interest, not on a view of anyone&#8217;s &#8220;fault.&#8221; VW gave evidence with determination, and without wavering. She did her best to &#8220;step up to the mark.&#8221; I urge her now to do her best again to help NB accept the court&#8217;s decision, as she indicated she would. VW still has an important role to play in NB&#8217;s future. </p>
