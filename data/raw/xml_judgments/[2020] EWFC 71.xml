	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">This case has now been running for over 15 months since the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019 when the Intervenors, understandably, took safe-guarding measures in respect of Child S, then 13 months old. The hearing itself has lasted over two months, with breaks. I have heard and read a great deal of evidence and also written and oral submissions on behalf of the parties and intervenors. The whole process has, for a variety of reasons, taken far longer than is desirable. In the circumstances, I do not wish to keep the parties in suspense a moment longer than is necessary. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Having given full and careful consideration to the evidence and the arguments on both sides, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the local authority have proved their case in respect of the various findings sought. Even if I had been satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the medical evidence, in isolation, pointed towards non-accidental injuries (and I will return to that in more detail in due course), it would, at best, have been marginal, and the &#8220;wider canvas&#8221;, namely the extensive, and almost wholly positive evidence about these parents and their relationship with their children, would have pushed me back across the line to a point where I could not be satisfied to the necessary standard. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Putting it in a slightly different way, the positive evidence about this family is so strong that it would have taken very clear medical evidence to persuade me that these parents (or at least one of them, with a degree of collusion from the other) had serially abused their child. That is the way the local authority&#8217;s case is now put. I find that the medical evidence is nowhere near clear enough for that, for reasons which I will elaborate on later. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">I can probably do no better than to refer to the written closing submissions on behalf of the parents, and say that I accept those submissions. The final paragraph of those submissions is particularly  telling , with its three quotes. The first was from Childminder 3, third intervenor, the child-minder who saw and reported the bruising on Child S which led ultimately to these proceedings. I accept that she is a thoroughly decent and honest woman, and independent of the parents. When asked, if the clock had stopped at 11.45 on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019 (before she saw the bruises), how would she have described the C family, she said &#8220;a really good family, a lovely family.&#8221; </p>

It was clearly a very child-orientated home, even though the children have not been living there for the last 15 months. I wish I saw more images like that during the course of my Care work. Unsurprisingly, children from such homes are rarely the subject of Care proceedings. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.25in">Although the focus of this case has been events concerning Child S (now 2 years and 4 months old), it is very relevant that Child S is the second child of his parents, the First and Second Respondents. Their first child, Child P was born on the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2015, and is now approaching 5 years old. There have never been any problems or concerns relating to Child P. She has not, so far as I am aware, had any particular medical issues. She has never come to the attention of Social Services, except in the context of these proceedings, which started when she was already over 2 &#189; years old and started only because of events concerning her younger brother, Child S. Child P was, and remains, a happy little girl who loves her parents and wants to be with them (see the quotes above). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Child S was born on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018, and is now approaching 2 &#189; years old. So far as the outside world was aware, he, like  his older sister, was a happy, contented child (the evidence of the child-minders) from a happy family (the quote from Childminder 3, above). For the first 13 months of his life, he never came to the attention of Social Services or the police. He did have some medical issues, but it is now clear that, despite the  originally incomplete medical chronologies from the two consultant paediatricians, Dr Robinson and Dr Fonfe, he was highly visible to medical services. Of course, the local authority make much of an alleged failure by the parents to seek medical attention for the &#8220;problem&#8221; that Child S appeared to have, at least for a time, with being placed on an adult&#8217;s hip (I will return to that), but the fact remains that he was seen on many occasions by medical professionals, who raised no concerns. In particular, between September and November 2018 (when aged around 6 months), Child S was taken to see various doctors in relation to problems with his arms.  </p>

Childminder 1 told me about her responsibilities and knowledge connected with child-minding, and told me, with understandable pride, about her &#8220;outstanding&#8221; Ofsted reports. It was, of course, Childminder 3 and then Childminder 1 who &#8220;raised the alarm&#8221; when bruises were seen on Child S on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019. Prior to that, although they had seen some  (relatively minor) bruising which they did not feel it necessary to report, they had seen nothing to cause them any concern in relation to Child S (or indeed Child P). </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">One of the most striking features of this case is the lack of any of the usual signs which the courts so frequently see in cases of physical abuse of children: in no particular order, parents who have drink or drug problems, evidence of neglect, parents who have anger-management problems or who have a known history of violence, often including domestic violence, repeated failures to keep medical appointments. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list. None of that applies in this case. </p>

The mother accepts she is very forthright. That is demonstrated by some of the texts I have seen. In my view that pales into insignificance compared with the picture we often see in physical abuse cases. </p>

Fortunately for them, most of them will not have had their lives dissected in the way that Mr and Mrs C have in this case. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">For the rest, up until the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019, the Cs gave every appearance to the outside world of being a perfectly normal, happy family who loved their children and cared for them. The question for me now is whether that was, in large part, an illusion; whether the matters which came to light as a result of the investigation which commenced on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April have now established, at least on a balance of probabilities, that one or both of these parents was a serial abuser, who had caused a large number of fractures and bruises to Child S, then only recently turned a year old. The case for the local authority is that this was not just an isolated incident of loss of control. There must have been a large number of separate applications of force to cause the 16 fractures in a variety of different locations. Indeed, according to Professor Offiah, on whom the local authority rely heavily, the likely explanation of the unusual appearance of the fracture sites on the X-ray images at the time of the second skeletal survey in June 2020 was that most of the fracture sites had been subjected to fracture upon fracture; the growth plates had been damaged, and the metaphyseal fractures had not undergone the rapid (within about 6 weeks) and complete healing process which would normally be expected. That therefore suggests a very large number of fractures indeed, all inflicted on Child S by the time he was just turned 13 months old. In addition, extensive investigations revealed the various historic instances of bruising to Child S which have been referred to throughout the case. The local authority say that the bruises seen at &#8220;The Childminders&#8221; on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019 were only the last (although the most serious) of a long list of bruises seen on Child S from the age of 4 weeks (the jawline bruises in the parents&#8217; own photographs). The local authority say there is good evidence that those were non-accidental injuries which can also be laid at the door of one or both of the parents. They therefore submit that the evidence shows a pattern of abuse starting no later than when Child S was 4 weeks old, and extending up until the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019, when the extensive bruises on Child S, and subsequently the many fractures, were discovered. </p>

They now say, in the light of the medical evidence, that Child S must have a propensity to fracture easily, but they were never aware that he had suffered fractures until the fractures were revealed by the first skeletal survey. </p>

In the absence of any evidence of an underlying medical condition which explained Child S&#8217;s injuries, the medical experts agreed that they were likely, on a balance of probabilities, to be non-accidental, and therefore inflicted. If that had remained the case, I might have been driven to the conclusion for which the local authority (and the Guardian) still contend. Even then, I would have had to consider the wider canvas which, given the matters I referred to earlier, would have drawn me away from the conclusion suggested by the local authority, but may still have left me in a position where the case was very finely balanced. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In the mean-time, the picture has changed dramatically in terms of the medical evidence. Thanks to Dr Fonfe, part-way through the hearing, Child S underwent a second skeletal survey. That produced a number of unexpected findings, which were set out in the report of Dr Olsen at E438-443. There was then a Multi-disciplinary team meeting (MDT) in which all the experts save Professor Offiah participated. Although the experts present spoke of wanting to hear from Professor Offiah, in her absence, the overall picture appeared to have changed considerably. Three points struck me in relation to that MDT meeting. Firstly, Dr Olsen was clearly very concerned about what he considered to be very unusual aspects of the images from the new skeletal survey. Secondly, Dr Robinson referred to the fact that, although metaphyseal fractures were relatively common in infants, they were rare in 1-2 yearolds (Child S was 13 months on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019, and twice that age by the second skeletal survey) (E502C). That meant that the absence of evidence of new fractures since Child S had been in alternative care suddenly appeared much less significant: the great majority of his original fractures were metaphyseal fractures, so he would have been unlikely to suffer further similar fractures in any event. Dr Robinson accepted that. (E502C) </p>

Miss Lee, in her closing submissions, appears to take the view that everything has fallen back into place (in terms of the evidence relating to fractures). I do not agree. Dr Olsen, a very experienced consultant paediatric radiologist from the highly-regarded Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, was very clear that he saw &#8220;red flags&#8221; on the second skeletal survey, anomalies which caused him concern. He pointed, very astutely, to the fact that it was for the Applicant to prove that there was no underlying abnormality and not the other way round (N146). He went on to say that there were a number of features of the appearances on the second skeletal survey which were &#8220;not the most typical&#8221;, and that he was &#8220;very unhappy with concluding that all of these are just independent random rare findings.&#8221; He went on to say (at N147) that &#8220;then the person who is the expert, Professor Offiah, says that, in her opinion, there is no known common denominator.&#8221; A little later, he said: &#8220;it remains my opinion that the&#8230;22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May skeletal survey is odd&#8221;. </p>

He was keen to acknowledge the limits of his expertise, but at the same time, he stood firm as to what he had seen, and whether it was unusual. He remained clear, throughout his evidence, that the second skeletal survey threw up a number of &#8220;red flags&#8221; which left him concerned that Child S may have an underlying condition which may have a bearing on the fractures. Given that this is a child who, we know from Dr Saggar&#8217;s evidence, has not one, but two, known genetic anomalies, Dr Olsen&#8217;s evidence puts me firmly into territory where I have to seriously consider the possibility of the &#8220;unknown unknown&#8221; as Dr Saggar referred to it in the MDT meeting. </p>

Professor Offiah was, unfortunately, unable to attend the MDT meeting at which all the other experts discussed the findings from the second skeletal survey. However she subsequently produced a report in which she dealt, individually, with the concerns raised by Dr Olsen (E546 &#8211; 588). She subsequently gave evidence (transcript at N343-N391).

She also said that it could have been caused by only low to medium force. She referred (at N350) to a paper: &#8220;I think one of the papers I had submitted had described a cohort of young infants around Child S&#8217;s age who had these sorts of fractures, as inflicted injuries, which would further support that low to medium force could cause these fractures.&#8221; </p>

A closer reading of that report reveals that it was the alleged perpetrator, the boyfriend of the infant&#8217;s mother, who attributed the fracture to a &#8220;frustrated diapering attempt&#8221;. I do not attach any significant weight to that. It seems to me highly likely that the boyfriend would wish to minimise his responsibility for the baby&#8217;s injuries, and may well have given a false account of how the injury was caused. There is no reference in the report to any independent evidence of the causation of the injury. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Against that back-ground, I find that Professor Offiah&#8217;s assertion that it could be an injury requiring low to medium force, perhaps during a nappy-change, defies common sense as well as the rest of the expert evidence. If Professor Offiah was right about that, then it would surely be a more common injury. Infants are very rarely subjected to high-velocity impacts; but they have their nappies changed very frequently, no doubt often by parents or other carers who are in a hurry, or tired and irritable, or otherwise less careful than they should be. I find that the fact that this kind of injury is so rare in children of Child S&#8217;s age is more consistent with it being a high-velocity injury, (in children with normal bone-strength) as suggested by Mr Fernandes. I find that the fact that Professor Offiah was for saying that it could be inflicted with low to medium force suggests that she was trying too hard to say it was something relatively &#8220;normal&#8221;. I am satisfied from the evidence of the other experts in relation to the severity of this injury that it was an extremely unusual injury, one which, on a balance of probabilities, would have required a high degree of force in a child with normalstrength bones. </p>

	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">As to the metaphyseal fractures, which had not resolved (and therefore disappeared on X-rays) within about 6 weeks, Professor Offiah suggested that they may be the result of &#8220;fracture upon fracture&#8221;. In cross-examination by Miss Lee, (N356), Professor Offiah was asked about &#8220;the number of growth-plate fractures, which was unusual even for him (Dr Olsen).&#8221;  Professor Offiah replied &#8220;I think he&#8217;s right. I think that they are even unusual for me. &#8230;&#8230;.all of his injuries, and we&#8217;re also including the injury of his right femur, were actually quite severe, and I think that they represent recurrent injuries, so the rubbing wasn&#8217;t on one occasion; and I think it may have been injury upon injury, rather than a single injury, so that they were severe, so that there was&#8230;growth plate damage. I find there are two difficulties with this piece of evidence. The first is that Professor Offiah moves from accepting that an appearance was unusual for her, to putting forward a hypothetical explanation (&#8220;&#8230;.I think it <span style="font-style:italic">may have been </span>injury upon injury, rather than a single injury&#8221;). Since Dr Olsen had said that the great majority of Child S&#8217;s fractures (he went through them individually) had that unusual appearance, to a greater or lesser degree, it would follow that Professor Offiah&#8217;s hypothetical explanation (fracture upon fracture) would have to apply to a large number of fractures. In my view that makes it less probable that that hypothetical explanation could be correct: how likely is it that a perpetrator of physical abuse would repeatedly cause fractures at a considerable number of different sites? Of course, that becomes much more probable if the child in question is prone to fractures when subjected to lesser force. If the fractures were caused during normal (or perhaps only slightly rougher than normal) handling, it might explain how there would be fracture upon fracture, if the same handling (e.g. nappy changes, placing into a car-seat, etc,) was repeated. </p>

Either I find it unconvincing, because it does appear purely hypothetical, and flies in the face of the wider picture of loving and caring parents who would be unlikely to serially abuse their child;  alternatively, if I accept that it may be the explanation for the unusual appearances on the skeletal survey, it still suggests to me that there is something very unusual going on. Why, unless an abusive parent was also &#8220;moronic&#8221; (Mr Storey&#8217;s word in his oral submissions) would he or she repeat actions which he/she must have known had caused an injury previously, thereby risking causing a similar injury again, and being caught on this occasion. </p>

Of course, a parent would not be aware of such a problem unless or until it was diagnosed. He or she might be aware that the child sometimes whinged for no obvious reason. But if there had been no memorable event, because the child had been hurt by an amount of force which would not have caused injury to a normal child, there would be no reason for the parent to deduce that the child had, in fact, been hurt. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Unfortunately, I find that Professor Offiah&#8217;s response to those two, crucial issues, undermines the rest of her evidence: since I find that she was trying too hard to find a &#8220;normal&#8221; explanation on those issues, it makes me less prepared to accept her evidence that other matters Dr Olsen found were &#8220;atypical&#8221; were, in fact within the range of &#8220;normal&#8221; findings. My overall view was that she was trying to find &#8220;normal&#8221; explanations rather than giving any serious consideration to the possibility that this may be &#8220;the unknown unknown&#8221;, to use Dr Saggar&#8217;s words from the MDT meeting. The very fact that Professor Offiah was giving a variety of different explanations for findings which Dr Olsen, a very experienced consultant paediatric radiologist, considered to be &#8220;atypical&#8221;, all in the same child, a child we know has genetic anomalies, rings alarm bells.  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">I therefore do not accept that Professor Offiah&#8217;s evidence has moved us back from the position of uncertainty which existed at the end of the MDT meeting (which Professor Offiah did not attend), to a position where all the medical evidence points towards non-accidental injuries. Putting it another way, I am more convinced by Dr Olsen&#8217;s &#8220;red flags&#8221;, coupled with Dr Saggar&#8217;s evidence relating to genetics and Mr Fernandes&#8217; evidence about the force required for the hip fracture, than I am by Professor Offiah&#8217;s attempts to explain them away. Before moving on, I should deal with one aspect of the medical evidence which does not appear to be in dispute. It appears to be agreed that X-rays are not capable of showing significant degrees of de-mineralisation of bones (possibly up to 40%), which would amount to osteopenia or osteoporosis. This could significantly weaken the affected bones, making them more prone to fracture. Thus, none of the medical experts are able to say, simply by looking at the X-ray images, whether or not Child S&#8217;s bones were, in fact significantly de-mineralised (and therefore weakened) at the time of any of the skeletal surveys. That is one of the reasons why we have to look at the surrounding evidence to see whether there is any other evidence of bone fragility which may have played a part in the causation of Child S&#8217;s fractures. </p>

So if he doesn&#8217;t have an underlying abnormality then each of the fractures must have been caused by force that is beyond what you would expect from normal handling, in my opinion.&#8221; Two points flow from that. Firstly, even if Child S was a normal child, with no underlying abnormality, the large majority of his fractures (all the metaphyseal fractures) could be accounted for by incidents involving a relatively low level of force, which may not necessarily be capable of being described as &#8220;abusive&#8221;, or &#8220;non-accidental&#8221;, or &#8220;inflicted&#8221;.

I ask myself, if there were evidence that that incident did, in fact, result in a metaphyseal fracture, would I make a finding of physical harm against the father, based on that incident? I think not: there is no evidence that he was even aware that he might be causing any harm, much less that he intended to do so. Yes, his handling of Child S was sub-optimal, somewhat rough, and yes, he probably used force &#8220;beyond what you would expect from normal handling&#8221; (Dr Olsen, above). But where does one draw the line between handling which is sub-optimal and slightly rough, or careless, and handling which amounts to abuse? There is a temptation to answer that question by saying that you cross the line if the child is injured. But that answer would clearly be wrong. Firstly, you would first have to know the answer to the question of whether the child had normal-strength bones (precisely the point in this case); and secondly, it may well be, from my understanding of all the evidence in this case, that many infants may  suffer metaphyseal fractures which are never diagnosed because they occur through somewhat rough or careless handling, and the child makes a full and rapid recovery without treatment. That would not, on my understanding of Dr </p>

It also seems to follow from this that, at least in respect of metaphyseal fractures,  since they can be caused by relatively low force in normal infants (as discussed by Dr Olsen &#8211; see above),  a child would not need to have  a very serious underlying disorder to lower still further the amount of force required to cause such a fracture, to the point where such a fracture could be caused by normal handling. </p>

The father was &#8220;doing it wrongly&#8221; and Child S was complaining that he did not like it. I doubt whether anybody observing that incident  would have described it as abusive behaviour on the part of the father, or would have thought that Child S was being &#8220;hurt&#8221;  by it. But, with the benefit of hindsight, I find that that is the kind of incident which could have caused an injury to Child S if he had an underlying condition. Indeed Dr Robinson, during the MDT meeting, (at E501G), said that &#8230;&#8221;pulling, twisting, gripping force during that procedure might well have accounted for a metaphyseal fracture.&#8221; </p>

I draw two conclusions from that: firstly, that the father was unaware that he was doing anything inappropriate; and secondly, that he did not have a guilty conscience about anything that had happened to Child S in the past &#8211; or he would have been treating Child S with kid gloves to ensure there was no further evidence against him. </p>

	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">There are three major difficulties with that argument: firstly, most of Child S&#8217;s fractures previously had been metaphyseal fractures.

	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Secondly, we simply cannot say with any real confidence that he was being subjected to the same forces as previously, while in alternative care. For example, we know, from the car-seat incident witnessed by Mrs L on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, that the father is not the most gentle of baby-handlers. Dr Robinson said, in terms, that that incident could have accounted for a metaphyseal fracture. We know equally, from Mrs L&#8217;s response to that incident, that she handles children more carefully than the father. So that difference alone could account for the absence of fractures in alternative care (particularly when coupled with the fact that Child S was now into an age-group when metaphyseal fractures would be far less likely). Also, despite Mrs L&#8217;s assurance, in evidence, that she had tried to treat Child S as a normal child, I find that it must have been always in Mrs L&#8217;s mind that the child she was caring for had previously suffered a large number of fractures. It would be a remarkable carer who could put that completely out of their mind and treat the child in a completely normal manner; it would always be a consideration, conscious or sub-conscious, that this child may fracture easily, and that the alternative carer would not wish to allow him to suffer any further fractures, or for themselves, to be responsible for any such fractures. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">The local authority point to the fact that Child S was, by April 2019, becoming mobile, a boisterous, active child who would be more prone to fractures. They point, in particular, to two incidents, the fall on the stairs, and the fall in the park when walking with Mr S in ?September 2019. Yet these are very different incidents from the pulling/twisting actions which, we are told, are likely to be the cause of metaphyseal fractures. At the time of these incidents, Child S would still be small and light (I don&#8217;t have his precise height and weight, but these incidents happened when he was no more than about 18 months old). He would therefore develop very little momentum in any fall, and the subsequent impact would be correspondingly far less than for an older, larger, heavier child. For example, in the fall in the park, when Child S was walking, his centre of gravity at the start of the fall would only have been about 30-40 centimetres off the ground. It follows that that was a very short fall (and therefore one in which the child would develop very little momentum), probably with none  of the twisting and pulling forces which, we are told,  would have caused most of Child S&#8217;s previous injuries. I am not satisfied that that could necessarily be expected to lead to a fracture, even in a child who fractured easily. I would certainly not expect it to lead to a fracture in a child with normal bone-strength (we&#8217;ve all had toddlers pitch over when starting to walk, with no significant adverse consequences). It would then be a matter of degree as to how easily Child S would have had to fracture in order to suffer a fracture in those, very innocuous, circumstances. It is not, as I understand it, being suggested that Child S was prone to suffering spontaneous fractures, merely that he fractured more easily than a child with normal bone-strength. How am I to say whether, in those circumstances, he could have been expected to suffer a fracture in such an apparently innocuous fall?  I do not have the information to make that judgment. Since it is for the local authority to prove that Child S&#8217;s injuries were non-accidental, I do not find this piece of evidence and reasoning particularly helpful, much less persuasive. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Similar considerations apply to the incident with the fall on the stairs. Although the fall would have started from slightly higher, it would not have been a vertical fall, since some of Child S&#8217;s (limited) downward momentum would have been converted into forward movement to take him to the bottom of the stairs (a tumble, rather than a vertical fall). Again, I do not have sufficient information to draw conclusions adverse to the parents. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Thirdly, we cannot say with any certainty that Child S did not suffer further fractures in alternative care, as he was not (for obvious reasons), being routinely X-rayed. It could be that part of the unusual appearances seen on the repeat skeletal survey were due to re-fractures, which were simply not picked up at the time. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">S. But, given my finding that Child S was prone to fractures with lesser force, (a fact of which the father could not have been expected to be aware), I find that his handling of Child S may have been sufficient, in some instances, to cause fractures. I find there were probably a number of occasions when Child S became distressed when being handled by his father, and his father interpreted it (as in the car-seat incident), as Child S &#8220;not liking&#8221; what was happening to him. We are told by the consultant paediatricians that a child may settle relatively rapidly after a metaphyseal fracture. I therefore find that there may have been a number of instances in which there was no &#8220;memorable event&#8221; (in the sense of something which a lay person would expect to cause significant harm to a child); yet, because of Child S&#8217;s propensity to fractures with lesser force, he suffered metaphyseal fractures, from which he then rapidly settled. Dr Saggar said in evidence that a fracture in a child with reduced bone-strength would be just as painful as for a child with &#8220;normal&#8221; bones. It follows that Child S is likely to have shown significant distress; yet, without an event which a lay-person would expect to cause significant harm, a carer might well not appreciate what had happened, and simply allow the child to settle. It is of significance in this case that Child S was very visible throughout the period when his fractures must have been caused. In particular, he was attending frequently at The Childminders, being cared for by very experienced child-minders. Yet none of them appreciated that he had suffered any significant injury by way of fractures. </p>

One of the problems in this case is that we have no evidence of Child S being involved in any incident (e.g. a car-crash or something similar), which would have been likely to cause such an injury in a child with normal bone-strength, during the relevant period. As I have already observed, Child S was very visible throughout that period. He was, among other things, at The Childminders, three times a week, having his nappy changed frequently by carers who would have been quite prepared (as they subsequently demonstrated) to &#8220;blow the whistle&#8221; if they had realised Child S had suffered any significant injury, much less a serious injury. In changing Child S&#8217;s nappy, they must have been repeatedly manipulating the very bone which had been badly fractured. That leads me to the conclusion that there is something very unusual, not just about this fracture (which, effectively all the experts agreed), but also about Child S&#8217;s response to it. That, again, supports the view that there is something very unusual about Child S&#8217;s bones. In the circumstances, I find I am unable to draw any safe conclusions as to the amount of force which would have been required  to cause this fracture in Child S, how he would have responded, and whether his carer at the time would necessarily have been aware that he had suffered a significant injury. </p>

The local authority suggest that was an admission of guilt, which supports their case that the father had knowingly caused the injuries. From the outset, I was wary of that conclusion, even though, at that point, all the medical evidence appeared to be pointing in that direction: I was mindful that parents are sometimes led to believe that the only way of getting their child or children back is for one of them to take responsibility; and that, in the circumstances, it may be tempting for a caring parent to make a false admission rather than face the possibility of their child/children being removed permanently from their home. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">On the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019, Child S was seen to have a considerable number of bruises on his torso. Those bruises caught the attention of Childminder 3 at The Childminders when she was changing a nappy (as was bound to happen at some point during the day), and led to the investigation which ultimately revealed the numerous fractures to which I have referred. Since that time, the local authority have looked back in time, and now say that there was evidence of bruising much earlier, starting when Child S was 4 weeks old (the jaw-line bruising). The local authority now say that that was early evidence of a pattern of physical abuse which culminated in the findings in early April 2019. There are a number of difficulties with that line of reasoning.  <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt">Photos of Bruising</span></p>

Dr Robinson went on to comment, as did Dr Fonfe, (since they were both asked to do so) upon a number of photographs which did not fall into those very limited categories. Both said they were very uncomfortable doing so. Dr Fonfe made the point that she could not really tell whether the marks shown were actually bruises, but would have to act on the assumption that they were. </p>

Of course, the parents produced those photographs to support their own case that Child S bruised easily. There is nothing in law to prevent the local authority from turning the parents&#8217; own evidence against them. Yet I have to consider whether those photographs would ever have been disclosed by the parents if they did not genuinely believe that these were bruises which had appeared because Child S bruised easily, rather than bruises which one or both of them had inflicted. Surely if either or both of them had inflicted any of those bruises, they would have ensured that the photographs were not disclosed? I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the very fact that the parents produced these photographs supports their case. </p>

One example of that is the linear mark on the ear which was photographed, and which, for a time was thought to be a bruise. I heard a significant amount of evidence about that, yet it has now fallen out of the picture: other evidence showed that it had disappeared rapidly, and it is now accepted that it was just a transient mark, of a type to which Child S would be prone. How, then, can I safely draw conclusions adverse to the parents about other marks/bruises, based on photographs which do not meet the required standards? </p>

It follows from Dr Saggar&#8217;s evidence (above) that it would not require a &#8220;memorable event&#8221; to cause small bruises; they could be caused by &#8220;things which would otherwise seem innocuous&#8221;. </p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">One example of that, in my view, is the evidence of bruising to Child S&#8217;s jaw-line. Dr Robinson said, more than once, that he thought that would be the result of a &#8220;grabbing&#8221; action, and he had no doubt that would be abusive. The parents, when asked, said they thought the bruising may have resulted from propping up Child S&#8217;s head when winding him. Given Dr Saggar&#8217;s evidence about Child S&#8217;s propensity to bruise easily, I cannot see why the parents&#8217; suggestion is inconsistent with Dr Saggar&#8217;s evidence; if a baby is being held on his front to be &#8220;winded&#8221;, and his head is supported on either side of the jaw, there will be some force exerted on the jaw-line, if only the weight of the baby&#8217;s head being drawn down by gravity onto the thumb and finger, perhaps amplified to some extent by the motion of winding him. That would not, of course, be enough to cause bruising on a child with a normal bruising re-action. For such a child, I would accept Dr Robinson&#8217;s evidence that there would have to be a &#8220;grabbing&#8221; action, involving significantly more force. But  Dr Saggar said that, in a child with Child S&#8217;s condition, &#8220;things which can otherwise seem innocuous can certainly lead to bruising&#8221;. In the light of that evidence, how could I safely conclude, even on a balance of probabilities, that Child S&#8217;s jaw-line bruising was caused by a forceful, and therefore abusive, &#8220;grabbing&#8221; action. I find I cannot. </p>

I remind myself of the &#8220;delay&#8221; direction frequently given to juries in criminal cases, the object of which is to remind the jury to be fair when considering a Defendant&#8217;s account of events. Part of that direction involves reminding the jury that &#8220;with the passage of time, memories fade&#8221;. The jury are invited to put themselves in the position of a person having to answer questions about events which happened a long time ago, and to consider how difficult it would be. The same applies to the parents in this case. Of course, it may be tempting to think that the parents must remember these events, because they would have been &#8220;memorable events&#8221;. But that would be pre-judging one of the real issues in this case: were these, in fact, memorable events? If not, then why should the parents have a clear recollection of them? They may now think they have (as did Childminder 1 about the events on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019 when the police arrived &#8211; she was wrong). </p>

They suggest that makes it more likely that the bruises Child S suffered in the care of his parents were non-accidental , that is to say, inflicted injuries. On behalf of the parents it is argued that, on the contrary, Child S has been seen with bruising in a wide range of different settings. The paediatricians agree that, the more settings in which bruises are seen, the less likely it becomes that any particular bruise is non-accidental. </p>

I have heard much evidence about it. One possible explanation was the incident on the water-slide at Flamingoland the previous weekend, when the parents say Child S was grasped firmly by the torso to stop him going underwater. Dr Saggar accepted that, given Child S&#8217;s propensity to bruise with lesser force, that would be a reasonable explanation of this bruising, if the incident was sufficiently close in time to the discovery of the bruising. On the other hand, we have evidence (e.g. from Mr S), that, when Child S suffers a bruise, it appears very rapidly. The local authority therefore argue that the Flamingoland incident cannot be the explanation for the bruising seen on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April; that incident had occurred over a week previously, so, say the local authority, the bruises would have come out sooner. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">The local authority make much of the fact that the parents have not come up with a clear account of discussions between them concerning the bruising on Child S. The parents both say it had been seen on the Sunday before it was seen at The Childminders the following day. But there is not a clear account of any discussions surrounding it, either when the parents say they first saw it, or the following morning when it became apparent that the child-minders were not going to simply return the children in the usual way. The local authority say that is highly suspicious, and suggests that they are lying, because there must have been such discussions, and they would remember and be able to recount them. I do not accept that. Firstly, I am mindful of a lecture I attended at the Judicial College from a psychologist speaking about the damaging effects of trauma on memory (in the context, as it happens, of rape victims). Her theme was that people who are traumatised do <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> have clear memories of events surrounding the trauma. The brain, perhaps as a defence mechanism, tends to block out the memories. They often emerge either in a disjointed fashion, or not at all. That is, of course, directly contrary to what defence counsel have been putting to complainants in rape and similar cases for decades, perhaps centuries: &#8220;if you had been raped, you would remember it, and you would give us a clear account of it&#8221;. That, apparently, is simply wrong. Since hearing that lecture, I have been directing juries in rape cases that they cannot necessarily expect a genuine victim to have a clear recollection and to give a clear account. </p>

The description of the mother&#8217;s behaviour on arrival at the setting makes it clear that she was distraught. That is hardly surprising.

The fact that they do so does not mean that their evidence can be relied upon, even if they appear to be otherwise honest and dependable witnesses, with no axe to grind. That statement may seem curious, even perverse. Surely honest witnesses will generally be able to provide clear, truthful and reliable accounts? Well, no, not necessarily. In this case, we have a classic example of a patently honest witness, with no axe to grind, who gave a clear and plausible account which turned out to be badly wrong. I am referring, of course, to Childminder 1, and her description of Mr C&#8217;s behaviour when the police attended The Childminders at about lunch-time on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019. </p>

That could, of course, have been very important evidence in the context of serious alleged non-accidental injuries. Fortunately, we have irrefutable evidence which directly contradicts the evidence of Childminder 1 &#8211; the police body-cam footage. It is not disputed (even by Childminder 1), that her account was simply wrong! I do not say that as any criticism of Childminder 1: I have no reason to doubt that she was doing her best to give an accurate and truthful account. But it does demonstrate, as Crown Court judges sometimes remind juries, that even an honest and truthful witness can be mistaken. </p>

These are two intelligent adults who could certainly have avoided producing Child S at The Childminders until the bruising had disappeared; or, if for any reason he had to go to The Childminders, there would likely have been some carefully thought-out and agreed explanation for the bruising. The absence of such an explanation tends to support their account, that they were completely taken by surprise by the events of the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.

There is certainly no medical evidence to show what caused Child S&#8217;s complaints when he was placed on the hip. There are no X-rays showing an injury and no evidence from any medically qualified person saying that they examined Child S and diagnosed any such injury. Of course, the local authority say that is precisely because the parents failed to seek any treatment for any such injury. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">The parents say that Child S didn&#8217;t like being placed on the hip. Others have given different descriptions. This allegation is again bedevilled by the fact that whatever did happen, it had happened many months before the investigation started, and before any statements were taken. I have already remarked on the unfairness which can arise from investigating an event long after it happened, and how decent, respectable, honest witnesses can be mistaken in their description of events. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">The parents are effectively saying that they made a judgment call that there was nothing of substance underlying Child S&#8217;s dislike of, and his response to, being placed on an adult&#8217;s hip. Sensible parents frequently make such judgment calls. They may be right, and they may not. It could be that, because of his underlying condition, Child S had suffered a metaphyseal fracture because of an apparently innocuous event. If that was right, then there would have been no &#8220;memorable event&#8221;. If that were the explanation, I find that the parents cannot be seriously criticised: they would not have seen anything happen to Child S (an immobile baby) which should have led them to realise that he had suffered a significant injury. And if the same thing happened again subsequently when he was placed on the hip without excessive force, one interpretation could be that he &#8220;didn&#8217;t like it&#8221;.  Given the very positive things which are said about these parents; given the lapse of time and the difficulty in carrying out a fair and reliable investigation, and the fact that Child S was always visible through this period, and was seen and examined by a number of health professionals, I conclude that the local authority have not discharged the burden of proof. I am therefore not going to make any finding. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">This allegation is subject to the same criticisms as the last, but more so: here, the local authority accept that the parents sought appropriate medical attention; their criticism is that, whatever had happened to Child S to cause the first pulled elbow, the parents allowed it to happen again to the other elbow. That might be a reasonable criticism if Child S had a medical condition which was known and understood, and if the parents had been told that they must treat Child S very gently to avoid a recurrence. So far as I am aware, they were not told that. So far as they were aware, Child S was a normal baby who did not have to be treated particularly carefully. In the circumstances, I find it unsurprising that there was a recurrence (albeit on Child S&#8217;s other side).  </p>

He is not to blame for what happened to Child S. Nevertheless, I anticipate that, now he knows more, he will handle Child S more carefully in the future, while avoiding &#8220;wrapping him in cotton wool&#8221;. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">The outcome of this hearing depends on the interplay between the positive evidence about the parents, on the one hand, and any medical evidence which might prove that Child S&#8217;s numerous injuries were inflicted. There is no eyewitness evidence to support the allegations of non-accidental injury inflicted by the parents (except, arguably, the evidence of Mrs L about &#8220;the car-seat incident&#8221;). </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">As to the medical evidence, I prefer the evidence of Dr Olsen, Dr Saggar and Dr Fernandes to that of Professor Offiah and the consultant paediatricians. Accordingly, I find, without hesitation, that Child S has genetic anomalies, some of which may still be un-identified and not properly understood (Dr Saggar, supported by the evidence of Dr Olsen&#8217;s &#8220;red flags&#8221;). Those genetic anomalies lead to bruising with lesser force, and may lead to fractures with lesser force (Dr Saggar). </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Taking the medical evidence in isolation, I find that the local authority have not discharged the burden of proof in relation to any of Child S&#8217;s injuries, since they may all be accounted for by known genetic anomalies and possible unknown anomalies. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Once the positive evidence about these parents is factored in (the wider picture), and the fact that Child S&#8217;s older sister, Child P, has never come to any harm, I find the local authority have fallen well short of proving their case. I accordingly make no findings. </p>

It is fortunate that they have been kept within the extended family in the interim, and I have no doubt that the parents are very grateful to Mrs L for caring for them. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">When these proceedings started, there was no suggestion that the intervenors were responsible for causing any injuries to Child S. It was, after all, they who had started safeguarding measures by reporting the bruising seen on Child S. They would have been very unlikely to do that if any of them had been responsible for Child S&#8217;s injuries, at least those which were apparent at the time, namely the bruising. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">Fairly late in the proceedings, the local authority amended the threshold document to include possible findings against the intervenors. As I understand it, that was only ever a long-stop, in case the local authority failed to obtain findings against the parents. In the event, the possible findings against the intervenors have not been actively pursued; the intervenors have appeared as witnesses during the proceedings, although they have also attended the hearing, as they were entitled to do.  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">This hearing was conducted throughout on the on-line conferencing platform, Zoom. Fortunately, that had been arranged, and preparations made, before the judiciary were told that we could not use Zoom. In the circumstances, I was told we could continue with the existing arrangements. I am very grateful that that was allowed: ever since, I have been hearing reports of problems associated with  hearing the more complex cases on CVP. The general view seems to be that, once there are more than a fairly limited number of participants in a CVP hearing, the problems proliferate, with a resulting waste of time and an increase in stress for all concerned. I have also been told that, if one party has a bad connection, it appears to affect the functioning of the whole hearing. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">By contrast, this hearing, with upwards of twenty people joining most of the time, has been largely trouble-free. The only significant problems we experienced appeared to be the result of individual participants having difficulties with their home wi-fi connections, rather than problems arising from the platform itself. Those of us who participated in the hearing are all indebted to Miss Lee QC, Leading Counsel for the local authority. She kindly took it upon herself to manage the Zoom aspect of the hearings, sending out invitations, taking responsibility for recording the hearing, and forwarding the recordings to the court. Those were tasks which would normally have to be performed by a member or members of court staff. I do not suggest, for a moment, that that is something which should normally be expected of counsel. Certainly in this instance, Miss Lee had more than enough on her hands running a complicated case for the local authority. However, she took on the additional burden I have mentioned and, by doing so, enabled the hearing to proceed smoothly on a platform which worked well. She thereby assisted us all. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in">The case was heard using Caselines, an online system of electronic bundles rather than paper bundles. This is the second long case I have heard using Caselines (the first would, I am told, have involved 47 lever-arch files of papers). I have found it invaluable in both cases. It makes the judge&#8217;s task much easier, primarily because it completely removes the need for the judge to physically organise and manhandle vast quantities of papers, and locate page references. That is all done by the advocates (or their junior or solicitor) taking witnesses (and everyone else involved in the case) to a particular page by issuing a page-direction which is sent to every computer logged on to that particular case. By the same token, the witness does not have to find page references, nor does there need to be a member of court staff assisting the witness to do so. Witnesses giving evidence remotely can be directed to documents which are not physically present at their location. The list of benefits goes on. I found it speeded up the proceedings significantly, and reduced considerably the stress on me, as the judge. I found it speeded up the evidence, in particular, because I was relieved of the tasks of bundle-management and page-finding. I also found it made it far easier to write the judgment: I did not have to take large numbers of lever-arch files to wherever I wanted to work; I only needed my laptop, and the ability to log on to Caselines. I imagine the same is true for advocates preparing the case or preparing written submissions. </p>

Embrace it: it will make your life easier. In case you are thinking that I am some young computer-whizz, that is certainly not the case: I am fast approaching compulsory retirement age, and am only moderately technologically aware. The system is very user-friendly, and saves time and effort. </p>
