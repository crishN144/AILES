Mr&#160;H (who was at the outset of these proceedings legally represented) ceased to receive a public funding certificate, hence he has represented himself during this hearing.  I make no observation about how precisely that state of affairs came about, but in an attempt to assist him in his disadvantaged position, I permitted his mother to be present during the course of this hearing.  The absence of public funding for a litigant answering serious allegations with potentially long-lasting adverse consequences for him is obviously unsatisfactory.</span></p>

No such report was in fact logged by the North Wales Police.  Whether the mother was actually burgled or not, I do not know.  The Guardian said to me that was not the case, on the basis that the mother&#8217;s home and the living room in particular was so confined that she could not possibly sleep through the removal of her belongings.  The Guardian may indeed be correct with regard to that, but somewhat curiously Mr&#160;H was prepared to come to the mother&#8217;s aid at the eleventh hour and he suggested that things had indeed gone missing, although I would not take that as a reliable indicator that it was necessarily the case.  However, what is beyond peradventure is that the mother certainly lied about reporting any incident to the police, probably to cover up for a missed contact.

MH was with her.  I asked that she put him on the phone.  I asked him what this was all about.

If this is true, you will be in serious trouble.&#8217;  I asked him why is he saying this now.  He said that at least C can get K back.  I told him it doesn&#8217;t work that way.

The thrust of Mr&#160;B&#8217;s account is that Mr&#160;H was prepared to give an account to the police to facilitate K&#8217;s return to her mother.  Furthermore, the timing of this disclosure (according to Mr&#160;B) is at variance with that of the mother&#8217;s.  Is it December 2013 or is it February 2014?

At the very best, the account given by the mother in paragraph 10 above would be a partial and an incomplete account of K&#8217;s injuries.  Of course, the mother might allege that Mr&#160;H, having admitted such serious wrongdoing is more likely to be the sole perpetrator of the remainder of K&#8217;s injuries as well.</span></p>

I accept that Mr&#160;B advised caution and (on his evidence) spoke to Mr&#160;AW about this incident as well.
