That memo showed H to be set on a course of doing everything he could to defeat W&#8217;s claims. That contributed to a finding by me in my judgment of 16 April 2010 that:</p>

In that conversation, in truth a monologue directed at W, H in abusive and disgusting terms makes it absolutely clear that his intended course was to leave W (and presumably his children) utterly destitute.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I will explain in more detail below the charge in question was in fact a third charge over the former matrimonial home, Whitecliff, St George&#8217;s Hill, Weybridge. Charges No. 1 and No. 2 were in favour of EFG bank, which foreclosed. W and the children were put out of the property which was sold in September 2009; after redemption of the EFG charges there remained &#163;1,053,720 proceeds of sale, which have been paid into court. The charge in question here secures US $5,000,000, a sum greatly in excess of the funds in court. Thus, unless W succeeds, all of the money in court will be paid out to LF. Although H is a rich man, as I have previously found, there are no visibly attachable funds of his in this jurisdiction, or so far as I can see in any jurisdiction where there would be easy enforcement of a financial relief award. So, unless W succeeds, she and the children face the state of destitution that H so brutally threatened back in May 2007. I must not however allow my human feelings for her plight to affect the judgment I must give, which must be determined as between W and LF strictly in accordance with the law as applied to the specific facts of this case.   </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">On Saturday 1 February 1997 an agreement, this time typed up and witnessed by four witnesses namely Messrs Dubinin, Klimashevskiy, Frolov and Sheynin. This agreement relates to the Russian businesses of H and LF. It is basically the same as agreement iii) above. LF was to transfer his 50% share in the Russian businesses to H; that 50% share was valued at $2.5m; but H was given until 1 February 2007 to pay $5m for that 50% share.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be immediately apparent that there are a number of oddities about this agreement at 15(iv) above. Why did such a degree of formality suddenly arise? None of the previous agreements had been typed up and witnessed. Why was it necessary to have separate agreements for the Russian and non-Russian agreements? LF told me that this was for reasons of confidentiality concerning the non-Russian assets: they were so secret that not even witnesses could know about them. This struck me as highly implausible.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">LF told me that the handwritten agreement concerning the non-Russian  businesses at 15(iii) above was in fact converted into a formal agreement witnessed by a notary in Vienna on 3 February 1997. I gave him two weeks to track down the formal notarised agreement. On 8 October 2010 LF&#8217;s solicitors produced a small bundle of notarial documents some of which had already been produced in the court bundle. I did not receive any further written submission from counsel for LF elucidating these documents. I could not find within the additional papers any notarial agreement that corresponded to the agreement at 15(iii) above. There is a notarial deed of 3 February 1997 which provides that LF and H shall assign their 250,000 shares in BAST to a Mr Guerassimov and Mrs Kouzamina at a price of one schilling per share, and there is a partners&#8217; resolution of BAST that records that LF and H have been relieved of their duties. These arrangements are hard to reconcile with the purported effect of the agreement at 15(iii) above.  </p>

The agreement went on to say that H would put up Whitecliff as a &#8220;pledge&#8221;. It noted that Whitecliff was in fact owned by W, but provided that H would take the &#8220;necessary measures&#8221; to get a transfer of title in his favour.

This was to be paid by H transferring to LF his share in a company called ZAO, with the balance of $1.5m being paid when H recovered a debt in that amount from a Mr O.V. Passek.

H paid the $1m provided for under the 2001 Israeli agreement but, as is clearly stated and found by Mr Cohen QC, the sum was more or less immediately lent back to H at his instigation, and has not been returned to W: see paras 21 &#8211; 23 of his judgment dated 12 February 2009.

The reader of that document would not know that there were in fact two agreements of that date each deferring $5m of purchase money; nor would he know to which agreement the charge was referring. But the parties to the agreement would have known full well. It is interesting that the charge refers in an ambiguous way to &#8220;the&#8221; loan agreement of 1 February 1997 (in the singular) but not to the agreement of 6 March 2007 which specifically establishes the entitlement to the charge. It is also interesting that the deed of charge refers to &#8220;the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">loan</span> agreement&#8221; of 1 February 1997. It is stretching language for either agreement of 1 February 1997 to be described as a &#8220;<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">loan</span>&#8221; agreement: they were effectively contracts for the sale of business interests, albeit with deferred payment terms.</p>

There H unambiguously stated that he owed 131,578,769 roubles to LF. This is a reference to the Russian judgment debt and is in turn a reference to the handwritten unwitnessed agreements of 1 February 1997 and 6 March 2007 concerning the division of the non-Russian businesses. H stated that when it was clear by the early part of 2007 he did not have the money to pay LF &#8220;he was happy to accept a charge over my property, but when he learned of the difficulties I was in he decided that he also wanted the protection of obtaining a judgment against me through the Court&#8217;s (sic) in Russia&#8221;. It is notable that H refers only to one agreement of 1 February 1997, reiterated on 6 March 2007. He does not mention the type-written witnessed agreements concerning the Russian businesses or the fact that it was the latter of these than supplied the entitlement for the charge. This passage of H&#8217;s affidavit clearly reads as if these type-written witnessed agreements concerning the division of the Russian businesses either do not exist, or are ineffective. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied on the evidence that LF knew full well that a motive of H in making the type-written agreement of 6 March 2007  and the creation  of the charge itself on 25 January 2008 was, at the very least in a subsidiary way, to defeat W&#8217;s claims. I will deal below with the question whether the agreements are shams, but if the agreement of 6 March 2007 and the charge of 25 January 2008 were indeed authentic then I am sure that LF knew that H was doing it with the intention, if not the dominant intention, of  defeating W&#8217;s claims. If I am wrong about this then LF is certainly, on the evidence, to be fixed with constructive knowledge. And of course the charge has the very effect of defeating W&#8217;s claims totally, at the very least in the sense described in the statute concerning the frustration of enforcement.  It therefore follows that the second and third elements of the exception are not satisfied and it is not available as a defence. (Having reached this conclusion, I do not have to decide whether the first element, namely the presence of valuable consideration, is satisfied. It is bound up with the case on sham. If the agreement of 1 February 1997 and its successor of 6 March 2007 are shams then obviously there will not have been valuable consideration; if they are authentic then there will have been.)</p>

I acknowledge Arden LJ&#8217;s warning that just because something looks un-commercial or even artificial that does not of itself signify a sham. A sham must be an act whereby the parties intend the document to do something different to that which it says it does, and broadcast this fact. There are grounds for suspecting that this is the case here. There are very many implausibilities, inconsistencies and oddities in the circumstances surrounding the alleged creation of the type-written witnessed agreements concerning the division of the Russian assets, which I have set out above in the narrative section of this judgment. There are reasons to doubt whether the type-written agreement of 1 February 1997 is authentic. I have my doubts as to whether the three witnesses to that agreement gave me truthful evidence. Equally, there is reason to doubt whether the agreement of 6 March 2007 was signed and witnessed on that day. </p>
