It was argued that it would be unreal to prevent such publication where those names were on the Interpol website. I readily agreed, and in the circumstances it was an unexceptional order.

The rest of the world, and specifically the European Union, regard the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as being a military occupation by Turkey of part of the Cypriot Republic.  The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is not a signatory to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Effects of Child Abduction, nor does it subscribe to or apply the child abduction provisions of the Brussels II regulation.</span></p>

In order for an unlawful retention for the purposes of Art.3 to be proved, it has to be shown that on the relevant date Abdul Rahman was habitually resident here and that at that time rights of custody had been vested in this court.  Plainly the latter criterion was satisfied because this court had made him a ward of court on that day.  The question is whether on that day he was habitually resident here.</span></p>

He argues, as does the Council which he represents, that this is a reasonably foreseeable prospect.  First, they say that the parents were, in fact, in Turkey as recently as December 2013.  They say they went there in 2013 for a holiday.  Secondly, they say that in order to be able lawfully to stay in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus they need to leave the country every 90 days in order to re-enter and receive a new 90 day tourist visa.</span></p>

At the time they arrived they had not established accommodation in Cyprus.  Since then they have taken a tenancy extending only to six months, although they say it is extendable.  When they came to Northern Cyprus they had no family living in Cyprus and the father had only one friend who ran a restaurant.  He did, however, say a religious Mullah who he followed, he being a Muslim, was living in Northern Cyprus and had done for about 20 years.</span></p>

I do not need to speculate further on the motives that drove them to leave to go to Northern Cyprus although pretty easy conclusions can be drawn.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  Yes.  I make an order that expert evidence be obtained as to the prospects of a court in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus implementing an order for return here because this court does not engage in empty gestures.  So I would like that to be obtained within 28 days.  Then I would wish this matter to be returned to this court for this court to consider, in the light of that, whether it makes an order inviting a court in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus to return Abdul Rahman here.  As to the merits of that, I again make no comments whatsoever.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. DOWNS:  It is possible that that could be all that is required by way of directions because apparently a direction has already been made which will allow continuing communication with the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office.  Of course, negotiations will continue between the local authority and the family with a view to trying to bring about an agreement, possibly with the assistance of third parties.</span></p>

It has made its orders.  I am making three further orders: (i) a declaration about habitual residence; (ii) an order that you obtain expert evidence;  (iii) that the matter be returned in the light of that on the first open date after 28 days with an time estimate of one hour, and with the parents to attend by video.</span></p>

Under the Civil Procedure Rules Part 52 the permission can only be given if I am satisfied that there is a real prospect of success or there is some other compelling reason why the appeal should be heard.  In as much as I can understand Mr. Chhatbar, he says that my decision is wrong because I have no jurisdiction and because it is fraudulent.  </span></heading>
