	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.17in;text-indent:0in">"There is a vast range of investment managers in the market offering different investment styles and services at varying levels of charges, and not all specialise in personal injury awards. When obtaining advice as a deputy, it is this firm's practice to follow a beauty parade style process to compare advice and services between a small number of different firms before procuring investment management services.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0in">As part of the beauty parade process, we encourage clients and/or suitable members of their family to participate in the process so far as they are able and willing to do so.

	      <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.01in">On this occasion and in view of the circumstances of MWS, consideration was given as to whether holding a beauty parade was in MWS's best interests. A key consideration is costs. When holding a beauty parade, it is usual for the deputy and/or the fee earner with day to day conduct of the deputyship to attend the meetings with each of the proposers. This can take several hours. In addition, there is preparation time both before and after the meetings in order to consider and review the proposers' reports and recommendations.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:-0in">Where P and/or their family are able to take an active role, this process is valuable in giving them, the opportunity to be involved and contribute to decisions where possible. However, as this is not the case with MWS, it was not considered appropriate to incur the level of costs associated with going through a full beauty parade process.</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0in">Rather than undertaking a beauty parade in this case, I obtained a report from Enhance Wealth Consultancy Limited, a leading provider of investment oversight services to the fiduciary sector. The purpose of the report is to provide independent verification as to whether there is any reason why Enhance would disagree with 1MTC' s choice of IMAM as an investment solution and provider. In this case Enhance were asked to compare two recommendations. There would usually be three but in this case I was able to discount one based on high costs before proceeding to external verification.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0in">Enhance conclude that the solution presented by IMAM is at an acceptable cost; the financial planning structures are effective and appear to be well researched; the investment management process is comprehensive and the overall solution is suitable to meet the objectives (in so far as they are currently known) of MWS. An element of flexibility is built into the proposals in consideration of potential changes to future requirements,</p>

Chapter 8 of the Code is headed "What is the role of the Court of Protection and court-appointed deputies?" and paragraphs 8.54 to 8.68 set out the duties of any deputy. Paragraph 8.58 defines and discusses the deputy's fiduciary duty. It says that:</p>

For example, deputies should not buy property that they are selling for the person they have been appointed to represent. They should not accept a third party commission in any transactions. Deputies must not allow anything else to influence their duties. They cannot use their position for any personal benefit, whether or not it is at the person's expense.'<img src="image5.jpg" style="width:1.92pt;height:3.12pt"/></p>
