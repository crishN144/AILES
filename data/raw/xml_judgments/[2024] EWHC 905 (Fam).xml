	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have been hearing cross-applications by the parties in this case for enforcement of an order made by Mostyn J as long ago as 12 June 2019.  The first is an application for enforcement and an account of monies due to him, made by Mr Frank Eric Hersman (hereafter &#8220;the Husband&#8221;) against his former wife, Mrs Alexandra Caroline De Verchere (hereafter &#8220;the Wife&#8221;) dated 22 December 2022.  He also applies for an injunction against her by way of application dated 15 April 2024.  I have decided to give permission for that application to be made on short notice, given the circumstances of this case, as set out below.  The Wife applied on 20 January 2023 for enforcement of an unpaid lump sum and appointment of an expert in relation to Capital Gains Tax.  I propose to call them &#8220;the Husband&#8221; and &#8220;the Wife&#8221; for the sake of convenience, even though they have been long divorced.  I mean no disrespect to either by so doing. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The dispute concerns two very substantial properties, Chalet Pearl in Courchevel, France and Villa Pearl in St Tropez, France.  Villa Pearl was held in joint names.  Chalet Pearl was held in the name of the Wife during the marriage, albeit subject to a very large mortgage with Barclays Bank, Monaco.  The Wife suggests in her statement that the title was in her name for tax reasons.  I have no idea whether that was the case or not but, if it was, the case provides yet another very salutary lesson of the foolishness of doing so.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">A final financial remedy order was made by Mostyn J as long ago as 12 June 2019.  Both parties had excellent representation, with leading counsel on both sides.  There was a three day hearing.  A recital to the order declared that the Husband &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">is the sole beneficial owner of Chalet Pearl and Villa Pearl as from the date of this order</span>&#8221;.  He was to discharge the mortgage instalments on the properties, but I am clear that this was on the basis that he would be receiving the rental income from both residences.  He was then to pay to the Wife a lump sum of &#163;709,707 by 1 December 2019, less any sums removed by the Wife from a Banque de Savoie Oyster account and not used solely for the benefit of SARL Oyster Properties.  The Wife was to transfer both Chalet Pearl and Villa Pearl to the Husband forthwith, which meant immediately.  The Husband was to release her from any liability she had under the two mortgages with Barclays Bank as soon as possible and by no later than 1 December 2019.  If he was not able to secure her release, the properties were to be sold but he would receive the entire net proceeds of sale.    </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Chalet Pearl is a very high end skiing chalet that is rented out for vast sums to very high net worth individuals.  The rentals were contracted via a company known as SARL Oyster Properties.  The Wife had undertaken to Mostyn J to transfer her shares in that company, amounting to 99% of the shares, to the Husband.   She did so on 30 July 2019, but she then entirely negated the transfer by cancelling her contract with SARL, such that, thereafter, rentals would be conducted directly with her, entirely in breach of the order of Mostyn J.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I accept entirely that Covid-19 followed some nine months after this order was made but, for reasons that are completely unclear, no attempt was made by either party to enforce the order until 22 December 2022 when the Husband applied for enforcement and for an account of all rental monies received by the Wife since the 2019 order had been made.  He filed a statement also dated 22 December 2022 making it clear that he sought possession of Chalet Pearl and an account of the rental money the Wife had received from the property since 2020.  He said that, because the Wife had taken all the rental money, he could not pay the mortgage.  Chalet Pearl had cost &#8364;21 million in 2007 and was subject to a mortgage on purchase of (&#8364;17,150,000).  He added that, for the year ending 30 June 2018, the rental income from both Chalet Pearl and Villa Pearl was &#8364;1,994,776 of which Chalet Pearl contributed &#8364;1,276,818.  He made the point that high-net worth individuals were prepared to pay &#8364;117,000 for a week in January 2023; &#8364;420,000 for the period 19 December 2022 to 2 January 2023; and &#8364;300,000 for a further two weeks in January 2023.  </p>

I refused the Husband&#8217;s application that I should make an immediate order giving him vacant possession of Chalet Pearl or that I should order a transfer of the property and surrender of the keys/access codes that day.  I considered that the Wife should have a chance to state her case.  The Wife was, however, to notify the Husband once per month of the rental income she had received.  Any net rental income, after deducting the running costs of the property and the mortgage payments, was to be paid into an escrow account.  I directed that she provide a full account of the rental income she had received.    </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Wife, who had solicitors on the record as acting for her at the time, filed a detailed statement, dated 15 February 2023, setting out her case.  She said that the Husband had consistently failed to re-finance the mortgages to enable her to be released from them.  She said that the combined mortgages on the two properties were approximately &#8364;24 million.  She said she obtained possession of the property in September 2021 but did not receive any rental income prior to December 2021.  She added that she believed Chalet Pearl could be rented out for &#8364;1.3 million per annum, if it was fully occupied during the entire skiing season, but she made the point that the costs of running it were substantial, saying that staff social security alone is &#8364;35,000 a season.  She had received rent of &#8364;1,970,999, since December 2021 but had expenses of (&#8364;1,047,393), making a profit of &#8364;923,606.  She accepted that she had not paid anything towards the mortgage.  She then set out significant amounts of expenditure that she said she had incurred in other areas as a result of the divorce.  She paid &#163;20,313 towards the winding up of a company called Churchill Capital International Limited and &#163;82,576, most of which was legal costs, relating to a property in London that was also transferred to the Husband.  She said she had incurred significant legal costs in France to the tune of around &#8364;198,000. She was out of pocket from the liquidation of SARL Oyster to the tune of at least &#8364;450,000.  She said it suited the Husband for the Chalet to remain in her name until now.  She accused the Husband of keeping &#8364;950,000 of deposits for Spring 2020 rentals that were cancelled due to Covid.  The company was now in liquidation and owed &#8364;1.2 million, of which she had agreed to pay the sum of &#8364;450,000.  She then details various payments she had made relating to the parties&#8217; children.   She said she had sought to implement the English court order.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The matter was heard by me on 24 February 2023.  The Wife was both present and represented.  Her counsel told me, on instructions from the Wife, that she had received more than &#8364;500,000 in rent for Chalet Pearl since 23 January 2023 but she had paid no money into the escrow account as there had been no net income after deducting the running costs. She had paid no money towards the mortgage.  She said there were no rentals booked for March 2023.  After I had given judgment, her lawyers said that this was incorrect and she had let Chalet Pearl from 27 February to 6 March 2023.  She agreed that she would transfer both Chalet Pearl which was in her sole name and Villa Pearl, which was in the joint names of the parties, to the Husband promptly upon him procuring her release from the mortgages secured on the properties.  The Husband was to keep her informed of all developments promptly.   I then ordered a transfer of the properties to the Husband forthwith on the Wife being released from the mortgages.  I directed that the Wife give vacant possession of the property from 7 March 2023. She was to surrender all keys and access codes to the properties; provide all documentation as to rentals to enable him to take over the management of the property; and transfer any deposits to his nominated bank account.  On that basis, he was to pay the mortgage and outgoings.  I gave her some security for her claims against him by prohibiting him from selling or charging the London property, now in his name.   I directed that she was to provide a statement of the expenses she had incurred in relation to the running of the property since October 2021 by 10 March 2023.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, I said that it was absolutely clear that Chalet Pearl was to be transferred from the Wife to the Husband pursuant to the order of Mostyn J and, in consequence, she should give him vacant possession immediately.  I was doubtful as to the Wife&#8217;s contention that there had been no net income since the January 2023 order but I had not heard oral evidence so I was unable to make a finding to that effect.   </p>

She did not deliver up the documentation.  She did not transfer the deposits.  She did seek permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal but, on 7 July 2023, Moylan LJ refused permission to appeal on the grounds that there was no real prospect of success in the appeal.  It was clear, however, from the fact that she tried to appeal, that the Wife was fully aware of the order that I had made and the obligations which it had imposed upon her.  Moylan LJ confirmed that I had power to make an order for vacant possession as the Wife had no beneficial interest in the property pursuant to the order of Mostyn J.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 8 September 2023, the Husband filed a further statement in support of his application.  He made the valid point that the Wife had not filed a statement explaining how she had incurred expenses of &#8364;777,208 on Chalet Pearl between since October 2021 and February 2023, notwithstanding my order that she do so.  She had still not delivered up possession. She had continued to let the property and keep the rent. She had said she was paying the mortgage but had not done so.  There were mortgage arrears.  Including penalties and interest, these were, at that point, in the sum of &#8364;2,502,334.  He complained that there were periods when the Wife had chosen not to rent the Chalet but she had, instead, used it herself, such as at Christmas 2022 when she could have earned &#8364;500,000.   He did not accept that she had only received &#8364;1,989,999.  He made the point that she had been using a false name, Chalet Makalu, to rent out the property.  He informed the court that the skiing season is from 8 December to 30 April.  As the property can usually rent for between &#8364;85,000 to &#8364;100,000 per week, it should rent for a total of &#8364;2,320,000 per season.  Instead, he calculated that there had been 175 days without tenants.  He said he had achieved 100% occupancy when he was in charge, whereas, he said, she achieved 39%.  He then said that he had a rental agreement in place to let the Chalet for &#8364;775,000 from 16 December 2023 to 6 January 2024.  He said that, since the order of Mostyn J, the total income should have been &#8364;5,130,000. The expenses disclosed were muddled and, in part, redacted.  He added that he would have expected total running costs over a two year period to be &#8364;352,000.  He had paid the mortgage until 30 June 2021.  He rejected all the Wife&#8217;s claims for reimbursement to her.  </p>

I was satisfied that the Wife had notice of the hearing.  The Husband had, earlier, applied for an order that, because the Wife was in breach of my earlier orders, she should not be entitled to participate further in the proceedings.  Very sensibly, he did not request that I make such an order.  I would not have done so if he had asked.  It follows that the Wife has had a full opportunity to place statements and evidence before me as to her case, but she has not done so.   I directed that the committal application should be heard on 30 November 2023.  I warned her that, if she did not attend, the court was likely to proceed in her absence.  I made it clear to her that she was not obliged to file any evidence in relation to the committal application, although she could do so if she so wished.  </p>

She said that she gave her sincerest apologies that she would not be in court that day, referring to alleged limited English language skills.  First, her document proved that her English language skills were excellent. Second, the notice of proceedings sent to her made it clear that she could have both a free lawyer and a free interpreter if she so wished.  She referred to a hearing in France the following day as a reason for not attending before me, but she had not requested to attend by video-link, which I would, of course, have granted.  She also responded to a Position Statement that had been filed by the Husband&#8217;s leading counsel, Mr Tim Amos KC.  She said that she could not transfer title to a property that is mortgaged and that the Husband had to repay the loan first.  The difficulty, of course, is that he can only repay the loan simultaneously with the property being transferred to him and remortgaged at that point.  She said she &#8220;repossessed&#8221; the Chalet to sell it, not to run it.  The difficulty with that is that she has not sold it; she has rented it out.  She then said that she would make herself available to sign the deeds of transfer of the properties with a Notary before 31 December 2023 as soon as the Husband had proved that he had the necessary funds.   </p>

I found that the Wife was in contempt of my order of 24 February 2023 in a number of respects, including failure to give up vacant possession; failure to deliver up the keys and access codes; failure to deliver up the documentation; and failure to transfer the deposits to the Husband.   I decided that only an immediate prison sentence would suffice as punishment and to secure compliance with my earlier order.  I sentenced the Wife to three months in prison, of which she would serve half.  I directed that she pay the Husband&#8217;s costs, with a payment of &#163;30,000 on account by 14 December 2023.  The Wife has not come to this country since my order. She has not therefore served the prison sentence.  She has not paid the costs ordered to be paid by 14 December 2023 or at all.    </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Husband filed a final statement in support of his applications, which is dated 5 April 2024.  He says that the Wife has changed the name of the chalet again and is now renting it out at Courchevel Chalet.  He confirmed that First Abu Dhabi Bank is willing to lend him &#8364;23.1 million to refinance the mortgages.  He exhibited the offer letter, which is valid until 31 October 2024.  He seeks compensation for loss of &#8364;1 million of rentals for the next ski season, 2024/2025, presumably on the assumption that he will still not have obtained possession by then.  He complains about losing a rental at Christmas 2023/24 in the sum of &#8364;775,000.  He increases the figures he says he lost for 2022/2023 from &#8364;2.4 million to &#8364;3.07 million and to &#8364;3.3 million for 2023/24.  He relies on the fact that Courchevel is situated 1850 metres above sea level, and therefore, virtually guaranteed snow, unlike lower lying areas.  He adds that the Chalet can be rented out for 18 weeks per annum.  He therefore calculates the total rent lost at &#8364;8.78 million.  He accepts that the running costs would have increased from &#8364;352,000 per annum to &#8364;528,000.  He refers to mortgage arrears and penalties now amounting to &#8364;3,943,303, although this appears to include &#8220;enforcement costs&#8221; of &#8364;1,017,705, as, elsewhere, the figure is given as being &#8364;2,893,361.  He argues that the Wife is responsible for the penalties and interest on penalties.  He makes the same point in relation to Villa Pearl, saying the arrears on the mortgage are &#8364;1,026,338 with additional fees on the redemption statement of &#8364;311,288.  He then talks about contents removed from Chalet Pearl, including a painting that cost $56,000 and missing chattels of &#163;50,000.  He then claimed the costs of a web-designer of &#163;18,277.  He claims costs he has incurred in France of &#8364;831,360, which he says are largely irrecoverable, even if he wins the litigation.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have to say that I did not find all this at all impressive.  It certainly appeared to me that he was just adding in any possible expense he could think of to increase the overall total to an enormous level, namely &#163;14,942,426. Indeed, he has to accept that he is on the title for Villa Pearl so he has not had the same difficulties there, but he claims that the Wife had been denigrating him in such a way that potential renters have been put off, such that he was only able to rent the property for &#8364;150,000 in the summer 2023 and that he has no bookings for summer 2024, when he would usually have bookings of &#8364;1 million.  His costs of the English proceedings are &#163;256,609.  </p>

Mr Amos KC, who again appears on behalf of the Husband, has not had the chance to cross-examine her as to her earlier statement or what has happened since then.  I have already made it clear that this is deliberate on her part.  She could easily have attended by video link and I am clear that she has the resources to be represented if she wished to instruct a lawyer.  In these circumstances, I am entitled to draw adverse inferences against her, but this does not mean I can draw any inference I like.  An inference must be properly drawn.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is then the question of my jurisdiction to make the orders sought by the Husband.  I am quite satisfied that I have jurisdiction to do so.    The first point relates to the Husband&#8217;s application that the Wife indemnify him against the mortgage liability incurred during the period that she has wrongly occupied Chalet Pearl.  The case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">CH v WH</span> [2017] EWHC 2379 is clear authority for the proposition that a judge has power to order an indemnity.  At paragraph [9], Mostyn J says:-</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The Family Court has all the powers of the High Court.  The High Court unquestionably has the power, as part of its equitable jurisdiction, to order an indemnity.  If awarded, that represents a legal right in favour of the person so indemnified. The court can award an injunction in support of a legal right.  To order someone who has been ordered to indemnify the other party in respect of a mortgage to use his or her best endeavours to keep up the payments on that mortgage is of the nature of an injunction in support of a legal right.  In my opinion, this provision is squarely within the power of the High Court to order, and is therefore within the power of the Family Court.&#8221;</span></p>

Again, I have no doubt whatsoever that the court has such jurisdiction.  It would be a very surprising and unjust omission if such a power did not exist.  It would be a cheats charter and encourage non-compliance or obstruction with legitimate court orders.  Fortunately, the Court of Appeal has confirmed that the jurisdiction exists to enable a judge to do so, where the order remains &#8220;executory&#8221;; in other words, it has not, as yet, been complied with.  In the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bezeliansky v Bezelianskya</span> [2016] EWCA 76, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from me, when I had done just that.

I did ask a few questions myself, but I recognise that this is no substitute for proper forensic testing by an experienced advocate.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Husband told me that he is in a cleft stick in France, as he has not been able to apply for possession until he owns the property, but he cannot own the property until he has vacant possession.  This is a very unfortunate situation, which I hope the French Court will be able to resolve, now that the order of Mostyn J has been registered in France.  He then told me that the problem is that people do not want to rent from him unless they are sure he can comply.  This is a very fair point.  When asked by me, he accepted that the total rent for the year ending June 2018 for Chalet Pearl was &#8364;1.2 million.  He said that the expenses were approximately &#8364;250,000 for that year, excluding the mortgage..  He made the fair points that there had been significant inflation since then and that his property has the advantage of being so high in the Alps that there is a guarantee of snow, which increased the price yet further.  He said that, if it is raining at the bottom of the mountain, it will still be snowing in Courchevel.  He confirmed that the original mortgages on the properties with Barclays were &#8364;17,150,000 for Chalet Pearl and &#8364;5,076,000 for Villa Pearl.  The amounts outstanding today are &#8364;21,371,817 for Chalet Pearl and &#8364;6,337,141 for Villa Pearl.  He made the point that the only payment off the mortgage on Chalet Pearl since 2019 was a sum of &#8364;1,349,329 taken from a deposit he had made with Barclays when the mortgage was originally taken out.  He did say that Barclays had failed to obtain possession of the property in France at first instance, as the judge found that Barclays had, in some way, failed in their legal duty to explain some of the terms of the mortgage to the parties.  He added that Barclays are appealing this order.  He was quite unable to tell me what would happen if Barclays failed in the appeal, but I find it impossible to believe that they will not be able to enforce their borrowing in some way in the future.  In normal circumstances, a deal would almost certainly be done, but that is not a possibility here at present, due to the complete intransigence of the Wife.</p>

It does not matter, as I am clear that the property could not have been rented out prior to either date, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  He then dealt with the injunction he seeks.  He said that the Wife and her boyfriend had been denigrating his ownership of the two properties by saying she was in charge and that it was all hers.  He made the point that, if I make an injunction and give him permission to disclose the order, he will finally be able to show that she is incorrect.  He then gave some evidence about how he intended to enforce any order that I may make in France.  I do not consider it is necessary or helpful for me to set that out in this open judgment.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I will deal first with the achievable rent over the last three seasons.  I am satisfied that the Husband is entitled to seek sums for each of the three seasons, 2021/2022, 2022/2023, and 2023/2024, even though he had not launched his enforcement litigation until December 2022.  The order of Mostyn J was clear that Chalet Pearl was his.  The Wife deliberately cancelled the contract with Oyster Properties, having transferred the shares to him, so that she did not have to pay the rent to Oyster Properties.  The fact that he had become the owner of Oyster Properties makes it absolutely clear that he was entitled to the rent.  I am reinforced in this conclusion by the fact that the Wife did not pay the mortgage.  If she genuinely thought she was entitled to the property, there would be no possible reason for her not paying the mortgage.  She was just taking advantage of the fact that the property remained in her sole name, to enable her to take the rental income, whilst not accounting to the Husband for it and not paying the mortgage instalments.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept, however, that I should perform some complicated retrospective calculation as to how much rent she should have received during this period.  I am going to take the figures that she herself provided in her statement dated 15 February 2023.  It is fair to do this as she was not facing enforcement action from the Husband until December 2022.  In other words, if this is unfair to the Husband, he has only himself to blame because he did not institute proceedings earlier.  She says she received rent of &#8364;1,970,999 during this period.  I have no reason to doubt that figure.  She has produced invoices. The figures seem cogent and reliable.  She says the expenses were (&#8364;1,047,393), giving a net profit of &#8364;923,606.  These expenses are considerably higher than those given to me by the Husband in oral evidence for the 2018 year, namely &#8364;250,000 per annum.  Again, however, I propose to accept her figures. I do so for the same reasons as before, particularly that the Husband launched his litigation so late.  I also accept that there may have been extra expenses of getting the property ready for renting after Covid-19.  </p>

She had at least one rental thereafter, namely the rental in early March 2023 that she did not tell the court about in February 2023.  The Husband tells me that the season continues until 30 April.  I am going to do the best I can and assume she received further rentals of &#8364;750,000 from 27 February 2023 to the end of the season.  In this regard, I propose to increase slightly the Husband&#8217;s figure for expenses from 25% to 33%.  I therefore consider a profit element of &#8364;500,000 to be fair.  The Wife did not make any payments into the escrow account, when there must have been profit, particularly as she was not paying the mortgage.  If I have overstated the income, or understated the expenses, she has only herself to blame.  </p>

In relation to this season, the Wife is on very weak ground indeed, as she was fundamentally in breach of my order throughout that season.  I accept the Husband&#8217;s evidence that the Chalet has become far more desirable given the lack of snow elsewhere.  I further accept that he had a customer willing to  pay &#8364;775,000 over the Christmas period.  I cannot accept, however, that he would have generated total rentals of &#8364;3.3 million.  The figure is completely out of kilter with the 2017/2018 figure.  I take the view that inflation and the position of the chalet would have doubled the income figure from 2018 to approximately &#8364;2.5 million.  The Husband told me that the expenses would have been in the order of &#8364;528,000 but I am again going to take 33%.  The expenses would, therefore, have been &#8364;833,000 and the net profit to &#8364;1,666,670.  Again, if this is unfair to the Wife, she has only herself to blame.</p>

I have absolutely no idea when the Husband will finally obtain possession of the property.  I hope he will be able to do so before the next ski season.  If so, he will be able to rent it out himself.  It follows that I consider it would be quite wrong to ascribe any loss at this point as I would be plucking a figure out of the air with no evidence to support it and no knowledge of what will actually occur.</p>

Even if the Wife had been participating, it would have been unreasonable to expect her to deal with such a significant claim so close to the final hearing.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I then turn to the question of the mortgages.  The first point to make is that, if the Husband receives the net profits as a result of my order, it is up to him to pay the mortgage instalments.  There cannot be double counting.  I accept, however, that any penalties and late payment surcharges have been caused by the Wife not paying the mortgage or accounting to him for the rental income.  A second difficulty is that I do not know if Barclays will be able to enforce these amounts in any event.  I have decided that the &#8220;late payment surcharges&#8221; in relation to Chalet Pearl are the responsibility of the Wife from the date of my order dated 24 February 2023, but allowing her just over one further month to comply with my order, namely until 31 March 2023.  As she did not comply, the surcharges thereafter are her responsibility.   Again, the delay in launching proceedings means that it would be unfair to lay any earlier surcharges on the Wife.  I calculate that the surcharges after 1 April 2023 are as follows:-</p>

She also claims various other offsets in her statement dated 15 February 2023.  I reject her argument that the Husband should pay the costs she incurred associated with the winding up of Churchill Capital International Ltd.  In the same way, I reject her claim in relation to the costs of the London property.  There is nothing in the order of Mostyn J to justify any of these costs being the responsibility of the Husband.  Her claim for French legal costs fails for two reasons.  First, I have denied the Husband his French legal costs, so it is impossible to see why I should make him pay hers.  Second, I am clear that she is in the wrong in France, so it would be quite wrong for me to expect the Husband to pay her costs.   Her claim in relation to SARL Oyster also fails.  She was wrong to terminate the contract with SARL Oyster.  In relation to the English position, the company belonged to the Husband after the transfer of shares.  It was therefore his responsibility to deal with any creditors of the company, subject, of course, to issues of limited liability.  If the position is different in France, it is for the French courts to determine liability, not me.  Any costs incurred in relation to the children is a matter for child maintenance claims, not the application I have been hearing.  Finally, there was some suggestion that the Wife wished to make a CGT claim in relation to tax due by her on the transfer of Chalet Pearl to the Husband.  She has never advanced that claim.  She has provided no evidence.  She has not attended to argue the point.  Indeed, she has not transferred the property.  I make no order in her favour in that regard.  </p>
