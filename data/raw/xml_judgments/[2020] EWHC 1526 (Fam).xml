Second, the Moscow Property was transferred to Temur in 2018 at a time when the Wife was seeking to enforce the judgment abroad. The transfer was carried out in April 2018 by Sunningdale Ltd (&#8220;Sunningdale&#8221;), a Cypriot company beneficially owned by the Husband, transferring its interest in the Moscow Property to Solyanka Servis LLC, a Russian company. In June 2018 Sunningdale transferred its interest in Solyanka Servis to Temur.  </p>

She points to the Husband, with Temur&#8217;s assistance, having been engaged since about October 2014 in concerted efforts to ensure that all his assets were not amenable to enforcement.  She also maintains that Temur has received monies, directly or indirectly from the Liechtenstein trusts in circumstances where, since those trusts were established, the Husband has received very substantial sums from those trusts (known to exceed US$113 million since 2017) and he has, in turn, transferred well in excess of US$25 million to Temur since 2017. </p>

The shares, however, remain at present registered in his name. A very short time after the Wife issued her Particulars of Claim in January 2020, Sunningdale &#8211; the company controlled by the Husband - suddenly commenced proceedings in Moscow against Temur to recover the shares for his default of payment. Temur states that he will not defend this claim. The Wife contends that this litigation is a transparent and collusive attempt by the Husband and Temur to move the shares out of Temur&#8217;s ownership so that this court cannot grant effective relief now that a claim has been brought against Temur in this jurisdiction. </p>

In summary, certain judgment debtors &#8211; including the Husband and Cotor &#8211; have challenged enforcement in France, Russia and Switzerland on the basis of an argument that the Wife is not entitled to enforce the judgment in her own name because she has assigned her rights to Burford. That argument was said to be misconceived as the Deed of Assignment only granted a security interest to Burford enforceable in the event of default by the Wife and did not divest the Wife of her right to enforce the judgment itself. By a judgment of the Zurich District Court dated 16 April 2020 and received on 4 May 2020, that court discharged an arrest of one of the Husband&#8217;s Swiss bank accounts on the basis that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the applicant alone would no longer be actively legitimised to assert the assigned claims</span>&#8221;.

That was done in the hope that judgment debtors would find it impossible to challenge the Wife&#8217;s standing to enforce the judgment debt in her sole name.  </p>

Further, it is submitted that Temur&#8217;s counter-claim raises a novel and important issue of public policy concerning the conduct of family proceedings, namely whether third-party litigation funding, with an interest in sharing the financial spoils of litigation, should be permitted in family proceedings. As Mr Owen QC submitted, Burford Capital &#8211; by trafficking in the outcome of the spoils of this matrimonial litigation &#8211; hoped to pocket a large reward and make a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">big fat killing</span>&#8221; for its shareholders. He drew my attention to the unique position of family proceedings in public policy terms in that such proceedings are excluded from the category of legal proceedings for which a legal advisor might enter into a conditional fee agreement [see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41/section/58" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.58</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41" uk:canonical="1990 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Courts and Legal Services Act 1990</ref>] and sought to draw an analogy therefrom with third party litigation funding.  </p>

Mr Gourgey QC submitted that Temur&#8217;s applications were nakedly tactical manoeuvres intended to gain an advantage over the Wife by discovering how much funding she has and the terms on which it was provided. Temur&#8217;s strategy was to prevent the Wife from instructing solicitors funded by or on behalf of Burford Capital with the result that she would be unable to pursue her claim against him and the Husband. The suggestion that public policy required the Wife to be deprived of the funding she needed in order to pursue enforcement of this court&#8217;s orders and that the interests of justice were served by leaving her without the means of unravelling Temur and the Husband&#8217;s dishonest schemes to frustrate and evade those orders turned both justice and the public interest on their heads.   </p>

That was not a matter for the court where Parliament had chosen not to enact and/or bring into force rules relating to third-party funding. This was particularly undesirable in circumstances where litigation funding by professional funders, adhering to a Code of Conduct, has been sanctioned and approved in this jurisdiction as facilitating access to justice and as being unlikely to corrupt the same. </p>

The claimants had been brought low by the initial wrong done to them and by the costs and stress of prolonged litigation in which no quarter was given. They were faced with an extraordinarily complicated task in proving the damage that they had suffered and there was a real risk that lack of funds might result in their losing the fruits of their litigation.

He also recommended that a voluntary code be established (para. 2.12) and that it be made clear that funding arrangements complying with such regulation would not be overturned on grounds of maintenance and champerty (para. 5.3). The Civil Justice Council &#8211; an agency of the Ministry of Justice &#8211; published its Code of Conduct in 2011 which is administered on a selfregulatory basis by the ALF. In his sixth lecture on the Civil Litigation Costs Review Implementation Programme, Lord Justice Jackson stated that the Code of Conduct was a satisfactory implementation of his recommendations. </p>

That jurisdiction derives from the pre-Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vict C 66) powers of the Chancery and other courts to grant injunctions (see pp.329H -330A of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Fourie v Le</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Roux</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 WLR 320" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 WLR 320</ref> (HL) per Lord Scott).

Mr Owen QC submitted that Temur had a cognizable interest in preventing proceedings being unlawfully maintained against him and that interest subsisted after the abolition of the tort of champerty. Further, or alternatively, the power to grant injunctive relief arises due to the Court&#8217;s inherent power to protect its own processes from abuse, for example by granting a stay of champertously maintained proceedings.  </p>

The consent of Burford Capital was said to be required for the Wife to settle the financial remedy proceedings against any of the Respondents and Burford Capital was said to be able to require the Wife to take particular steps in the conduct of the proceedings. The January 2018 Deed of Assignment has been revoked as paragraphs 21-22 make clear and Mr Owen QC sought to persuade me that this was a matter of significance since the court no longer had any factual material upon which it could examine the relationship between the Wife and Burford Capital. That is not strictly speaking accurate since the statement of Mr Riem survives unchallenged and describes the Wife&#8217;s control over the litigation process and the involvement of Burford in that.  Though I regard it as unfortunate that the Deed of Assignment was revoked during the course of the hearing, it does not alter the import of Mr Riem&#8217;s statement. I observe that, even if Temur&#8217;s pleaded allegations were true, Burford&#8217;s mere control would not - of itself - suffice to engage the law of champerty. A funder of litigation is not forbidden from having rights of control but is forbidden from having a degree of control which would be likely to undermine or corrupt the process of justice (see the Court of Appeal&#8217;s decision in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Excalibur</span> cited in paragraph 43 and </p>

Rather more significantly, his Defence does not specifically plead that third-party funding is impermissible in family proceedings. However, the main thrust of Mr Owen QC&#8217;s oral submissions and of much of his skeleton argument was to the effect that there is a public policy against champerty in family proceedings which renders the litigation funding arrangements in this case unlawful. The failure to specifically plead a prohibition on third party funding in family proceedings is unfathomable in the particular circumstances of this case. However, given the seriousness of the issues at stake, I have decided to overlook any deficit in pleading and assume that the allegedly unlawful and champertous nature of the Wife&#8217;s funding arrangements already pleaded applies with particular force to family proceedings. </p>

He submitted, by analogy with conditional fee agreements, that litigation funding made the settlement of proceedings more difficult and that it was to the detriment of the parties that the litigation funder received a share of finite matrimonial property. Furthermore, the intervention of a litigation funder would inflate the needs of the funded party artificially. He referred me to the debate in the House of Lords on 26 January 1999 when the Government accepted the prohibition of conditional funding arrangements in family proceedings and submitted that many of the concerns therein articulated were also relevant to third-party litigation funding in family proceedings. Those concerns were in summary: (a) that the ethos of family proceedings was to limit costs and acrimony by seeking compromise and avoiding adversarial stances; (b) it was often difficult in family proceedings to define who had won or lost; (c) ancillary relief claims are not the same as claims for debt or for compensatory damage since the court&#8217;s discretion means that there is seldom a precisely predictable result; and (d) the court would not be able to exercise its control over the costs of matrimonial litigation if it were not privy to the detail of funding arrangements.   </p>

This concerned third-party litigation funding in matrimonial proceedings by reason of an application by a husband for a declaration that the proposed third-party funding of his claim did not breach the laws of champerty and maintenance. The husband in that case submitted that those arrangements fell, for example, within an Access to Justice Exception in article 10 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. Mrs Justice Ng surveyed the law with respect to thirdparty litigation funding in matrimonial proceedings worldwide, yet her decision was taken in a Hong Kong context where maintenance and champerty remain crimes and torts. Unsurprisingly she refused the application for declaratory relief. Whilst the case is of interest in its detailed description of the public policy arguments in play, I did not find it decisive in reaching my decision.</p>

That analogy seems to me to be misplaced because the different treatment afforded by the courts to contracts with lawyers is obvious. There is a clear concern about a person&#8217;s lawyer having a financial interest in the outcome of proceedings which might improperly influence both the advice and the representation given. Those concerns do not arise in thirdparty funding arrangements where the lawyers conducting the proceedings have no financial interest in the outcome.  In this context, I am also mindful of the inappropriateness of extending the prohibition on third party litigation funding to family proceedings as if settlement were any more difficult/desirable in those proceedings or because a portion of the monies at stake in the litigation were used to pay a funder.  </p>

Those submissions are misplaced, in my view, in circumstances where third-party funding has been accepted in this jurisdiction to be desirable to facilitate access to justice and where first-instance decisions in the Family Division have concluded that (a) it is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a necessary and invaluable service in the right case</span>&#8221; (per Mr Justice Francis at paragraph 53 in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Weisz v Weisz</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2019/3101" uk:canonical="[2019] EWHC 3101 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWHC 3101 (Fam)</ref>) and (b) that nothing should be said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">that makes it even more difficult for litigants to obtain litigation funding in the future, particularly given that there is no legal aid available in this area anymore</span>&#8221; (per Mr Justice Moor at paragraph 9 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Young v Young</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/3637" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 3637 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 3637 (Fam)</ref>).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Is there merit in an investigation of the detail of the Wife&#8217;s funding arrangements which would justify refusing the application to strike-out because there is an issue of principle about those arrangements in family proceedings? Having thought about this matter very carefully, I do not think that there is. To do so would require more than the matters pleaded in the Defence or advanced in argument by Mr Owen QC. Ignorance as to the precise terms of the Wife&#8217;s funding arrangements does not, of itself, justify further enquiry or disclose reasonable grounds for bringing the application particularly in circumstances where the Wife&#8217;s litigation funder adheres to the ALF&#8217;s Code of Conduct. In that context, Temur is required to show some prejudice or injustice to him arising from those funding arrangements or that the funding arrangement may be champertous. That might constitute a legally recognisable ground. However, I have seen nothing in his case which comes close to that. In my view, he cannot sensibly maintain, in the light of the Court of Appeal decision in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Excalibur,</span> that the litigation funding in this case is prima facie champertous.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Furthermore, this is not a developing area of jurisprudence which requires detailed consideration by this court. Litigation funding practised by a funder adhering to the Code of Conduct has been endorsed by the senior courts in robust terms. Funding is being provided post-judgment to enable the Wife to secure the recovery of sums already awarded to her in the face of the Husband&#8217;s contumelious conduct (assisted by others) in evading and frustrating the enforcement of the judgment debt. Without such funding, the Wife would lose access to justice and the chance of recovering the monies awarded to her in December 2016. In those particular circumstances and for the other reasons set out in this judgment, the concerns expressed in a Parliamentary debate over twenty years ago have little traction.  </p>

Had he not withdrawn his application for disclosure in respect of that material, I would have refused it since the terms of the Wife&#8217;s retainer with her solicitors would have been irrelevant and because any funding agreement between PCB and Burford Capital was not in her control since neither were parties to the litigation. </p>

The Wife sought clarification from Temur&#8217;s legal representatives as to who had provided this information to the media and was told that Temur had not spoken to the Observer and had provided no assistance or comment. There followed an exchange of correspondence as to the alleged involvement of media agencies with each of the parties.

Previous judgments in this case had found the Husband to have acted in an improper and dishonest manner throughout the proceedings and to have conducted a campaign to avoid his liabilities under the judgment. The Wife&#8217;s case now involved her son, Temur, in an attempt to recover monies given to him by the Husband as part of his efforts to avoid payment of the judgment debt to her. It was said to be imperative for the media to have access to and publish information in the proceedings &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">should that information give rise to serious financial queries, irregularities or improprieties, or even criminal or contemptuous conduct as it has in the past</span>&#8221; (letter dated 3 April 2020). </p>

His personal financial information would not become public otherwise but for these proceedings. He asserts that there would be detriment to his activities as a trader if details of those activities were to become known but there is no witness statement in support of that contention. Mr Howard QC submitted that the damage would be obvious, but this court requires evidence in relation to those matters before derogating from the principle of open justice. Likewise, I have been provided with no information as to why Temur&#8217;s involvement with a company, separate from his trading activities, requires the making of the order sought. I also note that the material in the Schedule to the Defence identified in paragraph 9(b) is material on which Temur relies as being of relevance to his Defence and thus might be thought to be of crucial importance within the proceedings.   </p>

However, I am persuaded that there should be an order, similar to that directed in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Chodiev</span>, preventing the reporting of Temur&#8217;s address; the identifying numbers of his bank accounts including their IBAN number; the reference number of his tax returns and the contents thereof; the details of the specific products contained in his investment portfolios; and the name of his UKbased trading platform. A restriction on reporting those matters would preserve the privacy and security of his home and his financial affairs from those who might seek to do him harm or defraud him and does not inhibit the proper reporting of these proceedings. However, general details of the sums gifted to Temur by the Husband, his trading gains and losses or the gist of his trading activity cannot legitimately fall within my order, not least because it would make it very hard indeed to make a comprehensible report of the proceedings.  </p>

I see no justification whatsoever for restricting access to court documents referred to in open court and to impose upon the media the necessity of making applications to see any court document. That would fly in the face of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Dring </span>and, if the tenor of this litigation to date is anything to go by, would expend considerable and valuable court time in what can only be described as disproportionate satellite litigation, scrutinising the contents of court documents to see if they might be disclosed so as to permit media reporting. My order protecting Temur&#8217;s private information is sufficient to protect his Article 8 rights and strikes the correct balance between the Article 6, 8 and 10 rights in play in this case. The media will be bound by that order &#8211; nothing more stringent is required and certainly not an order in the form envisaged by paragraph 13.  </p>

In that context, I note that paragraph 7 of the Code of Conduct for litigation funders requires a funder to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">observe the confidentiality of all information and documentation relating to the dispute to the extent that the law permits</span>&#8221; and also obliges a funder to preserve confidentiality or behalf of any funder&#8217;s subsidiary or associated entity. Whilst that is not to the same effect as the prohibition on collateral use required by either the FPR or the CPR of the Wife herself, use by a litigation funder of material in a manner not permitted to its client would likely represent a serious breach of the Code of Conduct. </p>

The provision of advance written assurances from third parties &#8211; for example, potential witnesses - to whom documents might be disclosed might impede each party&#8217;s ability to prepare their case. Moreover, it would appear to require a foreign court to provide assurances in advance of the disclosure of any material to it. That provision might practically inhibit the use of material in enforcement proceedings in certain jurisdictions, rendering paragraph 13 (ii) nugatory. </p>

I note that it is not submitted by Mr Howard QC that providing disclosure of sums in excess of $100,000 is said to be onerous. In the circumstances of this case, this court requires clarity as to the sums transferred by the Husband (or entities associated with him) to Temur. Furthermore, even if the Wife had accepted in her Request for Information that $500,000 was the amount which should apply to the detailing of the amounts of generalised financial support provided by the Husband to Temur, I do not consider that to be acceptable in the circumstances of this case where the Wife has only recovered about &#163;5,000,000 of the huge sum owed to her by the Husband.   </p>

Following an exchange of correspondence, there is a substantial measure of agreement between the parties on which requests do and do not need to be answered. However, I was asked to determine whether requests 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16 and 19(a) should be answered by Temur. Mr Gourgey QC confirmed to me that he no longer sought an answer to request 22(b). </p>

He relied on <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">McPhilemy v Times Newspapers and Others</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 3 All ER 775" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 3 All ER 775</ref> in which Lord Woolf MR observed that the need for extensive pleadings (including particulars) should be reduced by the requirement that witness statements are now exchanged. This reinforced paragraph 1.2 of PD18 in the CPR which states that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">A Request should be concise and strictly confined to matters which are reasonably necessary and proportionate to enable the first party to prepare his own case or to understand the case he has to meet</span>&#8221;. The twin requirements of necessity and proportionality are to be strictly applied in the circumstances (see paragraph 63 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">King v Telegraph Group Ltd</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2004/613" uk:canonical="[2004] EWCA Civ 613" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWCA Civ 613</ref> per Lord Justice Brooke). </p>

It was not sufficient to answer a Request by saying that the information would be forthcoming in witness statements when the purpose of a Request was to allow a party to prepare her case and understand the case she had to meet. It was not contended by Temur that answering the Request was either onerous or disproportionate or that what was being asked was unnecessary. </p>

He is prepared to answer request 12 to explain why he failed to make the payment under the Purchase Agreement within one month of the register entry but refuses to provide information about, inter alia, who the representatives from Sunningdale were who offered him an opportunity to acquire the shares in Solyanka Servis or who participated in the negotiations which took place in about June 2018 and what form those negotiations took. Mr Howard QC submitted that this would all be answered in witness statements, but I see absolutely no difference in the information sought in those requests and that which Temur is willing to provide in response to Request 12. Request 11 asks whether Temur knew that the price he was paying was far less than the true value of Solyanka Servis and, if so, what he understood to be the reason for a sale at an undervalue. That information is important so that the Wife can understand Temur&#8217;s case as to the purpose of the transfer and also whether he can rely on the bona fide purchaser defence in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/423" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.423</ref> of the IA and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37</ref> of the MCA. That is simply asking for basic information about Temur&#8217;s case which should not await a witness statement. Requests 9-11 should be answered by Temur in accordance with the timetable I will direct.  </p>

The Wife has put in issue the authenticity of those documents. Mr Howard QC submitted that the Wife would get details of the correspondence when the documents were disclosed. However, that exchange of correspondence has already been disclosed and the Wife now needs information about, for example, how this correspondence was delivered to Temur which would allow her to investigate and prepare her case accordingly. Those Requests should also be answered &#8211; the information sought is not complex or onerous. </p>

Mr Howard QC said this was akin to cross-examination and would be dealt with in a witness statement by Temur. In my view, the Wife needs to know before witness statements whether it will be in issue that the return of the shares was agreed with the Husband given that she asserts this was a collusive arrangement between father and son. </p>

Mr Gourgey QC clarified that this related to money rather than other benefits in kind and confirmed that, prior to the hearing, the Wife&#8217;s legal representatives had clarified that Temur should answer this Request to the best of his knowledge as he may not know whether a payment he received came initially from one of the trusts. That clarification dealt with the concerns raised by Mr Howard QC before me so that Request can also be answered by Temur.  </p>

She had already disclosed the six documents from the Reviewable Documents which contained information about Temur&#8217;s personal, financial and business affairs and which would be relevant to his counter-claim. She will also disclose all other documents which are relevant to the pleaded issues in these proceedings by way of standard disclosure. Temur was not, however, entitled to see irrelevant Reviewable Documents. Temur had already received copies of all but one of the Reviewable Documents deployed in these proceedings for any purpose and Mr Gourgey QC confirmed that the Wife would provide him with the outstanding document. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I can deal with this issue shortly. First, Temur has already received all but one of the Reviewable Documents produced to this court and will shortly receive that missing document. He will not be prejudiced by not having had sight of the Reviewable Documents which have been relied on and thus produced to the court. Second, the Wife&#8217;s legal representatives have already scrutinised the Reviewable Documents to identify personal/financial information relating to him and have made that material available to him. He has no need to see documents which the Wife&#8217;s solicitors are satisfied do not contain any such information. The suggestion that he needs to see all the Reviewable Documents to check that the Wife&#8217;s solicitors have, in effect, done their job properly and complied with their obligation and duties to the court is, in my view, entirely misconceived. Third, my order in November 2019 is not directly applicable to Temur&#8217;s role in these proceedings. The Husband was entitled to a copy of the Reviewable Documents as those documents were generated during Mr Henderson&#8217;s employment by the Husband and thus &#8220;belonged&#8221; to the Husband.

Mr Howard QC submitted that this was essential so that Temur could know the case he had to meet and would not be subject to trial by ambush. He sought to draw a distinction between documents which were the property of the Wife and those which had come into her possession either because she obtained them in proceedings elsewhere or because they were provided to her. That latter category represented documents which must be disclosed in full to Temur. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am not persuaded that the distinction Mr Howard QC sought to draw between documents the Wife owned and those which had come into her possession is applicable to the disclosure obligation in this case. Parties are obliged to disclose the documents material to the proceedings, the existence of which a party is aware and which are or have been in that party&#8217;s control [PD21A, paragraph 2.1]. The concept of ownership is not apposite here. Furthermore, I accept Mr Gourgey QC&#8217;s submission that it is difficult to see how Temur&#8217;s right to a fair hearing would be prejudiced by the Wife having complied properly with her disclosure obligations to the court and holding onto irrelevant documents which did not need to be disclosed. There is thus no need for an order for specific disclosure of the entirety of the Kerman and Liechtenstein papers. </p>
