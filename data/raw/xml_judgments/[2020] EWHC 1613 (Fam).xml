The first listed day of the hearing was Monday 23 March 2020, which has meant that as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, it has not been conducted in the Royal Courts of Justice, but rather by means of a videoconferencing facility, through which the parties and the court have all engaged entirely remotely, save for the wife&#8217;s evidence which she gave whilst in the same room as her Counsel and instructing solicitor, albeit at an appropriate distance. In this way I have taken the evidence of the parties, one witness who was overseas, and the Single Joint Expert, Ms Hall, as well as written and oral submissions from both leading counsel.  </p>

They met in 1998 and married in September 2000. The parties have two daughters; aged 8 and 3. The children respectively attend a fee paying school and nursery in central London.   </p>

The parties separated in October/November 2017 and shortly afterwards the husband moved into rented accommodation; he now has a new partner with whom he has a young son, born in 2019. The wife continues to live in the former family home with the children of the marriage.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The wife presented her divorce petition in February 2018. Decree Nisi was pronounced in July 2018, and it has not yet been made Absolute. Child arrangements have not proved to be easy, and will no doubt have proved costly for the parties. That unfortunate background makes the costs of these financial proceedings merely a part of what must add up to a daunting total. Those financial costs for the husband stand at &#163;697,903 and for the wife at &#163;812,808. This is especially striking when one of the major issues between the parties beyond the value of their assets has been their past and future liquidity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Shortly after the parties&#8217; marriage, in 2001, the parties moved to mainland Europe for the husband&#8217;s work. The wife too worked in the financial sector whilst living there  and continued to do so after the parties returned to England in 2004, until 2011. Following the birth of their first child, in 2012, the wife left formal employment and has not returned. In 2016, the parties moved with their elder daughter to live abroad  where the husband&#8217;s business was setting up a new office, and where their younger daughter was born. The family returned to London in 2017.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Not long after their return the marriage broke down. Given the value of the parties&#8217; assets, examined below, and their agreement that any award (within the spectrum of those contended for as fair for her under the sharing principle) will meet her needs appropriately without the need for her to consider a return to work if she does not wish to, her future earning capacity has not been a live issue between them. It should be said that, insofar as she may choose to return to work in the future, there has not been a suggestion that that should happen within a timescale that will affect her liquidity during the time period which will be necessary to enable full implementation of the court&#8217;s order. </p>

Plans to unite the properties have been put on hold. Flat A is valued at &#163;4.4m, with a mortgage of &#163;3.5m secured on it. Flat C is worth &#163;1.7m against a mortgage of &#163;1.1m, and Flat B is worth &#163;515,000. Accordingly, whilst all three flats have a gross value of &#163;6.6m they only have equity of around &#163;1.9m.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">These mortgages over the three properties are inevitably expensive to maintain. In the period since separation the parties have used the liquidity available to them to meet these and other property payments. This has been because the husband&#8217;s income has been significantly reduced from its previous levels and so has not been sufficient to service the family outgoings. Those costs together with living and legal expenses have reduced the investment fund held at the time of the parties&#8217; Forms E from around &#163;4.2m to just under &#163;1.5m now. </p>

B Ltd sits at the top of a corporate structure. The husband is one of the founder members of the business, as well as being its single largest shareholder. The business of B Ltd now takes two forms: Proprietary Trading, where employees trade in the markets and make profits/losses from those trades, and Market Making, where the business acts as a middle-man to facilitate trades. It deploys its own funds in the marketplace - it does not borrow money or use third parties&#8217; funds. The traders use B Ltd&#8217;s money, so that the outcome of each trade directly impacts on the value of the shareholder&#8217;s funds in the company.  </p>

The husband and two other co-founders, Mr Y and Mr Z, are the directors of B Ltd: I heard evidence from Mr Y. Collectively, these three own nearly two thirds of the shares in the company. The husband holds about 1/3 of the total shares. The remaining shares are divided between the further employees, or former employees, or on their behalf.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The business now employs some 190 people, many more than the amount at the point when the parties&#8217; marriage broke down.  It briefly operated in 3 areas, adding asset management to its other 2 arms in 2016. However, this proved short lived. After the departure of their main trader Mr X in late 2018 to set up a rival business, the asset management arm was closed down, and the business returned to its core activities - proprietary trading and market making. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The husband relies upon the fact that B Ltd has no underlying regular income stream.  It briefly received some management fee income, but that ended when the short-lived asset management arm shut down in 2018. The traders therefore need to make substantial profits, to cover the business&#8217; operating costs, and to pay their own significant bonuses, which keep them employed by B Ltd rather than moving to rival concerns, before then turning a profit for the shareholders.  However, historically they have done that very effectively. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In order to effect multiple trades, the business uses a number of prime brokers.  The prime broker will deploy its own capital to place the trade and requires B Ltd to provide collateral against its own assets. It is therefore the husband&#8217;s case that the value of B Ltd can be set at the end of each day, in that it represents the sum of the accumulated profit held by the business. He points out that talented staff are integral, and that selecting and retaining traders who will continually produce substantial profits for B Ltd is now a key skill of his. In particular he points to the period after the departure of Mr X towards the end of 2018, as a period when he had to work hard to maintain team morale and replace departing staff with others who would produce comparably good results going forward. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The husband acknowledges that most trading firms have a relatively short life span because of the difficulty in continuing to make substantial profits over a lengthy period in a fiercely competitive market. Eventually, like some other such businesses, he suggests that B Ltd will be wound up. However, although most trading businesses do not last much more than about 10 years &#8211; and B Ltd is now in year 9 of its life cycle &#8211; he says that he and his partners have no immediate plans to liquidate their asset. His case is that the very significant recent increase in staff numbers presages a new attempt to grow the business and increase profitability for the existing shareholders, rather than as any form of preparation for a sale or other liquidation at any price greater than the net asset value of the company. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">During the brief tenure of the asset management arm of the business, the husband operated as a trader in asset management. He however stepped back from that section of the business even before its early closure. His performance is said to have suffered during the first 6 months of 2018, which his counsel Mr Peel QC describes as &#8216;a very difficult time for (him) personally because of the divorce and children proceedings&#8217;. I have no doubt that that was the case. He resigned from his asset management role in August 2018, just a few months before Mr X&#8217;s departure and the closure of that element of the business. He continues to have oversight of the other teams.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The single most important dispute between the parties revolves around the value to be ascribed to the husband&#8217;s interest in B Ltd. It is essentially the reason why the case has not been resolved before trial. Resolving that issue has generated a very significant input not just from the SJE, Ms Faye Hall, who has reported, responded and updated regularly during the past 18 months. But also latterly from Mr Mark Bezant, who has been deployed for the wife as a shadow accountant to provide a critical evaluation of Ms Hall&#8217;s methodology.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Although a <span style="font-style:italic">Daniels v Walker</span> application was made on her behalf at the PTR in January 2020 for the court to receive full evidence from Mr Bezant, Holman J declined such an application as coming too late, but did allow the admission into evidence of a letter which Mr Bezant had written on 3 December 2019, setting out his concerns about the basis of the valuation before the Court. The accountants subsequently met and have produced a statement identifying the areas on which they are agreed. Mr Peel QC for the husband had the opportunity to cross-examine Mr Bezant on the contents of his letter, but, on the basis that no positive case as to valuation is there set out, he declined. The only expert testimony that I therefore heard came from Ms Hall, to whom Mr Webster QC for the wife put the concerns which Mr Bezant had raised. I have carefully considered the content of their joint statement. </p>

The husband&#8217;s income for the last 4 tax years has been: April 2016 - &#163;5,123,865 gross; April 2017 - &#163;2,086,503 gross; April 2018 - &#163;2,411,865 gross; April 2019 - &#163;411,072 gross; April 2020 - a gross salary of &#163;50,000pa, rising to &#163;200,000 in December 2019, and a bonus of &#163;959,564 relating to the business&#8217; year to June 2019, paid in August 2019. </p>

This has forced the parties, and in particular the wife, to use up much of the balance of the parties&#8217; liquid capital in meeting costs that would in previous years been treated as income expenditure. Previously, the husband has (up to 2016) received substantial dividends from the company, as well as significant bonuses. For different reasons unconnected with the breakdown of the marriage, he says that these are no longer available to him. </p>

In addition the husband relies on the business&#8217; internal policy of seeking to maintain a balance 4 times its annual running costs as a cash float within the company (which it is not currently doing thanks in significant part to its recent heavy recruitment of new staff); the demands of the Prime Brokers that all of the trades placed by B Ltd are backed with cash collateral; and a concern that staff might mistake the payment of healthy bonuses as the prelude to exit preparations by the major shareholders, which in turn might trigger an exodus from their ranks. </p>

Thus, he says, in a year where some make profits from their trades but others losses, full bonuses to the profit-makers will be paid, which may therefore be disproportionately large having regard to the overall profitability of the company. Historically he has been both active and successful in his trading, which has led to his becoming entitled to substantial bonuses over the years. Now that he is not trading directly, he says that the prospects for him to receive significant bonuses going forward is reduced. His benefit comes in the increase in the value of his equity through the successful trading of those that he recruits. </p>

In a normal year this would make little odds, but in a year when the company suffers a sharp drop in profitability, as it did in the year to 30 June 2019, in the wake of the closure of the asset management arm, the reduction is magnified by being calculated against the backdrop of the bonuses paid in August 2018, on the back of the year to the previous June when the business recorded a net profit of over &#163;60m. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">That drop in B Ltd profitability in the year to 2019 has been explained and is readily understandable. So too is the fact that the husband&#8217;s bonus paid in August 2019, of &#163;942,000 gross, was a lesser sum than that paid to at least one of his fellow directors, on the basis that whilst he may have worked hard over that time to preserve the business, he did not create profit which is the major driver of remuneration. What on its face is more striking is the fact that this year was not the nadir of the husband&#8217;s earnings. It was rather in the previous year, when B Ltd itself was in very significant profit, that the husband&#8217;s performance &#8211; he says in large part due to the strains of the breakdown of his marriage &#8211; was so poor that he received a bonus in August 2018 of only &#163;308,958 for his efforts in the previous year. As I will discuss below, that is to be set against the fact that the net asset value of his shareholding in the business in fact increased during the twelve months to June 2018 by a gross figure of over &#163;12.5m.  </p>

She also pointed </p>

These considerations included the fact that no formal or informal offers had ever been made in respect of the business, and that a sale of the husband&#8217;s equity was restricted by the Shareholders&#8217; Agreement to sales on an internal market, which I will consider in more detail below. Taking the figures as at October 2018, she arrived at an applicable ratio (rounded) of 1.4, which ratio Mr Webster &#8216;with some reservation&#8217; invites me to apply to the October 2019 NAV of the husband&#8217;s shareholding in B Ltd in calculating the quantum of the wife&#8217;s award. </p>

The underlying aim of the policy as described by the husband is that all shares are held by employees so that they have &#8220;skin in the game&#8221; and B Ltd vetoes any attempt to sell shares externally. This is evidently not a completely accurate description, as some former employees, given their high churn rate, retain their shares for some years after departure, and will not normally be required to sell immediately. Equally, some employees do choose for tax reason to have their shares held by family members, or other vehicles.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Those restrictions include a narrow annual sale window in what is an internal market for share sales and purchases between employees. This means that there is a practical limit to the number of shares which can be sold; which is determined annually by whether there are sufficient purchasers to buy the shares. In the past 2 years, not all of the shares which have been offered for sale have in fact been taken up. The value of each share is set by the NAV referable to the June year-end accounts just past, and calculated by the auditors. Sales to third parties are only allowed in very exceptional situations, and have never in practice occurred. Borrowing against shares is barred without consent, and whilst as indicated it is possible for employees to transfer shares to trusts or family members with permission of the directors, the directors are able to refuse a request to transfer shares in this way, and are able to refuse to register any such transfer. Whilst the husband&#8217;s own expressed reluctance would ordinarily create little traction, the rarity of this having taken place historically is relevant. In any event, the wife&#8217;s primary case is for a clean break in a fixed sum paid over a period of years, a similar scheme to the husband&#8217;s, albeit in significantly greater amounts. </p>

Whilst such value will, as she comments, capture all of the historic profitability in the company (and this is especially so in absence of any dividends in the past 3 years), it doesn&#8217;t appear on its face to capture the fully rounded value to the shareholders of an edifice which has been remarkably successful at generating profits over the 9 years of its existence to date. That concern is only compounded by the husband&#8217;s frank evidence that he would not want to sell his shares now, at NAV, because of course they are worth more to him than that, in that he anticipates continuing to operate B Ltd into the future, and to continue to recruit staff to its banner whose efforts will only swell the value of the equity in the company. </p>

In other words, whether any third party would see value in acquiring B Ltd as a going concern, at a premium based upon its past trading record. It is striking that no example has been citied to me of any similar entity having been acquired in such a way. The husband&#8217;s case is that, if he were to depart, the collection of employed traders which he has assembled would soon dissipate, and with them, their individual ability to generate profits for the shareholders.  His case is put upon the basis that the equity in B Ltd is no more than a pile of cash, the accumulated profits of past trades, and essentially that no-one is going to pay more for a pile of cash than its simple value.  </p>

What this means in practise on analysis is that even if such an offer were made now, the traders whose skill was being purchased by the prospective buyer would be substantially different from those who were in place when the parties separated. So, any Price/book calculation would have to be applied to the NAV at the appropriate time &#8211; which time I will discuss below. </p>

If the personnel stay, as I accept that they do, because of the current directors&#8217; enlightened bonus policy, it is foreseeable that the departure of the directors would soon precipitate the departure of many of their traders. That is not to say that such an acquisition is impossible, simply that it is not sufficiently likely, especially in the absence of any obvious precedents, to render it fair to the husband to make an award to the wife on the assumption that it is more likely to happen than not. </p>

I have considered that the fact that the usual lifespan of such a concern is not much more than 10 years would suggest that an exit for the directors will come sooner rather than later. But equally, the fact that the current rapid expansion does not suggest that this is a business on the verge of wind-down by its directors. There is no evidence before me of any impending sale, and the evidence of both the husband and Mr Y very clearly is that none such is in prospect &#8211; nor any other exit.

A thorough investigation into these differences can be extremely expensive and of doubtful utility". I understand, of course, that the application of the sharing principle can be said to raise powerful forces in support of detailed accounting. Why, a party might ask, should my "share" be fixed by reference other than to the real values of the assets? However, this is to misinterpret the exercise in which the court is engaged. The court is engaged in a broad analysis in the application of its jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Causes Act, not a detailed accounting exercise. As Lord Nicholls said, detailed accounting is expensive, often of doubtful utility and, certainly in respect of business valuations, will often result in divergent opinions each of which may be based on sound reasoning. The purpose of valuations, when required, is to assist the court in testing the fairness of the proposed outcome. It is not to ensure mathematical/accounting accuracy, which is invariably no more than a chimera. Further, to seek to construct the whole edifice of an award on a business valuation which is no more than a broad, or even very broad, guide is to risk creating an edifice which is unsound and hence likely to be unfair. In my experience, valuations of shares in private companies are among the most fragile valuations which can be obtained." </span></p>

The reasons for this are many. In the first place there is likely to be no obvious market for a private company. Second, even where valuers use the same method of valuation they are likely to produce widely differing results. Third, the profitability of private companies may be volatile, such that a snap shot valuation at a particular date may give an unfair picture. Fourth, the difference in quality between a value attributed to a private company on the basis of opinion evidence and a sum in hard cash is obvious. Fifth, the acid test of any valuation is exposure to the real market, which is simply not possible in the case of a private company where no one suggests that it should be sold. Moylan J is not a lone voice in this respect: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">A v A <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2818" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2818 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2818 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 FLR 115" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 FLR 115</ref></span><span style="font-size:11pt"> at [61] &#8211; </span></p>

As referred to by both King LJ and Lewison LJ [in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Versteegh</span><span style="font-size:11pt">], the broad choices are (i) "fix" a value; (ii) order the asset to be sold; and (iii) divide the asset in specie:&#8230;The court has to assess the weight which can be placed on the value even when using a fixed value for the purposes of determining what award to make. This applies both to the amount and to the structure of the award, issues which are interconnected, so that the overall allocation of the parties' assets by application of the sharing principle also effects a fair balance of risk and illiquidity between the parties. Again, I emphasise, this is not to mandate a particular structure but to draw attention to the need to address this issue when the court is deciding how to exercise its discretionary powers so as to achieve an outcome that is fair to both parties. I would also add that the assessment of the weight which can be placed on a valuation is not a mathematical exercise but a broad evaluative exercise to be undertaken by the judge.  </span></p>

The husband&#8217;s evidence has been that, since the last company figures were received in October 2019, the asset value of the company had first risen sharply, to the tune of more than &#163;50m, but then fallen back to a figure now which is probably less if anything than it was in June 2019. That he had not disclosed the fact of the original rise may fairly be the subject of criticism, regardless of the precise wording of the PTR order of Holman J, but of more import is the fact that, by fixing a price for the assumed value, there is no likelihood that that creates prejudice for either party in particular. </p>

The share price at that point, relied on by Mr Peel, was 12.03. However, notwithstanding the daily nature of the trading business, a closer analysis of business&#8217; history, and of its figures, makes it clear in my view that such a determination would produce an unfair outcome for the wife. </p>

For the reasons which I have already in part articulated, I reject this date as one on which to quantify equal sharing as being too far from the ending of the marital partnership to be a fair one for the husband. The evidence which I accept is that, although not perhaps in a trading role, he did make significant interventions to protect and preserve the value of the company from the autumn of 2018 onwards, as corroborated by the evidence of his co-director Mr Y. It is also of relevance that there has been a large turn-over of trading personnel since that time, and a significant increase in the number of employees.

Until that day, in a very real sense the husband is &#8216;continuing to trade with her share&#8217;, and it was plain from his answers to me that his hope, certainly on the basis of his proposal for resolution, was to be able to realise enough to meet his obligation largely from future remuneration, rather than by the sale of shares if he could avoid it.

As it is, the June 2018 price is likely to be well within 2 points of the current value, which has recently fallen back by more than &#163;50m on the basis of the husband&#8217;s evidence to me. I consider that it is fair to both parties to determine that the recovery from 2018, the roller-coaster that has been the last 9 months, and any progress or otherwise from this point are properly beyond what might be classed as marital endeavour. </p>

However, the payments to be made on the wife&#8217;s proposal are exponentially bigger than those offered by the husband. They also fall in June rather than in September. Whereas, in addition to the transfers of heavily mortgaged properties, the husband only suggests the payment of just over &#163;1m (payable in September 2020) before September 2021, the wife seeks &#163;6m in June 2020, and a further like sum in June 2021. Overall, her calculations would leave the husband to find a series of lump sums totalling &#163;30m, whereas the husband offers only &#163;11m, and so staged that in all probability he is hoping to pay these sums from his remuneration, however received, as opposed to by the sale of shares.

Whilst it clear that there is an active internal market for these shares, it is equally clear that there are usually more on offer than can be purchased, so there will be a limit on the amount that the husband can fairly raise annually. However, given the value of the equity attributable to his holding, and given his immediate obligation to the wife, the husband will have to begin taking far more active steps than he has to date to begin to realise some of his interest, or to extract funds by means of bonuses or dividends (if agreed) if the shares cannot be sold in sufficient quantity, or if he wishes to retain them. Providing fairly for the wife will require the husband to work hard to raise the amount required. I do accept Mr Webster&#8217;s submission that B Ltd&#8217;s current restrictions on liquidity are a function of the company&#8217;s desire to continue to trade at ever increasing levels, and he should therefore have some scope for flexibility. </p>
