I am concerned with AB who is aged seven.  The initial application was in relation to an application for a special guardianship order made by her maternal uncle and aunt.  The mother is, sadly, deceased and it was her wish for the child to live with her uncle and aunt, which she has done so since 2018.  The father lives in Ireland and, initially, supported that application.  The aunt and uncle were also happy to promote contact.  </span></p>

The child was made subject to a child protection plan on 2 March 2021 which was stepped down to a child in need plan on 5 April 2022.  </span></p>

As memory fades, there may be a desire to iron out wrinkles which may not be indicative of bad faith.

He advocated the forceful removal of the child who suffered from this from the home of one parent or the other.  His theories, however, have subsequently been criticised as having no scientific basis but they have been developed into a wider, more flexible concept of a child rejecting contact with a parent with whom they previously had a good relationship.</span></p>

In such cases, the focus of the Family Court rightly moved away from any psychological or psychiatric debate in order to concentrate on a particular behaviour of the particular parent in relation to the particular child in each individual case.  If that behaviour was found to be abusive, then action was taken, irrespective of whether or not a diagnosis of a particular personality or mental health condition in a parent could be made.  In my view, alienation should be approached in the same way as it is likely to be emotionally harmful for the child to grow up in circumstances in which there is an unjustified and wholly negative view of the absent parent&#8221;.  </span></p>

Most of these children will show some or all of a cluster of psychological responses.  Within an individual child (and between children in the same family) the presence of the features can vary rapidly over time and place, but in their full manifestation are so surprising and unique as to be unforgettable.  The proposed term &#8216;alienation&#8217; applies only to the cluster of psychological responses in the child with no need to presume a deliberate campaign of denigration by one parent.  There is now research data supporting a multifactorial aetiology for &#8216;alienation&#8217; following parental separation, involving contributions from both parents and vulnerabilities within the child&#8221;. </span></p>

I do not accept her evidence that she reported it to the social worker both by text and two subsequent visits.  It beggars belief that a professional would not only fail to record that allegation but not action a safeguarding referral in light of that and its seriousness and then lie about it to the Court.

As with the aunt, I find it not credible that this was not reported or made reference to within the provisions of the order of18 October 2022 when the uncle was represented and, indeed, the matter purportedly mentioned in court and to his solicitors at the time.

He, too, shares the aunt&#8217;s belief that the child should know the truth about the death of her mother, and Father&#8217;s purported role in it.  </span></p>

A clear example is when she had told professionals that her uncle told her that her father had slapped her when she was little and she could not remember it herself.  His answer to this is that she has made it up.  Similarly, when she states that they speak about the father in front of her and swear.  </span></p>

In denying this, he said that the aunt does not talk to him which is precisely in accordance with the aunt&#8217;s own evidence.  </span></p>

That provides that where, in any family proceedings in which a question arises with respect to the welfare of any child it appears to the Court that it may be appropriate for a care or supervision order to be made with respect to them, the Court may direct the appropriate authority to undertake an investigation of the child&#8217;s circumstances.
