	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this matter I am concerned with an application by Her Majesty&#8217;s Attorney General for an order committing Mr Elavi Dowie to prison for contempt arising out of his alleged interference with the administration of justice.  That application is brought under Part 19 of the FPR 2010 pursuant to FPR r. 37.3(3).  On 22 November 2021, I granted permission to the Attorney General to make her application for the committal of Mr Dowie.  The Attorney General is represented by Ms Kathryn Howarth of counsel.   Mr Dowie represented himself at the final hearing.  In circumstances where Mr Dowie is a serving prisoner, the hearing took place over CVP with the agreement of all parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the Attorney General issuing her application for permission to bring committal proceedings, on 2 July 2021, Keehan J adjourned the application in order that Mr Dowie could obtain legal representation.  On 9 August 2021, Dillex Solicitors informed the Government Legal Department that they had been instructed on behalf of Mr Dowie.  Legal aid was granted to Dillex Solicitors on 24 August 2021.  However, on 3 November 2021, Dillex Solicitors indicated they were having difficulty taking instructions from Mr Dowie.  On 2 December 2021, Dillex Solicitors indicated they were no longer acting for Mr Dowie in respect of the committal application.  On 10 January 2022, Mr Dowie applied for an adjournment of the final hearing on 18 January to allow him to obtain further legal representation (in the event, the hearing was adjourned after Mr Dowie contracted COVID-19).  Mr Dowie has not obtained further legal representation and he did not make an application for further time to secure such representation at the commencement of this hearing.</p>

The specific grounds relied on by the Attorney General are set out in a Statement of Grounds served on Mr Dowie at HMP Preston on 16 April 2021, which service Mr Dowie has acknowledged, and are as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence in support of the application made by the Attorney General is in the form of an affidavit from Kate Mulholland, Legal Adviser to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, which affidavit contains a number of exhibits. At the outset of the hearing Mr Dowie indicated that he wished to cross-examine Ms Mulholland.  However, in circumstances where the statement of Ms Mulholland simply relates, in short terms, the factual background to the application and the enquiries made by the Attorney General and where, as I will come to, Mr Dowie admits those facts, I exercised my case management powers to refuse to require the attendance of Ms Mulholland for cross-examination.  In short, I was satisfied that in circumstances where none of the facts contained in Ms Mulholland&#8217;s affidavit were disputed by Mr Dowie, it was neither necessary nor proportionate to require her attendance at the hearing.  To adopt the formulation used by the Administrative Court in <span style="font-style:italic">HM Attorney General v Pelling</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2005/414" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 414 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 414 (Admin)</ref> at [17], there were no relevant facts requiring any further elucidation.</p>

In the video, Mr Dowie states its purpose to be to highlight the fact that his application to the Family Court has not yet received a listing.  For the purposes of these proceedings, the key element of the video is a recording it contains from the private law proceedings before District Judge Turner.  Specifically, the recording includes the cross-examination by Mr Dowie of a psychologist whom he alleges in his video is &#8220;a criminal&#8221;, had wrongly diagnosed him with narcissistic personality disorder and a paranoid personality disorder and had plagiarised her report, together with Mr Dowie&#8217;s consequential exchanges with District Judge Turner, who Mr Dowie in the video accuses of fabricating evidence.  In addition, the video includes a recording of Mr Dowie&#8217;s cross-examination of the Child and Family Reporter.  It is plain that Mr Dowie made the recording in the courtroom.  At the outset of the first video, Mr Dowie makes references to orders preventing him from revealing certain information concerning the proceedings and at one point acknowledges that his conduct may be considered in violation of an order.</p>

The video includes Mr Dowie asserting that counsel has fraudulently obtained legal aid and that the court is complicit in criminal activity.

We remind ourselves, as we remind anyone here in court, and the defendant himself, that he is entitled to apply to the court before any hearing for permission to record the proceedings by way of some mechanical device. We make it clear that if he had attended the hearing today and had made that application (or invited counsel to make the application on his behalf), we should have granted permission. We should have done so because of his age and infirmity, his apparent diminution in hearing and also his burning sense of grievance and his total mistrust of any process by which the court's proceedings are recorded. Given that combination of circumstances we would have been prepared to grant permission. We invite any court which has to deal with him in future as a defendant or a party to litigation, or acting as a McKenzie friend for an individual who is not already legally represented, at least to consider with some sympathy an application, if he chooses to make one, for permission to make a recording.</p>

Our sympathy is designed to enable the defendant to make his own recording of the proceedings -- a recording which he would then feel able to trust in a way that he cannot repose confidence in the court process. That is by way of a footnote. Our decision is the order that we have made.&#8221;</p>

Where this occurs as a result of the act of a party who is bound by the order or of others acting at his direction or on his instigation, it constitutes a civil contempt by him which is punishable by the court at the instance of the party for whose benefit the order was made and which can be waived by him. The intention with which the act was done will, of course, be of the highest relevance in the determination of the penalty (if any) to be imposed by the court, but the liability here is a strict one in the sense that all that requires to be proved is service of the order and the subsequent doing by the party bound of that which is prohibited. When, however, the prohibited act is done not by the party bound himself but by a third party, a stranger to the litigation, that person may also be liable for contempt. There is, however, this essential distinction that his liability is for criminal contempt and arises not because the contemnor is himself affected by the prohibition contained in the order but because his act constitutes a wilful interference with the administration of justice by the court in the proceedings in which the order was made. Here the liability is not strict in the sense referred to, for there has to be shown not only knowledge of the order but an intention to interfere with or impede the administration of justice&#8212;an intention which can of course be inferred from the circumstances.&#8221;</p>

In respect of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref>, the conclusion of proceedings will likewise not prevent the commission of a contempt under one of the exceptions set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.12</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Dowie&#8217;s actions did, as a matter of fact, interfere with the administration of justice.  The statutory prohibition on recording in court without the permission of the court, and on publishing such recordings, reflects what Parliament considers to constitute a serious risk to the administration of justice if those actions are taken.  Within this context, I am satisfied that the recording by Mr Dowie of proceedings and the publication of those recordings, in breach of a prohibition against doing so, interfered with the administration of justice more widely through the very act of defying the clear prohibition on pursuing such a course of action.  The reason that this is so is obvious, both in respect of this case and more widely.  If those giving evidence in future private proceedings concerning this family were to be required to do so in the knowledge that their evidence has been recorded and relayed to the public at large they may well be reticent in giving full and frank evidence to the court in the future. The same risk arises if parties know that deeply personal matters relayed in evidence in private proceedings have been disseminated to the public at large.  Within this context, Mr Dowie&#8217;s children, the subject of the proceedings in respect of which recording publication has taken place, are still minors and the family&#8217;s circumstances are still the subject of some litigation under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>. More widely, if those giving evidence in private proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> generally were to be required to do so in the knowledge that their evidence may be recorded and relayed to the public at large may likewise be reticent in giving full and frank evidence to the court in the future.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Beyond this, in this case Mr Dowie uses his recordings to present the judge presiding over the proceedings, and the expert jointly instructed in the proceedings, as &#8220;criminals&#8221;, the judge as a fabricator of evidence, mother&#8217;s counsel as committing a fraud on the Legal Aid Agency and to assert that Cafcass has an agenda to allow &#8220;paedophilic individuals&#8221; access to children.  In my judgment, the use of recordings of proceedings held in private to level unfounded allegations and to paint a highly partial and partisan account of proceedings is itself apt to further undermine the administration of justice more widely.   </p>

In this regard,  the Attorney General contends that given the extent to which Mr Dowie was involved in proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, and that previous orders were made prohibiting him from publishing information about the family, it is simply not credible that he did not know he was involved in proceedings being heard in private. Mr Dowie contends that at the time he uploaded the videos he was not aware that the family proceedings were being heard in private, it being only later that he realised his actions were unlawful, at which time he reported himself to the police.   I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Dowie <span style="font-style:italic">did </span>know at the time he made the recordings, and certainly by the time he published the same, that the family proceedings were proceedings that were held in private.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst Mr Dowie also contends that his mental health at the time the recordings were made prevented him from understanding that the proceedings were in private, there is no medical evidence to support such a contention and such a contention is inconsistent with the evidence. Prior to his recording and publication of the information, Mr Dowie had been involved in family proceedings held in private since 2017.  On 4 January 2018, Mr Dowie was specifically prohibited from communicating to any third party, person, business or organisation any information or document arising from the proceedings and was prohibited from publishing the same.  As I have already noted, at the outset of the first video, Mr Dowie makes references to orders preventing him from revealing certain information concerning the proceedings and at one point acknowledges that his conduct may be considered in violation of an order.  In my judgment, this indicates that Mr Dowie was well aware at the time he published the videos that information concerning proceedings was sensitive and the subject of special considerations regarding publication.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition, and more importantly, at no point has it been suggested by Mr Dowie that he recorded the proceedings openly or that he sought permission to record the proceedings.  There is no indication on the recordings that the judge, the lawyers or the witnesses were aware that a recording was being made.  Within this context, I am satisfied that the recordings made by Mr Dowie were made covertly.  I am further satisfied that it is reasonable to infer from that covert action on his part that Mr Dowie was well aware that he was not permitted to record proceedings because they were being held in private.  In my judgment, that is the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the fact that Mr Dowie acted covertly.</p>

Whilst Mr Dowie contends this is evidence of the fact that he only realised after the event that the hearing was in private, taken in the foregoing context I am satisfied that this is further evidence that he was aware that the proceedings were private and that his course of conduct was not permitted.  In any event, on Mr Dowie&#8217;s<span style="font-style:italic"> own</span> evidence in this regard, he was therefore <span style="font-style:italic">definitely</span> aware that the proceedings were held in private at the time he published the covert recordings he made of the proceedings.</p>

The Attorney General submits that such intention on the part of Mr Dowie can readily be inferred as the publication was inherently, obviously and foreseeably prejudicial to the administration of justice given the private nature of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> proceedings. As I have noted, Mr Dowie argues that his mental state at the time meant that he lacked the requisite intention to act illegally or be reckless in that regard and lacked the requisite intention to impede or prejudice the administration of justice. Again, no medical evidence has been produced to substantiate this contention and no application to adduce such evidence was made by Mr Dowie.  Again, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Dowie intended by his actions to interfere with the administration of justice.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have noted, it is plain from watching each of the videos containing the relevant recordings in their entirety, that Mr Dowie used those recordings to present the judge and the expert as &#8220;criminals&#8221;, the judge as a fabricator of evidence, mother&#8217;s counsel as committing a fraud on the Legal Aid Agency and to assert that Cafcass has an agenda to allow &#8220;paedophilic individuals&#8221; access to children.  Within this context, Mr Dowie used the recordings of proceedings held in private to level unfounded allegations and to paint a highly partial and partisan account of proceedings.  I am satisfied that the obvious inference to be drawn from this conduct, which conduct was in breach of provisions designed to prevent interference in the administration of justice, is that Mr Dowie intended at the time he made the recordings, and at the time he published those recordings, to interfere in the administration of justice.   In my judgment, that intention is clear from the manner in which Mr Dowie proceeded to make partial recordings of the hearings in order to publicly subvert the account of what had <span style="font-style:italic">in fact</span> taken place as set out in the judgment of District Judge Turner.  In seeking to depict the conduct of the judge, the witnesses and counsel as criminal, fraudulent and facilitative of paedophilia can only have been intended by Mr Dowie to have one aim, namely, to undermine with spurious and entirely unevidenced allegations, the credibility of the court process to the public at large.  Further, this approach undermines Mr Dowie&#8217;s competing contention that he intended by his actions simply to bring to the attention of the public what he considered to be injustices committed against him by reason of him being a Black man.  In any event, as I have noted, it is not a defence to a charge of contempt that the relevant actions were carried out in order to expose alleged wrongdoing.</p>
