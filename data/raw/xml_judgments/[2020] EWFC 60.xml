It is submitted she did not lose her English domicile during her residence thereafter in Spain, as her family continued many English traditions, ensured her continuing education in and fluency in English and maintained close family links with their relatives who remained here. In January 2020 the Applicants relocated permanently to live in this jurisdiction. It was a carefully planned move, involving moving jobs, the transfer of their savings here and locating a permanent home here.  They are now very well settled and supported and their lives enmeshed with close relatives here.  </p>

W has an older daughter Y (now approximately 5 years old), cared for by her parents. W has consistently stated that she was unable to care for Z. She began looking for adoptive parents during her pregnancy as she did not wish to leave her child in an orphanage. The Applicants, through G&#8217;s cousin, V came to hear of her situation, and they communicated with W in the later stages of her pregnancy and the Applicants were present at Z&#8217;s birth and assumed her care.  At the Applicant&#8217;s instigation W was included in the choice of Z&#8217;s name.  </p>

He and the birth mother had a brief relationship, they were not married, separated during her pregnancy and he has taken no further part in Z&#8217;s life. The Applicants only became aware of his identity when G opened a sealed letter written soon after Z&#8217;s birth which W had provided for Z when she is older. The letter gives the father&#8217;s name but no contact details. The information from the Mauritian lawyer is the Applicants cannot initiate a search for the birth father&#8217;s whereabouts or proceedings to prove his paternity, as such enquiries can only be made within 2 years of the child&#8217;s birth by W, which did not take place. </p>

These steps have included repeat telephone calls to W and the maternal grandmother from V between May 2019 &#8211; March 2020. V met with the W in May 2019, unfortunately she failed to attend two subsequent appointments in September 2019 and January 2020.  W was visited by a Court appointed Usher to serve her with hearing papers and the adoption consent form. She signed to show she received these papers but did not sign the consent form. The recent statements by Ms Dally and V confirm the Applicants instructed Mauritian barrister, Ms Luchman to meet with W and seek to arrange to obtain her consent. She sought to arrange to meet W in prison, her home, at her office and by telephone. W was absent or failed to attend these meetings. Ms Luchman also tried to arrange for the Court Usher to effect personal service of the letter and Court order on W but these efforts were also unsuccessful, although the Usher left the papers at the home of the maternal grandmother as W was residing there. W subsequently confirmed to V she had received them.    </p>

As described in her recent statement V was able to read and explain the agreed consent questions, the terms of the consent form and assured W about the agreed contact arrangements proposed by the Applicants. She was able to do this in a way that assisted W as she speaks the Creole language and was sensitive to the views expressed by the family. I agree with Ms Cronin when she describes her explanations were painstaking, sensitive and effective. W signed the consent form in V&#8217;s presence. As reported by V, W made clear she had no regrets about the adoption. V was able to play a voice message </p>

I accept this signed consent form stands as evidence of a fair, transparent process that was respectful to W and her family. The short video clip sent with the papers shows W&#8217;s relief and happiness that the process was satisfactorily concluded and will form a valuable part of Z&#8217;s life story book, together with W&#8217;s letter and the other information the Applicants have. </p>

The Applicants permanently relocated here in January 2020. The planning for it, X&#8217;s resignation from his employment, and the transport of their household furniture and their possessions all support this. </p>

Ms Cronin and Ms Stanley have drawn the courts attention to the requirement in rule 14.10 (6) that any form of consent executed outside this jurisdiction must be witnessed by one of the persons listed, such a notary public. That has not taken place here, as the consent has been witnessed by V. Ms Cronin, supported by Ms Stanley, submits that under Rule 14.10 (2) the court has a </p>

The phrase <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;as the court directs&#8217;</span> could include, for example, consent given in other ways than in the prescribed form. They submit when the court looks at all the evidence in this particular case it can be satisfied this consent was given by W and was given in a way that was entirely informed and voluntary. This is supported by the video clip of W&#8217;s message and the wider information given in V&#8217;s statement. I agree with that analysis. It is clear from the information the court has every effort has been made to engage W in the adoption process and to make sure she is kept informed. The evidence given in V&#8217;s statement demonstrates that W&#8217;s consent is given freely and with full understanding, which is supported by the appropriate questions W asked V and the content of her video message. </p>

The Applicants have sensitively begun life story work understanding how important it is for Z&#8217;s continued stability and security for her to have a full and transparent understanding of her own background.   This open adoption will ensure that Z will know and be encouraged to spend time with her birth family, as described in the Annex to the order made on 9 June 2020. She has a loving explanation of her relinquishment by W and an adoptive family with positive views on and a commitment to post adoption contact, with a real appreciation of how it will benefit Z. Z has been placed with the Applicants since birth, she has established and valued relationships with all the extended family and G&#8216;s own origins, will enable Z to know and value her own Mauritian background. </p>
