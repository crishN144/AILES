	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"The wife is proceeding on advice that this is a sensible way of advancing her claim and it is not for me to question that. It has been asserted that this being a sentence of nine months it would be open for this court to request that a European arrest warrant be issued. That would have the effect of detaining the respondent anywhere within the European Union and having him brought to this court if the European arrest warrant procedure is available. I confess that when I first read this I was surprised that it was being asserted that the arrest warrant procedure was available as it was my belief (it is fair to say not based on much education) that the European arrest warrant was confined only to what can strictly be described as criminal offences and a civil contempt was not in that category. However, Mr. Calhaem has placed before me the Council Framework Decision of 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and Surrender Procedures between Member States of which Article 2.1 states:</span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">'A European arrest warrant may be issued for acts punishable by the law of the issuing Member State by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least 12 months or, where a sentence has been passed or a detention order has been made, for sentences of at least four months.'</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The use of language for "acts punishable by law" would certainly embrace a custodial penalty imposed for contempt of court and, recognising I have only heard only one side, I am satisfied in these circumstances that the sentence I have awarded is properly to be backed by a request for a European arrest warrant and I will complete the necessary annex form when the order is made."</span></p>

This has resulted in me giving a judgment which is legally incorrect and which, for all I know, may have led other people in other cases to have applied for a European arrest warrant following a finding of contempt.  So I take the opportunity today to correct my previous judgment so as to delete para.10 and to confirm that the European arrest warrant procedure is not available in contempt proceedings.</span></p>

The statement itself was not sworn.  To make a false statement, as opposed to a false affidavit, is not perjury.  This was by design of those who framed the Civil Procedure Rules which have been mirrored by the Family Procedure Rules.  To file a false statement is a contempt of court but it is not perjury.  To file a false statement can lead to an order for civil committal for up to two years, but it cannot lead to criminal proceedings for perjury.  Arguably it could lead to criminal proceedings under the Fraud Act but it cannot lead to criminal proceedings for perjury.  </span></p>

This is, to my belief, wholly unprecedented.  Mr. Todd is constrained to agree that he cannot identify any case in the ancillary relief field where there has been a reference to the police of perjury or fraud during the pendency of proceedings.  Moreover, under the comparable jurisdiction which is incorporated in CPR 31.22(1), which requires the court's permission to reveal disclosed documents to any third party, Mr. Todd has been unable to identify one case where there has been a reference to the police of fraud or perjury during the pendency of the proceedings, where the very allegation that is sought to be referred to the police is in issue in those proceedings.</span></p>

It seems to me that the motive is to replace the pressure of the European arrest warrant with a different kind of pressure to try and bring the husband, who is steadfastly not engaging in the proceedings (he is not negotiating, to my knowledge, or making proper disclosure), to heel in order that the case can be adjudicated fairly.  But that is not a proper motive for seeking what, in my mind, is a premature reference to the police.  In my judgment, it would be wholly wrong for this court to refer these matters to the police in advance of its judgment on those very matters and for these reasons the application is dismissed.</span></p>

Under FPR 30.3(7) permission to appeal may only be given where (a) a court considers the appeal would have a real prospect of success or (b) there was some other compelling reason why the appeal should be allowed.  In my judgment, an appeal would not have a real prospect of success.  It would have no prospect of success at all.  Furthermore, I cannot identify any other compelling reason why the appeal should be heard.  The fact that there has never before been a case in the annals where a reference has been made during the pendency of proceedings to my mind hardly supplies a compelling reason why an appeal should be heard.  To my mind, the empirical evidence suggests quite the opposite, that this is an appeal which should not be heard.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Although para 1 of this judgment makes it perfectly &#160;clear on a natural reading that counsel who &#8220;then&#8221; appeared on 27 October 2015 was not the same as counsel who appeared on this occasion, and although a reading of the first judgment referred to there &#160;would have confirmed this to be the case, Mr Todd QC is highly insistent that this is spelt out in this judgment. I am doubtful that the clarification procedure extends to requests for editorialisation for counsel&#8217;s personal reasons, but this additional paragraph has that effect.</span></p>
