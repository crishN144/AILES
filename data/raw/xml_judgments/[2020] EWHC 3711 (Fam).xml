	      <p style="margin-left:0.6in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">This is perhaps unfair to the Chancery Division given that these proceedings are in the Family Division. However, as we are now approaching the fourth anniversary of the inception of these proceedings and like Groundhog Day we may (depending on my decision) be about to start the whole process all over again, it seems apt. I get the impression that none of the parties really want to litigate this but the personal feelings of many of those involved, in particular the fifth defendant who openly expresses them, create a poisonous atmosphere around the case which seems to cloud judgements. What the deceased would make of his widow and three groups of children fighting tooth and claw over his estate I have no idea. I assume that the family parties must have some idea and are either content that this is what he would want or one or more of them have sufficiently little regard for his memory that they are content to continue the fight. Who may be responsible for this situation may eventually come to light, but not in this judgment which deals only with procedural issues.  </p>

Together with his twin sister Isabelle Wickham (both born on 5 December 2000) they issued a claim on 16 January 2017 by their litigation friend, Ruth Dore, under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependents) Act 1975</ref> against William Riley and Robert Sibley (&#8216;the first and second defendants&#8216;) the personal representatives of the estate of Anthony John Wickham on the basis that reasonable financial provision had not been made for them by Anthony Wickham&#8217;s will dated 1 April 2010. Matthew John Wickham, Penny-Ann Wickham and Lisa Joanne Wickham were also named as defendants. Matthew and Penny-Ann (&#8216;the third and fourth defendants&#8216;) were sued as beneficiaries of the estate. Lisa, the mother of Alexander and Isabelle, (the fifth defendant) was sued as a trustee of the estate and as a beneficiary of the estate. Subsequently notice was given to Karl Catchpole under CPR 19.8A as a member of a class of beneficiaries under the will. He has subsequently made common cause with the third and fourth defendants and has appeared in these proceedings. </p>

The fifth defendant indicated that day that she wished to consider her tax position under the agreed terms before consenting to the agreed settlement. Mr Justice Cohen recorded that he was satisfied that the disposition of the estate under the will of 1 April 2010 was not such as to make reasonable financial provision for the claimants and that the agreed terms were for the benefit of the claimants and that the court approved of the agreed terms.  The fifth defendant wished to seek tax advice on the consequences of the settlement and was not prepared to sign the terms at that point. Cohen J stayed the proceedings until 27 November 2018 for the purposes of obtaining the fifth defendant&#8217;s signed consent to the terms and provided that if a further copy of the Agreed Terms bearing the signed consent of all parties, Karl Catchpole and Norwich Developments Ltd that the terms of the settlement would come into effect. </p>

The claimant acted in person and participated in the hearing from what appeared to be a room in his home. His mother, the fifth defendant and Isabelle Wickham the former joint claimant were present with him throughout. The first and second defendants were represented by Mr Redmayne counsel. The third and fourth defendants together with Mr Catchpole were represented by Miss Plant, counsel acting on a direct access basis. The fifth defendant represented herself.

Although when he appeared before me on 4 March, he indicated a clear intention to seek legal advice he remains unrepresented and as far as I am able to tell has not instructed solicitors or Counsel. He told me that he is on Universal Credit and that he had not been able to find a solicitor to help him as the case was too complicated. Whilst I can accept that securing a solicitor might pose some challenges in terms of funding (whether legal aid or a CFA would still be available I do not know) I find it hard to believe that this case would be regarded as too complicated by a firm practising in this field.   He has not filed any documents for this hearing. At E67 in the bundle is a letter, authored I think by Isabelle, but also signed by the claimant. That sets out a proposal to settle the claim but also indicates that Isabelle wishes to advance a fresh claim against the estate. In his brief submissions to me during the hearing he made no reference to the issues of capacity. He focused on his current position and his need for provision from the estate, emphasising that he has not gained maths or English GCSEs, has not managed to secure a college place and is currently living on Universal Credit and struggling to find work. He said he had no savings or other financial resources with which to pay any costs orders. The 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendant added some further information about the Claimant&#8217;s health problems and how that impacted on his ability to work and study.  </p>

In her submissions to me she struggled to focus on the issues which I was to determine but was preoccupied with allegations of misconduct against the solicitors for the first and second defendant, the third defendant, Mr Catchpole and the solicitor for the litigation friend. She accepted that Alexander had capacity but confirmed some of the educational struggles he had to confront as a result of his condition. She said that &#8216;they&#8217; were willing to drop hands on the basis that ownership of Hungate (currently owned 50% by her and 50% by the Estate) was transferred entirely to her with no liabilities attaching. She made clear that she was speaking for her children as well as herself. She did not appear to see that there might be a conflict of interest between herself and the children. She also said that if the proceedings did not end now (on the basis of her proposal) she thought that the costs of pursuing the proceedings further made it &#8216;lunacy&#8217; to carry on.

His failure to instruct solicitors means the estate bears more of the costs, for instance in the preparation of the bundle.

Dr Chisholm took some care in making the arrangements for the assessment both in terms of its location and the presence of one third party. His EHCP identifies that he can struggle to hold verbal information in his working memory and requires time to process information. Although anxious at the beginning of the assessment it became visibly calmer and explained in his own words what he understood the assessment to be about.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">Firstly, I should make clear that I do not consider it appropriate to adjudicate upon the additional issues identified in the statement of issues. No application has been issued by Isabelle Wickham for permission to make another claim against these defendants pursuant to CPR 38.7. There is no evidence before the court which explains her reasons for discontinuing the claim in March 2019 nor her reasons for now seeking to reinstate it. I&#8217;m prepared to infer that her reasons are likely to be connected with those advanced by the claimant but that does not mean that they will necessarily be identical or indeed that the court will approach them in the same way. It is clear that the claimant, whilst he has capacity has a degree of vulnerability in respect of his decision making and the court would not necessarily extend the identical approach to the claim by Isabelle Wickham. She has had eight months in which to either seek and obtain legal advice or to undertake some research yourself to advance a claim. The complexity of making such a claim was clearly pointed out to her by the first and second defendant solicitors. Her mother, the fifth defendant is well versed in litigation of this sort. I note that the fifth defendant makes various references to who is apparently also familiar with these sorts of complex disputes. In the absence of an application and in the absence of any evidence I am therefore not prepared to determine that unmade application. If an application is subsequently made it will of </p>

She of course played no part in the proceedings from 2019 through to November 2020. </p>

The order itself identified that the court&#8217;s approval of the settlement was subject to the fifth defendant agreeing to them by signing them along with each of the other parties. I do not therefore need to consider this any further. I do however observe that the terms agreed provided for a substantial property to be transferred, to the claimant and Isabelle Wickham and for the payment of their costs. Albeit the factual landscape has changed in the two years which have passed since then, in particular the claimant and Isabelle Wickham attaining their majority, the value of the settlement supports the contention that the claimant would still have an arguable case under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/29" uk:canonical="2007 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">The net effect of Dr Chisholm&#8217;s evidence is therefore that Alexander had capacity in March 2019 to serve his notice of discontinuance. This followed on from his email in January 2019 which indicated the withdrawal of the claim. A consistent position over the two-month period accompanied by the completion and signing of the notice of discontinuance by both Alex and Isabelle would be consistent with his having capacity along with his sister. Inevitably their decision is likely to have been affected by the position their mother was taking but this is part and parcel of family life. Young adults might reasonably expect to receive advice from their parents. Advice that may be unwise or ill-considered does not mean that they have been subject to undue influence or duress. It seems highly unlikely that the fifth defendant was in any way seeking to prejudice the claimant or Isabelle albeit she was certainly on her submissions seeking to protect her interests, but she sees her interests and those of the Claimant and Isabelle as essentially indivisible. It may be that her advice was misguided although making that evaluation is not easy given the passage of time and may have been motivated by seeking to avoid the estate paying the costs of the solicitor for the litigation friend. Given that the settlement provided for the payment of those costs and the fifth defendant has a very strong standpoint on the unreasonableness of those costs it may be that played a role in her advice. It seems that the solicitor for the litigation friend was acting under a conditional fee agreement and non-recovery by the children would very likely have led to no liability for the costs of the solicitor. That would have saved the estate a significant sum but absent some side agreement with the other defendants, of which there is no suggestion, it is not clear to me how the fifth defendant or more particularly the claimant or Isabelle Wickham benefited from the discontinuance. The fact that the advice was taken by Isabelle for whom no issue of capacity arises in respect of  any suggestion of undue influence or duress arises would be consistent with the claimant not being subject to duress or undue influence either. Neither the claimant or Isabelle take any issue with their mother&#8217;s advice in any event. Thus, I am satisfied that the claimant had capacity at the time he served the notice of discontinuance of his claim and indeed in the period since he attained his majority and that he was not subject to duress or undue influence. With the benefit of hindsight, the decision was almost certainly unwise; indeed, it was probably unwise at the time it was taken but that does not affect the decision on capacity. The presumption of capacity together with the evidence of Dr Chisholm and the evidence of the claimant and the fifth defendant all support the conclusion that the claimant had capacity to conduct the proceedings at the time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">The decision to withdraw the claim was first communicated by emails sent on 21 January 2019 by the claimant. This was followed by an email from Isabelle on 23 January 2019 confirming that both she and the claimant were withdrawing their claims. On 11 March the claimant sent a form N279 to the defendants and to the court. Isabelle Wickham also sent a form N279. The forms are signed by the claimant and Isabelle Wickham respectively. Although there may be a minor procedural error in that the notice of discontinuance did not have the consent of the other claimant attached the forms were sent within six minutes of each other. CPR 3.10 would have the effect of rendering the notices of discontinuance as effective unless I hold otherwise. No reason has been advanced by the claimant or indeed anybody else as to why they should be held to be ineffective due to that technical defect. The notices of discontinuance are therefore effective and the consequence of CPR38.5 is that the proceedings ended as against each of the defendants as of March 2019. A consequence of that is that pursuant to CPR 38.6 the claimants are responsible for the defendant&#8217;s costs up to the date of discontinuance. No suggestion (save by the first and second defendants as set out above) has been made that they should not be. </p>

There is therefore relating to the distribution of an estate which impacts upon the claimant&#8217;s claim or the other beneficiaries. However, the administration of the estate has been very significantly delayed as a result of the difficulties which arose following the failure of the settlement which was proposed in November 2018. The management of the estate has been complicated as a result of its illiquidity. However, I note that the management of the limited company has been simplified to some extent as a result of the exclusion of the fifth defendant as a director. Although there are manifestly some ongoing issues with the administration of the assets of the estate in practice the Hungate properties are being managed by the fifth defendant who is receiving the entirety of the rental income. I&#8217;m not entirely clear how Norwich Developments Ltd is being operated but the third and fourth defendants own 20% each of the shares and Mr Catchpole 1% of the shares and I believe that the third defendant and Mr Catchpole are directors and it seems that the company is managing. I was told in March 2020 that consideration was being given by the first and second defendants to the need to make an application to the Chancery Division for the sale of state assets in order to generate funds to enable the executors to manage the state assets but that this has not proved necessary. That suggests that a way has been found to deal with Norwich Developments Ltd and the properties it holds. It therefore appears that any prejudice caused by delay in terms of the assets themselves is being managed. The ongoing delay and the generation of expenses in the administration of the estate of course is an additional form of prejudice to the other beneficiaries. The expenses of the administrators will fall roughly 2/3 on those who stand to benefit from Norwich Developments Ltd and roughly 1/3 on the fifth defendant who would stand to benefit from Hungate Street </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:-0in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">The reason why the limitation period becomes relevant is the need for fresh proceedings to be issued consequent upon the claimant having discontinued his first claim. The fact of a claim against the estate has been part of the landscape for a very long time and of course has been the subject of these proceedings since they were commenced in January 2017. I am satisfied that the claimant issued his notice of discontinuance following advice from his mother that to do so was more beneficial for her and ultimately for him. However, this seems to have been on the basis that the fifth defendant believed that the settlement and the continuation of the proceedings would have an adverse impact upon her and would thus eat into her  estate that she would in due course leave to the claimant. As the fifth defendant observed in submissions, she is in her 50s and could be expected to live for 30 to 40 more years and so any benefit to the claimant is very far down the road and unpredictable. In contrast the benefit to him of the settlement and the benefit to him of any order would be immediate. There is clearly a conflict of interest between the claimant and the fifth defendant in this sense although I appreciate that in reality given that the claimant lives with the fifth defendant and relies upon her the conflict is probably submerged by the reality of their relationship. For reasons which the claimant has not been able to fully articulate he has now come to the realisation that his decision to discontinue was unsound and that there is benefit to him in pursuing the proceedings. That seems to me to be a sufficient ground. I take account of the fact that whilst he has capacity, he has some degree of vulnerability and is to some extent reliant upon the fifth defendant in respect of whom there does exist some conflict of interest. </span></p>

The terms of the previously agreed settlement would support that evaluation, although I acknowledge that the defendants may have had personal reasons for agreeing to that settlement rather than representing purely a commercial appraisal of the likelihood of the claimant&#8217;s succeeding. I am also alive to the fact that ultimately the success of the claimant&#8217;s claim might have a disadvantageous impact on his mother, the fifth defendant.

I note also that the third and fourth defendants and Mr Catchpole may issue an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/29/section/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/29" uk:canonical="2007 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> so that the assets that the fifth defendant received by reason of being a joint tenant of properties with the deceased and this may also have an impact on the fifth defendant and thus an indirect impact on the claimant. However ultimately if the claimant succeeded the award would be to him for his maintenance not to the fifth defendant. </span></p>

I have not been able to fully grasp her logic although it seems to have emerged from her anxiety as to the costs of the and her belief that these were manifestly unreasonable. From what was said to Dr Chisholm and from what has been said to me during this hearing it is clear that the claimant relied entirely upon his mother&#8217;s advice as to what was financially best for the family. As the litigation friend noted at the time it was hard to understand from the claimant&#8217;s point of view why he took that decision, but it plainly was in reliance upon his mother&#8217;s advice. That her advice turned out to be inaccurate, ill informed or simply unwise I cannot currently determine but that it has dawned on the claimant that discontinuing was not to his financial advantage is perhaps not a surprise to anybody. I therefore am satisfied that his explanation for having withdrawn and now seeking to reissue is a satisfactory explanation. </span></p>

The total costs of a further tranche of these proceedings if all parties are represented may get close to or exceed the value of any award that the claimant might achieve.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In respect of allowing the issuing of a second set of proceedings the balance seems to me to be much finer. The vulnerability of the claimant and the reasons for serving the discontinuance against the backdrop of a substantial settlement or potential claim and the extent to which he was influenced by one of the defendants, the fifth defendant in doing so are significant factors in favour of granting permission. Weighing against the grant of permission to bring a second set of proceedings are all the arguments deployed by the defendants and in particular the concerns about how the proceedings </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.6in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">may be pursued by the claimant given the likely ongoing influence of the fifth defendant and how that may impact upon the costs incurred and the manner in which the proceedings are pursued. Ultimately though the underlying merits of the claimant&#8217;s case and the possibility of him achieving an award in his name seem to me to outweigh the arguments in support of finality of litigation and prejudice to the defendants. His decision to withdraw was not a decision taken by a commercial entity after careful consideration but was the decision of a vulnerable just 18 year old under the influence of and on the advice of his mother who is his primary carer. I will therefore grant permission to issue a further set of proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have considered whether any conditions ought to be applied to the grant of permission to bring a further set of proceedings. Mr Redmayne and Miss Plant both acknowledged that conditions could be applied. One of the most obvious conditions would be that the claimant pay the costs of the estate and of the third and fourth defendants and Mr Catchpole arising out of the discontinuance. However, as they both acknowledged the reality is that the imposition of such a condition would in effect create an absolute bar to the claimant pursuing the claim as he is impecunious. In addition, the costs will need to be subject to detailed assessment and so no time limit for their payment could be imposed at this stage. </p>
