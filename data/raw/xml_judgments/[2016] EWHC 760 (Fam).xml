Ms Fottrell and Ms Dally are specialists, amongst other things, in the law relating to surrogacy and applications under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (HFEA) 2008. Ms Cronin&#8217;s expertise lies in immigration law. It is a measure of their personal generosity as well as their dedication to serving the public in the finest traditions of their respective professions that they have been prepared to act without recompense in these proceedings. </p>

I should also record my own and the Applicant&#8217;s gratitude to the Treasury Solicitor. His 21 March 2016 Position Statement on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Home Department makes clear there will be reconsideration of an earlier immigration decision refusing entry clearance to the child, J. An explicit assurance is given that the findings made at the conclusion of this hearing will be taken into account by the Secretary of State when she reconsiders the decision of the Entry Clearance officer of December 2015. </p>

I cannot ignore Ms Dutta&#8217;s assessment which is that the applicants made a &#8216;heart-wrenching decision&#8217; to leave J in India whilst they returned to their employment in this country so as to satisfy immigration criteria.</span></p>

Whilst all are important, it seems to me that the concluding fifth paragraph encapsulates the overarching doctrine. &#8220;Where the applicants for a parental order are acting in good faith and without &#8216;moral taint&#8217; in their dealings with the surrogate mother, with no attempt to defraud the authorities, and the payments are not so disproportionate that the granting of parental orders would be an affront to public policy, it will ordinarily be appropriate for the court to exercise its discretion to give retrospective authorization, having regard to the paramountcy of the child&#8217;s lifelong welfare.&#8221;</span></p>
