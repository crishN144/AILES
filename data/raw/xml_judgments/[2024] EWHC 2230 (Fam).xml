	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Considerable emotional damage has been, and is being, done to the children who are the subject of these wardship proceedings. They are now believed to be staying in war-torn Sudan, where there is widespread violence, mass population displacement and acute food insecurity.  The children are to all intents and purposes missing there.  Quite apart from the trauma of their current situation, these same children are doubtless all suffering unimaginable grief at their mother&#8217;s sudden and premature death from heart failure, at the end of last year, just as they were all preparing to return to England.  These children have suffered further loss &#8211; the familiarity of their home in England, where they had lived prior to 2022. In recent months, they appear to have been moved from one country to another (from Sudan, to Kenya, to Eritrea, to Uganda and then returning to the eastern region of Sudan near the border with Ethiopia), without apparent warning or preparation; their lives have become unpredictable and unstable.  Their family relationships, social relationships, and their schooling have all been irredeemably disrupted.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have found that the Defendant has caused or materially contributed to the children&#8217;s current appalling situation.  It is notable that on 15 February 2024 (his last engagement with the Court) before Henke J he told her that he would do his &#8220;utmost best&#8221; to recover the children and bring them back to England.   In this regard, he has, I find, cynically misled the Court; he has deliberately flouted the Court&#8217;s direction to achieve the repatriation of the children.  In failing to attend Court hearings on three occasions subsequently, contrary to the specific direction of Henke J, he has contemptuously turned his face against the authority of this Court.</p>

This Defendant has committed repeated breaches of the Court&#8217;s orders over an extended period of time; he has deliberately, in my judgment, failed to comply with orders despite repeated opportunities being given to him to achieve compliance.  That he misled Henke J so egregiously is a significant aggravating factor.</p>
