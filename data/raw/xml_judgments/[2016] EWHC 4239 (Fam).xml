A child&#8217;s circumstances may &#8220;require&#8221; statutory intervention, perhaps may even &#8220;require&#8221; the indefinite or long-term removal of the child from  the family and his or her placement with strangers but that is not to say that the same circumstances will necessarily &#8220;require&#8221; that the child be adopted.  They may or they may not. The question, at the end of the day, is whether what is &#8220;required&#8221; is adoption.&#8221;</span></p>

It is what is demanded rather than what is merely optional or reasonable or desirable.  It is a stringent and demanding test.  The court should begin with a preference for the less interventionist rather than the more interventionist approach.  This should be considered to be in the better interests of children unless there are cogent reasons to the contrary (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re O (Care or Supervision Order)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 2 FLR 755" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 2 FLR 755</ref> at 760.</p>

In short, nothing else will do (per Lady Hale at paragraph [198]).

Cutting off all contact and the relationship between the child and his or her family is only justified by the overriding necessity of the interests of the child (Lady Hale at Paragraph [198]).</p>

He said it was time to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">call a halt</span>&#8221;.  The evidence placed before the court must address all the options which are realistically possible and must contain an analysis of the arguments for and against each option and, in particular, the nature and extent of the risk of harm involved in each of the options (Paragraph [34]).  The need for analysis of the pros and cons and a full reasoned recommendation was essential if the exacting test set out in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> and the requirements of Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention are to be met (Paragraph [36]).  There must be adequately reasoned judgments (Paragraph [43]).  The court rejected a linear approach whereby each option other than the most draconian is considered and rejected in isolation.  Instead, a balancing exercise is required in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives.  Each option should then be compared, side by side, against the competing option or options (Paragraphs [49] &#8211; [50]).  </p>

Ms Z was unable to rely on the Mother&#8217;s assertion that her relationship with Father B has ended given her lies.  Ms Z felt it was significant that the Mother still talks positively about him.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr W was cross-examined by Mr Allen for the Mother primarily on the basis that he had not given the Mother a fair chance.   It was put to him that he had ruled her out at an early stage and certainly before the parenting assessment of her and Child D.  Whilst Mr W was not prepared to accept that contention, he was constrained to admit that he had taken into account matters that I had not found proved against the Mother at the fact finding hearing, such as the neglect allegations, although he was clear he would have come to the same conclusion anyway.  I remind myself that the only reason I found the neglect allegations not proved was because the children had been removed from the Child Protection Register in October 2014 due to an improvement in their care and there was no evidence of a subsequent deterioration between then and the care proceedings being instituted.</p>

I am satisfied that I am entitled to take these matters into account given the terms of the welfare checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the Children Act.  Mr W stated that Child C did not have good teeth when he was taken into care.  They were hugely decayed and had crumbled away. He did not believe Child C had been to a dentist prior to going into care. At the time the children went into care, Child A had been soiling himself.  He would dress himself whilst still wet following a bath.  Even though he was seven years old, he would eat with his hands and fingers. He did not know how to use a knife and fork.  The same was true of Child B.  Child C did not use toilet paper or wash his hands after going to the toilet.  He had to be shown how to clean his teeth.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr W added that Child B has made good progress in foster care.  She was quite angry at first.  There would be tantrums in which she would kick and scream as well as bite her siblings and she would misbehave on school runs but, as the foster placement has progressed, he had seen a change.  She is a lot happier and more caring.  She has an extremely positive relationship with the foster carers and the number of incidents has reduced.  She can reflect and say sorry now, whilst the incidents have become a rarity.</p>

They have still not been able to find housing in the Barry area, in part due to their current status as benefit claimants.  Mr Hartley-Davies asked him about his previous drug use.  He said he did use MDMA in 2009, although he thought it was ecstasy.  He said he stopped the day he got arrested as he discovered that day that he was to be a father, namely of P.  On balance, I accept this evidence although he has continued to take cannabis occasionally.  He told me he last did so in September 2015 and would not do so in the future.  He offered to undertake drug testing on a monthly basis.  He said there had been a few &#8220;hiccoughs&#8221; since.  He referred to a fight at a family wedding although, somewhat confusingly, seemed to suggest he was not in fact involved.  He has occasionally &#8220;had a few drinks&#8221; which I took to mean drinking alcohol to excess.  He told me that his partner, Ms MC, would not put up with such behaviour.  She is keeping him on the &#8220;straight and narrow&#8221; and would &#8220;kick him out&#8221; if he misbehaved. He added that she is a lot better organised than he is.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">He had met Ms MC in August 2015 and accepted it was not the longest relationship but, apart from a few small arguments, about things such as him not being tidy, he told me it was a good relationship.  Realistically, he accepted that it is impossible to know what the future holds.  He told me he &#8220;would not put any money against us breaking up&#8221; but clearly meant the opposite, namely that he did not think they would break up.  He did tell me that he remains good friends with Father A and the boys would go to the same school if he is successful in caring for Child C.  I have to say that I consider Father A is a good influence on Father C.  Whilst I would like to put some of the matters raised down to Father C being young, he is in fact the oldest parent in the case at 29.  He has needed to mature.  I will return to this when I consider the evidence of Ms MC.  In fairness, he did present as having adopted a responsible approach in relation to his ex-partner and Ms MC&#8217; ex-partner.    </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"> Father B remains in HM Prison Cardiff.  He told me he has been approved for tagging by the Probation Service and is just waiting for the Governor to sign his release papers.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that he is likely to be released on tag within the next few weeks.  He told me that the terms of his indefinite restraining order are that he is to have no direct or indirect contact with the Mother, including by social media and he is not to enter the area of Mother&#8217;s hometown.  On release from prison, he will live with his maternal grandparents at their home in Canton.  He has done courses in prison, which seemed to be aimed particularly at anger management and coping with stress.  Perhaps somewhat worryingly, he told me that his tutor said he was the angriest person the tutor had seen for a quite a while when he started the course but he does seem to have made significant progress as he has been asked to be a peer mentor for others doing the course.  He said he held his hands up in relation to his behaviour to the Mother and she was right when she said he needed prison to sort himself out.</p>

He was present in court but he said he had not read the written document since, saying he felt it might &#8220;fry his head&#8221;.  I do not criticise him for being unable to read it.  He said he was half-truthful in his evidence to me but then repeated the evidence he had previously given.  In particular, he was adamant that the video was the worst act of violence between him and the Mother and he was insistent that the Mother was equally to blame for the violence, saying she was violent to him as well.  He accepts he put himself at risk by breaching his bail conditions when he went to see her in 2009 and said that he had &#8220;found it difficult to resist her when she calls out for me&#8221;.  He was adamant however that there would be no relationship in the future due to the restraining  order but confirmed that he has always been in love with her and there will always &#8220;be a feeling there&#8221;.  He stressed that he did not want the children going through &#8220;all of this again&#8221;.  He repeated that he would not go over even if invited when drunk.  He told me he has been clean from drugs for six months and will not go back on to them now.  He ended by saying that he will have to let the one he loves go and he will be able to do so.  He referred to a potential five year sentence if he breached the restraining order.</p>

In answer to questions by Mr Thomas for the Local Authority, she told me that the fact that the Mother was found to be lying to me at the October hearing was highly significant.  She said that, sadly, it leaves professionals being unable to rely on what she says.  It would need time to prove she can be trusted not to re-enter a relationship with Father B or another inappropriate male and to show that she would cooperate with the Local Authority.

Ms Z said that the Mother had told her the relationship was finished and how abusive it was but, the following day, she said Father B was not all bad.  Whilst it was impressive that she had done so many courses herself, Ms Z still had concerns in relying on her.  She did confirm that the Mother had met Child D&#8217;s basic care needs for stimulation and emotional warmth but her deceit and lies were so pervasive for so many years that there was no alternative to monitoring her twenty four hours per day.  Her vulnerability and isolation was important.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In her evidence in chief, the Mother told me about the importance of the Church to her and the support it provided for her. She disputed the observations of the foster carers as to the behaviour of the children when they first went into foster care (such as bed-wetting, toileting difficulties and feeding problems) saying that the children did not display such deficiencies when with her.  She accepted that she had not taken Child C to the dentist, although she stressed that she had ensured he brushed his teeth twice per day, saying his top front teeth were discoloured rather than black.  I have to say that, with the exception of Child C&#8217;s teeth, she seemed to be describing an almost idyllic home life for the children.   By then, she had heard Father B give evidence.  She told me she did not think he had changed.  She said she could hear him &#8220;getting angry&#8221; whilst he was being cross-examined.  She said that she did not deserve what he had put her through and she had learned this from the courses she has recently undertaken.  She accepted she had undertaken a Pattern Changing course in 2013.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">She was cross-examined yesterday morning.  I make allowance for the fact that she was not feeling well and I could see that this was the case.   She was first asked about the findings I made as to the lies she told in court.  She was unable to accept that she had lied concerning her pregnancy with Child D, saying the first person she told was MI.  Given what was being said by the mothers at the school and Child A, this is demonstrably incorrect.  At first, she said she could not remember that Child A had stayed overnight with Mr Aaron Hughes until she spoke to him on the telephone in prison but she later was prepared to admit that she had lied to me in this regard.  I have to say that I did not find this in the least bit reassuring.  I consider she realised that it was just impossible for her to sustain the lie so she changed tack but that did not stop her initially trying to mislead me again.  </p>

She said she got really ill and began to hallucinate.  She had a moment of clarification and she saw her whole life without her children, which would not be a life.  She added that she had not been dealing with the issues since February because she couldn&#8217;t bear to be without her children and therefore suppressed it all.  I have to say that I found this all very difficult to accept.  I consider it should have been the taking of her children into care or my fact finding judgment which caused her to realise the seriousness of her predicament.  I do accept that her peritonitis may have been very frightening for her although medical professionals would have reassured her that treating such problems is now fairly routine. </p>

She said that Child B did not listen to a lot of people but did listen to her mum but she then somewhat contradicted that by saying that Child B &#8220;turns quite violent towards me, screaming that she hates me and physically attacking me&#8221;.  She said this stopped after one to one contact.  She put Child B&#8217;s behaviour down to a fear that someone will take her away from her mum.  I cannot accept that.  She repeated this evidence when cross-examined by Mr Hartley-Davies for the Guardian.  She told him that, when they were living at home, Child B would scream and shout.  She would hit Child A and sometimes hit Child C but she had only been violent to the Mother whilst in foster care.   She said that the smallest of things would set Child B off in contact and she would end up telling the Mother that the Mother doesn&#8217;t love her and does not want her and that she hates her and doesn&#8217;t love her.  She said Child B thinks that the Mother is rejecting her because she is not letting her come home.  I found this evidence both troubling and very sad.  She did, however, say that, in one to one contact, Child B says she loves the Mother and gives her cuddles.  </p>

She has not been to a dentist since 2013, although she had an appointment recently that she missed due to her recent ill health.  Initially, she had led me to believe that she had been to this appointment, which was very misleading although I accept she corrected herself shortly thereafter.  She told Mr Allen that she uses her teeth to scare her children and ensure they brush their teeth religiously.  I am not sure this is an appropriate way to ensure they do so but it is by no means the most serious matter in the case.  Overall, however, I have to say that I did not find any real change in presentation or approach between the first time the Mother gave evidence to me and this occasion.  The same criticisms can be made of her evidence on both occasions.</p>

There had been the odd stress and strain, particularly as a result of the quest for a house.  I remind myself that the evidence is that Father C has been more laid back about this than Ms MC would wish.  She told me that she and Cassie are happy to move to Wales.

Provided a recommendation is clearly made and supported by evidence, no advocate will succeed before me in the old chestnut &#8220;that was not in your report&#8221;.  Having said that, I do consider that there is force in the complaint that Mr Y&#8217;s final document is virtually silent as to the effect on the children of the separation of each group from the other.  There is a reference to it on page 18 under &#8220;detriments&#8221; of adopting Child B and Child D alone but I accept that even there, the position of Child A and Child C is not specifically referred to.  This has given me pause for thought.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">However, I consider that Mr Y did put this right in his oral evidence.  He told me that he was unable to champion long term fostering as being in their interests.  He reminded me of the detriments to children in general of languishing in the care system as against the advantages of stability and permanence of adoption.  He said that, to give them that chance it was necessary for there to be the ending of the relationship with the other two children.  In essence, he was saying to me that the very significant disadvantage of separating Child A and Child C from Child B and Child D was justified by the huge advantages of adoption for Child B and Child D such that, for him, there was no alternative and nothing else would do.   </p>

The issue surrounds the care plan thereafter and the question of the placement applications.  Father A and Father C both accept that there should be care orders in relation to Child A and Child C respectively albeit on the basis of care plans that place their sons with them.  The Mother accepted the need for care orders even if the children were residing with her.  She told me she had no problem with ongoing involvement by the Local Authority.  She said a care order was fine and there was no difficulty with the Local Authority sharing parental responsibility with her.</p>

The findings were more than just findings as to the lies about her ongoing relationship with Father B.  There were a significant number of other matters.

I was frankly troubled by this.  I wanted to give the Mother every opportunity to satisfy the court that she could safely parent these children.  I had already decided to take the unusual step of permitting a second assessment by an Independent Social Worker instructed by her but, very fairly, all parties agreed to such an instruction without me having to rule on it.  The Mother instructed a very experienced ISW in TS who took exactly the same view as the Local Authority.  Even that was not the end of the matter.  Mindful of the particular importance of giving parents a chance to care for a baby, I indicated that the Mother should be given another opportunity in a mother and baby placement with Child D.  I accept that the Mother has done her very best there in what must have been difficult circumstances for her, but, again, the Local Authority assessment was negative.  I reject Mr B&#8217;s submission that Mr W had already closed his mind when he began the second assessment.  I accept that he could not ignore what had gone before but, as a conscientious and committed social worker, he assessed the Mother carefully and again concluded she could not care for Child D.</p>

On the balance of probabilities, I very much regret to say that I have been unable to find any change in her.  I do make full allowance for the very difficult circumstances of giving evidence about such personal matters in front of so many people with so much at stake.  I also recognise that she has not had good health and was not well during the hearing.  I further accept that it is difficult to admit you lied to a High Court Judge but the strength of that submission evaporates as she was able to admit to me that she had lied in part.  Whilst that is to her credit, she undoubtedly initially attempted to persuade me that she had not lied about not remembering that Child A had a sleepover with Mr Aaron Hughes.  I find that she then weighed up whether it was better to lie to me again or not and decided that it was better to tell the truth but only in the context of already having told a further lie.  Indeed, I consider she initially tried to mislead me about the dentist as well.  Her first reaction when I asked when she had last been to the dentist was to say that it was only a few weeks ago.  Again, it is to her credit that she later told me that she had not in fact gone but again any credit she gets for that is completely undermined by the initial attempt to mislead me.  </p>

I accept that this may have been frightening for her although I have already noted that experienced doctors would have reassured her that modern medicine can deal with such situations.  She may have hallucinated.  It may have involved the children but, if there was to be a light bulb moment, it should have been when the children were taken into care in February 2015 or, at the very latest, when I gave my earlier judgment.  In fact, she gave evidence that all was rosy when the children were with her and would be equally fine if they returned to her care.  I do not accept that evidence.  I find that she was finding it very difficult to cope with the children when they were all with her before.  The failure to see to Child C&#8217;s teeth is but one example. To add a baby to the mix would make life even more problematic for her.  I find that she has great difficulty in not having a man in her life. Very regrettably, she appears to attract abusive men.  I have not heard evidence but it may be that they recognise her vulnerability.  </p>

There was some debate as to how long the Mother would need to prove herself.  At one point, Ms Z mentioned six months but that was only in relation to whether or not her relationship with Father B was truly over.  I consider a six month period to be significantly over optimistic.  I find that the time needed is much greater and, again with great regret, outside the timescales for the children.   </p>

I have found that he has not and will not take drugs when caring for Child A.  He is now aged 28.  I find that he has matured and is now a proper and fit person to have care of his son.  I must take account of Child A&#8217;s preference to be with his Mother but it is only a preference and Child A has no difficulty with his father.

Even if she was in doubt, she should have ensured the doubt was swiftly resolved by DNA testing.  She clearly blew hot and cold, depending on her own emotional position.

I trust he has begun to realise that he needs to step up to the plate for both his children and, in this context, Child C in particular.  I have a suspicion that this process has been a considerable wake up call for him, particularly as he has learned the detail of the Mother&#8217;s relationship with Father B.

I have come to the clear conclusion that placement of Child C with his father is infinitely preferable to the alternatives.  I therefore approve that care plan as well. I also grant Father C parental responsibility for Child C.  There was some suggestion that Ms TE from the Church was going to put herself forward to care for Child C.  I know nothing of her circumstances, although I entirely recognise the good intentions behind this suggestion.  The application has not, in fact, been made although I would not have considered it in preference to a father who has passed a parenting assessment and is ready, willing and able to take up the challenge.

I do not consider the position is the same here.  Although there are care orders in place, both boys are going to reside with their fathers.

I do accept that this will involve a significant reduction in contact to Mother from the current three times per week plus contact on Sundays at the local Chapel but I must take into account the relationship the boys have with their mother.  In one respect, reducing the contact too much may also provide difficulties for the placements.  I remind myself that Child A has expressed a preference for living with his Mother.  I accept that the matter will have to be kept under constant review and I accept the Local Authority will behave properly in this regard.  Nevertheless, I consider that supervised contact of once per fortnight is the most appropriate figure on what I have heard to date.  As I am making care orders, however, the matter is one for the Local Authority, in conjunction with the parents and there will have to be flexibility.  If the Mother was to undermine the placements, I have no doubt the level would reduce dramatically.  Equally, there may come a time when it can increase to weekly.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have already noted that this is materially different to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  The reason is obvious.  Adoption is very different to making a care order.  It is permanent.  It changes the status of a child for ever.  It cuts all ties with the birth family.  It is rightly a draconian order only to be made when nothing else will do.  In particular, I must pay regard to the fact that it will sever the relationship between Child A and Child C on the one hand and Child B and Child D on the other.  I must consider the long-term effects of that on all four children.  It is not easy.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have come to a clear conclusion in relation to Child D.  He is a baby.  Although I accept he is developing a bond with his Mother, he is not in the same position as the other three.  At present, he has no significant attachment to them due to his age.  I recognise that he would wish, if possible, to be brought up in his birth family and having a fulfilling relationship with his siblings.  But I have already found that it is not possible for him to be brought up by his birth family and I have to balance all the other factors against the advantages, on both sides, of him retaining a relationship with his birth parents and his siblings.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have to consider his welfare throughout his life.  He is entitled to security, stability and permanence.  He should not languish in the care system.  I recognise that, as a fall back, he could move to Child B and Child C&#8217;s current foster placement but this would involve him in being within the care system for all eighteen years of his minority, with all the uncertainty and difficulties that this would bring.  I have come to the clear conclusion that he is entitled to better than that. I find that his parents would recognise that if they were able to consider this objectively.  I further find that his brothers and sisters would do so as well.</p>

Nothing else will do, notwithstanding the loss of his siblings and birth parents.  It follows that I dispense with parental consent as that is what his welfare requires.    </p>

She has bonds with them.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On the other hand, she too is entitled to permanence if it can be achieved.  She cannot live with either of her parents.  Languishing in the care system has real difficulties and uncertainties as already noted.  It is a great shame that there is no-one available to care for her, short of the care system or adoption.  I am not criticising anyone for that.  It is just a statement of fact.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">So what do I do to square the circle?  Do I leave her with her current foster carers in the long term with all the uncertainties that this would bring but so that she can continue to see her Mother, Child A, Child C and Father B?  Or do I find that this is completely unfair on her and that, like Child D, she deserves the chance of a permanent lasting placement for the rest of her life in an alternative adoptive family?  I remind myself that this is not just a case of weighing up the two and coming down in favour of the better.  I must be satisfied that, before I make a placement order, nothing else will do.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I have to weigh in the balance the professional evidence I have heard from both the Local Authority and from the Guardian.  I have placed Child D for adoption.  The Local Authority believes it can find a placement for both Child D and Child B together.  This is important.  I take the view that Child B is also entitled to permanency throughout her life.  She is entitled to an adoptive family with Child D.  I have therefore come to the conclusion that a placement order is the right order to make for her as well.  I have decided that nothing else will do.  She should not languish in the care system, seeing two of her brothers placed with their fathers and knowing that her youngest brother has been given the chance of a permanent adoptive family.  If she can be in that family as well, I have decided that this is the correct order to make.  I therefore do so. It follows that I dispense with parental consent as that is what her welfare requires.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I make it clear however that my approval so far as Child B is concerned is on the basis of a clear plan to place the children together.  I have been given a six months&#8217; timeframe.  I am of the view that, if placement together cannot be achieved, the matter should be restored for further hearing before me urgently.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I approve the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan for contact to both the Mother and Father B prior to placement.  So there is no doubt, Father B should see Child D before he is placed.  I trust that will not be in prison but, if it has to be, it has to be.</p>
