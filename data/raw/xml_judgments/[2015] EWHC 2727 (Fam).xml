	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is sometimes necessary for the court to make an interim order for the sale of a piece of property during the pendency of the ancillary relief proceedings. The property might be a car, a field, a picture or a horse. It might be a block of quoted shares. It might be a piece of commercial property. And it might even be the matrimonial home where the wife and children are living. That is what the husband seeks here. This is my judgment on his application. </p>

	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are three procedural routes whereby such interim relief may be awarded. The first is by means of an order made under section 17 of the Married Women's Property Act 1882 ("MWPA"), as clarified by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/35/section/7/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7(7)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/35" uk:canonical="1958 (6 &amp; 7 Eliz. 2) c. 35" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes (Property and Maintenance) Act 1958</ref>, which expressly confirms the power to order a sale. The second is by an order made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 13</ref> and 14 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47" uk:canonical="1996 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996</ref> (TOLATA). This route depends on both spouses having a beneficial interest in the property.  The third is under FPR 2010 rule 20.2(1)(c)(v). This provides that the court may grant as an interim remedy an order "<span class="CoverDesc" style="font-size:12pt">f</span><span class="text">or the sale of relevant property which is of a perishable nature or which for any other good reason it is desirable to sell quickly". </span> Relevant property is defined as "<span class="text">property (including land) which is the subject of an application or as to which any question may arise on an application".</span> It is the counterpart to CPR rule 25.1(1)(c)(v), which is phrased identically. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The route that is barred is <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref>A <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, which was enacted by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref>. An order under that section can only be made <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">on or after</span> the making of an order for periodical payments (secured or unsecured) or lump sum under section 23, or a property adjustment order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref>, or a legal services payment order under section 22ZA. Such an order is usually made alongside the principal order but it can be made at anytime thereafter and as such is a useful weapon in the armoury of enforcement (a facility that is often overlooked).  But an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref>A cannot be made during the pendency of the proceedings, save as an adjunct to a legal services payment order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Looked at from first principles it is obvious to me that when making an order for sale the court has power to make a supplementary order requiring an occupant of the property to give vacant possession of it. It would be absurd if that were not so and the court could only make half an order.  Under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47/section/13/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(1)</ref> of TOLATA trustees may exclude the entitlement of a beneficiary to occupy land and this power may be exercised by the court by an order under section 14. In <span style="font-style:italic">Miller-Smith v Miller-Smith</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/1297" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 1297" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 1297</ref> at para 16 Wilson LJ explained that the conjunction of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 13</ref> and 14 "enables the court in effect to order that a beneficiary should give vacant possession of land". </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One might think that it was obvious that a supplementary order for the giving of vacant possession could be made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> of MWPA. After all, the very wording of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> gives the court power to make such order as it thinks fit "in any question between husband and wife as to the title to <span style="font-weight:bold">or possession of</span> property" (my emphasis). However, in <span style="font-style:italic">Wicks v Wicks</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 1 FLR 470" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 1 FLR 470</ref> at 483H Ward LJ stated "the power [under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.17</ref>] to order a sale of the former matrimonial home will not include a power to order possession of it". I am sure that Ward LJ did not mean this literally. I have retrieved the fourteenth edition of Rayden on Divorce, published in 1983 (before <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref> - which introduced <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref>A - was passed). At the time it was written the only powers of sale available in divorce proceedings were under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> MWPA and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/30" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 30</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law of Property Act 1925</ref>. At page 682 it states "an order made in proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> of the Married Women's Property Act 1882 may include a provision that one party is to give to the other possession of premises which were the subject matter of the application". It cites <span style="font-style:italic">Short v Short</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1960] 1 WLR 833" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1960">[1960] 1 WLR 833</ref>, a decision of a strong Court of Appeal comprising <span class="judges">Hodson, Willmer and Devlin LJJ. The husband was the tenant of the matrimonial home. In his absence the wife committed adultery in it.

Any other conclusion would, I believe, lead to the most serious confusion.

It seems to me, looking at the matter from first principles, that if the court has before it an application by one spouse for an interim order for sale of a piece of property (howsoever formulated), and that piece of property is the matrimonial home occupied by the other spouse, then the court cannot order vacant possession of it (whether under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref>, TOLATA or procedural rules) without first undertaking the exercise required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> (the successor to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Homes Act 1983</ref>). It seems to me that to do otherwise would be to by-pass specific legislation on the point and to fall foul of Lord Hailsham's proscription. </p>

What is clear, indeed accepted by Mr Wilson, is that under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.13</ref> of TOLATA there is power in effect to order that vacant possession of a property be given, whether on sale or otherwise. So, to the extent that <span style="font-style:italic">Wicks</span> is the peg on which Mr Wilson seeks to hang his argument that the husband needs to satisfy the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1996, being the successor to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1983, the peg cannot hold the argument and breaks from the wall at once. One may say, broadly, that it would be surprising if an order that in effect a spouse should give vacant possession of a matrimonial home under TOLATA were to be made in circumstances in which the applicant could not have secured an occupation order. But I have already stressed the width of the mandatory enquiry under TOLATA; and Mr Wilson's submission that the recorder was required in law to conclude that an occupation order should be made against the wife is in my view invalid. Nor does Mr Wilson wrestle convincingly with the recorder's further observation that, had such a conclusion been requisite, it would have been apt." </p>

They have a son aged 14 who attends a top public school in this country, and a daughter aged 10 who attends a well known London prep school. The combined fees for these schools amount to &#163;56,000 annually.  In 2003 the parties and their son moved to California from this country and their daughter was born there two years later. In 2007 the family returned here and they have lived in London ever since. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the return to this country the family lived in rented accommodation. In 2011 they resolved to buy a home and in October of the following year the matrimonial home was purchased in North London in the husband's sole name. That home was also to be a home for the husband's mother, a lady now aged 82, who would live in a refurbished annex or cottage at the bottom of the garden. A large mortgage of over &#163;1m was raised. The husband's mother contributed &#163;517,500 to the project. This sum was not given to the husband. Rather, it was given to the husband's sister who then lent it the husband under a formal loan agreement which was executed on 26 July 2013.  That provides for repayment within 5 days of any future sale of the property. The husband, who gave oral evidence to me, explained that the rationale for this arrangement was that he would have the use of the money for as long as the house was unsold (which could have been for many years) but ultimately the sum would revert to his sister. Thus he his mother and his sister considered that a fair balance had been struck. </p>

At that point all the monies mentioned above had been spent (or in the case of school fees earmarked for that purpose). Indeed they had even spent the money that the husband should have put aside to pay his tax. Thus in February 2015 the husband had to borrow &#163;45,000 from his business partner to pay taxes and in July 2015 &#163;38,000 from his sister for the same purpose. Further, since the separation the husband's rent of &#163;2,100 per month has been paid by a friend of his, and that friend has also provided the husband with a car. Other sums have been lent by that friend and repaid by the husband &#8211; the documents show that in the year the husband has made a net payment to his friend of &#163;6,900. In the year since the separation it appears that the husband's friend has either given or lent the husband the net sum of &#163;18,300 ((&#163;2,100 x 12) - &#163;6900). Further still, the husband's employer has lent him &#163;43,262 on top of his earnings. That is required to be repaid by the end of this year.</p>

What is remarkable however is that the husband did not put any part of it aside to pay income tax with the result that he owes &#163;45,869 payable on 31 December 2015, &#163;60,593 on 31 January 2016 and &#163;60,593 on 31 July 2016.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the separation the parties agreed that the wife and children could in principle relocate to Los Angeles but the detail was almost entirely absent and the plan was very poorly formulated. In the early part of this year the father repented of this agreement. This led to the mother issuing on 8 May 2015 an application for a specific issue order in relation to their son's schooling in California and on 1 June 2015 an application for leave to relocate both children to California. Those applications were heard by Deputy District Judge Allen on 7 and 8 August 2015. She dismissed the mother's applications on the basis that her plans were far too imprecise. However, she did express the view, perhaps curiously, that in about four years' time it would be in the children's interests to relocate to California. That strikes me as a very risky hostage to fortune: how could anyone peer into the future and make such a proleptic assessment so far ahead? The danger of making pronouncements of this nature is well illustrated by the wife's stance in reaction. She now says "it is of course fantastic to know that we will be returning to California at some point in the next four years" and "our relocation to California is a question of when not if", and it is on that basis that she says that the home, which she had previously agreed to be sold, should not be sold until the certainty of her relocation eventuates.</p>

On 29 July 2015 her solicitors wrote to the husband's solicitors requiring that the proceeds of sale be placed in an escrow account.

Mr Le Grice suggests that it may yet be found that the husband has secreted a large part of the unaccounted sum of &#163;158,000. I think not. I believe it has been spent, in large measure recklessly. He argues that the debts to the business partner and to the sister to pay tax can safely be regarded as soft and negotiable. Yet it is clear that those sums were lent on the clear understanding that they would be repaid when the property was sold. Mr Le Grice is on stronger ground in relation to the debt to the sister of &#163;517,500 given that in the relocation proceedings she stated that she would make available &#163;250,000 from it for school fees and later has indicated that the whole sum would be made available to the husband provided he used it to house their mother as well as himself. The mother's position is very unhappy. She remains living at the home with the wife and describes her situation as being "like a prisoner in my own home". </p>

The husband's reckless and irresponsible conduct in spending such a large sum in the year of separation is indefensible and there will have to be reflection of that when the parties come to settle the ancillary relief claim (which surely must be settled very soon &#8211; it cannot possibly be fought out). The wife is to be criticised for reneging on her clear agreement to sell and then sticking her head in the sand like an ostrich. Her stance is summed up by her statement in her witness statement "I believe he will easily be able to access funds from third parties or from within the business as and when he needs them". It is completely unrealistic. Mr Le Grice wisely did not press me in this regard. </p>

Only in this way can the pressing debts, most importantly to HMRC, be paid and the revenue deficit eliminated. The future housing of the parties will have to be in rented accommodation. I have seen particulars of 3 bedroom flats in reasonable areas costing around &#163;2,500 per month. The husband's net income is just sufficient to pay for two flats as well as to pay the school fees and to support himself the wife and the children. The effect of my order is to impose financial sanity on this family. That is needed for the health, safety and well-being of the parties and their children as the alternative is insolvency with all the psychological damage that that entails. </p>
