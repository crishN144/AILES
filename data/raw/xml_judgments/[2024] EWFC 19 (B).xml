Presently, however, &#8216;U&#8217; is living in a residential unit under an Interim Care Order. The Interim Care Order was made on 19 April 2023 when the Court endorsed the Local Authority&#8217;s interim care plan for &#8216;U&#8217; to be placed in interim foster care. The Local Authority seeks Placement Orders for the youngest three children, &#8216;D&#8217;, &#8216;T&#8217; and &#8216;Q&#8217;, with the care plan that the children are adopted.

She tells the Court that she has experienced a decline in her mental health, including increased panic attacks and has found it hard to leave the home for weeks at a time. She attended this Final Hearing remotely by video at her request. She told the Court that she has not been able to attend contact with the children consistently due to the decline in her mental health. She told the Court that she loves each of the children. She wants the Court to make decisions which are in their best interests as individuals and as a sibling group. She seeks professional support in respect of domestic abuse, substance misuse and improving her mental health. She wants to work towards being able to resume caring for the children. She wishes to remain involved in their lives and to be there to support them in their placements. She agrees with the professional recommendation that it is not in the best interests of any of the children to move to their father&#8217;s care. She considers that the only realistic option for all the children is for the Court to make Care Orders to enable each of them to receive attuned, properly supported parenting in long term foster care, with the youngest three children remaining placed together as a sibling group and the eldest child receiving specialist therapeutic care to meet his needs. The mother opposes the Local Authority&#8217;s applications for Placement Orders for the youngest three children. </span></p>

He seeks to care for all the children. He recognised, however, during the Final Hearing that, due to the competing needs of the children, it may be unrealistic for all the children to be placed in his care. In the alternative, he would seek to care for the eldest child, &#8216;U&#8217;. He opposes the Local Authority&#8217;s applications for Placement Orders for the youngest three children. He proposes that he is supported in his care of &#8216;U&#8217; by his wife, who is not the mother of the children. She and the father are separated, though not divorced. They live in the same household, notwithstanding their separation. The father is a person with communication difficulties, including difficulties with attention and concentration, understanding low frequency vocabulary, understanding court-specific terminology, understanding grammatically complex sentence structures, processing verbal information and understanding written information. He is unable to read independently. An intermediary assessment was completed during the proceedings. Throughout the Final Hearing, the father had the support of a specialist communication intermediary by way of necessary adjustment to ensure a fair hearing, having regard to his vulnerability as a party arising from his cognitive and communication difficulties.</span></p>

Although permission had been given by the Court in an earlier Order for the page limit of the bundle to exceed 350 pages, regrettably no upper page limit was imposed by the Court. Furthermore, the father is a person who, by reason of cognitive impairment, necessitated the use of an intermediary, with repeated breaks required throughout the Final Hearing. Inevitably, it was necessary to adjourn the Final Hearing, part-heard and identify additional days when all trial Counsel and the Court could convene, causing further delay.

It is not clear whether that the significant change to the Local Authority&#8217;s interim care plan for &#8216;U&#8217; to move from a foster care placement to a residential placement was ever endorsed by the Court. The change in the nature of the placement was contrary to both interim care plans filed by the Local Authority, which recorded the need for &#8216;U&#8217; to have a stable, secure, long term foster care placement with a nurturing, safe home environment. It is noted that, erroneously, the updated final care plan for &#8216;U&#8217; records that his needs would be met within an &#8216;adoptive family&#8217;. It has never been the Local Authority&#8217;s stated care plan that &#8216;U&#8217; be adopted. It is not clear that a revised interim care plan was ever produced by the Local Authority nor is it clear that any details of the residential unit were provided to the Court, including details of whether the placement was registered, the qualifications of the staff, whether the staff were trained in neurodivergence, the staff-to-child ratio nor details of the profiles and ages of the other children in placement. That is particularly concerning having regard to &#8216;U&#8217;s age (he is 7 years old) and his diagnoses of autism and ADHD.</span></p>

The Court was informed by the Local Authority Social Worker that there had been only one incident of restraint. The Court expressed its concern at Final Hearing that the child had been the subject of any restraint, having regard to his age and vulnerabilities. The Court directed the Local Authority to provide reports of any restraints. The reports provided at the adjourned part-heard Final Hearing in January 2024 demonstrate three prior incidents when restraint was used by staff at the unit against &#8216;U&#8217; and one subsequent incident. The Court was told at the January 2024 hearing that there have been no other incidents of restraint since 2 December 2023 and that the staff at the residential placement had been instructed by the Local Authority not to use physical restraint against &#8216;U&#8217;. This Court expressed disquiet at the use of restraint on a child so young, without any lawful authority to do so. The Local Authority was directed to file an application for a Deprivation of Liberty Order with the High Court Deprivation of Liberty Unit, with the request that such application be transferred for hearing before me, exercising a s9 High Court jurisdiction. Such application was issued by the Local Authority on 25 January 2024. The High Court in turn transferred the application, now listed before me on 2 February 2024. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:11pt">It is common for witnesses in cases to tell lies during the investigation and the hearing. The Court must be careful to always bear in mind that a witness may lie for many reasons, such as shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear, and distress. The fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything (</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">R v Lucas</span><span style="font-size:11pt">&#160;</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1981] QB 720" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1981">[1981] QB 720</ref>)</span><span style="font-size:11pt">. It is essential that the Court weighs any lies told by a person against any evidence that points away from them having been responsible for harm to a child (</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">H v City and Council of Swansea and Others&#160;</span><a class="Hyperlink" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/195.html" style="font-size:11pt;color:initial"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2011/195" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCA Civ 195" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWCA Civ 195</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">)</span><span style="font-size:11pt">. The Family Court should also take care to ensure that it does not rely upon the conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt. A lie is capable of amounting to corroboration if it is deliberate, relates to a material issue, and is motivated by a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth (</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">Re H-C (Children)&#160;</span><a class="Hyperlink" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/136.html" style="font-size:11pt;color:initial"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/136" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 136" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 136</ref></a><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">&#160;at paragraphs 97-100)</span><span style="font-size:11pt">. The more pertinent matter for the purpose of this Court concerns lies in the context of welfare. Lies, however disgraceful and dispiriting, must be strictly assessed for their likely effect on the child, and the same can be said for disobedience to authority. In some cases, the conclusion will simply be that the child unfortunately has dishonest or disobedient parents. In others, parental dishonesty and inability to co-operate with authority may decisively affect the welfare assessment. In all cases, the link between lies and welfare must be spelled out. Lies are significant only to the extent that they affect the welfare of the child, and in particular to the extent that they undermine systems of protection designed to keep the child safe.

The Court must therefore evaluate the family placement and assess the nature and likelihood of the harm that the child would be likely to suffer in it, the consequences of the harm arising, and the possibilities for reducing the risk of harm or for mitigating its effects. It must then compare the advantages and disadvantages for the child of that family placement with the advantages and disadvantages of a placement in long term foster care. The comparison will inevitably include a consideration of any harm that the child would suffer in the family placement and any harm arising from separation from their parents, siblings and other relatives. It is only through this process of evaluation and comparison that the Court can validly conclude what is the outcome that can provide for the child's lifelong welfare, in other words, that it is necessary and proportionate. </span></p>

She was noted to have cooperated well with the assessment process and presented as amenable, open, and easy to engage in conversation, albeit reluctant to talk about the past. Dr Liverton noted the mother to have experienced emotional and behavioural difficulties since childhood, related to significant adversity and abuse in her early life. She was reported to experience difficulties with low mood and anxiety and enduring low self-esteem. Her main difficulty was noted to be emotional dysregulation with intense mood changes which can rapidly oscillate between hopelessness and tearfulness to anger and aggression, exhibiting traits which are problematic and pervasive across many areas of her life. Such traits were considered by Dr Liverton to impact negatively on her life and likely to impact on her parenting capacity, including shouting and swearing as her way of coping with her intense feelings. This, Dr Liverton concluded, would leave the children at risk of being on the receiving end of verbal aggression. Dr Liverton considered that the mother will be less able to respond appropriately and sensitively to her children&#8217;s needs when feeling overwhelmed by her emotions. Dr Liverton observed that many of the mother&#8217;s children have additional developmental needs or mental health needs, requiring an &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">even more attuned, consistent and sensitive parent.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> Dr Liverton concluded that the mother&#8217;s difficulties with emotional regulation, relationship volatility and impulsivity will negatively affect her ability to provide a safe, attuned, predictable response to her children.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.03in"><span style="font-size:11pt">In respect of therapeutic intervention, Dr Liverton reported that the mother, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">described longstanding difficulties with low mood, anxiety and emotion regulation. She said she finds it hard to notice triggers for her extremes of mood, and that she struggles to know what to do when she is experiencing them. She showed a lack of adaptive coping strategies for her mental health in general. She also talked of having unresolved traumas from her past which she has not felt ready to talk about in a trauma-focused psychological intervention. I would suggest that, given the instability in her current life including the ongoing Children&#8217;s Services involvement, the older girls&#8217; living situation, and parenting many young children, [the mother] would still be unlikely to be able to engage meaningfully in a trauma-focused intervention. For this reason, I would advise that [the mother] would initially benefit from an intervention which helps her to manage her overwhelming emotions, providing her with skills and strategies so that she is more equipped to regulate her feelings and ensure her children are not exposed to this. Without treatment, I am of the opinion that [the mother] will continue to struggle to regulate her emotions and to prioritise her children&#8217;s needs during times of emotional distress. An evidence-based intervention, such as dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) or cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended to support her in this area. This can be provided by the [Local Authority]in-house psychologists within the Family Safeguarding Service. This treatment is skills-focused and delivered via a small online group, which should improve her capacity to engage in the treatment as she is not required to travel nor to discuss her past traumas&#8230;This treatment lasts 12 weeks, and this time scale should be sufficient to experience a positive change and noticeable improvement in symptoms, provided [she] is committed to the group and attends consistently. Her ability to benefit from the treatment will also be affected by her motivation to put into practice the strategies and skills learned as well as any logistical childcare issues. Any changes would need to be maintained in the medium to long term to reduce the impact of her mental health difficulties on her parenting capacity&#8230; would recommend that she review her needs at the end of the DBT programme &#8211; she may require longer term individual psychotherapy to help her address her past life events and enduring maladaptive patterns of thinking, feeling, behaving, and coping &#8211; affecting all aspects of her life including parenting and relationship volatility. This could include schema therapy, mentalisation-based therapy, or cognitive analytic therapy. This work would be intensive with enduring change occurring more slowly (generally a minimum of six to 12 months of weekly sessions), and again this is not something she may be able to engage in at present due to ongoing instability and surrounding stressors in her life which may interfere with therapy.&#8221;</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s position then was that she sought to care for the children as a sole parent, without the father. The assessment concluded negatively, in that it did not recommend that any of the children should be placed in her care. The Local Authority recognised the mother&#8217;s significant personal vulnerabilities, however, the combination of the chaotic and hazardous home environment, the impact of the mother&#8217;s mental health on her parenting capacity and substance misuse led the Local Authority to the conclusion that the mother lacks the ability to meet the children&#8217;s basic care needs, including their emotional needs, their need for guidance and boundaries and provide them consistent parenting, such that and each of the children is at risk of experiencing significant harm if returned to her care. </span></p>

It is a concern that [he] presented as wanting to deflect the concerns away from his parenting to the children and was not completely honest about his knowledge of what the children were experiencing at home despite being involved in the child protection meetings. There is a concern that [he] did not step up to protect his children and continued to suggest that [&#8216;D&#8217;, &#8216;T&#8217; and &#8216;Q&#8217;] were not his biological children despite knowing that they were. It is the view of Children&#8217;s Services that [he] deflected the concerns and struggled to take responsibility for his actions, putting the ownership on, and directing the concerns to [the mother]. At some stage in the discussions, [he] was able to say, &#8220;Okay, I did wrong&#8221; which positively shows a glimmer of acknowledgement. However, he went on explain that [&#8216;O&#8217; and &#8216;S&#8217;] have no respect and have abused the respect from him and blamed them for the reasons why the children were removed from [the mother&#8217;s] care. It is the view of Children&#8217;s Services that [the father&#8217;s] inability to protect the children and not being honest about his role as their father contributed to the emotional harm and neglect experienced by the children in the care of their mother.&#8221;</span></p>

[&#8216;D&#8217;] also mentions specific details that a child of 5 years old, if not exposed, would unlikely be able to give such a detailed account&#8230;Whilst this remains a police investigation, it is the view of Children&#8217;s Services that there is sufficient information to suggest that there were harmful and abusive behaviours within the home that the children were exposed to. There are significant concerns that the children are likely to have been exposed to high levels of violence within the home, however [the father] appears to struggle to acknowledge any of these behaviours that may have been harmful for the children. This makes it difficult to start the process of evoking change with [the father] which includes referring him for any perpetrator work, as [he] needs to be in a place where he is able to acknowledge the concerns and the need for change to happen.&#8221;</span></p>

However, the updating assessment identified concerns that the father, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">is not always honest with professionals, wanting to deflect the concerns away from his parenting and focus on other factors including [the mother&#8217;s] behaviours as well as the behaviours of [&#8216;O&#8217; and &#8216;S&#8217;]. He was asked what needed to change and he was only able to explain what [the mother] needed to change rather than thinking what he needed to change. It appears that [the father] remains in at the pre-contemplation stage when considering the cycle of change and is not yet in a place where he is able to take responsibility for his own behaviours and consider what could have been done differently. As a result of this, the children have suffered significant harm and Children&#8217;s Services would worry that this harm is likely to continue&#8230;he denied being [&#8216;D&#8217;, &#8216;T&#8217; and &#8216;Q&#8217;s] biological father up until when the children were Police Protected on 07/02/2023. A DNA test&#8230;confirmed that [he is]&#8230;their biological father. The Local Authority question and would be concerned about [the father&#8217;s] openness and honesty if the children were to be in his care. This would be a concern as the Local Authority would be heavily reliant on [the father] being open and honest with and co-operating with Children&#8217;s Services and other professionals involved in order to make things safer for the children and ensure their needs are consistently met. The evidence suggests that [he] may struggle to do this and therefore Children&#8217;s Services and other professionals may not consistently know what is going on for the children and how safe things are. Historically, the children have struggled to share some of their experiences at home and therefore if [he] is not open and honest about this, there is a risk that their voices will not be heard. The Local Authority were very concerned about the updated information received by [the mother] on 05/04/2023 and 14/04/2023 which raised significant concerns about [&#8216;U&#8217;s] and his sibling&#8217;s safety and emotional wellbeing in the care of his father due to the exposure to domestic abuse. This, alongside [&#8216;D&#8217;s] comments to her foster carer, raises significant concerns that all the children were exposed to significant domestic abuse within the family home. Children&#8217;s Services note that in the previous care proceedings with [both parents&#8217;] older children, there were also significant concerns that arose around domestic abuse between the parents.&#8221;</span></p>

The Social Worker acknowledged also that the father&#8217;s contact with his older children has been positive. Further, the Social Worker acknowledged that &#8216;U&#8217; is very fond of &#8216;W&#8217; and they have a close relationship. The Social Worker told the Court that &#8216;D&#8217;s reports of domestic abuse by her father against her mother were &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">striking</span><span style="font-size:11pt">&#8221; in their similarity to the mother&#8217;s descriptions of the domestic abuse she experienced, including her account of the father&#8217;s attempts to strangle the mother. Further, the Social Worker acknowledged in her oral evidence that &#8216;U&#8217;s behaviour has deteriorated since he moved from his father&#8217;s care to a residential unit.

Furthermore, the Social Worker highlighted the father&#8217;s denial of domestic abuse in 2015 and that he has maintained that denial ever since, notwithstanding the findings made by the Court in 2015.</span></p>

The recording was taken in unusual circumstances. The mother was situated in her home. The father, &#8216;W&#8217; and &#8216;U&#8217; were in their own home. The mother had a telephone link open with the father&#8217;s home, with the father&#8217;s knowledge and consent.

Using fear of a Social Worker as discipline may mean he is not able to speak openly about what is happening to him. He is only 7years old. He has autism and ADHD. His lived experiences mean he has not been able to regulate his emotions. He has had abuse from his elder siblings where they also shout and swear at him. He has gone to live with his father and, from what I hear in the recording, he experienced similar abuse&#8230;his father told me he sits down with [&#8216;U&#8217;] and speaks with him calmly.

The placement should have requested to lawfully utilise deprivations. That makes me question their level of specialism dealing with neurodivergence in a child so young. I do not know this placement&#8217;s regime or training or experience of its staff. I&#8217;m unclear about the influence of other older residents, and the impact on [&#8216;U&#8217;s] behaviour.

We need to have clear and comprehensive plans moving forward because its crucial to their futures. I struggle to ask the Court to endorse the existing Local Authority Care Plan with the level of uncertainty there is. A child psychologist is necessary with expertise in terms of neurodiverse children, trauma and attachment needs. Those are the three priorities for identifying an expert. The time to conclude the proceedings should be extended to inform [&#8216;U&#8217;s] placement needs and educational needs. A more comprehensive Care Plan is needed that shows a clear pathway to achieving those needs, so that more informed plans could be achieved. We don&#8217;t have a road map of what [&#8216;U&#8217;s] future will look like. Things have been changing quite rapidly on the ground. At least, having a therapeutic package in place could provide some resolution to [&#8216;U&#8217;s] escalating behaviours. That has not been achieved yet. I did not know how much his behaviours had escalated within the placement, the level of restraint he was subjected to nor the increase in aggression. It has been a constantly evolving picture for [&#8216;U&#8217;] in terms of his needs. I would have hoped therapeutic support, due to his life experiences, combined with his additional needs, could have been put in place earlier. He has always had difficulties with his behaviour. His Behaviours have escalated, likely affected by the changes of placement and changes of his primary carer. It has got increasingly challenging throughout these proceedings. He is being </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">offered containment at present, that&#8217;s probably about it. His behaviours have escalated. This is a very worrying situation, being so young, with his additional needs, in a residential unit with lots of different staff, rather than a core group of consistent adults and being physically restrained. It is a worrying situation for [&#8216;U&#8217;] currently.&#8221;</span></p>

Initially I recommended a time-limited family finding search for six months. That was in July 2023. This was largely down to challenges in successfully identifying a forever family for an older sibling group with the two youngest children showing emerging behavioural difficulties. [&#8216;D&#8217;] has now past key milestones in respect of her age, additional needs, existing attachments to her parents and extended family members, her siblings and her influence on the younger children, which would made adoption less successful. She will be 7 years old in April 2024. For older children, after the age of 5, it becomes very, very difficult to integrate into a new family setting.&#8221;</span></p>

An adoptive placement stands a really high risk of breakdown and that would be devasting for these children. Identifying a forever family with their ages and complex needs will be a struggle. The priority is to keep them together as a sibling group and to remain in a stable placement with longevity. They will need an extremely high level of support over and above what these foster carers are receiving. I don&#8217;t see an adoptive placement being provided with the same level of support as professional foster carers would provide for such highly traumatised children displaying really challenging behaviours. That could put a real strain on an adoptive placement, increasing the likelihood of a breakdown of placement. I listened to the Family Finding evidence.

Their individual needs remain heigh and their collective needs as a sibling group remain high. Despite being provided with reparative care, it&#8217;s slow progress and demanding.

He continues not to accept the factual findings made by HHJ Wright in 2015. The Court has made further findings in these proceedings. Plainly the father continues to have a troubling propensity towards domestic violence. Further, the father has consistently not been open or honest with professionals, maintaining a level of dishonesty that directly impacts on the ability of the professionals to safeguard the children. The extent of his fundamental dishonesty was even to deny paternity of all the children until the police exercised powers of protection in February 2023. This Court reaches the same inescapable conclusion to that of each of the professionals that each of the children would be at risk of significant harm if placed in his care, either as a sole carer or as joint carer with his estranged wife.   The combination of concerns leads the professionals to the unanimous conclusion that no amount of professional support could adequately safeguard any of the children in his care or mitigate the risks sufficiently for the benefit of the children.  Furthermore, the father&#8217;s vulnerability in respect of his physical health needs mean that he is largely dependent on a carer, his estranged wife, in respect of his own needs, including dealing with medication and taking him to medical appointments. He has depended on his estranged wife further in respect of his care of &#8216;U&#8217;, in terms of preparation of meals, laundry and homework. The father and &#8216;W&#8217; both told the Court of an intention to divorce and for the father to move out of their current shared property. As the Local Authority properly noted, there remains a high degree of uncertainty about how the father could manage the day-to-day basic care of &#8216;U&#8217; or any of the children, without the support of &#8216;W&#8217;.  To his credit, the father recognised it would be unrealistic for him to care for all four children. He has no established record of manging their care as a sibling unit and meeting their competing needs. Moreover, there is unanimity of professional opinion that &#8216;U&#8217; has a high level of need requiring specialist, therapeutic carers, having regard to his diagnoses of autism and ADHD, with increasingly challenging behaviour. Each of the professionals was rightly concerned about the father&#8217;s and &#8216;W&#8217;s inability to adequately manage &#8216;U&#8217;s behaviour, as evidenced by the audio recording of 12 April 2023. The professionals are united in their opinion that the father is not able to meet &#8216;U&#8217;s needs consistently nor provide the reparative parenting &#8216;U&#8217; desperately needs. The additional factors of the father&#8217;s lack of insight into domestic violence and the impact of his behaviour on the children leads the Court to the same conclusion reached by the professionals that the father cannot meet the needs of any of the children to a good enough standard, with or without support. Further, there is no solid evidenced-based reason to conclude that he could make the necessary changes in respect of his parenting, within the timescales of the children. </span></p>

Those records identified repeated, troubling incidents of restraint being used against &#8216;U&#8217; by members of staff in his placement, following dysregulated behaviour. No Deprivation of Liberty application had been made by the Local Authority. There is currently little or no educational provision for him. He is receiving no targeted therapeutic support beyond &#8216;animal therapy&#8217;. Although it was said that the Local Authority&#8217;s in-house psychologist was a resource open to &#8216;U&#8217;, it does not appear that the deteriorating situation for &#8216;U&#8217; including his repeated dysregulated behaviour and the consequences of it, were of such significance to the Local Authority that urgent psychological support or assessment was considered to be a priority. </span></p>

There is considerable weight to the submission on behalf of the Guardian that such care planning should be informed by expert evidence from a psychologist, with expertise in children with neurodevelopmental disorders who have a history of trauma and who exhibit dysregulated behaviour, to advise the professionals and inform the Court about care planning for &#8216;U&#8217;. </span></p>

Further, it is imperative that the Local Authority urgently continues its search for a more appropriate placement for &#8216;U&#8217;. Moreover, it is imperative that the Local Authority puts into effect a suitable therapeutic package of support for &#8216;U&#8217; in his current placement and a return to education, until such time as a suitable placement is found for him. This Court entirely agrees with the sentiment expressed by the Guardian and by the mother, that in reality, &#8216;U&#8217; has over recent months, and continues to be, little more than &#8216;contained&#8217;.

The Guardian, who has the utmost respect for the work of these foster carers and their ability to provide reparative care, nevertheless concluded that the children&#8217;s existing placement with these foster carers is unlikely to be a long-term option for the children. The foster carers have expressed their current view to the Guardian that they need significantly more psychological and other support from the Local Authority for the children, and to see positive results therefrom, before they would be prepared to commit long-term to their care. &#8216;D&#8217; continues to display challenging behaviours. &#8216;T&#8217; and &#8216;Q&#8217; are also showing signs of emerging behavioural difficulties, such that the foster carers are not confident they would be able to meet the needs of this sibling group in the long term. </span></p>

Whilst the Local Authority told the Court in its evidence that it proposes to carry out a parallel search for both a foster care placement and an adoptive placement over 12 months, the Social Worker&#8217;s evidence suggested that a search for a foster placement would only begin after a 12-month search for an adoptive placement.

Further, it is unlikely that adopters could be found who have the skills required to meet the needs of these siblings. Furthermore, it is unlikely that adopters would be given the level of support they are likely to need in the long term to meet the needs of each of these siblings. Yet further, it is likely that the Local Authority search for an adoptive placement would be protracted and futile and thus compromise the children&#8217;s urgent need for a permanent placement to be found for them. Moreover, it is likely that any essential work with &#8216;D&#8217; by way of preparation for adoption would be emotionally damaging if no such placement emerged. Additionally, save in the unlikely event the Local Authority finds exceptional adoptive carers, the task is liable to be beyond the capacity of most prospective adopters and the risk of breakdown of an adoptive placement is significant. Any placement breakdown in adoption would have profoundly emotionally damaging consequences for each of the children. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.03in"><span style="font-size:11pt">Having regard to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>, this Court prefers the careful, nuanced analysis of the Children's Guardian, whose initial written analysis was given thoughtful revision, reflective of the current circumstances. Comparing the advantages and disadvantages to the children of adoption with long term foster care, putting into the balance the factors identified by the Guardian in her oral evidence, the balance tips firmly away from adoption as being in the best interests of each of the three youngest children. This Court respectfully endorses the Guardian&#8217;s updated analysis. This Court must conclude that adoption is not in the best interests of the three youngest children for the reasons expressed by the Guardian. Further, this Court must conclude that adoption is neither necessary in this case nor is it the proportionate response. For those reasons, the Local Authority&#8217;s applications for Placement Orders for &#8216;D&#8217;, &#8216;T&#8217; and &#8216;Q&#8217; must be dismissed. </span></p>

Further, the Court agrees with the Guardian that careful care planning is necessary to ensure that the needs of these children to have contact with their parents and with &#8216;U&#8217; are properly considered. </span></p>

Further detail is required regarding what that means. Further detail is required about the psychological support available to &#8216;D&#8217; to assist in managing her challenging behaviour. Having regard to the request from the current foster carers for additional support, including psychological support, this Court agrees with the submission made on behalf of the Guardian that the Local Authority must provide information from its in-house psychology team about the placement and therapeutic needs of this sibling group and the timescales within which those needs should be met. </span></p>

There is merit in the Guardian&#8217;s recommendation that it is of importance that the children are not left in their current placement for a lengthy period, while the Local Authority decides whether the existing carers can meet the children&#8217;s needs. </span></p>
