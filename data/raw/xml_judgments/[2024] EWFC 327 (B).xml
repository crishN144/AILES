It addresses the evidence and the decision which the court would have made if the matter had been contested. It was written particularly for the benefit of the mother and her legal team, as well as the father and guardian.</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s conduct in accepting the order was of some concern in view of her historic position and it is fair to say that her demeanour was extremely flat at court. Whilst the court did not have concerns about her capacity within the proceedings, the court was deeply concerned about the mother&#8217;s wellbeing and mental health, both historic and from today.</span></p>

This is the father&#8217;s application for a Child Arrangements Order, including an immediate and urgent transfer of residence. There were previous proceedings commenced in 2023 where the father sought contact and these were compromised by way of an order earlier this year, which provided for A to live with her mother and for the father to spend increasing amounts of time with A including overnight contact. It is important that I note that the recommendation of CAFCASS at that time was for A to move area and to live with her father. At the time this was not pursued by father.  I have had conduct of the matter throughout.</span></p>

Following the issue of the application, I listed an urgent hearing (which initially had to be adjourned and relisted due to administrative issues) and appointed a Guardian and Solicitor for A pursuant to S. 16(4) CA 1989.  Ms D was appointed as Guardian and the matter was listed for an urgent hearing. Ms Turner, Solicitor for A, filed a position statement on behalf of the Guardian which recommended an immediate change of residence as well as a S. 37 CA 1989 direction, an order for a psychological assessment of the mother and for the mother to have only supervised contact. The application was listed urgently upon receipt of the information from CAFCASS.  I will address the position statement in more detail later.</span></p>

I listed this further hearing today in order to allow the mother to properly instruct her solicitors and for all parties to file statements in relation to the urgent issue of change of residence to father. I have received statements from mother and father. Their positions remain as before. The father today sought an order for immediate change of residence. The mother initially opposed this but ultimately consented. The Guardian supported the father.</span></p>

Following separation, contact took place on a supervised basis (by the mother and at her insistence) but attempts by father to increase the time and reduce supervision arrangements could not be agreed and the initial application was filed in Summer 2023.

Her position was that the father was a risk to A and should not be allowed to have any unsupervised contact with him until she was older, able to vocalise her wishes and able to make up her own mind. In her final statement in the earlier proceedings she stated [I] &#8220;want her to make decisions in relation to living arrangements herself when she is an adult in order to prevent harm or any the risk of harm&#8221; and she wanted &#8220;A safeguarded and contact stopped.&#8221;</span></p>

No fact finding was to take place, as this was neither necessary nor proportionate. I also did not accept that at [x] months of age, A cannot be left unsupervised with her father or that she must be of a specific age or able to talk before she can be left unsupervised with her father. I carefully explained these matters to the mother at the court hearings, as she was unrepresented, and they were set out in the recitals to the orders. The mother refused to increase contact and the matter was listed for a further hearing and a report from CAFCASS was also ordered as well as a letter from the local authority.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The matter was reviewed in early 2024. The CAFCASS officer, in a very detailed analysis, recommended contact increasing gradually to overnight and expressed concern that if this had not happened, A could be at risk of emotional harm if she remained in her mother&#8217;s care. The mother&#8217;s position remained the same as before, repeating all of her allegations, relying on the same &#8220;evidence&#8221; as fact. The CAFCASS officer considered various hypotheses for the mother&#8217;s behaviour: being an overanxious parent; being critical and controlling of the father to marginalise him from A; exhibiting alienating behaviours or that the father was indeed a risk of harm to A. She dismissed the final hypothesis as being without any evidence. She also expressed concerns about whether the mother would promote contact or abide by a court order. She urged the court to spell out very clearly to the mother the possible implications of not complying with a court order. The court did this and clearly informed mother that if she persisted with her unfounded allegations and refused to progress contact, a change of residence to father was a realistic possibility. The father was not at the time pushing for this. Again the position was recorded in the court order and the mother confirmed that she understood. </span></p>

Mother had attended A&amp;E that evening, raising concern that she believes A has been given sleeping pills by her father. Mother advised that when she collected A from her father, A was stumbling around which is unlike her and she appeared very tired. Mother believed Father was therefore drugging A with sleeping pills. A was checked over by a nurse, who advised she was unable to see any signs of this and observations were fine. The staff at the hospital agreed to complete a urine toxicology and blood gas test which would identify whether there were any immediate health concerns. Mother advised the nurse that she had previous concerns about Father when they were in a relationship, including catching him with his hand between A&#8217;s legs and on another occasion covering A&#8217;s face with a blanket. Due to the concerns for Mother&#8217;s mental health, it was agreed for A to remain in hospital overnight for social admission and overnight observation.</span></p>

Instead she chose to record the father at handover and has attempted to control the father via methods of communication. The cost of OFW is approximately &#163;9 per month per parent &#8211; an insignificant amount for the mother to contribute for A&#8217;s welfare particularly compared to the extremely high costs of the father&#8217;s travel and accommodation for contact etc over a long period of time. Indeed there is a 30 day free trial and it can be free in certain circumstances (such as being in receipt of universal credit &#8211; which the mother used as an excuse not to use the App). This is done via a &#8220;fee waiver&#8221;, which the mother would know if she had activated the App and she should have been able to provide contemporaneous proof of her efforts in relation to the same &#8211; none has been provided. Instead she simply chose to ignore the court order. Now she says she is willing to use the App and indeed her use of it has been to request money from the father for May nursery fees.</span></p>

Where, in private law proceedings, the choice, as here, is between care by one parent and care by another parent against whom there are no significant findings, one might anticipate that the threshold triggering a change of residence would, if anything, be lower than that justifying the permanent removal of a child from a family into foster care. Use of phrases such as &#8220;last resort&#8221; or &#8220;draconian&#8221; cannot and should not indicate a different or enhanced welfare test. What is required is for the judge to consider all the circumstances in the case that are relevant to the issue of welfare, consider those elements in the s1 (3) welfare check list which apply on the facts of the case and then, taking all those matters into account, determine which of the various options best meets the child&#8217;s welfare needs.&#8221;</span></p>

The evidence is clear from the Guardian &#8211; this child has suffered and continues to suffer from emotional harm as a result of the mother&#8217;s actions.  It is potentially the case that the test for the threshold is met for the making of a public law order, the local authority are already involved with child protection matters due to the mother&#8217;s actions and allegations and the Guardian has recommended that the local authority prepare a report under section 37 CA 1989. It is perhaps surprising that the local authority took no immediate further action following the mother&#8217;s hospital visit.</span></p>

Change will occur but this will settle and there is no evidence that father will not be supportive of contact with the mother &#8211; indeed he readily proposed his sister as a supervisor.

I agree that mother has looked after A&#8217;s physical and many of her emotional needs during this period. Indeed the CAFCASS officer recognised her ability to practically care for A and the local authority have observed only positive interactions between A and her mother. I have no doubt that there is a strong attachment between them. I recognise that a transfer of residence may cause short-term emotional harm to A, but in my judgment there is sufficient evidence for me to conclude that this is preferable to prevent further alienation from her father and potential emotional harm. Put simply, the mother is presently unable to meet A&#8217;s emotional needs &#8211; she either refuses to properly do so or is unable to see that her behaviour is damaging. In addition to these issues regarding alienation which would cause emotional harm to A, there are very real concerns shared by the Guardian and the Local Authority of A becoming subject to further unnecessary medical testing in the future due to mother&#8217;s anxieties</span></p>

If she does not believe them and is merely using them as a method to try to alienate the father, the same applies. I am not satisfied that she will comply with court orders in the future, indeed she has told the police she will not do so. I am certainly not satisfied that she is able to promote contact and a positive image of the father for A&#8217;s benefit. History is a useful indicator of future behaviour. </span></p>

The mother maintains that she stands by her concerns raised during and since the last set of court proceedings.
