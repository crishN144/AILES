At the conclusion of that judgment Mr Reeder invited me to deliver such an additional judgment and I now do.</span></p>

He has unfortunately lifelong physical and mental disabilities and substantial communication problems.  These proceedings will decide his future and in particular where and in what circumstances he will live.  The background is factually controversial.  Both of AB&#8217;s parents have been joined as parties and he similarly is a party.  There are to be resolved serious questions of physical, emotional and financial harm, and a Schedule of Allegations which is at the beginning of the bundle and is entitled S1 sets out the factual matters in dispute.  At an early stage it was determined to deal with the matter in two parts, starting with a fact finding hearing.  That hearing, in an absolute strict sense, stands part-heard but in reality the earlier hearing only involved the short evidence of one witness before the hearing was adjourned for various reasons into which I need not go.  What is left is effectively the full fact finding hearing, a substantial and substantive hearing with nine days&#8217; Court time set aside, due to start in two weeks.</span></p>

There is, as counsel put it, guarded optimism but no guarantee at present and accordingly the Directions that I made on Friday anticipate the matter proceeding to a full hearing.  </span></p>

The lack of available Court time, which was known in advance, meant that I directed that the issues were subject to full Skeleton Argument to be added to only by oral submissions within the time available.  Helpfully therefore I had before me four extensive Skeleton Arguments and additional documents and a core bundle specifically for the hearing.  I am grateful to all four counsel for their Skeletons and to Miss Crow, who stood in for her trial counsel, at the oral submissions stage.  Although the decisions are in the nature of case management they are of the utmost importance to AB and are regarded by the Official Solicitor, who acts as his Litigation Friend, as raising issues of wider significance.</span></p>

The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> changed all that and the work of the Court of Protection has grown enormously in the last 10 years.  It is a jurisdiction of profound importance and unlike any other.  It takes decisions for people who lack capacity and the decisions are often life-long and life-changing.  It is a dynamic jurisdiction and change in law and practice is rapid.  A common misconception is that it is a paternalistic secret jurisdiction.  Conducting much of the work in public and providing accessible judgments online are important recent developments which undermine that misconception.  </span></p>

Many professionals involved, in legal and other disciplines, have knowledge and/or direct involvement in childcare law or practice.  They are inevitably informed by that experience as they approach cases in the Court of Protection.  So, just as the role of the child in Family proceedings is under constant re-evaluation, so is P&#8217;s role and his ability to participate in Court of Protection proceedings likewise.  </span></p>

It has been broken down by Mr Bagchi QC, who represents AB, in his Skeleton to a series of questions and propositions.  There are a number of authorities touching on the participation of P but none which formulates at the appellate level guidance for trial Judges.  The decisions I make are obviously factually specific to AB&#8217;s case but it is necessary to consider the questions of principle.  At A80, which is page 3 of Mr Bagchi&#8217;s Skeleton, he lists eight questions, the last two of which are practical but the first six are substantive.  He sets out the following; </span></p>

I use the inelegant phrase &#8216;oral input&#8217; as there is an issue as to whether what AB says is truly evidence.  The Local Authority and the parents all oppose AB giving evidence or addressing the Court other than in an informal meeting with me.  The parents oppose AB&#8217;s attendance at Court and the Local Authority has some reservations although takes a fairly balanced view and will support practical arrangements so long as they do not draw upon Local Authority funding or resources to any significant extent.</span></p>

It is a creature of civil law but the role in this jurisdiction is spelled out in the Rules but in general terms.  As far as I am aware no statute, set of Rules or authorities is or are prescriptive in terms of how a Litigation Friend discharges his or her duty.  It would be quite wrong for the Court in effect to manage &#8211; or as some might see it, micro-manage &#8211; the discharge of the Litigation Friend&#8217;s central functions.  In the Court of Protection we are fortunate, in my judgment, that many Litigation Friends are professionals in the sphere of Social Work or Social Care or have the experience of the Official Solicitor and his office.  Very often therefore they are experienced independent persons acting fairly and with P at the heart of the matter.  At A93, again in Mr Bagchi&#8217;s Skeleton, he devotes a whole passage beginning at paragraph 43 to the role of the Litigation Friend.  I do not read it but I express my agreement with the propositions set out therein and the citations from authorities describing broadly the functions of a Litigation Friend.  </span></p>

However, I do not accept that I am bound to accept the expert view at this stage and in effect abdicate the judicial role or at least subjugate it.  It is highly likely that the expert view will prevail, but not even to attempt to give AB an opportunity to contribute even to the fact finding phase is in my judgment too restrictive.

It may well be that the net result will quickly be apparent that his information is too unclear or lacks probative value and so the exercise can gently be curtailed.  In other words, using Rule 95(e) the Court may admit the information but there is no guarantee that it would accept or act upon it.  If the Official Solicitor tenders AB to give &#8216;information&#8217; I do not accept I have a general power to stop him or that a specific permission arises; it is in my judgment simply an application of Rule 95(e).  Of course even if this exercise proves fruitless the position may be different at the best interests stage because it is certainly clear that AB has communicated his views as to the future.  </span></p>

Rather than create a general case management power, I prefer to characterise the Court&#8217;s role as dealing with specific best interests decisions as they arise, and they </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">do</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> arise in many different circumstances.  </span></p>

They say it is contrary to AB&#8217;s best interests to attend the hearing, even to remain in or around the building, and certainly to give evidence or provide information, because it will have no probative evidential value and the process will cause distress and even harm to him. They say it is contrary to AB&#8217;s best interests to observe his parents and previous carers being cross examined about those historical allegations because that will cause distress and harm to him.    They submit that his participation should be limited to meeting me.  They have no objection to him being provided with updates during the course of the hearing. It seems to me in an ideal world that such matters should be isolated and litigated at a very early stage.  That has not happened here and because the case has developed as it has, I intend no criticism of anyone and therefore I am prepared to deal with the question on the basis that there is an informal application by the parents for a best interests declaration on participation or provision of evidence and information.  </span></p>

I accept that there is evidence of potential harm and that there are substantial misgivings properly and conscientiously felt by the parents and representatives of the Local Authority.  But on the other hand there is evidence of AB&#8217;s desire to give evidence and to participate and of his potential frustration if he is not permitted to do so.  He has been described at times as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;resilient&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> and there is the advantage, as Dr Lilley puts it, of empowerment.  In this regard, Miss Dart&#8217;s evidence is very encouraging.  I accept that there are powerful points both ways and that this is a difficult balance to strike.  But it is nevertheless a balance. There is no presumption, but there seems to be good reason in this case why it is worth having a try and keeping the matter under review.  Therefore I am not prepared to make a best interests declaration that it would not be in his best interests to attend or attempt any form of participation.  After all, the special measures and substantial adjustments that are proposed are designed to deal &#8211; at least in part &#8211; with those anxieties.  </span></p>

I recognise the powerful points made and understand the very real anxiety that AB may be dragged into the fact finding when in reality the Local Authority does not want or need him to prove their case. AB&#8217;s real interest appears to be to express his views as to the future not the past and to provide his expressed wishes as to his own circumstances rather than to give an account of past events.  Therefore I am acutely aware of the dangers and I have no wish to embark upon an empty exercise that is just as synthetic as other methods of participation suggested, but it is my view that we should try.  As the Judge, I have the duty to find the facts and evaluate the evidence or information provided.  Simply to regard AB&#8217;s contribution as forensically worthless without even hearing him is not something I can contemplate.  </span></p>

On behalf of the Trust in this case Mr Sachdeva QC submitted that the views expressed by a person lacking capacity were in principle entitled to less weight than those of a person with capacity.  This is in my view true only to the limited extent that the views of a capacitous person are by definition decisive in relation to any treatment that has been offered to him so the question of best interest does not arise.  However, once incapacity is established so that a best interest decision must be made there is no theoretical limit to the weight or lack of weight that should be given to the person&#8217;s wishes and feelings, beliefs and values.  In some cases the conclusion will be that little weight or no weight can be given; in others very significant weight will be due.&#8217;  </span></p>
