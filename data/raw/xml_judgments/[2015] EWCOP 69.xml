They are desperately sad that, as a result of my findings, they are unable to care for him and continue to devote great energy in pursuing an agenda in respect of him.  Some of that agenda is misguided based, as it is, on an inability to recognise the facts as I have found them to be, but in other respects they have demonstrated a genuine and laudable wish to do whatever they can for their son, whatever the circumstances.  Thus, although they do not accept my findings and have indicated they never will accept them, they have engaged in the process of assisting this court in making decisions as to his future in the light of those findings.  For that the court is grateful, even though E's conduct continues to cause considerable difficulties in managing the case.</span></p>

I further gave permission to the local authority and the Official Solicitor to reinstruct Dr Gwen Adshead to prepare an addendum report as to the risks, if any, posed by M's family in relation to contact arrangements following my judgment.  Thereafter, M duly moved to the placement run by EL, and subsequently E and A requested an amendment to the contact order by email.  That request was refused.</span></p>

Having heard evidence from Mr McKinstrie, the social worker, LG, Dr Adshead, A and E, I concluded that M should move to T Road.  I declared that it was in his best interests to have contact with family members in accordance with the terms of a schedule appended to the order.  In short, that provided that there should be contact with his mother, father and sister after his move to T Road on one occasion per week, at the weekend for two hours, to be supervised by two support workers provided by the agency in the community.  I provided that contact should continue to be regulated by the previous protocols for contact which were already in place.  In addition, it was directed that the local authority would facilitate additional contact between M and his father, A, on a minimum of one occasion per fortnight during the week, based on a sporting activity.  It further provided that there would be additional family contact on Christmas Day and such further contact as may be agreed by the local authority and the Official Solicitor.  The schedule also recorded that, the court having expressed the hope that it may be possible for the restrictions on contact to be relaxed, providing it was in M's best interests, the local authority should keep the frequency of contact and the need for two supervisors under review.  Provision was also made as to written communications.  I identified a number of issues remaining outstanding at that point, namely: the making of a final order for contact; whether to appoint a deputy for health and welfare; if so, the identity of the deputy and his or her obligations; an application by E to lift the restrictions concerning the reporting of the case and disclosure of documents; the management of future applications; and the scheme for the authorization of any deprivation of liberty.  And I gave directions for a further hearing in February 2015 aimed at resolving those issues.  Following this hearing M moved to T Road, where he remains.  It is the evidence of the local authority that he has flourished at that placement.</span></p>

Further directions were then given concerning the outstanding issues.  In particular, so far as the identity of the deputy was concerned, the Official Solicitor was directed to seek clarification on certain issues from the Office of the Public Guardian concerning the funding of a deputy.  Further directions were subsequently applied for by the parties and ordered by email.</span></p>

It was agreed in principle, however, by all parties and the court that a deputy should be appointed, not only for health and welfare but also for property and affairs.  As a result, the question of an appointeeship fell away.  As to the identify of the deputy, the local authority proposed, as they had consistently done, an employee from within the authority, albeit separate from social services, whereas E and A proposed an independent person.  Various inquiries were made via the Office of the Public Guardian to identify a suitable independent person.  The question of the identity of the deputy was adjourned until 23rd April, along with the other issues.</span></p>

I do not propose to lengthen this judgment still further by setting out the reasons for the court's approval of this course.  Suffice it to say that I am satisfied that the circumstances of this case merit such an appointment having regard to the terms of s.16(4) of the Act and Chapter 8 of the Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice.

I do not propose to go through each and every one of the issues identified by those track changes, although I have considered them all carefully.  In my judgment, it is unnecessary to do so.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I add these further brief comments in outline in response to some of the issues raised in E and A's track-changed documents.  First, I do consider it appropriate to grant the deputy the power to suspend contact as set out above, but it will be seen that I have amended the draft prepared by Mr Bagchi in a way that limits the deputy's powers.  The suspension of contact with close family members is a serious step and should only be taken if the deputy considers it to be in M's best interests.  I anticipate that this will only occur in exceptional circumstances.  Secondly, it is not necessary to refer within the exceptions, as suggested by E and A, to the deputy's powers to take decisions under a lasting power of attorney or an advanced decision under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.24</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  M has not executed either a lasting power of attorney or an advanced decision, and the omission of these two provisions does not amount to discrimination or a breach of his human rights as E and A assert. Thirdly, the reference to "restrain" his intended to restrict the deputy's powers so as to prevent any restraint of M beyond that which is permitted under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and authorised by this court.  Fourthly, I accept in part E and A's complaint about the clause authorising the deputy not to notify or consult them, but only to the extent that I consider the deputy should be obliged to notify and consult with them in respect of any decision to suspend contact between M and E and/or A and/or S.  Finally, the matters listed by E and A in a proposed additional subparagraph to the reporting and consultation obligations are to my mind satisfactorily covered, to the extent that it is in M's best interests, elsewhere in the terms of reference as set out above</span></p>

I have considered them carefully but conclude that the order should remain in the terms of Mr Bagchi's draft, subject to the insertion of the appropriate figures, which I would be obliged if Mr Bagchi would email in due course.  No more need to be said about that now in this judgment.</span></p>

A number of possible candidates were put forward to fulfil that role.  Ultimately, however, there were only two viable options: one, an employee of the local authority, whom I shall hereafter refer to as "Ms Y", and, two, a solicitor, whom I shall refer to as "Ms Z".  The local authority supports Ms Y.  E and A support Ms Z.  The Official Solicitor, through Mr Bagchi and Miss Mackintosh, ultimately declared himself neutral.  </span></p>

At present she works in a different office from the social work team responsible for this case as the access to resources manager of the local authority, responsible for managing direct payments to all services user groups, purchasing supporting independent services, arranging short-term beds and managing the cost model matrix for high cost placements.  She is based in an office not far from T Road and would therefore be easily contactable and available to undertake visits if required.  She has had no previous involvement in this matter and knows nothing of the proceedings, save for the main judgment of August 2014 which has been released to her.  The local authority has other individuals who have acted as deputies and, according to the senior manager, the arrangements seem to work well.  It is the local authority's case that Ms Y has the necessary skills, is at the right level of seniority, is not carrying an excessive caseload, has no prior knowledge of this case, has vast experience and is a registered social worker, all of which, in the submission of the local authority, makes her an ideal candidate.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In oral evidence before me, Ms Y thought that she would be able to devote about eight hours a week maximum to this case.  No-one has suggested to her any specific time limit, but she obviously would have to fit her responsibilities as deputy into her main job.  She said that if more time was required she would arrange things and acknowledged that in some weeks it could take more/some less.  She has never acted as a deputy before.  She has looked at the Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice to ascertain the responsibilities it would involve and was aware of the key principles, in particular the obligation to act in the best interests of M and to consult with the appropriate people before making a decision.  She was aware from reading the judgment that there have been a number of controversies in this case over issues that are likely to recur in the future.  She said nothing about that caused her concern.  She said that she had a lot of experience of this type of case as a care manager.  She acknowledged that it was difficult for anyone to put a loved one into the care of somebody else.  She recognised that this gave rise to a level of anxiety and was familiar with dealing with complaints in these circumstances.  On some occasions she has found it possible to resolve such matters satisfactorily, on other occasions not.  She saw that it would be very difficult for E and A to accept that she would be independent of the local authority.  She stressed, however, that she has experience of challenging and criticising the actions of others within the local authority in the course of her work.  She said that she thought she was likely to make decisions that the local authority would not like and also on occasion decisions that E and A would not like.  Cross-examined by E, she stressed that she recognised that E, A and S are very important people to M and acknowledged that they had "done a great job with M".  </span></p>

She has been qualified since 1998 and in 2005 set up her own firm as a sole practitioner.  She has plenty of experience as a deputy in property and affairs, but this would be her first case as a health and welfare deputy.  She has been on the panel of deputies recommended by the Public Guardian since 1st June of this year.  Ms Z could not say how many hours would have to be devoted to this case every week.  If more than 10 hours was required, she would find it challenging, but her proposal is to delegate part of the work to her assistants.  All members of her team have experience in working in the field and she would expect all of them to have dealings with members of the family.  Her plan would be to analyze the case and assess the types of decisions required, identifying those in respect of which she needed to be involved and those which could be left to other members of staff.  Ms Z said that she was aware of the background of conflict between E and A and other professionals.  She saw the risk that she would be bombarded by communications from family members.  It would, therefore, be important to establish boundaries at the outset.  She had experience of challenging cases in the course of her work.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I have found this a finely balanced decision but in the end I have decided to appoint Ms Z as deputy.  In reaching this decision I stress that I have no criticisms of Ms Y.  She is plainly highly qualified and experienced in many difficult cases and sensitive to the anxieties and concerns of family members.  I believe that she would be scrupulous about maintaining independence from those employees within the local authority involved with the family.  The fact is, however, that she is employed by the same local authority which has been responsible for taking and prosecuting these proceedings.  As a result, it is, in my judgment, very unlikely that she would ever have the full trust and confidence of E and A.  I have already found the multiple criticisms levelled E and A at the social workers in this case to be almost completely unjustified and I have no reason to question the integrity or professionalism of anyone within this local authority.  But, in my judgment, it is essential that the new deputy is given the best opportunity to forge a good working relationship with everyone in the case, in particular E and A and, therefore, if possible, must be not only independent of the local authority but seen to be independent.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">That objection would not necessarily be decisive.  Were there to be no other credible candidate, as seemed likely at one stage, I would have had no hesitation in appointing Ms Y.  But, in my judgment, Ms Z is eminently qualified to perform this role.  She is in some respects the opposite of Ms Y. Whereas Ms Y has plenty of experience of dealing with complex care cases, with no experience of working in the Court of Protection or of acting as a deputy, Ms Z, although not experienced in social work matters, has plenty of experience in Court of Protection work and in the legal complexities of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.  Furthermore, she has acted as a deputy for property and affairs in the past, although not hitherto for health and welfare.  She has the support of a team experienced in this sort of work.  From my limited opportunity to observe her in the witness box being questioned by Mr Bagchi, Miss Bretherton and E, I formed the view that she has both the judgment and the independence to enable her to fulfil this role.  I believe she will quickly master the details of the care plan and allocate staff appropriately to the various tasks required.  On balance, therefore, I conclude that the best person in all the circumstances to act as deputy for M, both for health and welfare and for property and affairs, is Ms Z and I shall make an order to that effect.</span></p>

In a civilised and democratic society, the legal system must be seen to be open to scrutiny.  In the spirit and opinion of the fundamental principles of justice and liberty is openness and transparency, as endorsed by the reforms of the Family Division and the Court of Protection in its drive against secrecy.  The core legal and social issues highlighted in this case are of enormous public interest importance, as the judgment recognises.  Therefore, they are worthy of debate in a public forum.  Our experience would benefit so many, as so much is topical, with recent legislation, reforms and reviews, which is in the wider interest.  The particular interests we would wish to focus on are those of (i) costs of DIY justice - litigants in person; (ii) deputyship of those vulnerable and the importance of working collaboratively with the local authority; (iii) the Mental Capacity Act to be embedded into society and the implications of not doing so for all concerned.</span></p>

At the hearing I had understood that E and A agreed to an undertaking not to communicate with M's dentist or GP or other professionals involved in providing care for M, save in writing via his deputy or otherwise with the consent of the deputy.  This provision duly appeared in Mr Bagchi's draft order.  However, in the track-changed document, E and A objected to the phrase "save in writing".  In my judgment, given the lengthy history of unwarranted and damaging interference by E in the work of the professionals involved in M's care, as described in the main judgment, such a restriction is wholly justifiable in M's best interests and I shall make an order to that effect.  However, the terms of the order, reflecting Mr Bagchi's draft undertaking, give the deputy a discretion to permit communication otherwise than in writing if she considers it appropriate.  I am confident that I can trust Ms Z to exercise that discretion sensibly.  </span></p>

The local authority seeks permission to disclose the judgment and care plans and contact protocols to medical professionals and any advocate concerned with M's care and welfare.  E and A ask that such an order be more specific, asserting that the local authority proposal is intended to be a further means by which they can be "maligned".  I completely reject this argument.  The order sought by the local authority is entirely sensible and practicable in M's best interests and I shall so order.  </span></p>

The order contains an injunction on disclosure and must, therefore, contain a penal notice.  As drafted by Mr Bagchi, that notice is directed only at E and A, but the order that I am making is not confined to E and A but extends to everyone served with the order.  The penal notice attaching to the disclosure order should, therefore, be amended to read: "If you disobey this order you may be found guilty of contempt of court and may be sent to prison or be fined or have your assets seized." However, the draft order submitted by Mr Bagchi contained an undertaking, and to that, as set out above, E and A raised an objection.  And, as indicated above, I have now substituted it with an order.  That is directed at E and A and should, therefore, be accompanied by a penal notice directed to them.  </span></p>

Mr Bagchi's draft included a recital to the effect that the court had found that neither E nor A were suitable persons to act as litigation friends for M.  I did not in fact make such an express finding in the main judgment in August 2014, and I do not recall making any such finding at any other point.  I will if necessary consider this and any representations on this point.  In my view, however, it is unnecessary to include such a recital since I am including within the deputy's terms of reference a provision that she should be allowed to act as litigation friend in all proceedings in respect of M from this point.  </span></p>

E and A ask me to invite the local authority to change the two social workers, JR and LG, who have been involved in this case for several years.  I decline to do so.  As indicated in my main judgment, I do not accept the criticisms relentlessly levelled at the social workers by E and A.  They have done an excellent job in very difficult circumstances.  E and A also ask me to invite the local authority to apologise for its "maligning" of them to them to the CQC.  I am not in a position to say whether they have been so maligned, and I do not consider it necessary to investigate this issue.  </span></p>

That judgment was delivered extempore at a hearing attended by all parties, including E and A.  As the time for appealing that order had expired by the date of their application for such an extension, I do not consider that I have power to extend the time for appealing.

The Official Solicitor is concerned at the risk of further unmeritorious applications by E and A which, unless restricted, would waste the time and resources of the court and other parties.  Mr Bagchi reminds me that there is in the Court of Protection rules and the Mental Capacity Act no power akin to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  Nonetheless, he also reminds me of the court's inherent powers to restrict applications - see, in particular, </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Bhamjee v. Forsdick and others (No 2)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2003/1113" uk:canonical="[2003] EWCA Civ 1113" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWCA Civ 1113</ref>.  He invites the court to make a direction forbidding any further application to this court in respect of M without prior permission of the court.  E and A object, stating that this violates their rights as human beings.  At this stage I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to go as far as the Official Solicitor proposes.  This order marks the end of these proceedings.  I expect all parties will do their best to avoid litigation in future and try to work collaboratively with the new deputy I have now appointed.  Despite the many applications that have been issued in the course of these proceedings, I am not prepared to make an order at this stage to the effect that E and A should be restrained from making an application without the permission of the court.  It does not follow, simply because they have made numerous applications in the course of these proceedings, that they will continue to do so now that these proceedings have come to an end.  Nonetheless, without imposing any requirement for permission, I shall direct that any application upon issue shall in the first instance be referred to me for further directions.  </span></p>

Finally, E and A object to any order which provides that all future applications be reserved to me.  They argue that such a restriction is an infringement of their human rights and argue that any future applications should be made in the usual way that does not specify for the attention of any named judge.  I have tried to explain the principle of judicial continuity to E and A in the course of the hearing but they have maintained their position.  In my judgment, it would be wholly unfair on any other judge and wasteful of valuable resources to expect another judge to take on such an application.  As long as I am available, all further applications shall be reserved to me.</span></p>
