	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">I have been engaged this week in a Fact Finding Hearing in relation to Adam Glanville, who was born on 27 July 2017. He is therefore at the moment 6&#189;, going on seven years old. His mother is<span style="font-style:italic"/>Karima Gadelrab Elsayed Mahmoud, and the father is Daniel Glanville. The parents cohabited for a short period of time, and they separated, and they managed to resolve the financial matters in relation to Adam by way of an agreed schedule 1 order.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">Poor Adam has been the subject of litigation for a very great deal of his short life. The first application that was made in these proceedings was in January 2020. At that time, Adam was only 2&#189; years old. It is shocking that this little boy has been the subject of a war between his parents, and I have been able to form a very clear view during the course of the hearing this week whose fault that is. Rarely do I in children&#8217;s proceedings find that I can blame just one of the parents almost entirely for what has happened.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">The matter was listed before me this week for three days for a Fact Find Hearing in relation to a Scott Schedule of allegations that occupied 22 pages. When I looked at this case last week, I immediately asked my clerk to send a message to Counsel, saying that it was completely impossible for any judge to deal with 22 pages of allegations, and to navigate their way through a bundle of 1,619 pages in the three days allowed. My reading time over the weekend before this case was about three hours. We started more or less on time on Monday morning, although Counsel had asked for extra time which of course I was willing to give them.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">We had the additional difficulty, this is not in any way of course a compliant, it is just a fact that the mother was to give her evidence through an interpreter, and that of course always takes longer. In fact, it is obvious that the mother speaks really fairly good English. I completely accept though that it was appropriate and necessary for her to have an interpreter because English is not her first language. Her first language is Arabic, and it has only been fair to her that she had the opportunity of giving evidence in her own language and having that translated for her.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">I want to pay tribute to the interpreter that we have had in court this week. In my experience, and doubtless that of others, the quality of interpreters that we have in this court varies. I have rarely had one as good as I have had in this case this week, and in difficult circumstances because the mother&#8217;s answers tend to be agitated and rambling.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">When I debated the matter with Counsel, that is Ms Pink acting for the mother, Ms Papazian acting for the father, and Ms Musgrave acting for the Guardian, Gill Timmis, they all recognised of course that it was not possible for me to deal with the 22 pages of allegations. I had expected when Counsel first came into Court on Monday that probably we were going to have to find ourselves adjourning this case. I have said very often in this Court, and it is obvious that delay is almost always the enemy of justice, particularly in children&#8217;s cases.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">An adjournment on Monday would have been for many, many months because of the pressure on the judges of this Division at the moment, but the matter was transferred from the Family Court at West London by me, or rather in conjunction with discussion with me as the Family Presider for London because of the international aspects of the case and the very serious allegations which were, among others, threats to kill allegedly by the father to the mother, and of child abduction, allegedly by the mother to various countries. This is obviously a case that was appropriate to be heard by a judge of the Division, and I am going to order that the matter shall continue to be heard by a judge of the Division, reserved to me if available.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">Although I plan to retire from full time sitting as a High Court judge of the Family Division at Easter, the President of the Division has agreed that I can return to hear this case, and in fact it seems to me at the moment that the case after this Judgment today is going to be adjourned part heard by me because there are further facts that we may need to deal with, and there will of course be a welfare hearing in this case as well.  </p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">It seemed to me that the appropriate thing to do was to look at the serious allegations. The serious allegations were obviously the ones to which I have referred, that is child abduction and threats to kill. I took the view that if at any point it became clear to me that it was not possible properly to deal with those issues in isolation of the many, many other issues in this case, that I would adjourn it. I also made it very clear to Counsel that if any of them thought that the process was going to be unfair for reasons I have just identified, that they would make submissions to me, and I would listen very carefully to whatever it was that they had to say.  </p>

	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">No such application was made, and I am completely satisfied that the process this week has been fair, no one has suggested that it has not been, and that I have been able to come to a very clear view on the issues of alleged child abduction and alleged threats to kill.  </p>

	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">I heard the evidence of the mother. At times her evidence was given in English, but I encouraged her to use her first language which is Arabic, because I wanted to be sure that I had an exact answer from her, and that there was no complaint from her that there had been some sort of misunderstanding. It is of course obvious that most parents giving evidence in the High Court about their children are going to be anxious. In my judgement, the mother was a lot more than just anxious. She was agitated, she was at terms thoroughly belligerent, and I am afraid I have to say that she was most of the time thoroughly dishonest.  </p>

	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">I have taken the view that I cannot believe anything that the mother has told me unless it is supported by independent evidence, that is independently corroborated but the best evidence of course is likely to be contemporaneous written evidence. The father gave evidence. I found him at all times to be courteous, calm, respectful, and I have to say, transparently honest. It is obvious to me that the father has experienced immense pressure from the behaviour of Adam&#8217;s mother.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">The mother has been, even during the process this week, objectionable, belligerent, and at some times downright abusive. She appears to have little respect for the process, and at one point as I shall turn to later, even said quite clearly in an email that she was going to ignore an order of Williams J given earlier in this case, and that she could secure fake documents to enable her to travel out of the country with Adam within minutes, or was it within hours, but certainly within either minutes or hours, and to have a litigant in this Court being rude and objectionable about an order of a High Court judge is something that I, and I suspect all of my fellow judges of this Division, simply will not tolerate.  </p>

Our memories of past beliefs are revised to make them more consistent with our present beliefs. Studies have also shown that memory is particularly vulnerable to interference and alteration when a person is presented with new information or suggestions about an event in circumstances where his or her memory of it is already weak due to the passage of time.&#8221;  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.47in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;In the light of these considerations, the best approach for a judge to adopt in the trial of a commercial case [and of course that was what that was concerned with, but I suggest that exactly the same should apply in a fact find such as the one I am engaged in] is in my view to place little if any reliance at all on witnesses&#8217; recollection of what was said in meetings and conversations, and to base factual findings on inferences drawn from the documentary evidence and known or probable facts.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.47in;text-indent:0in">This does not mean that a raw testimony serves no useful purpose, though its utility is often disproportionate to its length, but its value lies largely as I see it in the opportunity which cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations, and working practice of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">The proceedings started, as I have said, by the mother applying <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> for a Non Molestation Order. The parties at a later point agreed that they were not going to resurrect allegations of argument, violence and abuse one to the other, and this order related to matters that predate that agreement of theirs. I plainly make no findings at all on the allegations of abuse that the mother then made against the father, simply because I have not heard evidence about it, it has not been relevant to what I am dealing with today, and in any event, the parties as I have said agreed to put all of that behind them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">In any event, the matter came before the Court again on 20 January 2022. That was an order made by Deputy District Judge Edwards sitting in private at the Family Court in West London. The parties were both represented by Counsel, and Adam then represented as he now is by NYAS, was then represented by Counsel, albeit a different Counsel from Counsel that appears today. The order makes clear that the mother had raised concerns regarding the Guardian, Mr Adedeji, and sought his removal from the proceedings and for a new report to be commissioned.  </p>

She has complained about NYAS workers, about district judges, about judges, and about solicitors. None of her complaints have, as far as I am aware, been upheld.  </p>

It seems to me to be beyond doubt that United Kingdom means the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Normally in these orders, one expects to see reference to England and Wales. The reason for that is obvious, because first of all Scotland, albeit being part of Great Britain and part of the United Kingdom, has a different legal system.  </p>

I am not blaming anybody for that, but this order then continues by saying while a Child Arrangements Order is in force in relation to a child, nobody may remove the child from the United Kingdom.  I have no doubt that the intention here was to order that the mother should not remove the child from the jurisdiction of England and Wales.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">This order, unsurprisingly coming from the High Court, did not make reference to the United Kingdom but to England and Wales, and whatever the mother may have thought the United Kingdom meant, one thing is clear, because it will become relevant in a minute, is that she could not possibly have thought that Northern Ireland was part of England and Wales. Northern Ireland is of course part of the United Kingdom, but this order was very specifically now referring to England and Wales. The order also did not have the confusing rubric at the bottom saying that she was allowed to take, or that anyone was allowed to take Adam out of the country for 28 days. The order of Williams J could not have been clearer.  </p>

How they got there it seems was a taxi to Watford junction. I can see that that might be sensible in the sense that it is possibly quicker to go round the M25 and up to Watford than to go into London to pick up the train from Euston, and then the mother and Adam and the cat took a train to Liverpool Lime Street. They then went to the docks at Liverpool, and they got a Stena ferry over to Northern Ireland where they arrived at about 6 o&#8217;clock in the morning the next day.  </p>

I should have thought anybody wanting to see the ships on the sea living in Richmond might think it be more sensible to get a train down to Southampton or Portsmouth. Portsmouth after all has two of the largest aircraft carriers in the world docked there, the sort of thing I should have thought a little boy of his age might want to look at.  </p>

She got the ferry over to Belfast where she got off there at six in the morning, and her plan she says was to stay there one or two nights and then come back the next day. The travelling for a five year old boy from Richmond to Watford in the cab, Watford to Liverpool Lime Street in a train, Liverpool Lime Street to the docks, the docks over to Belfast on a ferry, an exhausting journey for a child.  </p>

The only conclusion I can reach, on the balance of probabilities which is the applicable test, is that the mother&#8217;s purpose in going to Northern Ireland was to cross the open border from the north to the south to the Republic of Ireland where she would then be outside the jurisdiction of this Court.  </p>

I do not need to prove to the criminal standard, beyond reasonable doubt, that this was the mother&#8217;s plan, but I find it impossible to think of any other reason why the mother could have wanted to go in late October when it was dark and getting cold, why she would want to spend all that time travelling to go to Northern Ireland.  </p>

I have not even heard evidence that she took him to the Titanic museum which would have at least fed his &#8220;interest in shipping&#8221;. I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s plans were altogether less worthy than a nice couple of days out, and I am sure that the mother cannot spend any unsupervised time with Adam at the moment.  </p>

That contact must be supervised. I find as a fact that the mother has, on three separate occasions, attempted to take Adam out of this jurisdiction illegally, and in the light of her own promise, her statement in documents in an email that she wants to take Adam away from this Court and into Egypt which will not respect the orders of this country.

I am going to order that a transcript should be obtained and it is to be a legitimate charge on the legal aid certificate, and I do not think it would be fair for me to ask NYAS to share in that cost. I am going to say, I will hear representations on this if Counsel want to persuade me, but my feeling at the moment is that the transcript should be a charge on the mother&#8217;s legal aid certificate with the father having to pay the other half I am afraid from his own costs.  </p>

She has had, if I may say so, one of the most difficult briefs that I have seen in this Court for quite a long time, because Counsel walks on a very difficult tightrope sometimes between their duty to the Court and their duty to the client. I am completely satisfied that Ms Pink has carried out both of those duties extremely well, and I want the mother to hear me say that I think that Ms Pink has said everything on the mother&#8217;s behalf that could possibly have been said, in case the mother decides to add Ms Pink to the long list of people against whom she makes complaints.  </p>
