	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Pippa Knight is a much loved five year old girl. Her father died three years ago but she has the most dedicated and loving support of her mother, Paula Parfitt, her older brother, aged 7, and her maternal grandparents, uncle, and aunt. Together they form what Ms Parfitt describes as &#8220;powerful unit of strength for her and for each other.&#8221; </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">That strength has been needed. Pippa is gravely unwell. She has severe brain damage and has been kept alive by mechanical ventilation through a nasal endotracheal tube in the paediatric intensive care unit at the Evelina London Children&#8217;s Hospital since January 2019. Expert neurologists and intensivists agree that she probably feels no pain and experiences no pleasure, that she is not conscious of her environment, and that there is no prospect of improvement in her condition. The NHS Trust responsible for Pippa&#8217;s care and treatment, whose doctors, nurses and therapists have exercised exceptional skill in looking after her, considers that she has been through enough. It asks this court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to declare that it is lawful and in Pippa&#8217;s best interests that: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Ms Parfitt opposes the Trust&#8217;s application. The evidence shows that there have been many meetings between Ms Parfitt and the treating team. She is aware of all the expert medical opinions that have been given in this case, but unlike the Trust, she believes that Pippa has made some progress since January 2019, that she has awareness of her family and can derive pleasure from being with them and from touch and other sensations, and that it is in her best interests to continue on long term ventilation. In reliance on expert evidence, including from Dr Colin Wallis, Consultant Respiratory Physician, Ms Parfitt proposes that Pippa should now undergo a trial of portable ventilation, a tracheostomy, and management in a transition unit with a view to her being discharged from hospital, to be cared for at home. </p>

The hearing before me was held in public and in person, with two witnesses giving evidence by video link. The parties and the court have had the benefit of experienced Counsel: Mr Mylonas QC for the Applicant, Mr Davy for the First Respondent, and Mr Sachdeva QC and Ms ButlerCole QC for the Second Respondent. I am grateful to them and to their instructing solicitors for the care and skill they have exercised in presenting this case. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The dispute as to whether continuing ventilation should or should not be given to Pippa has been brought to the court for determination because Ms Parfitt and those who are treating Pippa have been unable to come to an agreement. The Trust has carried out best interest reviews. It has sought second opinions from independent consultants. Its Ethics Committee has given its opinion on whether long term ventilation is in Pippa&#8217;s best interests. Mediation has taken place but was not successful. This case is of an exceptional nature &#8211; very few children are in Pippa&#8217;s condition &#8211; and it is the exceptional cases that tend to come before the courts. The Trust&#8217;s application was made in March 2020 but it has taken several months to arrive at a final hearing. This is in part due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but also because of the nature and extent of the expert evidence in the case. On 22 July 2020, Judd J gave permission to the Second Respondent to rely on six expert witnesses. One of those, Dr Wallis, proposed a trial of portable ventilation with a view to transferring Pippa home. The feasibility of that proposal, and the conditions under which a trial should be conducted, have taken time to investigate.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Since the parties bring Pippa&#8217;s case to court, the court must make a determination &#8211; it has a duty to do so. The court is independent of the Trust, of the NHS, and of Ms Parfitt. The court&#8217;s power is to decide whether a course of treatment is lawful or unlawful. It has no power to require doctors to carry out a medical procedure against their professional judgment. The court&#8217;s decisions are not based on what the particular judge would decide for themselves, or what outcome they would want for their own loved ones. Nor are the judge&#8217;s own ethical or religious beliefs relevant. Rather, the court seeks to apply the law to the facts of the individual case. The question for the court is what is in Pippa&#8217;s best interests. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">On the first afternoon of the hearing, Ms Doyle and I visited Pippa on the PICU at the Evelina. Her mother was where she can usually be found: at her daughter&#8217;s bedside. I had expected that any visit would be by a video link of some kind, given the current Covid-19 pandemic, but Ms Parfitt wanted me to attend in person and the Trust was happy to accommodate the visit with suitable safeguards being taken. The purpose of the visit was not to gather evidence, but to see Pippa in the environment in which she is cared for. The visit helped to connect the forensic process within the court room with the real circumstances in which Pippa and her mother find themselves. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The background to this application is heart-rending. Pippa was born on 20 April 2015. As a very young child she was affectionate, reaching out to her parents and others for cuddles. She had a strong bond with her brother whom she idolised. She developed normally until December 2016 when her mother took her to Medway Hospital because she was unwell. She deteriorated overnight and began to suffer seizures. She was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (&#8220;PICU&#8221;) at St George&#8217;s Hospital, London, and was diagnosed with acute necrotising encephalopathy (&#8220;ANE&#8221;), a rare condition in which an acute febrile disease, usually a viral infection such as influenza, is followed rapidly by seizures, disturbance of consciousness, and ultimately brain damage (encephalopathy). Pippa remained on the PICU until 10 January 2017, when she was moved to the paediatric ward. A month later she was transferred back to Medway Hospital, and after another month she was transferred to a neuro-rehabilitation unit where she remained for a further three months. On discharge home Pippa was severely compromised. She had a four-limb motor disorder with a predominant dystonia. She required nasogastric tube feeding and was thought to have cognitive impairment.  </p>

He found it difficult to cope with the fact that another of his children was suffering so grievously. A few days after Pippa&#8217;s discharge home, he took his own life. Ms Parfitt had to cope not only with her own bereavement, but with two bereaved children, one of whom was newly discharged from rehabilitation and severely disabled.  </p>

She made progress under the care of her mother at home. She gradually regained some strength and could walk a few metres with a walking frame (her left leg was weaker and she had difficulties with balance). She regained the ability to crawl and she could ride a tricycle with support. She had limited verbal communication but was interactive in play. </p>

When a child&#8217;s parents and the medical personnel treating a child disagree about whether certain treatment is in a child&#8217;s best interests, neither has a veto &#8211; the court, taking an independent and objective view of the evidence, is required to decide what is in the child&#8217;s best interests. Nevertheless, authority from the European Court of Human Rights does suggest that parental wishes are a factor that should be taken into account. Pippa has a right to life under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Art 2 imposes a positive obligation on the state to protect life but, although that is a fundamental right, withdrawal of life sustaining treatment is not a contravention of Art 2 if certain requirements are met.

By way of example, although the Court of Appeal in this case, in  reaching the conclusion that the withdrawal of food and Anthony Bland's subsequent  death would be for his benefit, attach importance to impalpable factors such as  personal dignity and the way Anthony Bland would wish to be remembered but do not  take into account spiritual values which, for example, a member of the Roman  Catholic church would regard as relevant in assessing such benefit. Where a case  raises wholly new moral and social issues, in my judgment it is not for the judges to  seek to develop new, all embracing, principles of law in a way which reflects the  individual judges' moral stance when society as a whole is substantially divided on  the relevant moral issues.  Moreover, it is not legitimate for a judge in reaching a  view as to what is for the benefit of the one individual whose life is in issue to take  into account the wider practical issues as to allocation of limited financial resources  or the impact on third parties of altering the time at which death occurs.&#8221;[879H]. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>Pippa&#8217;s condition has been assessed at the Evelina over the nearly two years she has been a patient within its PICU. Longitudinal multi-disciplinary assessments have been performed to determine whether she is showing any signs of change. Numerous meetings have been held with Ms Parfitt, and with other family members to consider Pippa&#8217;s condition. In 2019 the Trust made referrals for second opinions from a paediatric neurologist and paediatric intensivist at the Addenbrooke&#8217;s Hospital in Cambridge. I have seen those opinions which largely accord with the expert opinions given to the court on behalf of the parties.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Pippa has no respiratory drive &#8211; she cannot breathe for herself at all. She has been ventilated on the PICU since admission in January 2019. Unusually she remains ventilated via an endotracheal tube (&#8220;ETT&#8221;) rather than a tracheostomy tube. A tracheostomy was offered in February 2019, which was standard practice given that neurological improvement was then anticipated and there would be a likelihood of long term ventilation. Ms Parfitt declined a tracheostomy on behalf of her daughter and now says that she did not fully understand why it was being offered. By May 2019 the paediatric neurologist from Cambridge, who was contacted for a second opinion, was advising that a tracheostomy was not in Pippa&#8217;s best interests, but he would not have anticipated that Pippa would have remained ventilated on the PICU as long as she has been. Pippa is attached to a standard ventilator and her respiratory support is described as modest with baseline settings at peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 17, positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) 5, and SiO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2 </span> 30%. However, those baseline settings are adjusted several times a day according to her physiological need. Dr C explained that the particular challenges with Pippa&#8217;s respiratory condition are not related to ventilation in itself, but to her tendency to desaturate, that is, for her oxygen saturation to fall. In the PICU, the target is oxygen saturation of at least 92%. About 10 to 20 times per day, on average, Pippa&#8217;s saturations fall to between 80% and 90%. With careful monitoring those changes are noted and acted upon. The reason Pippa desaturates is that she has poor oxygen reserve and a tendency for her lungs to collapse (&#8220;atelectasis&#8221;), and that secretions and saliva accumulate in her airway. Secretions are produced by cells in the lung tissue, saliva is produced in the mouth.  She cannot swallow, she has no gag reflex, she cannot cough, and she has little movement. These factors combine to allow both secretions and saliva to collect in Pippa&#8217;s airway, causing blockages. Because she has poor reserve, the blockages quickly cause decline in her oxygenation. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Dr C and Ms F both told me of the regime used to counter the blockages and desaturations. Regular respiratory physiotherapy is required. Pippa is frequently moved from her back to her side and vice versa. She is also moved into a special &#8220;bee&#8221; chair on a daily basis. For at least two hours a day Pippa is turned into a prone position, a manoeuvre which takes two, sometimes three, individuals to complete. I was told that Ms Parfitt assists and has become particularly expert at helping to move Pippa onto her front. The object of &#8220;proning&#8221; is to remove pressure on the back of her lungs so that her alveoli, the tiny pleural sacs, can take up oxygen and so build up her reserve. A cough assist machine, called a Clearway, is used two to three times a day, and sometimes a fourth time if needed. This machine administers saline under pressure and then reverses the flow, simulating a cough, so as to encourage secretions to move up the airway from where they can be suctioned. In addition, a risky process called saline lavage is undertaken by a suitably qualified respiratory physiotherapist. This involves instilling large amounts of saline into the lungs, giving large breaths with the oxygen bag, turning the patient, and using manual techniques alongside the bag breaths and suction to clear secretions. Mouth suctioning is also performed throughout the day and night. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Even with these interventions, Pippa desaturates every 1 to 4 hours. Generally, these episodes are addressed by deep suctioning (the suction tube goes to just above her vocal cords), adjustments to the ventilator pressures, and the use of anaesthetic bagging. Unlike with an Ambu bag, which can use air, or oxygen entrained from a connected cylinder or oxygen concentrator, anaesthetic bagging introduces oxygen into the patient under pressure in order to recruit the lungs. The specialist PICU nurses act swiftly to avoid further desaturation when these episodes occur because Pippa has a noted tendency to desaturate rapidly. Even so, notwithstanding the exceptional nursing care on the PICU, on an average of about once a week Pippa has a more significant loss of oxygen when her level drops significantly below 80%. It has been known to fall to as low as 40% as happened on one day during the hearing. In such cases a respiratory physiotherapist may have to be summoned urgently to add to the efforts to bring Pippa&#8217;s oxygen levels back to an acceptable range. Again, specialist equipment such as the anaesthetic bag will be used. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Pippa receives excellent care on the Evelina PICU, but she is vulnerable to profound desaturations or some other complication that could take her life at any time. Predicting her life expectancy with continued long term ventilation on the PICU is difficult, but the balance of the evidence to me was that Pippa would live longer on the PICU than she would if on long term ventilation in a home setting, and whilst she could die at any time, she could live on the PICU for some years yet. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The notion that it might be possible to transfer Pippa home on long term ventilation first came from Dr Wallis. His proposal is supported, in general terms, by Dr Chatwin and Dr Playfor. This combination of expert voices, fully supported by Pippa&#8217;s mother, introduces an important consideration for the court &#8211; is it in Pippa&#8217;s best interests to embark on a process that might lead to her receiving long term ventilation and other life sustaining treatment at home? In order to answer that question, it is necessary to consider what the process of transition to home care would involve, and the prospects of that process succeeding. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The manner in which evidence about a trial of portable ventilation and transition to home care has been rolled out has not been very satisfactory. That is not a criticism of the legal representatives. I do however say that Dr Wallis ought to have recognised that his proposal of a trial and transition to home care would require considerably more detailed explanation than he had given prior to the hearing, particularly once he knew that the treating team opposed it. For example, he gave very little further detail in his joint statement with Dr C, responding to some key questions merely by referring back to his first report. As a consequence, although Dr Chatwin had previously raised some issues about potential alterations to Pippa&#8217;s regime, Dr Wallis gave a great deal of evidence about the process under questioning at the hearing, which he had not previously raised. Even in re-examination he introduced striking new evidence as to the nature of home care. This made it difficult for the Applicant to respond. When witnesses for the Trust were able to respond, their evidence, in turn, prompted further investigation by the Second Respondent, so that even after the hearing had concluded, a fourth report from Dr Chatwin was submitted. After representations by email I ruled against admission of Dr Chatwin&#8217;s fourth report. It mainly concerned evidence of Pippa&#8217;s oxygen saturation levels when not desaturating, and other aspects of her past respiratory management, and I do not find such further evidence to be necessary to my determination of the issues in this case. </p>

It has to be recognised that there is an inherent risk to going home for Pippa but if the alternative is withdrawal of life-support, then this risk will have to be accepted by her therapeutic staff as well as mother.

The same is true for the team at the Evelina. The Trust&#8217;s witnesses responded with a number of concerns about this proposal but, whilst maintaining that the trial was not in Pippa&#8217;s best interests, they produced a draft trial protocol which, in turn, received some criticism from Dr Wallis and Dr Playfor for being set up for failure. The thresholds for abandoning the trial were set too low in their opinion. In her oral evidence Dr A from the Evelina said she would be open to reviewing the protocol, the proposed ventilator settings, and the thresholds for abandoning the trial. Accordingly, the terms under which a trial would be carried out were explored in detail at the hearing. It is unnecessary for me to chart the course that this evidence took, but I shall set out what was established by the close of the evidence: </p>

He said that overall there was a 1 in 4 chance of Pippa reaching the point of being discharged home with a full complex care package. However, if the initial trial were successful, he thought that there would then be about a 90% chance that Pippa would progress from the transition unit to home. As he told me, arrival at home is not the ultimate destination, it is the beginning of the next stage of her care. It would not be intended to discharge her home for palliative care, but to continue long term ventilation with a view to keeping her alive as long as possible. If, during the transition process, it became evident that home care was not achievable then the difficult discussion about withdrawal of ventilation would begin. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The treating team at the Applicant Trust does not believe that Pippa&#8217;s condition warrants any attempt to transition her to home care. This is a process familiar to the team - the Trust has undertaken it with many other paediatric patients. Dr C told me that she is line manager for fifty patients who are ventilated in the community. Drs A and C and Ms F were perplexed at the suggestion that Pippa was at all suitable for home care. They have been looking after her for nearly two years in the PICU and with exceptional skill and high specification equipment have managed to keep her alive. Frankly, they believe there is no realistic chance that with less sophisticated equipment, and less specialist personnel, Pippa could survive more than a very short time at home.  The treating team have stated that they would not be willing to perform a tracheostomy on Pippa for the purpose of the process Dr Wallis proposed and the Applicant seeks a declaration that it is not in Pippa&#8217;s best interests to undergo a tracheostomy. It is not that the Trust is opposed to the use of tracheostomies for children on long term ventilation &#8211; nearly all such children in the Evelina PICU have undergone tracheostomies, and one was offered for Pippa in early 2019. Rather, their resistance to taking any steps towards a transfer home, in particular an invasive procedure such as a tracheostomy, is based on their belief that the exercise would be futile, and that the continuation of long term ventilation in any setting is contrary to Pippa&#8217;s best interests. </p>

Dr Playfor and Dr Wallis emphasised that there are &#8220;ceilings of treatment&#8221; at home, and that families of children on ventilation at home, and the professional nursing team, have to accept the limits of provision and the consequent risks,.

He was the last witness to complete his evidence and there was no opportunity to explore this wholly new evidence with others. In particular, it was not clear to me what personnel and other equipment would have to be taken with Pippa in case she desaturated whilst outside. What is evident however, is that even at home Pippa would be permanently attached to a ventilator, she would require a tracheostomy and gastrostomy, and for most of the day, as now, she would be in a hospital bed, attended by nurses, undergoing suctioning and nurse led treatment and therapies.    </p>

There has been no assessment of the suitability of Pippa&#8217;s family&#8217;s home for accommodating her, her equipment, and the necessary care team. Hence, I have no reassurance that her envisaged package of home care is practically achievable. Whilst appreciating that the CCG will not address Pippa&#8217;s needs and funding decisions until necessary, it does strike me as a gap in the evidence that no-one has made even a cursory assessment of the suitability of Pippa&#8217;s family home as a venue for her long term care. The Second Respondent&#8217;s case is focused on Pippa&#8217;s best interests being served by her being cared for at her home, not in some other community setting but I have no evidence that her home is suitable to accommodate her, her mother and brother, all the equipment needed, and a team of nurses who would need space and facilities of their own in order to function effectively. </p>

This is not part of the Second Respondent&#8217;s case, no-one else suggested that the transition process was anything other than a means to an end, and Dr Wallis himself has said that in his view it would be contrary to Pippa&#8217;s best interests to continue to be ventilated on the PICU.

These adjustments might, he said, optimise the chances of a successful trial of portable ventilation and transition to home care. Witnesses at the Trust who subsequently gave oral evidence sought to address these suggestions. I was told that one of the leading specialists in salivary glands works at the Applicant Trust, had been consulted in the past about the option of Botox injections, and had ruled it out on the basis that it might well thicken her saliva and cause worse blockages. When told of that, Dr Wallis suggested that they might wish to think about it again.  </p>

It is not the court&#8217;s function to give detailed directions as to a patient&#8217;s medical management. On the other hand, it is necessary for me to form a view on all the evidence of the prospects of success in transferring Pippa to home care. Dr Wallis proposed that such a transition should be attempted, and I take full account of his experience and his evidence to the court. I accept that there may be several adjustments that could be made to optimise the chances of success of the trial and transition, but the trial and transition could only succeed if Pippa&#8217;s current tendency to suffer intermittent profound desaturations ceased or was significantly reduced. In his first report Dr Wallis wrote at para. 54: </p>

It is rare that a child with complete absence of ventilatory drive, failure to cope with secretions, absent cough and susceptibility to aspiration and atelectasis has, in the absence of consciousness, been put forward for home care. In one instance in which I am aware that this was provided, it was with the understanding that the child would have a limited life quantity and that palliative care provided at home with LTV support package was in the family&#8217;s best interests. Pippa would require 2 trained carers at all time who have demonstrated the ability to cope with her respiratory needs.&#8221; </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">In oral evidence Dr Wallis confirmed that that child, unlike Pippa, had some awareness of their environment. Dr Wallis knew of only two children with similar neurological conditions to Pippa&#8217;s who had been transferred to home care, but they did not have the same severe respiratory problems that she has. When pressed during his oral evidence, Dr Wallis assessed the prospects of a successful trial of portable ventilation as being between 30% to 40%, and the overall chance that the trial and transition process would succeed in allowing Pippa to receive long term ventilation at home as being about 25%. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Dr Chatwin also thought it less than probable that Pippa would be able to transition to home care. Dr Playfor said that that there was a greater than 50% chance of portable ventilation being viable but did not express a view as to the overall chances of a transition to home care being completed. The weight of these experts&#8217; opinion evidence was that it is possible but unlikely that Pippa&#8217;s management could be negotiated through transition to home care. These experts did however acknowledge that their evidence was based on the notes, their experience of other patients, and relatively brief interactions with Pippa herself, whereas the Trust&#8217;s witnesses had much more extensive experience of treating Pippa. Ms F for example told me that she had had direct dealings with Pippa on some 75 occasions. She has considerable hands-on experience of managing her desaturations. The Trust&#8217;s clinicians are adamant that there is no realistic chance of Pippa transitioning to home care. A distinctive difference in attitude to transition emerged during the hearing. The Second Respondent&#8217;s experts were more inclined to accept risk, to acknowledge that care at home could not and need not be optimal &#8211; it only had to be &#8220;good enough&#8221;. If the alternative is withdrawal of ventilation in the PICU and death, then, they contended, it is worth taking the chance that transition to home care might work even if the chance is as low as 25%. In contrast the treating clinicians were adverse to giving Pippa less than optimal care and concerned that the proposed process was based on wishful thinking rather than the reality of Pippa&#8217;s unstable respiratory condition. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">I take into account the fact that the Second Respondent&#8217;s expert witnesses might be able to form a more independent overview than those clinicians responsible for Pippa&#8217;s ongoing care who were particularly anxious to keep up the very high standards of care they have offered to Pippa to date. Nevertheless, in my judgment Dr Wallis&#8217; assessment of a 25% chance of Pippa being successfully transferred to long term ventilation at home is too optimistic. It cannot easily be reconciled with his initial view that Pippa&#8217;s condition was at the &#8220;absolute outer limits&#8221; of what can be managed at home. It is agreed that care of Pippa at the Evelina has been exceptional. She has had only a handful of respiratory infections during nearly two years on the PICU. Considerable thought, effort, and resources have been put into managing her complex respiratory problems. Even so, she has suffered numerous profound desaturations, and would have suffered more had her desaturations not been intensively and expertly managed. Against that background it is difficult to see how transfer to a less sophisticated ventilator and the removal of some of the interventions that have so far protected Pippa, could realistically alleviate her respiratory problems or lead to fewer or less profound desaturations, even with adjustments to her management. I give weight to the direct knowledge of managing Pippa that the Trust&#8217;s witnesses have and which informs their pessimism about the prospects of a trial and transition to home care. I also take into account the chances of a fatal complication occurring during the transition period, and the practical difficulties in setting up a care regime at home. Weighing all the evidence I have read and heard, I am satisfied that the chances of Pippa being able to be transferred to long term ventilation at home are remote. There is only a remote possibility of the trial and transition succeeding such that she could be discharged home. It is more likely than not that the failure of the process would be known at an early stage, perhaps even within the first two weeks, but just as it cannot be known with certainty that the process would fail, it cannot be known in advance when any failure would occur. </p>

Ms Parfitt&#8217;s view is that at home Pippa would benefit from her mother&#8217;s care such as being fed, but the undisputed medical evidence is that if Pippa were to go home she would require a gastrostomy to allow her to be tube fed. I have viewed twelve videos of Pippa submitted by Ms Parfitt. One has been given the title, &#8220;Pippa looking around the room&#8221;, but the agreed neurological evidence is that Pippa has cortical blindness &#8211; her eyes roll but she cannot see. The videos show Pippa as I found her on my visit. The overwhelming weight of expert evidence is that Pippa has no awareness of her environment, that she has not regained any neurological function since January 2019, and that she will not do so in the future. Ms Parfitt&#8217;s views on Pippa&#8217;s best interests are based on her faith and determination that by committing herself to her care, she can help her daughter to enjoy some recovery.

Even if Pippa had significantly less brain damage than she does, she might well not be able to remember her home, where she has not been for the last two years of her short life. As it is, her brain injury is much too severe to expect her even to be aware that she is in her family home. However, the key benefit being relied upon is not the house itself, but that Pippa would be living with her family. Pippa&#8217;s brother would return home and so she would be living under the same roof as him as well as with her mother and, I was told, the family dog. Other members of the family would be able to come and go from the home, rather than visiting Pippa in hospital.  </p>

The second respondent cannot do that and she has instructed independent experts. Expert medical evidence is permitted when it is necessary to help the court to determine the issues in a case. The medical expertise of Dr Playfor, Dr Wallis, Dr Chatwin, and others is of great assistance to this court, and their evidence on medical matters carries considerable weight, as does the evidence of the Trust&#8217;s clinicians, all of whom also have considerable experience in treating extremely unwell children. It is well established that the court should take account of the views of a child&#8217;s treating clinicians when assessing best interests, but how should the court treat the views of those clinicians, and of the independent medical experts, on the non-medical aspects of a child&#8217;s best interests? Dr Playfor and Dr Wallis in particular expressed views on Pippa&#8217;s best interests that went well beyond medical matters. Their views are relied upon by the Second Respondent and I address them in detail later in this judgment. In my view their opinions, and those of the treating clinicians on all matters touching on Pippa&#8217;s best interests, are welcome because their experience in caring for very ill children gives them considerable insight into how children deal with adversity, how even very disabled children interact with their families, and what a child is like when at the very edge of life.  In addition to their experience of such children generally, Pippa&#8217;s treating clinicians have specific knowledge of Pippa, and have seen her with her mother and other members of her family. The views of all the medical witnesses on the non-medical aspects of best interests carry less weight than their views on medical matters, but I do take them into account. </p>

She remained at home for about eighteen months until ANE struck again, leaving her in a PVS. She was then 3 years, 8 months old. It is not possible to ascertain her current wishes and feelings. She is not &#8220;locked in&#8221; and she is almost certainly incapable of forming conscious wishes, let alone having any thoughts about her continued treatment. I take into account that before she lost her capacity for conscious awareness, Pippa knew that she had the unconditional love and dedication of her mother, her brother, and the rest of the family. She made progress at home in their care after the first episode of ANE. This showed that she responded positively to being cared for at home.  </p>

There can be little doubt that any young child who is loved and well cared for, would want to be at home with their family rather than in a hospital. However, it is not possible to know what Pippa&#8217;s wishes and feelings would be in relation to the continuation of long term ventilation and other life sustaining treatment needed to allow her to attempt a transition to home care. Nor is it possible to impute to her any particular ethical, religious, or other values and beliefs. I would hesitate to do so for any five year old, let alone in Pippa&#8217;s own case.  </p>

Although Ms Parfitt would prefer that outcome if the only alternative were withdrawal of ventilation, her Counsel do not submit that long term ventilation on the PICU is in Pippa&#8217;s best interests.

I have set them out earlier in this judgment, but, in short, she cannot see, breathe, or communicate, she has no awareness of her environment or of interactions with others, she has no purposeful movement, she is unresponsive to visual, auditory or tactile stimulation, she is doubly incontinent and she has to receive interventions throughout the day and night to prevent potentially fatal oxygen desaturations.  </p>

The fact that she has not shown any sign of neurological improvement during that period leaves no reasonable doubt that she will remain in her current condition for as long as she lives. There is no hope of future improvement. Ms Parfitt&#8217;s evidence stands alone in suggesting both that Pippa has shown some signs of progress to date, and that she will improve in the future. Ms Parfitt&#8217;s care for Pippa after her first episode of ANE helped Pippa to improve and, as she told me, some patients may recover from brain injuries against medical expectations, but there is no evidence before me on which I could find that to be possible, let alone likely, now in Pippa&#8217;s case. The suggested adjustments to her respiratory management would not be of any benefit to Pippa were she to remain on the PICU. I am bound to conclude, on the basis of the very clear medical evidence, that the second episode of ANE has left Pippa far more disabled than her first, and that she is in a PVS from which she will not enjoy any form of recovery.  </p>

Physical interventions to prolong life should not be regarded as irrelevant to the consideration of welfare, just because the patient has no conscious awareness and cannot experience pain. Any proper assessment of welfare in a case involving life sustaining treatment ought to take into account the nature and extent of the interventions necessary to keep the patient alive. Clearly much greater weight should be given to the harm caused by those interventions if the patient can feel pain or discomfort. If Pippa were able to experience pain and discomfort when undergoing the multiple invasive procedures she undergoes each day, that would be highly material to the assessment of her welfare. But her loss of conscious awareness does not mean that those interventions can now be wholly disregarded. In Pippa&#8217;s own case she not only requires artificial ventilation, nutrition, and hydration, but, day and night, she requires other interventions including suctioning, bagging, proning, and use of the cough assist machine, as well as other less frequent interventions such as saline lavage. Both her ongoing condition and her necessary treatments in the PICU constitute burdens upon her person notwithstanding her lack of conscious awareness. In any event, the absence of pain is not the same as the absence of harm. The fact that a person has no conscious awareness does not give their clinicians, or anyone else, licence to perform procedures on them irrespective of their benefit. Compensation payments for &#8220;loss of amenity&#8221; have been made to patients who are in a coma because the law recognises that even the fully unconscious individual may experience a loss of function and a diminished quality of life even if they do not suffer pain &#8211; <span style="font-style:italic">Wise v.

It is insufficient to view her condition as depriving her of benefit. Her condition and the treatment it necessitates are significant burdens. Even if one discounted these factors in the welfare assessment, on the grounds that Pippa has no conscious awareness of them, they ought to be taken into account in the broad assessment of her interests.

Again, I accept that within the context of the frame of reference advanced by the Trust, namely continued invasive medical treatment over many years with little recuperative benefit may, for example in the manner articulated in Bland, reach the point of indignity for Tafida. The concept of human dignity as an element of the best interests analysis is however, not without difficulty. The term &#8216;human dignity&#8217; does not lend itself to precise definition and there is no universal agreement as to its meaning.

Yet Dr Playfor does not believe it is in Pippa&#8217;s best interests to be kept alive on the PICU. </p>

Her life does have worth and value which can be seen most clearly in what it brings to others, but the assessment of best interests has to be made from the point of view of the child.

In an adult or older child the concept of dignity might be linked to their exercise of autonomy and be a crucial factor in determining what is in their best interests, but that factor does not apply in the case of a young child like Pippa, whose values, beliefs, and wishes cannot reliably be ascertained or inferred. Perhaps we all think we can recognise human dignity when we see it, but there is obviously a high degree of subjectivity involved in describing someone&#8217;s life or death as having dignity. The protection of an individual&#8217;s dignity has been deployed in support of decisions to continue life sustaining treatment &#8211; <span style="font-style:italic">Raqeeb</span> &#8211; and to withhold it - <span style="font-style:italic">Alder Hey Children&#8217;s Foundation Trust v Evans</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2018/308" uk:canonical="[2018] EWHC 308 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWHC 308 (Fam)</ref> at [62]. For some, there is dignity in enduring suffering; for others, prolonged suffering constitutes a loss of dignity. There is a wide range of opinion as to what constitutes a dignified death. In the present case the Trust contends that the withdrawal of ventilation in a planned manner within the hospital and with appropriate palliative care, would allow Pippa to die peacefully with her family around her. Witnesses for the Trust told me of &#8220;chaotic&#8221; deaths they had witnessed, and which might occur if Pippa were at home, where a complication such as an uncontrollable desaturation could lead to her sudden death, perhaps without family members present. It might be said that Pippa&#8217;s dignity would be protected in the former case and lost in the latter. Her mother would strongly disagree. She says, &#8220;I could not think of anything more undignified than Pippa&#8217;s death being planned and for it to be carried out in the corner of the PICU when there is a procedure that can be done to potentially get her out of the ward and home.&#8221; </p>

Pippa has spent nearly two years on ventilation in the PICU whereas Tafida had had seven months of ventilation prior to the hearing. This is not a small difference &#8211; MacDonald J placed some reliance at [176] on the impact of more prolonged ventilation and intensive care on best interests. There was no suggestion that Tafida Raqeeb was vulnerable to the multiple life threatening desaturations that Pippa suffers, requiring specialist assistance. There was a &#8220;fully thought out and funded care plan&#8221; to move Tafida to be cared for by her family at home on a ventilator and all the experts agreed that Tafida could be ventilated at home, whereas it is currently unknown whether home care is feasible for Pippa: Tafida&#8217;s was &#8220;not a case where transport of the child remains simply a theoretical option&#8230;.&#8221; [179f]. The court in <span style="font-style:italic">Raqeeb</span> heard &#8220;on the Trust&#8217;s own evidence&#8221; that the proposal for home care was &#8220;consistent with the domestic approach in other areas to children in a similar position to Tafida.&#8221; In the present case no-one has experience of someone with Pippa&#8217;s particular constellation of problems and needs being cared for at home.  </p>

Dr Wallis and Dr Playfor cannot find any benefit in continued care in the PICU, even though Pippa would continue to be the focus of the unconditional love of her mother and wider family, and to receive exceptional family, medical and nursing care. Counsel for Ms Parfitt do not point to any such benefits in their submissions. Likewise, I cannot find any palpable or impalpable benefit to Pippa from prolonging her life in the PICU. Is it inconsistent to find that a young child with no conscious awareness suffers burdens but enjoys no benefits from the prolongation of life? I do not believe so. The profound loss of function and the daily invasion of her bodily integrity necessary to prolong her life constitute objectively identifiable burdens on Pippa&#8217;s person. Factors that might constitute some kind of benefit to an adult or young person, such as affirmation of deeply held values, or respect for autonomy, do not apply to a very young child such as Pippa. </p>

I have to consider Pippa&#8217;s best interests from her perspective. Notwithstanding the presumption that life should be preserved, it is not in her best interests that her life should be prolonged. Her welfare is my paramount concern. Pippa is in a persistent vegetative state and has been for well over a year. She has no conscious awareness and she gains no benefit from life but she daily bears the dual burdens of her profoundly disabling condition and the intensive treatment she requires to prevent it from ending her life. The evidence drives me to conclude that Pippa has no awareness of her environment nor of interaction with others, including, I am very sorry to say, her family. She receives exceptional care from her mother, others in her family, and from the healthcare professionals at the Evelina, but as all the medical witnesses have advised the court, there is no hope of improvement in her condition and no medical benefit from prolonging her life on the PICU. I cannot identify any non-medical benefits to Pippa from continued ventilation on the PICU, whether social, emotional, psychological, or otherwise. Prolonging her life on the PICU will only prolong her burdens. Continued care on the PICU is not the primary wish of her family, although they would prefer her to live rather than to have ventilation withdrawn. I take into account their wishes and views. I also take into account the view of the treating team and the independent experts. Ultimately, however, the court has to take an objective view of Pippa&#8217;s best interests.

Men and women are sociable beings. As John Donne famously remarked, "No man is an Island &#8230;" Blackstone observed that "Man was formed for society". And long ago Aristotle said that "He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god". As Herring and Foster comment, relationships are central to our sense and understanding of ourselves.  Our characters and understandings of ourselves from the earliest days are charted by reference to our relationships with others. It is only by considering the child's network of relationships that their wellbeing can be properly considered. So a child's relationships, both within and without the family, are always relevant to the child's interests; often they will be determinative.&#8221; </p>

But the role of the court is to exercise an independent and objective judgment.  If that judgment is in accord with that of the devoted and responsible parent, well and good.  If it is not, then it is the duty of the court, after giving due weight to the view of the devoted and responsible parent, to give effect to its own judgment. That is what it is there for.

In both situations it is the duty of the judge to allow the court's own opinion to prevail in the perceived paramount interests of the child concerned, but in cases at the latter end of the scale, there must be a likelihood (though never of course a certainty) that the greater the scope for genuine debate between one view and another the stronger will be the inclination of the court to be influenced by a reflection that in the last analysis the best interests of every child include an expectation that difficult decisions affecting the length and quality of its life will be taken for it by the parent to whom its care has been entrusted by nature." </p>

It is clear to me that the court should also take into account evidence about the family unit and its ability to support a child when assessing best interests, because those matters may directly affect the child&#8217;s welfare. Moreover, the court should have regard to a parent&#8217;s evidence about the character, values and wishes of their child. However, I do not discern any support in these three authorities for the submission that the wishes of a parent, or any other person, are material to the determination of a child&#8217;s best interests in a case of this kind. There is a distinction between the views of a parent as to their child&#8217;s best interests or their child&#8217;s own wishes, and the independent wishes of the parent. Counsel for Ms Parfitt submit that Holman J&#8217;s &#8220;sweeping statement&#8221; in <span style="font-style:italic">An NHS Trust v MB</span> [see para. 22 above] that parental wishes are &#8220;wholly irrelevant&#8221; to the objective assessment of a child&#8217;s best interests was &#8220;simply wrong&#8221;. I am unaware of any authority in the fourteen years since his judgment that has expressly cast doubt on Holman J&#8217;s view of the law, but I do take into account the judgment of the ECtHR in <span style="font-style:italic">Gard and others v UK</span> (above) to the effect that compliance with Art 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights does require the decision-maker to take into account the wishes of those close to the child when determining the child&#8217;s best interests, perhaps all the more so in the case of a young child whose own wishes cannot be ascertained. I also bear in mind that Ms Parfitt has an Article 8 right to family life which ought to be considered. If so, parental wishes are not &#8220;wholly irrelevant&#8221;. Nevertheless, an objective assessment of a child&#8217;s best interests should not be confused with the satisfaction of a parent&#8217;s wishes, even if the wish to care for a child at home is wholly understandable.

In striking that balance, the judge will of course take into account as a relevant, often highly-relevant factor, the attitude taken by a natural parent, and that may require examination of his or her motives. But the results of such an inquiry, must never be allowed to prove determinative.

The court evaluates the nitty-gritty detail of each option from the child's perspective. It does not prefer any particular option simply because it is put forward by a parent or by a local authority. The judge decides what is in the best interests of the child by looking at the case entirely through eyes focused on the child&#8217;s welfare and focused upon the merits and drawbacks of the particular options that are being presented to the court.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">Accordingly, the court should take into account the wishes of those close to Pippa to care for her at home but only as part of the broad assessment of Pippa&#8217;s best interests, and without detracting from the fundamental principles that Pippa&#8217;s welfare is my paramount consideration and that the assessment of best interests is made from her perspective. If it would be contrary to Pippa&#8217;s best interests to be cared for on long term ventilation at home, then it would be lawful not to accede to her family&#8217;s wishes in that regard, and unlawful to do so. Their Article 8 rights would not be contravened. Dr Playfor, Dr Wallis, and many other people might think that when a child can feel no pain, the courts should seek a solution that gives the most comfort to the child&#8217;s family, and that there is a cruelty in depriving them of that comfort and curtailing the life of the child they cherish. But the law seems to me to be clear that the benefits that Pippa has brought, and may continue to bring, to others, and the satisfaction of the wishes of a child&#8217;s family, are not the focus of the court&#8217;s attention. It is her welfare that is paramount, not the welfare of others, and her best interests that are the court&#8217;s concern.

That would subvert the framework of the established law which preserves the interests of the child as paramount. Nor do I believe Macdonald J intended to sever medical &#8216;best interests&#8217; from an overall evaluation of the child&#8217;s interests. Such an approach would be artificial. A true and meaningful assessment of a child&#8217;s best interests requires a conscientious survey of the wide canvas of his life, in which process the views of his parents concerning matters of faith, culture and more widely will be important but never a determinative factor.&#8221; </p>

Extensive medical evidence has been adduced, and there is none which shows that changing Pippa&#8217;s environment from hospital to home will lead to any improvement in her condition. She will remain unaware of her environment or of interactions with others. She would not be aware, therefore, of any change in her environment from the PICU to home and she would receive no benefit from such a change. </p>

The medical, nursing and physiotherapy care at home could not be of the exceptional standard it is in the PICU. Even if it is assumed that the very best care package could be funded and provided in Pippa&#8217;s family home, a home ventilator cannot provide the same sophisticated level of finessed support as a PICU ventilator, there could be no use of anaesthetic bagging and more advanced respiratory physiotherapy techniques, and the immediate availability of a respiratory physiotherapist would not be guaranteed. Even assuming that a tracheostomy and transfer to home ventilation somehow improved Pippa&#8217;s stability, there would be significant risk of a fatal complication occurring at home within weeks of transfer there, and without the immediate availability of the requisite equipment and skilled personnel effectively to help her. Pippa&#8217;s home care could never replicate the exceptional standards of PICU care and in that sense transfer home would, if anything, be a detriment to her. However, if it is assumed that long term ventilation at home could safely be given without the need for anaesthetic (pressurised) bagging and saline lavage, Pippa would be at least spared those particular interventions which, I have found, are amongst the invasions of her bodily integrity that do constitute a detriment to her.  </p>

Attempts are made to personalise Pippa&#8217;s environment on the PICU. As I saw on visiting her, she has her own clothes, and duvet. She is surrounded by her own toys, and coloured lights. She has music or videos played to her. Her mother is by the bedside sixteen hours a day and contributes very effectively to her nursing care. Nevertheless, inevitably there is a clinical sterility in the PICU. It is spacious but there are other children and parents in the vicinity. The PICU is a busy place with healthcare professionals constantly coming and going. At home the environment would be more personal, perhaps more peaceful.  </p>

Much of her home would in effect become a mini-hospital with a large team of specialist nurses working shifts, and therapists visiting on a regular basis. Specialist equipment such as a hoist, tilting table, specialist chair, cough assist machine, ventilator, monitors and a hospital bed would be installed, and all manner of sterilised pieces of clinical paraphernalia stored. Two nurses would be on duty at all times. She would be attached to a ventilator and monitored using electronic equipment and she would continue to require suctioning, proning and other interventions, day and night. She would be fed through a gastrostomy. She would need hygiene care as now. Pippa&#8217;s immediate environment would in many ways be similar to that at the PICU and, for her, home life would have many of the same features as life in the PICU.  </p>

Having regard to all the evidence, including the views of Ms Parfitt, I am not satisfied that home care would confer any benefits to Pippa&#8217;s welfare. Any benefits of home care that do exist would fall to her family, rather than to Pippa because she has no conscious awareness and derives no benefit from interactions with others, including family members.  That is not to say that Ms Parfitt&#8217;s advocacy of home care is motivated by her own needs &#8211; no-one could have been more selfless in her devotion to her daughter. But I have to focus on Pippa&#8217;s welfare and so it is necessary to be clear as to the benefits and burdens to her of home care, as opposed to PICU care. As to the benefits to the family, I proceed on the basis that Ms Parfitt speaks for the whole family, but I am not in a position, nor would it be appropriate, to take a view as to the other child involved in the decisions before the court, namely Pippa&#8217;s seven year old brother.  </p>

The answer is that the loss would be the continuing burdens to Pippa caused by maintaining a regime of ventilatory support and other life sustaining treatment to prolong her life, when to do so would bring her no benefit. Pippa&#8217;s welfare is my paramount consideration and continued ventilation, whether in the PICU, a transition unit, or at home, is detrimental to her welfare.

In any event, I have already found that the chances of success of both a trial of portable ventilation, and then a transition process, are remote. Furthermore, the transition process is prolonged &#8211; it would take at least six months. During that time Pippa would continue to be ventilated and treated in a hospital setting. She would not therefore have any of the supposed benefits of home care during that process. Her life expectancy on long term ventilation once at home would be uncertain but the best evidence is that it would be for some months only. It might be as short as a matter of weeks. At any time she could suffer a complication from which she could not recover, and the means available to achieve her recovery in the community would be less effective than those available in the PICU. In my judgement, balancing all the relevant factors including the views and wishes set out above, the presumption that life should be preserved, the benefits and burdens to Pippa of long term ventilation at home, the fact that she would remain without conscious awareness and would have no hope of improvement, the remote chance of the goal of home care being achieved, her limited life expectancy on home ventilation, and the long process involving continued ventilation in a hospital setting that would be required before home care could begin, I have reached the firm conclusion that it is not in her best interests to embark on a trial of portable ventilation and the transition process towards home care. </p>

Had I taken that approach I would have reached the same conclusion that long term ventilation is not in Pippa&#8217;s best interests, wherever she was cared for, and that it is not in her interests to embark on a trial of portable ventilation with a view to transferring her to long term ventilation at home.  </p>

On extubating Pippa it is likely that she will survive a very short time only. On withdrawal of ventilation there should be defined limits on the treatment provided to Pippa to allow her to die &#8211; those limits will be set out in the Court&#8217;s Order following this judgment. If ventilation is to be withdrawn then it may be that Ms Parfitt will wish that to be done at home. The Trust has told me through Dr C that extubation can be arranged to take place at home with support from trained and experienced hospital personnel to transfer her home and then to undertake the extubation process and to provide such palliative care as may be necessary in the very short time that Pippa will remain alive. As I understand it the portable ventilation necessary for transporting her home would be expected to be used only for a matter of hours. I do not know if Ms Parfitt would want to bring Pippa home for that purpose but I very much hope that with the support of the Guardian and others she can work with the Trust to agree on the circumstances of withdrawal of ventilation.  </p>

Thus, the prospect is put before the court of a supposedly &#8220;harmless&#8221; two week trial of portable ventilation which would be likely to fail but which it is claimed would at least give Ms Parfitt the peace of mind that everything had been tried that could be tried. The Second Respondent proposes that the court makes a declaration that it is lawful and in Pippa&#8217;s best interests to undergo a trial of portable ventilation at the Evelina in a two-stage process, &#8220;starting with a trial without a tracheostomy&#8221;. </p>

A trial of portable ventilation might not involve a tracheostomy but it would involve continuing ventilation on the PICU albeit for a short period. The trial would confer no benefit on Pippa. Furthermore, I am concerned that such an attempt to give Ms Parfitt some comfort would be ill-judged. Firstly, there are ongoing disagreements about how the trial should be conducted and failure of the trial could well lead to further disagreements about the merits of a re-trial with further adjustments. Secondly, Ms Parfitt does not agree that Pippa has made no progress to date and may well take a different view from the clinicians about whether Pippa had responded to the trial and whether everything had been done that could have been done. Thirdly, for the reasons I have set out in detail in this judgment, it would remain in Pippa&#8217;s best interests to withdraw ventilation even after a successful trial of portable ventilation.
