	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This case was listed for an eight day hearing commencing on 12 March 2014. On the third day following completion of the oral evidence from the allocated social worker, Ms Horrox, the parties were able to reach broad agreement on X&#8217;s future care. The only matter they have not been able to agree is the fine detail of the legal framework going forward, although all parties accept the case requires consideration by the court in about six months time.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I fully appreciate that this has been an extremely difficult decision for these two young parents. They understandably want to care for X full time but now realistically recognise that cannot happen. They have been supported in that decision by the paternal grandmother, who will be able to support the parents seeing X when he visits her home. Both the parents and the paternal grandmother have a good working relationship with Mr and Mrs SG and they will all need proper support in place to help ensure that remains an effective working relationship to benefit X.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">What has been agreed is that X should remain in the care of his current carers Mr and Mrs SG who have been his foster carers since May 2012. It is agreed that should be under a special guardianship order (SGO) in favour of Mr and Mrs SG. The local authority have filed a revised care plan which provides for more comprehensive contact between X and his birth family, leading to a regime of overnight contact based at the paternal grandmother&#8217;s home. That is agreed in principle, although there may still be some revision regarding the final detail and the support in place for the parents when I give this judgment.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">All parties have filed comprehensive written closing submissions which it was agreed would address the legal framework and issues regarding the actions of the local authority. The paternal grandmother records in her document that she is comforted by the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;we fought off adoption, suitable contacts arrangements are being made and that the Mr and Mrs SG are able to offer a loving secure home&#8217;.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although agreement has been reached I have been asked to give a judgment. The parents and paternal grandmother feel, in particular, the actions of the local authority in this case should be in the public domain in the hope that lessons can be learnt and other families in similar situations will not have the same experience they have had. I recognise that I have only heard from the allocated social worker however most of the concerns expressed occurred during the period of time she was allocated.</p>

He was born with hypertonia, suffers from a visual impairment Peters Anomaly Type 1/Anterior Dysgenesis Anomoly, has significant motor delay, scoliosis of the spine and suffers from digestive difficulties. As a result of these health difficulties he requires a standard of care that enables his particular health needs to be met. Such care includes 24 hour postural support, careful monitoring of his diet and significant care when feeding and essential auditory and tactile stimulation to ensure his emotional needs are met and to compensate for his loss of other senses. He has been placed with foster carers since May 2012 under a section 20 agreement.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">One of the central issues in this case has been the adequacy of the assessments of the parents as to their capacity to care for X. Put simply the parent&#8217;s case was that the local authority comprehensively failed in their duties to support X&#8217;s continued placement with his parents. It is submitted there has been an unfair process resulting in a catalogue of missed opportunities and inadequate assessments, which have resulted in the parents now being at a significant disadvantage in putting themselves forward to care for X. </p>

This is a  young boy who needs exceptional care due to his particular needs and the combination of the parent&#8217;s volatile relationship and the father&#8217;s inability to provide emotional care for this young boy mean his parents were unable to provide the care he needed.</p>

In her evidence Ms Horrox kept talking about <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;parallel planning&#8217;</span> but there was no evidence of any effective parallel assessment of the parents&#8217; ability to care for X at the same time as investigating alternatives in the care of the local authority. That is what parallel planning means. It is right the mother is recorded at the meeting in November as effectively supporting the long term placement of X with Mr and Mrs SG but that was without legal advice and in circumstances where there was no evidence of any alternative involving X being cared for by his family being actively discussed at that time.</p>

The care plan filed by the local authority on 6 September sought care orders and placement orders with contact with the birth family 4 times a year and made no mention of any outstanding assessments.</p>

That has never been in issue in this case and despite the difficulties there have been between the parents and the local authority the relationship between the family and Mr and Mrs SG has remained strong and all the evidence points to this remaining the position in the future. It is of note that Mr and Mrs SG attended the meeting on 4 March and the minutes of that meeting record the effective working relationship they have established. At that meeting the mother, in particular, recognised that X&#8217;s 24 hour 7 day a week care was better carried out by Mr and Mrs SG. She acknowledged she found it hard to say that and ideally she would like to care for X for shorter periods. She said she thought it was best for everyone to work together for X.</p>

In the light of the agreement reached between the parties it would be wrong to require a trial on the threshold issues in this case. The parents accept X will be cared long term by Mr and Mrs SG under an SGO and they accept the revised care plan put forward by the LA regarding their contact. There would be no demonstrable welfare purpose in such a contested hearing. On the contrary I consider such a trial would seriously risk the positive steps made by the parties in reaching agreement. Having said that I am certainly not prepared to say on a summary basis that threshold could not have been made out in this case. As I indicated in argument, Ms Wiley&#8217;s submission at the start of this hearing that the proceedings were unlawful was ambitious and was wisely not pursued. I did not hear all the evidence and whilst it looked like the issues concerning missed medical appointments and failure to provide breakfast on one occasion during the assessment did not stand up to forensic scrutiny there were other issues, such as the parents&#8217; relationship and the emotional care of X that would, if necessary, have required detailed consideration by the court as to whether the threshold criteria was met.   </p>

From the parent&#8217;s perspective it may have seemed an unfair process.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The social work statements were far too long and, in part, unfocussed and there was a lack of balance regarding their content. For example, it was extremely difficult to find the core relevant material that underpinned the threshold criteria. There were pages of generalisations which lacked any real evidential value. The lack of balance in the way some of the information in the statement was presented is illustrated by the reference in Ms Horrox&#8217;s statement referring to the police being called by the neighbours in early December as the parents were reported to be arguing. The statement records the mother being <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;dishevelled&#8217;</span> is not in the referral from the police, which is the only source of the information. Also, what the statement does not record, which is in the referral document sent by the police to the local authority, is the particular neighbours who alerted the police had been previously arrested for wasting police time for making such calls.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>That could have been an important context that should have been set out and addressed, not just left out.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Another matter that arose in the oral evidence was comments made by the mother in July 2013 regarding her concerns about the paternal grandmother. Whilst those comments were referred to in general terms in the written material the detail only came out under cross examination by Ms Stone on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian. Ms Horrox&#8217;s instincts were correct that information should have been recorded and disclosed. She was understandably concerned about the management of when it was disclosed, but appeared to be awaiting authorisation from some unspecified person to disclose it. It is right to record that the Court has made no findings about the concerns raised by the mother and no party has suggested that those concerns affect the paternal grandmother&#8217;s ability to care for X in the future during periods of contact.</p>

The statement filed by Ms Grindon after the parties reached agreement sets out what steps the local authority have taken. I am afraid its content and tone does not fill the court with confidence. I hope I will be able to record a postscript to this judgment that will address some of the issues I have raised below.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Ms Grindon attaches to the statement a hard copy of an electronic checklist that provides a structure and checklist to decisions that need to be made pre proceedings. It has &#8216;draft&#8217; written across it. There is no indication in Ms Grindon&#8217;s statement as to when it is going to be implemented. In the section entitled &#8216;Prior to Legal Planning Meeting&#8217; it states in one of the bullet points <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Any disability, need to refer to adult services or CWD at this point&#8217;</span>.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At paragraph 6 Ms Grindon refers to the mother not agreeing to the referral being made to adult services. It remains unclear which period Ms Grindon is referring to. There is evidence (such as the initial core assessment) that this was not the case, it was denied by the mother and I have seen no record of any active review of that position. Ms Horrox accepted that there could have been more creative thinking about encouraging or assisting the mother to access such support services.</p>

It was Ms Horrox first case where proceedings had been issued. She accepted there were delays in the disability assessments, delays in completing the relevant documentation for care proceedings. Those and other delays should have been picked up by those with responsibility for supervising her much earlier. </p>

Following his discussion with Ms Budden he informed the court that the local authority are undertaking a wholesale review looking at the PLO process and tracking of cases to ensure there are no systemic failures. This includes safeguarding officers regularly reviewing existing policies to ensure difficulties encountered are appropriately escalated within the management structure. A programme is also being devised to provide robust support for newly qualified social workers, which is likely to include co-working cases and enhanced supervision.</p>
