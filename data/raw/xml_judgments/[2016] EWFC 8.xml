	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AZ is just two years old.  She is the only child of Polish parents, who lived together for only a few months of her life, and were never married.  AZ was born in England and currently lives with her mother (&#8220;the mother&#8221;) in Sheffield; she enjoys regular staying contact with her father (&#8220;the father&#8221;).  There are cross-applications before the court: an application by the father for a child arrangements order, dated 2 October 2014 (which has in part been determined), and an application of the mother, dated 29 September 2015, by which she seeks permission of the court to move AZ to live with her in Poland.  </p>

The father is in a new relationship with a Polish national, and lives with her and her 10-year old child.  There are disputes about the nature of the parents&#8217; relationship, and controversy around the reasons for its ultimate demise.  The mother contends that the father was emotionally and financially abusive and controlling towards her; the father maintains that the relationship was adversely affected by the troubled mental health of the mother.  To an extent these issues are relevant to the application I must decide, and I refer to them later.  A specific fact-finding hearing was initially ordered for the court to investigate the mother&#8217;s complaints of abuse, but then vacated when the parties agreed that determination of the facts would not affect the principle, or indeed the progress, of contact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When AZ was 4 months old, the mother and AZ travelled to Poland for a holiday, returning after 8 weeks or so.  On her return, she maintains (the father does not materially dispute) that he informed her that the relationship was at an end.  After the separation of the parents in the summer of 2014, the mother spent some time in a refuge in Sheffield.  There was a hiatus in the father&#8217;s contact with AZ, and in October 2014, the father made an application for a Child Arrangements Order (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span>) seeking &#8216;shared care&#8217; of AZ, together with prohibited steps order (that the mother be prohibited from removing AZ from the jurisdiction).  It is sufficient for me to record, for present purposes, that a gradual introduction of contact was agreed, initially with supervised contact at a contact centre (ordered 16 October 2014); by July 2015 overnight contact had been agreed.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In March 2015, the mother indicated a wish to travel to Poland again to see her parents; this was not in the end feasible, as AZ&#8217;s passport had been destroyed by one or other parent in the course of an argument at the point of their separation, and the father prevaricated (so I find) over its replacement.  This left the mother not just disappointed; it fed her sense of isolation.</p>

By agreement, AZ enjoyed a 4-night visit with her father at Christmas 2015.  The paternal grandmother is present for much of the time when AZ is in the father&#8217;s care.  On 9 July 2015, an order was made that AZ live with her mother; a review was listed for October.  Whether that review of &#8216;contact&#8217; was entirely necessary or appropriate (see PD12B para.15.3), as it happens, it proved to be fortuitous because in the meantime, the mother issued an application for permanent leave to remove.  </p>

The re-crafting of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> orders from residence and contact into child arrangements orders has <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>the benefit of emphasising, absent adverse circumstances and welfare conclusions, the equality of parental responsibility that each parent has. Parents are to be expected to exercise their autonomy and to respect the autonomy of their children by entering into arrangements that plan for their children's long term welfare by providing for a meaningful relationship between each adult and each child.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.95in">[30] Where there is more than one proposal before the court, a welfare analysis of each proposal will be necessary. That is neither a new approach nor is it an option. A welfare analysis is a requirement in any decision about a child's upbringing. The sophistication of that analysis will depend on the facts of the case. Each realistic option for the welfare of a child should be validly considered on its own internal merits (i.e. an analysis of the welfare factors relating to each option should be undertaken). That prevents one option (often in a relocation case the proposals from the absent or 'left behind' parent) from being side-lined in a linear analysis. Not only is it necessary to consider both parents' proposals on their own merits and by reference to what the child has to say but it is also necessary to consider the options side by side in a comparative evaluation. A proposal that may have some but no particular merit on its own may still be better than the only other alternative which is worse&#8221;.</p>

The father believes that the mother has underestimated her eligibility to financial State benefits here, and has over-stated her case that she is likely to be more financially secure in Poland.   The father doubts that the maternal grandparents (by reason of their age, health, and the limited financial standing) will be able to offer the level of support which the mother will reasonably expect of them if she is to work. The father believes that educational and employment opportunities abound in the UK, and that many nationals from Poland, recognising this, are leaving their home country to travel here.

In the report there is surprisingly no specific reference to the<span style="font-style:italic"> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref></span> welfare checklist or indeed to its component parts.  While understandably attaching weight to the obvious concerns about the mother&#8217;s mental health and its impact (or potential impact) on her ability to care for AZ, I had a sense that the Family Court Adviser allowed this issue to assume disproportionate significance among other important relevant (but perhaps neglected) considerations.   Specifically, I felt that there was relatively limited analysis of the potential losses to AZ from the proposed relocation, and a rather uncritical acceptance of the mother&#8217;s case about the feasibility of contact.  He accepted in his oral evidence (when cross-examined) that the reduction in contact would represent a &#8220;backward step&#8221; for the father and AZ, and would have a &#8220;significant bearing&#8221; on their relationship.  He referred in his evidence to indirect contact, but adverted to the use of social media and WhatsApp &#8211; hardly appropriate for a child of AZ&#8217;s age.  He felt that AZ should not come to England for contact until she was five years old; he was concerned about the risk of the father unlawfully retaining her here (for which he did not provide any evidence as such), and seemed unaware of the protections offered by the 1980 Hague Convention.  A further matter of concern is that the Family Court Adviser used language in his report which is more redolent of the <span style="font-style:italic">Payne v Payne </span>guidance (which now has to be seen in the context of <span style="font-style:italic">K v K </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Re F</span> (above)), and which may have reflected an outdated appreciation of the current law.</p>

I think that the Family Court Adviser had proper cause for believing that the mother did not regard the father&#8217;s contact as an &#8220;absolute priority&#8221;; this was of a piece with the mother&#8217;s expressed resentment at what she saw as interference from the father (and possibly the court) in not being able simply to pack her bags and &#8216;go home&#8217;.  </p>

The practical arrangements for contact under her proposal (monthly in Poland, with holiday stays in England during holidays with effect from December 2016) are reasonable; flights are reasonably cheap, and both are in a position (and currently sufficiently motivated) to offer to contribute half of the cost.

It would plainly be in the father&#8217;s interests (and AZ&#8217;s) that he can resolve the family differences with his grandparents (the feud does not directly affect him anyway), so that he can (for as long as they live reasonably locally) see them and stay with them &#8211; with AZ &#8211; on visits to Poland.  To the mother&#8217;s credit, she has already discussed with the paternal family a proposal for them to have regular visits with AZ, a sure way of maintaining links for AZ with her father, through family.  In this way, the risk of the father being &#8216;side-lined&#8217; (<span style="font-style:italic">Re F </span>[30], see [13] above) would be significantly mitigated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">International relocation cases of this kind are always difficult for the parties, and indeed for the court.  The stakes are high.  Almost invariably and understandably the central issue polarises the parents, who find it hard to contemplate an adverse outcome of the litigation; they tend firmly to entrench themselves through their evidence in defence of their own positions.  Inevitably at the conclusion of the hearing, one parent is left feeling utterly dejected.   In a family where resources are tight, the prospect of funding international travel for continuing contact may seem daunting, even unachievable.  These features characterise this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered the competing options in the round, and having faithfully applied the paramountcy principle, I am of the clear view that it would be in AZ&#8217;s interests that her mother be permitted to remove her to live permanently in Poland.  While acutely conscious of the significant diminution of her relationship with her father which will be caused by this move, I consider that the losses to AZ were she to remain living here would potentially be much greater &#8211; deteriorating health of the mother, with a correspondingly elevated risk that the mother would become emotionally unavailable to her.  This permission is granted on the strict condition that the contact proposed by the mother is facilitated as she proposes, and as I have set out above: I regard it as important that AZ has the chance to visit her father in England, and it seems sensible to initiate that programme of visits after she has had chance to settle in her new home; a Christmas holiday visit in 2016 will fall shortly prior to her third birthday.  This frequency of contact is crucial in preserving the vital relationship which AZ currently enjoys with her father and her paternal family.  In addition to the direct contact, there will be indirect contact by way of Skype, and in due course, other means.  I will grant the necessary certificate to confirm the authenticity of the order under the regulation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents will contribute one-half each to the cost of the father&#8217;s flight to Poland each month at the cheapest available fare, and to the cost of AZ and an accompanying adult, when AZ comes to England for holiday times.   As the father is significantly in credit in relation to what he believes he should have paid to the mother by way of child support, and as he has family in Poland with whom he can probably stay from time to time in any event, the responsibility for covering any cost of his accommodation when he travels to Poland for contact will fall to him.  </p>
