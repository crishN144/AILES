JL is far from being a wealthy woman and what funds she has should be applied for her benefit and in her best interests. She lives in squalor. When Social Services initially visited her on 1 July 2013 they observed animal faeces on the carpets from her dog and three cats. Her food had a layer of mould on it, but she was nevertheless reheating and eating it, and she had neither washed nor changed her clothes for six months. </p>

The Council recently obtained a quote from Rentokil to clean the property for &#163;6,000 or &#163;7,000, but the cost is prohibitive and the Council is considering alternatives through its environmental health services. In addition, JL has an urgent need for properly functioning white goods. </p>
