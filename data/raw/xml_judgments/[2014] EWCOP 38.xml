Regrettably, AC failed to attend two recent appointments with Dr. Milne following which she had hoped to update her assessments.  It is rightly acknowledged by the represented parties that the assessment in relation to AC&#8217;s capacity to decide her residence does require updating, not least because there is no assessment currently before the court which addresses the specific proposal that AC moves from her home to reside at Pennine House.

AC&#8217;s mother, LC, is generally hostile towards professionals, and has been extremely confrontational and verbally abusive to AC&#8217;s social worker (causing distress to AC when she has witnessed this).  The relationship between AC and LC is described as &#8216;volatile&#8217; and arguments between them have occasionally caused AC to walk out of the home.  LC has historically refused to believe that AC has special needs and is opposed to professional engagement for her.  The local authority considers that AC's mother is a negative influence on AC, continuing to be aggressive towards any professionals who have entered her daughter's life. AC has described a volatile relationship with her mother, particularly when her mother has been drinking. Professionals have been advised not to go to the family home alone given the aggressive reaction of both AC and AC's mother.</p>

I was told that AC has the ability to undertake some tasks of independent living; she can operate a microwave oven, she prepares her own breakfast (though not a cooked meal), she can wash and change her clothes.  If she wants to go out, she can walk down into the local town, or go by pushbike; she knows how to catch a bus and can read a bus timetable.  She can use a mobile telephone and can send text messages.  I was told on the second morning of the hearing that AC had taken herself off that day to see her local GP; it transpired that she and her father were concerned that she was suffering from dizzy spells.  She had made the appointment; she had visited the doctor on her own before.   EC told me that in relation to general level of functioning he thought she was like an immature 12-13 year old.</p>

In those proceedings, AC&#8217;s capacity to litigate was assessed by a chartered clinical psychologist, Mr Paul Hunt, who concluded that AC&#8217;s full scale IQ was 53 and is therefore in the bottom 0.1<span style="font-style:italic"/>centile of the population; AC was allocated her own social worker, DT. Mr Hunt opined that her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">capacity for registering and retaining information verbally presented was particularly limited</span>&#8221; and concluded that AC &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">completely lacks capacity to give her legal representatives informed and reasoned instructions, because she struggles to register and retain information, and because she struggles with reasoning</span> &#8230; <span style="font-style:italic">verbal comprehension and working memory are her two weakest features</span>&#8221;.</p>

DT reports from her experience and the records (I add that I have no reason to doubt this) that AC has been the subject of emotional, physical, financial and sexual harm. This has been repeated and quite extreme.  AC has disclosed that she has had sexual relationships with numerous people in the area local to her home. She presents as vulnerable in this as indeed in other respects.   In October 2013 AC disclosed that she had recently had sexual intercourse with two men on no fewer than five occasions because the man with whom she was then in a relationship (BT) had asked her to do so; AC further reported that BT had been paid &#163;50 for this arrangement. Separately, AC had disclosed to her social worker that she was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">scared</span>&#8221; of BT, and that he had sent her threatening text messages (information from the police suggests that BT has a long and serious history of violent behaviour towards others).  Later in the same month, AC was travelling in a stolen car driven by BT who was according to AC &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">pissed</span>&#8221; at the time.  The car was involved in a collision; AC was fortunate to escape without injury but nonetheless was arrested by the police. </p>

In or around May 2014 she began a relationship with a man called DU, who is said by the police to be a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">serial criminal</span>&#8221;, with convictions for assault and actual bodily harm against a former partner.  In June 2014, AC and DU were discovered by police having sexual intercourse naked in a public park.  There are allegations that DU has assaulted AC; she has reported this but then refused to consider taking further steps in respect of these alleged assaults.   Indeed, even as recently as three weeks ago, AC visited her local police station to report that DU had assaulted her, striking her in the face, putting his hands around her throat and threatening to kill her; she said that she had ended the relationship. AC further told a family member that DU had threatened her with a knife.  Subsequently, it transpires that the relationship has not ended, and AC has continued to stay with DU.</p>

They have sought to explore options for her accommodation away from home with her parents, in order to give her an opportunity to achieve a degree of independence.  AC has repeatedly asked her social worker to facilitate this; she dislikes living with her mother and has said that she wants to live elsewhere.  In attempted fulfilment of the plan, DT has taken AC to visit a range of different placements including a shared flat, residential accommodation, and a supported living placement with another service user; AC has had the involvement of an IMCA when exploring these options.  Although AC has been generally positive about these placements at the time of visiting she has changed her mind after the visits, being vulnerable to negative influence from others. The Local Authority suspects that her views change because of the reaction of her mother and her boyfriend at any given time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have not heard detailed argument on this aspect of the case, as the parties were not in disagreement about it; but I must record my small misgivings about the conclusion reached. The distinguished line of judges sitting in the jurisdictions of the Family Division and Court of Protection who have opined on the question of what &#8216;relevant information&#8217; should inform the test of capacity in this vexed area have not sought to include within the scope of information the understanding of &#8216;P&#8217; that she (or he) may at any time change her (or his) mind about consenting to sexual relations.   Hedley J. considered that it would be legitimate to ask the question whether &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the person whose capacity is in question understand[s]that they do have a choice and that they can refuse.</span>&#8221;  The evidence in this case reveals that AC may not always fully understand that she does have a choice, and/or that she can change her mind in relation to consent to sex; given the extent to which she has been exploited this gives me considerable anxiety.  However, on the established test as it stands the professional consensus (with which I do not feel I should disagree) is that the criteria (summarised above) are established in relation to this issue at this time.  Accordingly, I conclude that AC currently has capacity in this regard although, given the fluctuating nature of her capacity in this respect, I urge those who have continued responsibility for AC to keep this issue under careful review.</p>
