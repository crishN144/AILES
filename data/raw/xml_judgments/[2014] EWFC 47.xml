	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have been a full time judge of the Family Division for almost twenty years.   In all that time, apart from cases concerning serious ill health, I have rarely heard a more harrowing case.   The hearing was a very painful one for all concerned, and I sincerely thank all parties and the professional witnesses for their attention, dignity and, to the extent possible, good humour.   I know, and deeply regret, that my decision will cause intense grief.   After hearing all the evidence and argument, and after due consideration, I am, however, clear as to the outcome, which I do not reach narrowly or marginally.</p>

I particularly thank Mr Andrew Wynne and Miss Dawn Tighe and their instructing solicitors, who have acted pro bono, that is, entirely free of charge.   As the case occupied five long days in court, as well as requiring considerable out-of-court work and preparation, they have shown great public service.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The facts and circumstances of this case are unusual, and this is a very fact specific judgment and decision.   Without any opposition by or on behalf of any party, I conducted virtually the whole hearing in public, except for a short period towards the  end when the applicants returned to the court room from the private room in which they had been watching and listening by video link.   At that point I went into private sitting so as to protect the confidentiality of their identity while, essentially, I said goodbye, although no member of the public was actually present.   I now hand down this freely publicly available, but anonymised, judgment.   In order to protect confidentiality I have deliberately omitted, or generalised (but not distorted), some detail which is well known to all parties but not significant to outcome.   I have no doubt that public reaction to this judgment and decision is likely to be polarised, with some agreeing and some strongly disagreeing with what I have decided.   It is vital to open justice and accountability in a free and democratic society that the public are enabled to know what decisions their courts and judges reach, and the reasons for them.   There is only true openness and public accountability if the public are permitted, if they wish, to see the courts and judges at work, not merely to read the account, which may be sanitised, that the judge chooses to present in judgment.   However, I direct that no report of, or reference to, this case in the press, media or elsewhere, including any form of electronic or telephonic or broadcast communication, may name or otherwise identify any of the persons listed above, or their addresses or (save to the extent described in this judgment) whereabouts.   Persons who are specifically named in this judgment may be named.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> A baby was, for good reasons, removed from his mother at the hospital of his birth, and fostered.   The identity of the birth mother was, of course, known.   Social workers, the guardian, and later apparently the court, all accepted the mother&#8217;s assertion that her then partner was the genetic father. Soon there was an unopposed care order and placement order.   When he was aged 7 months, the baby was placed for adoption with A and B who have been described as &#8220;perfect adopters&#8221;.   Three months later, A and B issued the present application to adopt him.   Another man then came forward claiming that he might be the true genetic father and it was quickly proved that he is.   Although he could not care full time for a small child himself, he strongly seeks that his son should now move to live with his sister (the child&#8217;s aunt) so that the child can grow up within his birth family and have the opportunity to enjoy a normal legal and psychological relationship with his father, paternal half sibling, and other members of his extended, genetic paternal family, throughout his life.   The father and the aunt also emphasise that they and their family are black African (the father&#8217;s choice of ethnic description); the child is of mixed race (the father&#8217;s choice of description) and clearly has dark (although not black) skin and negroid features; but A and B are both white.   The aunt has been assessed as a good parent to her own son, who is only a little older than the child, and as a suitable carer for the child.   The child is now aged 20 months.   He has lived with A and B for 13 months and is very well attached to them.   The essential question (but at this stage simplifying the issues and analysis) is whether his welfare throughout his life is better safeguarded and promoted by now leaving him with A and B, to whom he is so well attached, and making the adoption order; or by declining to make the adoption order and promoting the move of the child from A and B to live with the aunt.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is accepted by all concerned in this case that if the father had come forward and the true paternity had been established at any time up to the moment when the child was actually placed with A and B, then he would not have been placed with them and, after due assessment of her, would almost certainly have been placed with the aunt.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The agony which A and B (and their wider families) must have experienced since they first learned of these facts and the opposition to adoption last March cannot be overstated, and must have been, and still be, appalling.   Yet they have continued selflessly to care for the child with love and devotion to an exemplary standard.   They have also said that if I decide that the child should indeed move, they will co-operate and participate fully in a process of phased introductions between him and the aunt, and a phased process of moving him from them to her.   That is very selfless of them and underlines their love for the child and that they will do everything possible for him.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case and dilemma has provoked divergent professional opinions.   The front line social workers for each of  the child and A and B support the making of an adoption order.   A child psychologist who was jointly instructed to perform a &#8220;paper exercise&#8221;, but has not met anyone concerned, favours the making of an adoption order.   The Director of Safeguarding Children and Families and interim Strategic Director Children&#8217;s Services of the local authority (equivalent to the Director of Social Services in this field), who is the decision maker and who expresses the considered opinion and case of the local authority, firmly resists adoption and advocates that the child moves to live with the aunt.   The child&#8217;s guardian also strongly advocates that outcome.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 2 August 2013 a circuit judge in Sheffield placed the child in the care of Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council (Rotherham) and also made a placement order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>), authorising Rotherham to place the child for adoption.

In the unusual circumstances of this case, now that the true facts are known, all parties, including the applicants, have accepted that I should simply hear, as I have done, the genetic father and the aunt on the question whether or not an adoption order should be made, without the need to give prior leave to them to oppose the making of an adoption order.

In opposing the making of an adoption order, Rotherham (through their Director of Safeguarding Children, and by their counsel, Mr Charles Prest) have made quite clear, and the guardian advocates and supports, that if I determine not to make an adoption order and then revoke the placement order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/24/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, so that it ceases to be &#8220;in force&#8221; and the existing care order once again &#8220;has effect&#8221;, Rotherham will, under the care order, progressively move the child in a planned way to live with the aunt.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view that is a debate and territory into which I need not and should not enter.   The legal and factual situations in those cases were different.   In the present case, the child has already been lawfully and appropriately placed for adoption with A and B for over a year.   A range of rights under Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged.   There is a continuing legal relationship between the child and his paternal genetic family, with whom he has a father, grandmother, aunts, uncles and a paternal half sibling, but no current psychological relationship.   He has never met any of them.   (He also has several cousins but they are outside the definition of &#8220;relative&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/144/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 144 (1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.)   In this case the child unquestionably also has a private and family life and a home with A and B, and they with him, for which all three of them have the right to respect under Article 8.   With so many Article 8 rights engaged and in competition, it does not seem to me to be helpful or necessary in the present case to add a gloss to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of only making an adoption order if &#8220;nothing else will do&#8221;.   (Indeed Mr Nicholas Power might have argued on behalf of A and B, but wisely chose not to do so, that there could now be no interference with the Article 8 rights as between A and B and C mutually except if &#8220;necessary&#8221; within the meaning of Article 8(2).)   Rather, I should simply make the welfare of the child throughout his life the paramount consideration; consider and have regard to all the relevant matters listed in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref> and any other relevant matters; and make an adoption order if, but only if, doing so &#8220;would be better for the child than not doing so&#8221;, as <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(6)</ref> requires.   If the balance of factors comes down against making an adoption order, then clearly I should not make one.   If they are so evenly balanced that it is not possible to say that making an adoption order would be &#8220;better&#8221; for him than not doing so, then I should not do so.   If, however, the balance does come down clearly in favour of making an adoption order, then, in the circumstances of this case, I should make one.   I do not propose to add some additional hurdle or test of &#8220;nothing else will do&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I add, for the avoidance of misunderstanding, that the genetic father does not currently have parental responsibility for the child in this case.   He is not named as the father on the birth certificate (but Mr E, who was an informant jointly with the mother, is so named).   The father has not been given parental responsibility by a court order.   I have not been pressed to give him parental responsibility at this hearing, nor would I do so in view of his current lack of any psychological relationship with the child (he has never seen him) and the fateful lack of commitment which he showed between March 2013 and March 2014, as I will later describe.   Accordingly, the consent of the father (or its dispensation) is not a pre-condition to the making of an adoption order.   He is not a &#8220;parent&#8221; for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>; but he is a &#8220;relative&#8221; for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (8)</ref>).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one further &#8220;legal&#8221; matter which it is convenient to mention in this section of this judgment.   At times during the hearing, when longer term risks or advantages were being mentioned or considered, Mr Power referred, understandably but somewhat dismissively, to &#8220;speculation&#8221;.   Advocates, and also judges, often do dismiss points as speculative or speculation.   However, in relation to adoption, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> very clearly does require courts (and adoption agencies) to speculate.   It requires, as the overarching duty, that the paramount consideration must be the child&#8217;s welfare throughout his life.   This child is still less than two.   He is healthy, and his normal life expectancy may be around a further 80 years.   It is probable (but speculative) that he and his half sister, F, and his cousin, G, will outlive all the adults in this case by many years.   I am required by statute to take a very long term view, but I cannot gaze into a crystal ball.   I can only speculate.   More specifically, the court is required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref> (c) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> to have regard to &#8220;the likely effect on the child (throughout his life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person.&#8221;   Whilst that paragraph requires the court to consider only the &#8220;likely&#8221; effect, any such consideration involves speculation; and (speaking generally) the further ahead one looks (and one must envisage a whole lifetime) the more speculative such consideration necessarily becomes.   My decision in this case <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">does</span> include speculation.   That is what Parliament has told me to do.</p>

While a  teenager she had already had two children by different fathers.   They are now aged about 5 and nearly 4.   They were removed into care and have since been adopted together by one  adoptive family.   (I will refer to them later as the adopted maternal half siblings.)   The mother began a relationship with Mr E.   He, too, has had an unstable past and has a criminal record for a range of offences of both violence and dishonesty, and a recorded history of drug abuse.   In March 2013 the mother gave birth to C.   He was a normal, healthy baby, and is now a normal, healthy young child.   As had already been pre-planned by Rotherham, care proceedings were immediately commenced and the baby was removed from the mother five days after his birth and placed with foster parents.   Neither the mother nor Mr E engaged with the care proceedings nor, effectively, with the local authority.   However, the mother and Mr E jointly registered the birth on 18 April 2013, jointly stating and signing that Mr E was the father to the best of their knowledge and belief.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The child&#8217;s social worker, from the end of March 2013 and still now, is Miss Claire Fogwill.   She did not know or meet Mr E for some time.   She did, however, see the baby.   I have seen photographs taken of him shortly after his birth, including the original colour photograph which is part of the later formal application form for the placement order.   Although not black, the baby is very obviously very brown and has obvious negroid features.   These are not racist comments.   They are relevant facts.   As all concerned with the case agree, he very obviously appeared to be of mixed race.   Miss Fogwill said in her oral evidence that &#8220;when [she] first saw him as a baby he seemed obviously to have a black parent or at any rate a strong black/negroid genetic strain.&#8221;   Miss Fogwill was finally able to meet Mr E, who was in prison, on 22 May 2013.   She said that she was expecting to meet a black man and &#8220;was quite shocked&#8221; when he came into the room, since he appeared to be an entirely white man.   She asked him whether he was the biological father.   He said that he was.   (It is, of course, entirely possible that the mother had assured Mr E that he was the father, if she had never confessed to him that she had been having sex on the side with the actual father. As I have no evidence at all from either the mother or Mr E, I simply do not know.) Miss Fogwill questioned Mr E further and, according to Miss Fogwill, he told her that the baby was very brown because he, Mr E, had a Burmese mother, and added that the baby would become paler with age.   Neither Miss Fogwill nor, so far as I am aware, anyone else, took any steps to seek to verify whether in truth Mr E has a Burmese mother.   I personally do not have the slightest idea.   Miss Fogwill claimed that she was &#8220;not able to meet the mother again to ask her about paternity&#8221;, but in truth she made little effort to do so, and she made no enquiries of the mother&#8217;s own mother whose whereabouts were settled and known.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Fogwill made reports to Looked After Reviews on 12 April, 13 May and 11 July 2013.   Also present at, and chairing, these reviews was the Independent Reviewing Officer (IRO).   The minutes of the first two reviews record that the child &#8220;&#8230; is a child of mixed heritage.   His mother is white British &#8230; the social worker is, to date, unclear of father&#8217;s ethnicity and has asked [sic] father to clarify this &#8230;&#8221;   The minutes of the review on 11 July, also chaired by the IRO, record that &#8220;&#8230; the social worker has clarified with father that he is dual heritage as his mother is Burmese &#8230; the parents wished for the child to be referred to as White British, despite his presentation not reflecting this.   Father [viz Mr E] informed the social worker that he expected the child&#8217;s skin colour to change with age &#8230;&#8221;   There is no hint in those minutes that the IRO queried the account of paternity or suggested that further enquiries should be  made.   I do not make a criticism of the IRO for she has not been involved in this hearing and has had no opportunity to state her own point of view, but I accept the point made by Mr Prest that the responsibility of Miss Fogwill appears to have been shared with others.   Miss Fogwill has, however, accepted that she made a serious error in swallowing the explanation of the Burmese mother (i.e. the child&#8217;s grandmother) and not investigating paternity further, and she has apologised from the witness box to both the true paternal family and the applicants for adoption.   Miss Fogwill&#8217;s formal report to the court dated 28 June 2013 in support of the application for a placement order depicts a photograph of the child as I have already described, and refers to his having black hair and brown eyes and a dark complexion.   It continues that the mother is white British and Mr E is half white British and half Burmese as his mum was Burmese and father white British.   &#8220;[C&#8217;s] skin is quite dark however [Mr E] states that as [C] becomes older his skin will become paler.   [Mr E&#8217;s] skin is white.&#8221;</p>

In her report dated 19 July 2013 she describes Mr E as &#8220;White British Burmese&#8221; and says at paragraph 12 &#8220;[C&#8217;s] paternal grandmother is Burmese, although I understand his father [viz Mr E] views himself as white British.   At present [C] has the appearance of a baby who is not white British &#8230;&#8221;    As I understand it, the guardian herself never actually met either the mother or Mr E.   So she merely accepted the story via the social worker.   She said that she only ever saw a blurred black and white photocopy photograph of the child.   She said that she visited the baby once at the home of the foster mother.   However he was asleep, face downwards, with his head largely covered.   She only saw one arm sticking out.   The arm looked brown but she did not examine the baby further.   Mrs Hassall accepted her share of responsibility.   She said during her oral evidence:  &#8220;I make a heartfelt apology we are in this situation.   I feel desperately sorry for all those involved.&#8221;</p>

I do not know whether the circuit judge saw the original with the colour photograph which, as I have described, very clearly depicts a brown child of mixed race with negroid features; or whether he saw a black and white photocopy, one version of which I have seen, which shows the child&#8217;s face as a barely distinguishable large black blob like a large blob of spilt ink.   At all events, the judge appears not to have raised any question about true paternity at the, probably short, hearing when he made the care and placement orders.   So a last opportunity seriously to question paternity and consider obvious avenues of further enquiry was lost.   I accept, of course, that such enquiries might not necessarily have uncovered the true father, but they well might have done, for the affair between the true father and the mother was well known in the community and circle within which they lived.   The mother&#8217;s own mother certainly knew the true facts, as will later appear.</p>

A and B had already been thoroughly assessed by the adoption social worker, Miss Elizabeth Lancaster.   They were entirely suitable to adopt a young child and in due course were matched with C.   Miss Lancaster said during her oral evidence that nothing alerted her to the possibility that C had a black father.   &#8220;It was discussed that the paternal father was half Burmese.&#8221;   She appears to have accepted that position without further enquiry; but it was not her responsibility to make further enquiries, since she was (as she remains) the social worker for A and B, not for the child.</p>

Miss Fogwill was shocked and surprised by this news.   She and a more senior colleague interviewed the father on 14 March 2014.   She then immediately arranged for DNA sampling and testing of the baby and the man, and a report dated 24 March 2014 established a 99.9999 per cent probability that he is indeed the father.   All parties including A and B accept that he definitely is the father and the case has since proceeded on that basis.   The father is a black African who was born and brought up in that continent.   He is now aged 32.   His own father died when he was young.   He himself travelled to England in 2001 and claimed asylum.   He has lived here ever since and has indefinite leave to remain.   He is the seventh of a large family of eight children.   His own mother, now aged 64, now lives in the Midlands.   Two brothers live in the Midlands and South Wales.   A sister lives in East Anglia, and his youngest sister, the aunt, lives in the Home Counties.   The brothers and sisters in England and Wales have between them eight children who are paternal first cousins of C.   Some of them are of mixed race, having also a white parent.   The father&#8217;s three other siblings live variously within Africa and Canada.   There is, therefore, a considerable extended paternal family, mostly located within England and Wales.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For about 10 years the father has been in a relationship with Miss D (who is white) whom he describes as his partner.   Miss D has a child by another man, and that child is now aged 10.   She has a daughter, F, by the father and that child was born in May 2012 and is now aged 2&#189;.   The father and Miss D spend a lot of time together and the father frequently stays at the home of Miss D; but he has always chosen to retain also his own council flat where he actually lives.   He says, and I accept, that he visits the home of Miss D almost every day where he very regularly sees, and is in a good fatherly relationship with, their daughter F.</p>

That probably explains his evasiveness about the circumstances.   The evidence of the father about his relationship with the mother was conflicting, and he has told many lies or half truths, both to Miss D and to his sister (the aunt) and within these proceedings, including when he first gave oral evidence.   Miss D, on the other hand, was a very straightforward and transparently honest witness.   A combination of the oral evidence of Miss D, Miss Fogwill&#8217;s evidence and contemporary notes, and the final oral evidence of the father (after he was recalled and certain records were put to him) satisfies me that the essential facts are as follows.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst continuing his relationship with Miss D, the father also had a sexual relationship with the mother over several months in the spring of 2012 through to at least the end of June, around which time the child was conceived.   The mother visited and stayed at his flat several times a week and sexual intercourse took place regularly and frequently.   During part of the time Mr E was in custody.   The father did not use any contraception and he said that he was not aware of the mother using any.   Miss D soon became perfectly well aware of what was going on, for it was the subject of gossip and reports amongst her acquaintances.   Miss D had known the mother for several years since the mother was at school with Miss D&#8217;s younger sister.   There was also at least one occasion in the local pub when Miss D effectively saw what was going on with her own eyes.   She later confronted the father.   He denied it, but she knew he was lying to her.   Miss D also knew that the mother was sleeping with someone else (additional to Mr E and the father) as well.</p>

She showed me some photographs of the baby.   I could not tell whether he was white or black or mixed race.

He could not of course be certain, since he knew also that the mother had had other sexual partners.   But she told him, in effect, that the baby was half black and that he had been her only black partner.   Short of DNA testing, the likelihood was obvious.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He took no action at all.   He showed no real interest in the baby, or even much interest in seeing him, although he did ask the mother if he could do so.   I do not know why not, but it was probably due, at least in part, to his continuing stance of denial to Miss D.   Whatever the reason, it is a significant part of the history of this case that for almost a year the father showed no interest at all in, or commitment at all to, the child, and denied rather than asserted that he was the father.   So as well as the responsibility of Rotherham, the guardian, and possibly the court, for not investigating paternity further, a very heavy responsibility for events lies upon the father.   If he had shown any real interest in the baby and put himself forward in any way as the likely father, then the true facts would probably have emerged much earlier and the baby would never have been placed with A and B.</p>

His case is that he learned this for the first time at the beginning of March 2014.   He said that he saw the mother&#8217;s mother in the town.   He asked her where the child was.   The mother&#8217;s mother said that he was in care and that the mother had lied to him.   He then immediately spoke to and told his sister, the aunt, and at his request she immediately contacted the social services.   He says that in the first weeks after the birth he had indeed asked the mother if he could see the baby and she had fobbed him off by saying that the baby was staying with her mother or sister.   She also misled him into thinking that she was caring for the baby by asking him on a few occasions for money for nappies.</p>

This includes the following:  &#8220;1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> found out might be in care about a month after born.&#8221;   Miss Fogwill fairly said that she could not now remember the precise words used, but she stood by her note.   The father remained adamant that he did not say, and would not have said, that.   He remained adamant that the first time he found out the baby was in care was the same time he contacted social services, viz March 2014.   He said there must have been a misunderstanding between him and Miss Fogwill with regards to dates.   On behalf of the father, Miss Caroline Ford fairly makes the point that although he now speaks good English his first language is Shona.   Further, it is certainly the case that he is a very quietly spoken and unassertive man whose answers, at any rate in the witness box, were not always easy to hear and follow without checking.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have to decide whether I am satisfied on a balance of probability that the father knew that the baby was in care as early as about April 2013, as the local authority allege; or only in early March 2014, as he himself claims.   On this issue there is force in the point Miss Ford makes on the third page of her written closing submissions dated 21.11.14, and as she elaborated orally.   The father&#8217;s case is that he first learned that the baby, of whom he was likely to be the father, was in care in early March 2014.   He immediately contacted the social services (initially via his sister) and has, unquestionably, strenuously sought the move of the child to live with him or his family ever since.   It was only later that he learned that the child had actually been placed for adoption or that there was a current application to adopt him.   So, as Miss Ford puts it, his conduct by contacting social workers in March 2014 can only be  explained by his having only recently learned that the child was in care.   No other event or trigger has been identified as to why, having done nothing and shown no interest for so long, he suddenly did then make the contact which he did.   Miss Ford asks, rhetorically:  Assuming that he had known that the child was in care from, say, mid or late April 2013, why did he suddenly do something and with such resolve in March 2014?   She submits that the activity in and after March 2014, for which there is no known other explanation, is really only consistent with his having recently learned in March 2014 that the child was in care.</p>

At the same time as now admitting that soon after the birth the mother herself had told him that he was the father, he maintained his account, apparently convincingly, that he only knew that the baby was in care almost a year later, and said that the social worker must have misunderstood him.   I also accept the force of Miss Ford&#8217;s point as described in the previous paragraph.   There was room for misunderstanding, and I am not satisfied on a balance of probability that the father knew that the baby had been taken into care earlier than early March 2014, when he took action at once.</p>

The particular advantage to C if he lived with her would be that he was living and being brought up in the same home as, and in daily close contact with, his half sister, F.   The assessment of Miss D, also dated 8 September 2014 and done by the same social worker, was very positive.   The conclusions, now at bundle page D 82, include the following:  &#8220;[D] was found to be very child focussed and had a current knowledge of child development and showed an incredible level of insight to the emotive issues of this situation for all involved &#8230;   From the time spent with [D], it is my opinion that she does have the ability to meet another child&#8217;s holistic needs.&#8221;   During the hearing the father and the aunt both stayed at the home of Miss D.   They discussed the issues during the preceding weekend.   They reached a joint decision (which I consider was a wise and appropriate one) that the aunt rather than D would be put forward as the proposed carer, with D remaining &#8220;in reserve&#8221; (my phrase, not theirs) as an alternative carer if some reason later emerged which ruled out the aunt or made her inappropriate as a carer.   No such reason has emerged.   Accordingly, the consistent case which has been presented at the hearing by all three of the father, the aunt and Miss D is that adoption should be refused and that the child should move to, and make his permanent home with, the aunt.   I am quite satisfied that there is a good relationship between the aunt and Miss D.   The aunt and Miss D both regard Miss D and her children as part of the paternal family.   Miss D&#8217;s own 10 year old daughter has, for instance, stayed with the aunt at her home in the South.   They have interacted well throughout the hearing.   There is no contest, and there are no barriers, between them.   For so long as the aunt continues to live in the South, a considerable journey away by public transport, there may be practical difficulties about very frequent contact between C, if he lives with his aunt, and Miss D and F; but there would be no emotional or other barriers between Miss D and the aunt.</p>

It records &#8220;A and B recognise that the area in which they live is predominantly white British and English speaking and raised concerns that although they promote acceptance their wider community may struggle to accept a child with a different ethnic background &#8230; and raised concerns that a child that did not mirror A and B&#8217;s own identity [both white British] may face discrimination &#8230; accepting a placement of a child who differs from their own ethnicity may be potentially difficult for the child in future &#8230;&#8221;   This note of reservation about accepting a non white British child does not influence me one iota in the circumstances as they now are.   A and B themselves have no discriminatory thoughts or beliefs.  They lovingly accepted C when he was matched with them despite his obvious mixed race appearance.   They were given and accepted the Burmese grandmother explanation, and read books to him about Burma and promoted his &#8220;Burmese&#8221; ethnicity and heritage until they learned the true fact of his African ethnicity and heritage.   They now read books to him about, and promote the heritage of, the country from which his father came.   Whatever A and B indicated at the time of pre-placement assessment, as recorded in Miss Lancaster&#8217;s report and briefly quoted above, the fact that C has a black African father and mixed race appearance simply is not an issue at all for A and B now.</p>

She appeared to be thoughtful and flexible, and insightful and understanding of the issues in this case.   She said that she has prepared her own son, G, for the possibility that he might be joined by another, younger, boy.   She talks to G about C, and G would not be surprised if C became part of their family.   She said that G himself is a lovely boy, very caring and very sharing, who plays very well with other kids.   She paid generous and sincere tribute to A and B although of course she has never met nor seen them.   She said she was just so grateful for what they have done.   It is beautiful.   They have taken very good care of him.</p>

First, the references in Miss Lancaster&#8217;s answers and approach, to C not having experienced the things social services would remove a child for.   That, of course, is correct.   He is not a child who has been neglected, abused or otherwise ill-treated.   That, however, is a somewhat narrow approach to the circumstances and situation in the present case, in which what is under consideration is not removal from, but uniting with, the genetic paternal family.   Second, in common with other professional witnesses in this case, and in line with my own experience of similar evidence over many years, Miss Lancaster makes the point that the more moves a child has, the harder it becomes to settle.   This child was fostered with good foster parents within  five days of birth and has, so far, had one move, from them to A and B.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The child&#8217;s own social worker, Miss Fogwill, also clearly feels that he should not now be moved.   At the close of her evidence in chief she said she had &#8220;found herself pulled in both directions on outcome&#8221;, and she did not at that stage come down either way.   (That was a perfectly tenable position for her to take.   Since she already knew the position of her department, from the written statement of the Director, Ms Jane Parfrement, it was not incumbent upon her, as the front line social worker, to express a view, although she was entitled to do so.)   However, during questions from Mr Wynne, who was hoping she might come off the fence in favour of his client, the aunt, Miss Fogwill effectively made clear that, on balance, she favours adoption.   She said that the parenting qualities of the aunt, although good, are &#8220;not to the same standard as the adopters give to him.&#8221;   She said that the adopters are very child focussed and there is not the same kind of atmosphere in the aunt&#8217;s home.   I mention, however, that it was not Miss Fogwill but Mrs Akinson who carried out the detailed and in-depth assessment of the aunt, over six full day visits, and Mrs Atkinson reports that the aunt <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">is</span> very child focussed.   Miss Fogwill said that the aunt has not been tried and tested, and asked, can she manage the trauma of a potentially very distressed child?   She did say, however, that she &#8220;sees the advantages of the birth family.&#8221;   In answer to some questions from Mr Prest, Miss Fogwill said that the adopters and the aunt have different parenting styles and the adopters&#8217; style is what C knows.   A and B go beyond what she would expect of them.</p>

It is  important to stress that in her written statement Ms Parfrement adopted an approach (see in particular at paragraphs 12 and 15) that the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> requires that an adoption order can only be made if it is necessary and nothing else will do.   She said at paragraph 11 that were she simply to have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages, she might well say that the matter was finely balanced and that she would probably gratefully accept the opportunity offered by the court not to make a final recommendation at that stage.</p>

But it is not a fantasy in this case (as it would be for most adopted children) but a reality that his birth family could give him proper care.   She said that it is not at all uncommon within the African culture for children to be brought up by an aunt or the extended family.   If he was brought up by his aunt he would not see that as rejection by his father.   In any case his father has not rejected him.   He has come forward and is seeking a relationship with him.   Ms Parfrement did not accept that there is a risk of  significant harm to him from a move, although she accepts that there are some risks.</p>

She commits to commissioning and funding appropriate work and services for the aunt and C if he moves to her.   In the light of that commitment from Ms Parfrement herself, I will assume that if C does move to his aunt no reasonable expense will be spared in this case in giving all the training and support, and putting in all the resources reasonably necessary, to minimise the impact of a move upon C and maximise its prospects of a good and securely attached outcome.</p>

	    <num>70.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By an order made on 26 August 2014 a circuit judge authorised the instruction of a named child psychologist, Dr Ben Harper, to carry out a &#8220;paper based assessment&#8221; in accordance with certain questions annexed to the order.   The psychologist was to be jointly instructed by all parties (viz at that stage the applicants, Rotherham, the father and the guardian, the mother having been served but not participated throughout), with the solicitor for the guardian being the lead solicitor.   In fairness to the judge, I should stress that all parties were agreed on this approach and to some extent she was being asked merely to approve that which they had already agreed.   But I have to say that I do not consider that a &#8220;paper based&#8221; exercise of this kind was appropriate or justifiable, and certainly not &#8220;vital&#8221; as the order stated.   It is not suggested that C currently has any psychological or psychiatric or developmental disability, disorder or delay.   He is a normal, psychologically healthy young child.   The psychologist was not asked to see, and did not see, anyone concerned in the case.   His report is, therefore, entirely theoretical; and the court order and the report perpetuate the regrettable historic tendency of adding the expertise of a psychologist giving a theoretical opinion to the expertise of social workers and a guardian, and indeed the experience of specialist family judges.   Although the facts and circumstances of this case are unusual, in that it contemplates a possible move of a child from carers by whom he is very well cared for and with whom he is very well attached, almost any decision with regard to a child has an emotional and psychological component and effect.   <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1</ref> of both the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> both require courts and others to assess and weigh emotional and psychological effects.   &#8220;Paper based&#8221; exercises of this kind are neither necessary nor justifiable nor, frankly, affordable.   An actual assessment (seeing all concerned) by a psychologist might be enormously helpful in many cases, but that is now a mere pipe dream in our under-resourced family justice system.   I stress that I do not say this in any way critically at all of Dr Harper.   He merely did what he was asked and instructed to do.</p>

He said that any further assessment by him seeing the parties (which he could not complete until sometime in January 2015) would create delay and should only take place if absolutely necessary.   He himself did not advocate it, and no party at the final hearing invited me to adjourn for the purpose, although I had specifically stated at the outset of the hearing that I remained open to possibly adjourning the hearing and, if asked to do so, would finally decide that in the light of all the evidence.</p>

Dr Harper said that by 20 months the &#8220;blueprint&#8221; is probably very &#8220;embedded&#8221; in C.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Harper gave one answer that I found rather curious and difficult to accept.   Ms Parfrement had written at paragraph 9(7) of her statement (now at bundle page C 68) that a benefit of C living with the aunt or Miss D is that C would grow up with his father also being able to play a role in his life.   Dr Harper&#8217;s comment on that was that &#8220;I do not see that contact with a father who is unable to meet the psychological needs of a child as a full time carer should be used as a reason for a family placement.&#8221;   Many fathers, or indeed mothers, who are unable to meet the needs, including psychological needs, of a child as a full time carer, may, and do, nevertheless have much to contribute to a child on a less than full time basis or by forms of contact.   If C is able to move to the aunt and form a secure attachment with her, it could be a bridge to a relationship with his father which, in my view, could be beneficial.   The reason given by Dr Harper for his above comment appeared to be that &#8220;the child may later feel a sense of rejection if he learns that neither of his parents was able to meet his needs as a full time carer.&#8221;   Later he said that &#8220;psychological rejection from his birth parents would not necessarily be placated by placement with an aunt.&#8221;   I understand that point &#8211; it would not necessarily be placated; but I do not understand why it should be made worse.   If he grows up with A and B he may also later feel a sense of rejection by his parents, and Dr Harper himself said that at middle childhood he is likely to be distressed by the fact that he is not placed with his birth family (meaning one of his parents).   I cannot see that any sense of rejection by his parents is likely to be greater if he is living with his aunt rather than with A and B, and to my mind it is likely to be less if he is living with his aunt and having regular contact and a relationship with his father.   He would know that he had not been rejected by his father; in any event, living with someone such as an aunt is part of the cultural pattern of his African family.   So I disagree with Dr Harper&#8217;s view and comment that the possibility of a relationship and contact with his father is not <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">a</span> reason for living with his aunt.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs Sheila Hassall, the guardian, was also clearly told by me that she did not need to make any recommendation in advance of the hearing, but she, too, chose to do so, feeling &#8220;able&#8221; to do so.   Her written report dated 12 November 2014 is a very careful and thorough analysis over many pages of the issues and competing factors and considerations in this case, and is not easy to summarise.   In essence, she considered that the long term advantages of living within, and in contact with, his paternal birth family outweigh the risk of harm to him from a move now from the applicants with whom he is securely attached.   At paragraph 26 she made clear that the factor of his African heritage weighed more with her as a factor than it did with Dr Harper, who was rather dismissive of it in both his written report at paragraph 6.7.2 (bundle page D 101) and in his oral evidence, when he said that in his opinion it is a popular myth that some people will feel more secure and attached with people of the same ethnic mix.   He said that there is no evidence to support that.   Mrs Hassall, on the other hand, focussed not on the mere point of &#8220;the same ethnic mix&#8221; but on the actual shared heritage with his African family of origin.   She wrote &#8220;His African heritage is less accessible in his current placement.   In spite of the outcomes referred to by Dr Harper, I think that it has to be better for [C] to have relationships of quality with family members who share his African heritage and can promote his awareness of his origins on a day to day basis, rather than carers who provide this knowledge second hand, via resources through literature and the media.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her oral evidence at the conclusion of the hearing, and after all the other evidence, the position of the guardian remained unchanged.   At the very end of the hearing, and after all other submissions, I expressly asked Miss Alison Hunt, on behalf of the guardian, whether there was any change in the guardian&#8217;s position or the firmness with which she held it.  Upon the express instructions of the guardian, who was present, Miss Hunt told me, as the guardian&#8217;s last word, that &#8220;it is the clear, considered opinion of the guardian at the conclusion of all the evidence and all the argument that an adoption order should not be made and that C should move, under the revived care order, to live with his aunt.&#8221;   The word &#8220;clear&#8221; was used with deliberation and care.   Miss Hunt had also written in her own Closing Submissions that &#8220;The guardian considers there would be significant benefits for C in placement with [the aunt].   There are profound long term benefits &#8211; personal, emotional, psychological, social and cultural.&#8221;   I asked Miss Hunt expressly to confirm with the guardian the use of the words &#8220;significant&#8221; and &#8220;profound&#8221; in that passage, and the guardian expressly did so.   During her oral evidence Mrs Hassall had made clear that she is not approaching the case from a test of necessity or nothing else will do.   She is simply forming an opinion as to which is the better outcome for C, and in her view it is to move to the aunt.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During her oral evidence the guardian said that C has a natural family who have been assessed as able to care for him (viz the aunt).   His longer term needs include a need to be with his family of origin if that is possible.   In the short term A and B are meeting his needs.   The concern of the guardian is that when he becomes older and learns that he could have had, but has been deprived of, a life with his natural family, that will have a negative psychological impact, although she recognises that moving him will be a very difficult experience and may cause significant emotional harm.   The guardian said his ethnicity may be an important issue for him, but is not her main reason.   The point is that A and B are not his natural family.   His natural family can, at first hand, share their and his history and experiences with him.   His father and aunt were born and brought up in their country in Africa and can directly share their and his ethnicity and origins.   The guardian, who has met the aunt, considers her an intelligent and capable woman and agrees with the assessment by Mrs Atkinson.   The guardian expressly agreed with the point made by Ms Parfrement at paragraph 13(1) of her written statement, now at page C 70, that &#8220;the fact that [C] seems to be securely attached to A and B means that there is a strong likelihood that he will be able to form a similar attachment with a different carer.&#8221;   This is consistent with the evidence also of Dr Harper with regard to the embedded blueprint.   Mrs Hassall also expressly agreed with the comment in paragraph 16(3) of Ms Parfrement&#8217;s statement that &#8220;whilst recognising that this has been an adoptive placement and not a foster placement and so the relationship between A and B and [C] may be qualitatively different, social care often, in practice, have to move children of this age on from one set of carers to family or adopters and, in most circumstances, is able to do so successfully.&#8221;   Mrs Hassall pointed out that C has no disabilities or special needs which might require especial parenting skills.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have read and re-read those &#8220;balance sheets&#8221; and all the written closing submissions, and I have all the points listed there in mind.   Judges frequently use the language of &#8220;balance&#8221; and &#8220;balance sheets&#8221; (and I do myself.   I think lists such as the above are indeed very helpful).   But the analogy with balancing scales may be misleading.   When weights or objects are put on either side of a scale, their individual precise weights are known, or ascertainable.   You can put four objects in one scale pan and seven in the other, and the scales will come down one way or the other due to the aggregate of the individual precise and ascertainable weights on each side.   In a case such as this, however, none of the factors have precise weights.   All that may be said of any individual factor is that, as a matter of judgment, it is more or less important or weighty than another.   Mr Power&#8217;s list is long on the advantages of adoption and short on the disadvantages.    It is not, however, the number of factors which counts but their respective importance.   The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> does not itself use the language of balance.   It requires the court to &#8220;have regard to&#8221; all relevant matters, including those specifically referred to in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref>.   The effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(6)</ref> is that the court must then make a judgment (applying <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> and the paramountcy of welfare throughout the child&#8217;s life) whether making  (in this case) an adoption order &#8220;would be better for the child than not doing so.&#8221;</p>

His age, and the length of time he has been with A and B (now 13 months), is a very significant matter in this case.   The older he is and the longer he has been with them, the more potentially damaging it is to move him.   It is, however, possible to move children at his age, and social workers frequently do do so, as Ms Parfrement and the guardian both said.   It is relevant, as Dr Harper stressed and Ms Parfrement acknowledged, that his situation is not the same as that of a child who has been fostered for 13 months.   Foster parents are trained to avoid becoming closely attached, as they know the child must or may move on.   A and B were trained even before placement to form lasting attachments, and they have done so.   But as Dr Harper and other professional witnesses also said, the blueprint of attachment and security is embedded in him and (the paradox) he may be less damaged by a move now than if one had not been.   His personal background is the experience of 7 months of high quality care by his foster parents, and 13 months of exceptional care by A and B and their extended families, with all of whom he is well integrated.   It is, however, also part of his genetic background that he has a paternal family who do wish, and are able, to provide a good and secure home for him.   It is one of his characteristics that he is of mixed race with a black father, and does display obvious mixed race and negroid skin colour and features.</p>

His feelings currently are undoubtedly to remain living in the familiar home with the familiar people,   A and B, with whom he is so securely attached.   But those are current feelings with regard to the here and now.   A child of his age still lives for the present (infused by his past experiences).   He can have no concept of adoption, or of the future, or of any of the matters I have to consider.</p>

So does C.   He does have a need to be brought up in a way which acknowledges, respects and nurtures his ethnicity and his black African heritage.   He is a healthy child of apparently normal, healthy, age appropriate physical, mental and psychological development.   As the guardian commented, he has no disabilities or special needs which might require especial parenting skills.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">(Paragraph (e)). C has not to date suffered any harm, within the meaning of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.   He did have to move from his foster family to A and B at the age of 7 months.   It is clear that he was able to attach very well to A and B, and there is no report or evidence that he suffered any discernible or lasting harm as a result.   There is harm which he is or may be at risk of suffering.   If he is moved from A and B it is predictable and likely that he will suffer short term emotional and psychological harm, and certainly distress, as his attachments to them are broken.   The severity and permanence of any harm or damage is less predictable.   Dr Harper considers it would be &#8220;significant&#8221;.   Ms Parfrement did not agree that it would necessarily be &#8220;significant&#8221;.   All professionals agree that the already embedded blueprint is likely to enable him better to attach to the aunt than if he had not already experienced such good attachment and security, which tends to mitigate or lessen the risk of enduring or significant harm.   There is also harm which he is at risk of suffering if he remains with A and B.   This is more speculative but must be factored in to the decision.   That is the harm which he may suffer in his adolescence, teenage years, or adult life as he increasingly learns and appreciates that he is an adopted child who could have been brought up within his own genetic paternal family, who wanted to care for him and who, in the case of the aunt, was well able to care for him.   It is possible that there could be some contact, indirect or possibly even direct and face to face, between him and members of the paternal family.   It is uncertain whether the long term effect of such contact would be to mitigate the harm or, indeed, to intensify it as he acquires a growing awareness of what he has missed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">(Paragraph (c)). This ties in with consideration of the likely effect upon C throughout his life of having ceased to be a member of his original family and become an adopted person.   The point needs to be made that, whatever the outcome of this hearing, he has already ceased to be a member of his maternal original family.   He does, however, have a real and entirely viable opportunity to become a psychological member of his paternal original family.   I accept the point made by Mrs Hassall, and referred to in paragraph 83 above, that when C becomes older and learns that he could have had, but has been deprived of, a life with his natural paternal family, that is likely to have a negative psychological impact on him.   He could be told (in sensitive and age appropriate ways) that his father showed little interest in him during the first year of his life.   But he would need also to know (if only by one day reading this judgment, if he wishes to do so) that from the age of about 12 months his father was fighting hard for him to be cared for within his original paternal family.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">(Paragraph (f)). C&#8217;s relatives include his father (for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref>, see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (8)</ref>), his aunt (and the several other aunts and uncles), his paternal grandmother, and his half sister, F.   Currently he has a legal relationship with all of them but no psychological relationship with any of them.   His father and the aunt have a very clear and strong wish regarding him that he be brought up within, and in contact with, his extended paternal family.   The aunt, who is a relative, does have the ability and willingness to provide him with a secure home and environment in which he can develop, and strongly desires to do so. She can be given, by or through Rotherham, the intensive training and support she would need as C transfers his embedded attachments from A and B to her.   If he lives with the aunt, there is a high likelihood of psychological relationships being created and then continuing between C and his father, his half sister, F, his paternal grandmother and other paternal relatives, and these relationships are likely to have real value to him.   Although A and B have said that they are open to considering forms of contact, including possibly direct contact, between C and members of the paternal family, including his father, such contact is likely to be infrequent, closely supervised, and not such as to create any real psychological relationship.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A particular point does arise concerning half siblings.   As well as his paternal half sister, F, C does have two other genetic half siblings, being the adopted maternal half siblings.   These are no longer in any legal relationship with him, having been adopted, but the genetic connection of course remains.   A and B have said that they are in communication with the adopters of those two children and that they envisage that if C is adopted by them there may be some contact between him and those adopted maternal half siblings.   It is highly unlikely that there could be contact between him and them if he moves to live with the aunt, since (although they have not been asked) the adopters (about whom I know nothing) of those two children might feel that any such contact was a threat to their confidentiality and security.   The loss of some possible occasional contact with his adopted maternal half siblings is, in my view, clearly outweighed by the gain of less structured and more natural relationships within the extended family with his paternal half sister, F.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case clearly requires taking both a short term and a long term view.   C is currently very well placed with &#8220;perfect adopters&#8221;.   They are a well trained couple with whom he is very well attached.   He is of mixed race.   They are both white and share with him that half of his ethnicity.   A and B are &#8220;tried and tested&#8221; as has been said.   His aunt and the principal members of the paternal family are black and share with him that half of his ethnicity.   The aunt is a single person.   She has not been &#8220;tried and tested&#8221; as a carer for C, but she has been observed as a carer of her own child, G, and thoroughly assessed as entirely suitable to care long term for C.   There would be likely to be short, and possibly long term harm if he now moves from A and B to the aunt, but that is mitigated by his embedded security and attachments with A and B, and can be further mitigated by specialist training and support for the aunt, which she will gladly accept.   The unquantifiable but potentially considerable advantage of a move to the aunt is the bridge to the paternal original family.   </p>

Rotherham, in whose care C again now is, must engage intensively with all the relevant parties, and file and circulate within three weeks a written care plan setting out their plan for C and how they will implement, in the least damaging way, the process of his move from A and B to the aunt. It is impossible for me or any court to micro-manage that plan and process, and inconsistent with the respective roles and duties of the local authority and the court that I or the court should attempt to do so. If (as I sincerely hope will not be the case) any further resort to the court is necessary, application must be made locally to the designated family judge in Sheffield. A copy of this judgment must be given to, and read by, the Independent Reviewing Officer and all social workers having any continuing role with these families.</p>

But I have not, in the end, found it difficult; and, as I said at the outset of this judgment, it is not one which I reach narrowly or marginally.   At the directions hearing in Leeds, when I had read few of the papers (and there were several key documents still to come) and before I had heard any of the oral evidence or argument, I described this as a finely balanced case.   By the end, I do not think that it is.   I am clear that the welfare of C throughout his life decisively requires that he is not adopted but moves to live with the aunt.   It is my duty to make that welfare paramount.</p>
