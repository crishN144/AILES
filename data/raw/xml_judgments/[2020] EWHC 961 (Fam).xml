The father of V is the Applicant, H (hereafter &#8216;the father&#8217;), a British national represented by Ms Rachel Langdale, Queen&#8217;s Counsel and Mr Simon Rowbotham of counsel.  The mother of V is the First Respondent, B (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;), a Polish national. The mother has not appeared nor been represented at this hearing although she has been given notice of it.  V is a party to these proceedings and is represented by Ms Maria Hancock of counsel, through his Children&#8217;s Guardian, Kim Richardson. </p>

Since his retention, the courts in this jurisdiction have made three summary return orders.  Two were made in proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> on 27 September 2019 and 8 October 2019 by His Honour Judge Robinson and one was made in the High Court on 2 December 2019 by Her Honour Judge Robertshaw sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, although the precise jurisdictional basis for the latter order remains somewhat unclear for reasons that I will come to. </p>

The question that is posed before this court, in circumstances that I shall come to, is whether the father is permitted to pursue that route notwithstanding that the father is also now pursuing proceedings in Poland under the 1980 Hague Convention, which proceedings are ongoing.  For the reasons I set out below, I am satisfied that that question is not one that falls properly to be answered by this court.  </p>

Later that year the parents and V returned to England, where they continued to reside as a family.  The parties separated in April 2017 and the father applied for a child arrangements order and a prohibited steps order preventing the mother from removing V from the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  On 28 April 2017 the court granted a without notice prohibited steps order to that end.  On 27 September 2017 District Judge Sullivan made a final child arrangements order providing for V to live with both parents.  Having expressed the view that the father&#8217;s concerns regarding the Mother going to Poland were understandable, District Judge Sullivan maintained the prohibited steps order to run until January 2018. </p>

The mother also applied for a non-molestation injunction.  On the same day District Judge Brown granted a non-molestation order and suspended the operation of the child arrangements order.  On 10 January 2018 the father applied to enforce the child arrangements order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 11</ref>J of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

On 21 June 2018 the father issued a further application for a child arrangements order.  That application was accompanied by a Form C1A in which the father again raised his concern that the mother posed a risk of the abduction of V to Poland. </p>

During the course of that hearing, the learned judge noted that the father was not wholly without justification with respect to his concern that the mother would remove V to Poland and cease contact with the father.  Within this context, HHJ Robinson concluded as follows: </p>

The prohibited steps order remained in place but, as I have noted, made provision for the mother to travel to Poland with V for 15 days.  An effective final hearing did not in the event take place, but on 30 July 2019 a further child arrangements order was made varying the time the father spend with V.  The mother was granted permission to take V to Poland on holiday from 2 September to 14 September 2019.  The order again declared that V was habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales and asserted the court&#8217;s jurisdiction over welfare decisions concerning him.  Finally, a specific issue order was granted permitting the mother to obtain a Polish passport for V. </p>

On 27 September 2019 HHJ Robinson ordered the mother to return V to the jurisdiction of England and Wales unless medical evidence was provided to explain why he was not fit to travel.  At a hearing on 8 October 2019 HHJ Robinson found that, while it appeared V may have received medical treatment in Poland, the Mother had &#8220;failed to provide sufficient information to the Court&#8221; such that V&#8217;s inability to travel remained &#8220;in doubt&#8221;. Within this context, HHJ Robinson made a further order that the mother return V to England.  That order required the mother to ensure V&#8217;s return by 13 October 2019 or else to &#8220;provide a clear medical report stating that the child is not fit to travel to England&#8221;. The matter was listed for a return date on 4 November 2019. </p>

As I have already alluded to, it is now accepted by Ms Langdale that these submissions were erroneous and indeed junior counsel corrected the error when the matter came before Moor J on 19 February 2020.  With respect to enforcement of the domestic summary return orders, given V&#8217;s removal to Poland the appropriate framework for reciprocal enforcement is that provided by Chapter III of BIIa.  Further, Art 11 of BIIa would only apply had the Polish court made an order for non-return for the purposes of Art 11(8) of BIIa in the pending proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention.   In any event, Ms Fottrell QC raised the issue of whether, the father having issued proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention in Poland, it was open to him to seek to enforce the domestic return orders under Chapter III of BIIa in tandem with those Convention proceedings.  On 19 February 2020 the matter was listed before me for hearing with a time estimate of 1 day to consider that question. </p>

I do not see how it can be argued that an order requiring a child to be returned from another Member State to England does not fall within these provisions. It forms an aspect of the exercise of parental responsibility. Indeed, such orders are commonly made as part of, say, an order permitting a child to spend time with a parent in another Member State. If such an order is within the scope of BIIa, it could not be excluded simply because it was made at a summary hearing. The summary nature of the hearing does not change the nature of the order which would still be dealing with the exercise of parental responsibility and would remain governed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, making the child's welfare the court's paramount consideration.&#8221; </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Oller Kaminska v Poland</span> [2018] ECHR 70 following the separation of the parents in Ireland the father returned to Poland and sought to take the child on holiday to that jurisdiction.  The mother secured a declaration in the Irish court that the child was habitually resident in the jurisdiction of Ireland and a consent order was agreed providing for the child to go to Poland on holiday.  The father failed to return the child and the Irish court made a residence order in favour of the mother and ordered the child&#8217;s return to the jurisdiction of Ireland.  The mother sought to enforce the Irish return order in Poland under the provisions of BIIa Chapter III and made an application under the 1980 Convention.  The Polish court dismissed the application under the 1980 Hague Convention.  Proceedings to enforce the Irish return order in Poland took some three years to conclude.  The Polish Government conceded that non-enforcement of the Irish return orders constituted an interference with the mother&#8217;s right to respect for her private and family life but contended that this was justified as having had a proper legal basis and being necessary in a democratic society. In determining that a failure by the Polish authorities to act swiftly to enforce the Irish judgments as required under the EU law constituted an unjustified infringement of the mother&#8217;s Art 8 rights, the ECtHR observed at [88] that: </p>

The 1980 Hague Convention is not the only instrument regulating matters connected with child abduction in relations between Poland and Ireland. Both States are also parties to the 2003 Brussels II bis Regulation and the 1980 Luxembourg Convention. The 1980 Hague Convention itself has to be interpreted and applied in the context of those instruments.&#8221; </p>

In so doing, the court would be falling out of step with the other Member States of the EU and abandoning the detailed provisions of the Convention and the Regulation, which have been carefully calibrated to safeguard the interests of parents and children (see, for example, commentary on the Convention by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (Children) (Abduction: Custody Appeal)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/27" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 27" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 27</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 1 AC 144" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 1 AC 144</ref> at paragraphs 14 to 18). Article 20, useful though it is in appropriate cases, contains no guidance as to the circumstances in which the court will act, save that the case will be urgent and the measures taken "provisional, including protective". There is no route map of the kind provided by the Convention and Article 11, which focusses the minds of the parties and the court upon the issues which are likely to bear upon whether a return order should or should not be granted. </p>

When the father did not return the children from the Netherlands in September 2017 after a summer holiday, the mother had applied to enforce the child arrangements order made in November 2010 and applied to the English court for an order for summary return of the children to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  A summary return order was granted by the High Court.  Thereafter, the mother also made an application via the Central Authority under the 1980 Hague Convention in the Netherlands.

However, having regard to the matters set out above, I consider that, absent a good reason to the contrary, the better course is for the court to defer making a return order until an application under the 1980 Convention has been determined in the other Member State. As Black LJ said this is how the return of a child is "expected to be dealt with". Once such a determination has been made the court can then decide what order to make pursuant to Article 11(8) of BIIa. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0.49in">Apart from this being the "expected" route, it has certain real advantages. First, a higher degree of direct assistance is likely to be provided by the authorities in the requested state to a party bringing an application under the 1980 Convention than in respect of an application for the enforcement of an order. Secondly, there is a specific obligation on states to determine applications under the 1980 Convention within 6 weeks. There is no such specific requirement in respect of the enforcement of parental responsibility orders. Thirdly, Article 11 provides what is to happen if a non-return order is made. There is, therefore, a tailor-made procedure through which the courts of the respective Member States engage with the case and engage with each other. Additionally, any subsequent return order has an expedited enforcement procedure under Chapter III, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 4</ref> and, to repeat, "without any possibility of opposing its recognition if the judgment has been certified in the Member State of origin in accordance with" Article 42(2). The making of a summary return order does not necessarily lead to the expeditious return of a child. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0.49in">The advantages of an application being made under the 1980 Convention as against making a summary return order are evident from the circumstances of this case. Having obtained a summary return order, the mother found herself unable effectively to apply for its enforcement. It is not, therefore, known whether she might have encountered other difficulties under Article 23, for example on the issue of whether the voice of the child had been heard. Although there were some delays in the mother's application under the 1980 Convention being progressed, once she engaged with the process required in the Netherlands to progress an application under the 1980 Convention, the court there dealt with the application with expedition. That such applications are dealt with expeditiously can be seen from the information provided in its Annual Report for 2017 by the Dutch Office of the Liaison Judge for International Child Protection (BLIK). This is not to say that a return order would be made but that the process was more likely to be expedited by making an application under the 1980 Convention than seeking to enforce a summary return order by means of BIIa.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">To reiterate, in this case the English court has made a series of domestic summary return orders. HHJ Robinson made return orders in the proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> on 27 September 2018 and 8 October 2019.  Her Honour Judge Robertshaw made an summary return order on 2 December 2019, probably under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.  Whilst, having regard to the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>, this may or may not have been the better course in this case at that point in time, that is now the position in this case.

In circumstances where the father is entitled to Annex II certificates as of right having regard to the terms of Art 39, the question of whether it is appropriate to provide him with such certificates in circumstances where he has also commenced Hague Convention proceedings in Poland simply does not arise for determination at this stage of the domestic proceedings.  Indeed, at no point does the question of whether it is appropriate for the procedure under Chapter III of BIIa now to be used by the father to seek to enforce this court&#8217;s orders in Poland, notwithstanding that proceedings are also pending under the 1980 Hague Convention in that jurisdiction, fall for determination by this court in the circumstances of this case.   </p>

Finally, with respect to the current return orders, the orders made by HHJ Robinson are now out of date by reference to the return dates they provide and, as I have set out above, there is some uncertainty regarding the jurisdictional basis on which the return order made by HHJ Robertshaw was promulgated.
