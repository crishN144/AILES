The mother is aware of the proceedings but has not attended today and is not represented. The father of Y and Z has not been located, it is not known where he is, and the same applies in relation to X&#8217;s father.  I have considered whether this application should proceed, bearing in mind the mother of the children is not here and not represented. However, the information I have from the Central Authority regarding the mother is she does not propose the children remain in this jurisdiction, she is not in a position to be able to care for them in the Czech Republic and she has had limited recent contact with them. In those circumstances I do not consider waiting for her to be involved in these proceedings is going to be of benefit to these children and/or assist the court in relation to the decision it has to make.  </span></p>

There is no dispute now between the parties in relation to the course that is proposed; they all agree there should be a transfer request under Article 15 of B2R to the Czech Republic to assume jurisdiction of these proceedings. However, despite that agreement it is, of course, a matter for the court to consider whether that course is right in this case, applying the relevant principles.</span></p>

Y and Z are subject to interim care orders; X remains in the care of his grandmother and is not the subject of any orders.  There have been previous proceedings, applications and orders relating to these children in the Czech Republic. Pursuant to orders made within those proceedings the children have been in the care of maternal grandmother since they were very young.  In October/November 2009 the children came over to this country with the maternal grandparents.  Concerns in relation to the care that was being given to the children came to the attention of the relevant authorities.  All of the children had very poor school attendance.  They were late; were regularly truanting; and were displaying behaviours which hampered their educational progress.  The children came to the attention of Social Services in early 2013.  There were particular concerns that Z and Y appeared to be involved in behaviour that was exposing them to the risk of sexual harm in particular.  They would frequently go missing, often travelling to a local town, associating with older men, drinking alcohol, and were suspected of using illicit drugs.  They were not being promptly reported as missing, and there were concerns about the grandmother&#8217;s engagement with the local authority and with the school authorities.  In addition, X had become involved in criminal behaviour; in September 2013 he received a six-month referral order for a burglary.  </span></p>

In relation to X she failed to protect him from harm from being exposed to criminal behaviour, and in relation to all the children she was unable or unwilling to prioritise the educational needs of all the children. They all had an appalling record of attendance at school.</span></p>

Firstly, and importantly, information from the Czech Republic through the Central Authority in an email, providing certain documentary evidence about the historical proceedings in the Czech Republic and setting out and summarising the position in relation to the children&#8217;s mother. She remains in the Czech Republic; she has the care of her youngest child, C, but does not appear to have the care of her older child, J, who appears to be in some form of State care &#8211; possibly placed with foster carers.  They set out in general terms what the arrangements would be if the children were returned to the Czech Republic and the support that would be provided, including the involvement of the local courts and the local authority to be able to support the care of the children.  They rightly say the decision whether to transfer these proceedings and make that request to the Czech Republic is a matter for this court.  In addition, there is an email that sets out which court would be the competent court in the Czech Republic pursuant to Article 15.  It is in the District Court in Czech Republic, which in fact is the court that has dealt with the previous proceedings concerning this family, and is also the area where the grandmother plans to return back to.  </span></p>

It is an extremely helpful document for the court.  It sets out what has happened and what her plans are.  It describes that it is her definite intention to return to live in the Czech Republic as soon as possible.  She has very limited support here and is in an impossible situation.  She has no accommodation and no access to financial support.  From the point of view of the court that is extremely worrying regarding X, because he is in her care.  He is last known to have attended school last Tuesday.  </span></p>

They have provided excellent support, expertise and consistency; I would encourage the grandmother to take all the assistance they offer to be able to help her in the short term before she goes back to the Czech Republic. In particular to help her provide the necessary support for X; who is still in her care. The grandmother sets out in her recent statement that she intends to move within a month, so by about 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> April.  She says he does not want to be in this jurisdiction; she said she will go back to the area from where she came in the Czech Republic where she has family there and friends with whom she could stay.  She states she would have access to State benefits there and will also be able to have the enormous benefit of being able to deal with the authorities in a language that she understands.</span></p>

There is no issue that this court does have jurisdiction to be able to hear this case by virtue of Article 8 B2R; it is accepted the children are habitually resident in this jurisdiction.  However, it is open to this court, by way of an exception under Article 15, if this court considers that a court of another member State &#8211; here the Czech Republic &#8211; with which the child has a particular connection, would be better placed to hear the case, or a specific part thereof, and where this is in the best interests of the child they may request a court of another member State to assume jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 15.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in;text-indent:-0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">17     I have been referred to the two leading authorities that deal with this issue; firstly, the decision of Mr Justice Munby (as he then was) in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">AB v JLB</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 FLR 517" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 FLR 517</ref> and also the very recent decision of the Court of Appeal in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Nottingham City Council v LM</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/152" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 152" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 152</ref>.  Essentially those cases confirm that what the court needs to do is to determine three questions; (1) whether the child (or the children in this case) had a particular connection with the relevant other member State, and that is a simple question of fact; (2) whether the court of that other member State would be better placed to hear   the case or a specific part thereof, which involved an exercise and evaluation to be  undertaken in all the circumstances of the case; and (3) whether a transfer to the other  court was in the best interests of the child, which again involved an evaluation in all the   circumstances of the particular child. However, it related to the issue of where the hearing should take place, the court is not looking at what is in the best interests of the child; it is only in relation to and in the context of forum.</span></p>

If they are, then the court has to exercise its discretion in deciding whether to make the order or not, although it is difficult to imagine circumstances where all three questions are answered in the affirmative and the court then does not order a transfer.  </span></p>

First a particular connection; it is agreed that the following relevant facts are applicable to confirm that requirement is met.  The children are nationals of the Czech Republic; the Czech Republic was their former habitual residence; it is the former habitual residence of their maternal grandmother, who as I have said in her statement sets out that she intends to return there and wishes to be able to care for the children.  The children&#8217;s mother is Czech and lives there; she still retains parental responsibility; and finally their extended family reside there, including younger siblings one of whom is in the care of the mother.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The second question is whether the Czech Republic is better placed to be able to determine this application. The relevant factors that answer that question in the affirmative are firstly that the maternal grandmother, as I have said, has stated that she intends to return to the Czech Republic and wishes to be able to care for the children; she is isolated here in circumstances where she is no longer living with her husband, she has no access to support or effective support, and cannot speak the language, so finds it very difficult to continue her day to day life here.  The Czech Republic is in a far better position to enable this grandmother to be able to access the relevant support and legal system there.  There have been difficulties up until this morning in her being able to engage with her legal team; she has not remained in contact with them. That is probably likely to be linked to the difficulties there have been in terms of language.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The third matter is the role of the children&#8217;s mother in the proceedings.  While on the information the court has she is not formally putting herself forward to be able to care for the children, it is clearly important that she should, as far as possible, be able to have a role in the proceedings. That is much more effectively going to be able to be achieved in the Czech Republic.  Initially the Children&#8217;s Guardian set out in the position statement filed by Mr Donaghey reservations as to whether this ground was made out.  It was submitted that the factual basis for these proceedings is here; there was very limited information as to what would be available for the children if they returned back to the Czech Republic, it was all very generalised; the local authority had commenced a parenting assessment and their position was that this jurisdiction was best placed to be able to weigh up the risks and benefits of whether the children should return to the care of the maternal grandmother.  However, now having had the benefit of the helpful written statement by the grandmother the Guardian&#8217;s position changed; she was able to reconsider the balance in the light of that information, which sets out very clearly that the grandmother intends to return back to the Czech Republic, sets out what her plans are regarding the area and the support that she considers that she will have available.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The final matter the court has to consider is whether a transfer will be in the best interests of the children, particularly in relation to Y and Z, who are teenagers.  Their wishes are very clear; they want to be able to return back to their grandmother&#8217;s care and they include within that being cared for by her in the Czech Republic.  The children&#8217;s guardian, saw the children with their solicitor on 24</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> January and also saw X on 24</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> January.  It is quite clear that the transfer of these proceedings to the Czech Republic will be in the best interests of the children because they will be able to maintain the links with the family who are important to them; there will be an assessment effectively &#8211; and probably more effectively &#8211; undertaken in the Czech Republic for the reasons that I have outlined; and whilst there are concerns regarding the position here in terms of the care they were given, an advantage of them going back to the Czech Republic is that they would actually be removed from the circumstances that put them at such grave risk of significant harm when they were in this jurisdiction.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The only matter under this heading that gives the court some concern is the question in relation to delay.  The information from the Czech Republic at the moment is that they will need six weeks to be able to consider whether to accept this request.  Of course that is a time period that is provided for under Article 15, in particular Article 15(5) and it is very much a matter for the relevant authorities in the Czech Republic to take such time as they feel necessary to consider whether to accept this request.  All I would add by way of observation and in the interests of comity between the two jurisdictions, is that any further delay about which court is to have jurisdiction is likely to detrimental to the children, in particular Y and Z. It will inevitably have a knock-on effect in terms of the delay as to which court will be making decisions what the plans are for their future care. Whilst I fully respect their position regarding six weeks to be able to consider the request and whether they should accept it, I hope that in the circumstances of this case they will consider processing the request sooner rather than later.</span></p>

Having considered and reached the conclusion I have to exercise my discretion as to whether I should make such a transfer. I am satisfied on the facts of this case that that transfer request should be made and it should be made without delay.  So I will make a request to the court in the Czech Republic to assume jurisdiction in accordance with para 5 of Article 15.  I will also endorse the directions,  that I propose to be part of this request, under Article 56 to be able to elicit some more information in relation to the arrangements for Y and Z if the request is accepted. I also have to bear in mind that the request may be declined. It may be the decision of this court, if it retains jurisdiction, to consider whether there should be an order to place the children in another jurisdiction which would still be a course open to me.  So it is important that this court has the best information available.  It is also important for Y and Z to be able to know what arrangements would be in place for them if the request that has been made under Article 15(5) is accepted</span></p>
