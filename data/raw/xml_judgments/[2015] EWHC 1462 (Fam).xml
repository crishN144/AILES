	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case the applicant seeks that the decrees nisi and absolute of divorce issued by the High Court of Malaya at Shah Alam on 1 April 2014 in favour of the respondent husband be refused recognition in England and Wales. In my judgment the only basis on which she needs to mount her claim is under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51(3)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>. As I will explain, I will grant the applicant's plea. It is therefore not necessary for me to consider whether recognition could be refused on grounds of public policy under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51(3)</ref>(c) on the facts of this case, notwithstanding that there are questionable aspects concerning the contents of the Malaysian petition.</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"First: The power contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51(3)</ref> as a whole provides for wide judicial discretion. The provisions need not be exercised if the interests of the respondent spouse (as opposed to the petitioning spouse) are met by other means (An example of this is <span style="font-style:italic">El Fadl v El Fadl</span>). It seems to me that it is important to emphasise that those interests must be safeguarded. I would anticipate that this approach would only be adopted where the respondent spouse has no option under the overseas divorce law but to submit to the divorce. The important point to note is that the judicial discretion is wide and the applicability of the section will vary depending on the many and varied circumstances of each case.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Second: When considering <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51(3)</ref>(a)(i) a judge must ask whether reasonable steps have been taken by the petitioning spouse to notify the respondent spouse of the divorce proceedings in advance of them taking place.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Third: In answering that question the judge must look at all the circumstances of the case and the "nature of the proceedings" in the overseas jurisdiction.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Fourth: Whether reasonable steps to notify the other party have been taken is to be judged by English standards having regard to the nature of the overseas proceedings.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Fifth: Whether reasonable steps have been taken is a question of fact in each case (it must also be remembered that there are cases where reasonable steps have been taken but they were unsuccessful or, in rare cases, where it is entirely reasonable for no steps to have been taken).</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Sixth: It is important to note that whether the respondent spouse has notice of the proceedings is not the issue. It is whether the petitioner spouse has taken reasonable steps to notify the other party. The focus of enquiry is upon the actions of the petitioning spouse not simply a question of whether the respondent spouse knew about the proceedings."</p>

It would be bizarre if totally different rules applied to an application seeking non-recognition of a divorce granted in, say, Cyprus to one granted in Malaysia.

I pointed out in para 10 that there were no reported cases about Articles 22(b) or 23(c) but there were an appreciable number under the corresponding provision, Article 45, of Council Regulation No 1215/2012 of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) and its predecessor, Article 34 of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ("the Judgments Regulation").</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After considering the relevant authorities I concluded that a defendant who is resisting the recognition of an EU divorce or parental responsibility judgment must prove three things:</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">First, the defendant must show that the divorce was obtained in default of his or her appearance. This does not mean merely that the defendant was physically absent. If the defendant has already chosen to take part in the proceedings by defending them or even by challenging the jurisdiction, he or she may be said to have already "appeared" and thus not be in default of appearance.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Second, the defendant must show that he or she was not served in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his or her defence. Even where there has been formal valid service the court of registration is entitled to examine whether on the ground and in the real world there was actual service of the originating application or an acceptable substitute sufficiently far ahead of the hearing to enable the defendant to arrange for his defence. In an exceptional case the court can so conclude.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Third, it must be shown that the defendant has not accepted the divorce judgment unequivocally. I observed that it is hard to imagine a state of affairs where this comes into play. It is irrelevant under B2R if the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him or her to do so (in contrast to the Judgments Regulation) or if he or she had concealed his or her whereabouts from the person who instituted the proceedings in the overseas court (in contrast to the Luxembourg Convention).</p>

There must be a petition for divorce alleging irretrievable breakdown. The petition must state if there are any overseas proceedings in being which may affect the validity or subsistence of the marriage. The petition must be served personally although the court has power to authorise substituted service or to dispense with service altogether. The petition cannot be listed for hearing until the time for acknowledging service has expired, although this can be abridged. The petition must be proved before a judge in court in much the same way that petitions used to be proved here before the advent of the special procedure in the mid 1970s, although the petitioner's evidence in support of the petition may be given by affidavit. There is a period which must elapse before a decree nisi can be made absolute (here it is 6 weeks and I assume the same in Malaysia) although this period may be abridged by the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband and wife were married on 18 July 2001 in Singapore. Their daughter was born on 6 December 2005. At some point they came to this country. Their final matrimonial home was a flat in Westminster.  The parties separated on 3 November 2010. The wife issued a petition for divorce in the Clerkenwell and Shoreditch County Court on 23 November 2010. It was based on the husband's conduct. In accordance with the usual practice the behaviour was very lightly pleaded. The wife merely referred to frequent lengthy arguments. The petition was unquestionably duly served on the husband. A notice issued by the court stated that it was posted to the husband on 7 December 2010. The husband signed the statement of arrangements for the child on 11 January 2011 and an amended version on 21 February 2011. It is thus apparent that he was fully aware of and engaged in the divorce proceedings.</p>

It is on this occasion that the court considers whether the petition has been proved. It is very rare for the court to reject a petition as being insufficiently pleaded. Yet that is what happened here. On 11 April 2011 the court wrote a letter to the wife saying that the allegations of behaviour were insufficient. However the petition was not dismissed. The wife was left with a choice. She could have asked that her petition be listed for hearing under the old procedure, or (more likely) have amended her petition to plead the husband's behaviour more fiercely.  In fact she did neither. </p>

On that day he applied to the High Court of Malaya at Shah Alam for an order exempting him from mandatory pre-action mediation; such an order was granted on 17 December 2013. The husband's petition to that court is dated 16 January 2014 although it bears a date stamp from the court of 26 February 2014. In para 8 it states "there are no proceedings continuing in any country outside Malaysia which are in respect of the marriage or are capable of affecting its validity or subsistence". That was not true.  Had the truth been stated it is reasonable to suppose that the court in Malaysia would have adopted a very different course.  It sought a divorce based on irretrievable breakdown evidenced by two years' separation. </p>

He simply asked that service be waived altogether. His affidavit is quite short and I set out the relevant passages, as translated from the original Malay, in full.</p>

The title or heading was her wording and the proposed divorce proceedings to which she was referring were English proceedings. On 15 November 2013 the wife asked Miss Fu Yet See to state the husband's correct address for service of divorce papers and related papers. On 18 November 2014 Miss Fu Yet See wrote a careful reply in which she stated that she "had yet to receive" the husband's instructions to accept service. She did not however give an address at which service could be effected.  On that same day the wife repeated her request. On 20 November Miss Fu Yet See again deflected the question and avoided giving an answer. Instead she enquired as to the nature of the documents so that she could advise the husband accordingly. For some reason the wife did not give that information although she had made it clear 5 days earlier that the papers were divorce documents. The reply sought in the email of 29 November 2013 was to the question asked on 20 November namely: what is the nature of the documents you want to serve? It is disturbing that this email chain was not referred to in, or exhibited to, the husband's affidavit of 19 February 2014.</p>

The waiting period was introduced for a reason. It was to allow the Queen's Proctor to intervene to show that the decree nisi had been wrongly obtained (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>). It also allows the respondent to the proceedings to intervene to seek to set aside the decree if he or she had not for one reason or another been served with the proceedings. Expedition in this jurisdiction must be sought on grounds of urgency such as an impending death or an impending birth of a child. I am assuming that the law of Malaysia is the same. An application for expedition on the basis advanced by Miss Fu Yet See would not be granted here.</p>

On 4 August 2014 the Clerkenwell and Shoreditch County Court found the petition proved and listed the cause for pronouncement of decree on 1 September 2014, and decree nisi was duly pronounced on that day.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having reached the threshold conclusions in para 29 above it is then a matter for my discretion whether I refuse recognition. Militating against refusal is the fact that it is undesirable to have two different decrees absolute in different places in relation to the same marriage. A decree absolute is a matter of status and it is undesirable that the parties should have inconsistent decisions as to when their marriage was finally ended.  If I decline to refuse recognition then the Malaysian Decree Absolute is entitled to be recognised under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46(1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>. The consequence would be that the decree nisi pronounced by the Clerkenwell and Shoreditch County Court on 1 September 2014 would be set aside and the wife's amended petition dismissed. Before the advent of Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> this would have meant that the wife could not claim ancillary relief. However Part III allows the court to award financial relief following divorce, provided that leave to pursue that remedy has been granted. I have no doubt that a court would on the facts of this case grant leave. So it might be argued that there is no practical reason to refuse recognition.</p>
