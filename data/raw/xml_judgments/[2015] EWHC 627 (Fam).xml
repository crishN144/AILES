Annual turnover was &#163;15.3 million in the year to 31st May 2010.  It has increased year on year to &#163;19.5 million for the year ending 31st May 2014.  I am told that it is likely to be around &#163;24 million this year.  In 2014, the gross profit was &#163;7.1 million and the net profit, after tax, &#163;1.3 million.  </p>

There has been a rather unedifying dispute between them as to her exact role which I consider totally irrelevant to the issue I have to decide.  There is absolutely no doubt that I should treat their contributions to this marriage as equal.  The Husband was the driving force behind the business.  The Wife performed the role of homemaker and child-carer as well as working for the company.  It is a tribute to both of them that they have achieved so much, having started with so little.</p>

His immediate referral to residential/inpatient treatment was an emergency and life threatening.  [MFP]  had begun to experience delusional and severe paranoid behaviours that when combined with (h)is cocaine relapse and major depressive disorder created a scenario that necessitated the residential/inpatient level of care.  [MFP]  believes that he has been followed, photographed and that his home has been fitted with microphones that will provide information that will somehow be used against him.  [MFP]  has verbalised a threat to his own life, but indicates that he is ambivalent regarding following through with this.&#8221;</span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[MFP]  entered treatment in a profoundly depressed state and consumed by the consequences of his behaviour both upon his family, business and reputation.  [MFP]  was compliant in his participation throughout treatment, but struggled to accept clinical recommendations regarding length of stay and involvement of his family members in his treatment.  The treatment team recommended that [MFP]  remain in treatment for a minimum of 60 days and involve his family members in his treatment.  [MFP]  has failed to follow treatment recommendations during his previous treatment episodes. Throughout treatment, [MFP]  was focussed on developing a checklist that displayed for him the necessary daily activities that will support his sobriety.  He was able to accomplish this task during his time.  [MFP]  was compliant with his medications.  He also reported increased willingness to participate in 12 step meetings after his discharge as well.  [MFP] &#8217;s prognosis is poor due to his failure to address the issues underlying his addiction and engage with his family to begin addressing the tremendous stress that this plays in his life.  [MFP]  will benefit from engaging in a strong clinically appropriate aftercare plan (12 step meetings, psychotherapy, psychiatric support)&#8221;.</span></p>

When first asked about this, he took the view The AB Retreat was only interested in making money out of him.  Later, when asked again, he suggested he was missing home.  He undoubtedly minimised the consequences of his behaviour on his family.  He did eventually, rather grudgingly, concede that his addiction had &#8220;badly affected his family&#8221; but there did not seem to be much remorse.   </p>

He has not remained &#8220;clean&#8221; since his return from Utah.  He told me he takes cocaine occasionally and that the last time was approximately three weeks ago or, on another account, before Christmas.  It may be that he is a &#8220;binge&#8221; taker of the drug which, as a layman, would seem to me to have numerous dangers.   Overall, this is clearly a real worry for his long term health. I really hope he will be able to stop entirely, particularly once this litigation is over this afternoon.  If not, I fear for his life.</p>

She sought &#163;3 million immediately and the balance by 31st January 2017 (two years).  Until payment, she argued she should retain her 5% interest in the company. She should receive the dividend due to her in the sum of &#163;150,000 pa.  She asked for periodical payments of 6.2% on the amount outstanding and that she should have security by way of an equitable charge on the Husband&#8217;s shares.  Subsequently, she has sought a limit on the Husband&#8217;s expenditure until she has been paid in full.</p>

I am satisfied that he was the driving force behind the company, regardless of the role of the Wife.  It was his project and he has made a tremendous success of it.  He is entitled to enormous credit for having left school with no qualifications and ended up with a company worth tens of millions of pounds. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Having said all that, he has undoubtedly got a number of serious personal demons.  Whoever introduced him to cocaine in his early fifties deserves a very long prison sentence as that person has destroyed a forty year marriage and come close to wrecking a family.  The Husband, however, was the one that took the cocaine, became addicted to it and allowed it to destroy his marriage.  I am prepared to accept that depression may well have contributed although I am not entirely clear if the depression contributed to the addiction or was a consequence of the addiction.  The Husband has clearly not been able to act on the advice of his treating professionals.  I sincerely hope that, once this divorce is behind him, he will be able to rid himself of this problem for ever.  If he does not, it will probably kill him.  At the very least, it will cause his family yet more turmoil.</p>

It was not just the furniture at the former matrimonial home.  He paid for the entire family, including her, to spend two weeks at the Hotel Atlantis in Dubai over two Christmases.  One year, this cost over &#163;60,000. The other cost around &#163;40,000.  He spent over &#163;50,000 on cars for her both in the UK and in Spain.

Some of his points were undoubtedly well made.  For example, it was clear that a significant number of the &#163;20,000 per month payments to the Wife were included in the &#163;1.4 million.    There were also a large number of items of expenditure through the Husband&#8217;s credit cards that were spent on clothes, meals, travelling expenses and the like.  For example, there was a payment of &#163;10,000 to Chopard, Dubai in December 2013.  This was largely spent on a watch for the Wife herself as a Christmas present.  Some of the credit card expenditure was on very expensive designer items.  It was true that the Wife also spent money on expensive designer items but I was satisfied that her expenditure was on a far more modest scale to that of the Husband, who purchased such items in abundance every month.</p>

He was able to show very large sums of cash being withdrawn by the Husband from credit cards over and over again.  He would regularly take out &#163;700 per day from his RBS credit card and larger sums from American Express, despite his initial denials.  I cannot accept the explanation in Mr Molyneux&#8217;s schedule (&#8220;no evidence; this is personal to  MFP; possibly business expenses; no receipts so treated as personal for accounts purposes only&#8221;).  Whilst there may have been the odd business taxi fare with no receipt, this would have been insignificant compared to the overall cash withdrawn.  </p>

For example, he told me he made cash payments of &#163;2,000 per month to his driver.  I consider, however, that a significant part of these cash withdrawals was spent on cocaine and prostitution.  On the balance of probabilities, I find it was closer to &#163;250,000.  </p>

First, it is correct that in October 2014 the Wife did make an open proposal to divide the assets equally without add-back.  Mr Molyneux attempted to rely on this as evidence of the injustice of add-back.  I reject that submission.  Now that we no longer have <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Calderbank</span> offers, litigants must be encouraged to make open proposals as early as possible that are designed to encourage settlement.  If the other party spurns such an offer, the court is entitled to ignore it completely and decide the case entirely on the merits. I will have no hesitation in a suitable case in awarding an applicant more than an open offer he or she has made if that is justified.   </p>

If there has been spending that should be added-back, the court is in fact finding that the assets should have been greater than they are, thus justifying a higher payment to the party who had not wasted those assets to achieve the equality that he or she should have had. </p>

I am satisfied that this was, during this period, almost exclusively spent on the Husband&#8217;s villa  but that is more an accident of time.  Equally substantial sums had previously been spent on the Wife&#8217;s villa.  Mr Molyneux described it as being like the painting of the Forth Bridge.  It is only similar to the Forth Bridge in one sense, namely that it never finished.  I am satisfied that perfectly good work would be done but the Husband would not be satisfied and would decide to start again.  That, however, is his personality.  </p>

In part he did it because he could not prevent himself from doing it.  It was down to his flawed character.  This court could not possibly add-back the expenditure on drug therapy. This was him trying to put matters right.  Whilst I accept that he did not always take advice, I reject Mr Pocock&#8217;s description of him going to this therapy as a &#8220;holiday&#8221; to get away from the pressures of life or the litigation.  He was ill and he needed treatment. The same illness, however, prevented him at times from accepting the treatment.</p>

I have had the most difficulty with the expenditure on cocaine and prostitution.  I have, however, come to the clear conclusion that I should not add-back even these items.  As I have already noted, a spouse must take his or her partner as he or she finds them.  Many very successful people are flawed.  This is true of this Husband.  I have decided that it would be wrong to allow the Wife to take advantage of the Husband&#8217;s great abilities that enabled him to make such a success of the company while not taking the financial hit from his personality flaw that led to his cocaine addiction and his inability to rid himself of the habit.  It may have been morally culpable.  Overall, it was irresponsible.  But I find that this was not deliberate or wanton dissipation.  It would be wrong to add it back.   </p>

Nevertheless, if I agreed with Mr Pocock, I would have to allow the annual tax charge until sale of the company.  Moreover, Mr Pocock accepts that the overdrawn loan account would have to be repaid on sale.  The repayment would have to come out of the Husband&#8217;s share of the proceeds of sale which will incur Capital Gains Tax.

Nevertheless, I consider it is only fair to do so with three caveats.  First, I am only going to permit tax on the overdrawn account as at May 2014 which is the date at which the valuation of the company has been undertaken, namely &#163;1.8 million.  Mr Molyneux has indicated that the overdrawn account is now &#163;2.6 million.  Given the Husband&#8217;s rate of expenditure, that would not surprise me at all.  Any increased balance can be financed out of the profits made since May 2014 and will therefore be the Husband&#8217;s sole responsibility.  Second, I am not going to gross up the dividend required so he will still have to find the money to pay &#8220;the tax on the tax&#8221;.  I therefore calculate that the tax to be deducted at a tax rate of 30.56% is &#163;550,000.  </p>

Indeed, in so far as there was expenditure, I am satisfied that it was, at the very least, approved by the Husband.  In some instances, I find it was at his instigation, possibly as a result of his guilt in relation to his expenditure.

She has, after all, not as yet received her share of the value of the company and, as I have already noted, the profits since May 2014 are not being taken into account in the case.

Equally, the missing &#163;60,000 maintenance will be ordered separately.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The only adjustments that therefore need to be made to the assets schedule relate to the tax on the Husband&#8217;s Director&#8217;s Loan account (&#163;550,000), the loss of the Wife&#8217;s Entrepreneur&#8217;s Relief (&#163;271,000) and the removal of the Wife&#8217;s dividend.  The Entrepreneur&#8217;s Relief has already been removed from the Wife&#8217;s assets.  I therefore believe that the correct way to account for this is to reduce the Husband&#8217;s tax allowance by &#163;271,000 to (&#163;279,000).  This reduces the assets to &#163;24,860,445.  Once the dividend is removed, the figure reduces further to &#163;24,710,445 of which half is &#163;12,355,222.  In past cases, I have found there to be considerable disagreement over such figures after judgment has been delivered.  I do require counsel to agree the figure or point out any errors to me within seven days to avoid any problems in the future.  If mistakes are not rectified within that period, the alleged error will remain for all time.</p>

Both Mr Molyneux and Mr Pocock have since made further submissions to me as to this.  I consider that they are both right in part and wrong in part.  I am quite clear that I did order that the Wife should receive the dividend of &#163;150,000 over and above the provision made above as well as the sum of &#163;60,000 maintenance.

If she had already received it, she would have had that money in her bank account.  The assets would have increased by that amount.  It follows that a strict equal division requires a reduction in her second lump sum payment of &#163;75,000.  The second lump sum will therefore be reduced by &#163;75,000 to &#163;5,492,347.

It can sometimes take longer than would be expected.  I therefore propose to order payment in 42 days, which should give more than ample time for the relevant charges to be obtained on the business premises and the money made available by Santander.   </p>

I accept that delay in payment in such cases should, in general, be as short as is consistent with fairness to the payer.  I am particularly mindful of the fact that I have found the Husband to be irresponsible when it comes to spending.  I also have in mind the ages of the parties and the agreed evidence that they had not made substantial pension provision due to an intention to sell up prior to retirement.  Moreover, although I have not heard expert evidence, I consider this company to be readily sellable given that it does not appear to be tied nearly so closely to the skills of its owner as many companies that are considered by these courts.  Put shortly, it continues to make large sums of money even when the Husband is incapacitated through his addiction.  Consideration has, in the past, been given to flotation.  Although I have again not heard expert evidence as to this, I would have thought flotation in one form or another would be a real possibility for this business. </p>

He should have a reasonable period in which to do so following his 65th birthday.  I propose therefore to direct payment on or before 13th February 2018, which is in three years&#8217; time.   </p>

If payment in full has not been made by 13th February 2018, interest at the High Court Judgment Debt rate will then accrue on the outstanding lump sum.  This has been at the very high rate of 8% for many years now.  There is therefore a huge incentive to pay this lump sum on time.</p>

She points out that the tax saving made by paying maintenance is 45%. She argues that this would justify a reduction from 8% to 4.4%.

Her lump sum will be guaranteed regardless of future performance of the business, so she is not at risk.  Third, I accept that the Husband has to pay the interest on the Santander loan at &#163;228,000 per annum, his rent and the mortgage on his villa.  The Wife has no rent, no mortgage and the investment income on the &#163;3 million.

I am quite clear that this budget does not reflect the reality of her spending which is very considerably less.
