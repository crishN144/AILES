	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case concerned DC, who is a 21-year-old man facing a raft of challenges in his life. He was born with a profound learning disability and now lives in a residential care home. His medical history includes schizencephaly, a rare congenital brain malformation in which abnormal slits or clefts form in the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. The signs and symptoms of this condition include developmental delay, seizures, and problems with brain spinal-cord communication; microcephaly and cerebral palsy. DC is also described as non-verbal. </p>

DC uses a suction machine and, where necessary, a nebuliser and oxygen machine to support his breathing. There is no dispute, nor could there be, that DC is clinically vulnerable (as described by the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)). </p>

At 21 years of age, DC has already, and by some distance, outstripped his life expectancy. All the professionals who have been involved in his care consider that this is not merely in consequence of the high quality of medical support he has received, but primarily due to the practical and attentive commitment of his parents. Both have been heavily involved but, DC&#8217;s mother has been his mainstay. </p>

What is alarming is that, on the application of the available guidance, DC has been eligible for vaccination since February 2021. In February 2021, DC&#8217;s parents were contacted by his GP to discuss the Covid-19 vaccination. It became obvious, and is recorded, that both parents had &#8220;strong views&#8221; opposing this vaccination. HHJ Burrows made the following observations of DC&#8217;s parents in his judgment. Nobody has taken issue with any of these: </p>

I read his statements and the other supporting documentation. I listened to his oral evidence very carefully, too. I hope I do him no injustice when I summarise his position as follows. The pandemic has led to the rapid development of new vaccines- new not only in their use, but also in their science. These mRNA vaccines have not gone through the usual tests and regulatory scrutiny as they would in normal times. He describes the vaccine as "experimental". Having looked at figures from around the world, from emerging studies and data, he is not satisfied that the vaccine his son is being offered is as safe and efficacious as he (and the rest of us) have been led to believe. He points to concerns over myopathy and other respiratory, vascular and neurological issues that may arise, and about which there is an inadequate database for a decision to be made.  He is particularly concerned about blood clots because there are a number of examples of family members with illnesses due to blood clots</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:13.5pt;color:#000000">.&#8221;</span></p>

Her opposition is that she believes that DC is a very delicate young man who has in the past recovered very rapidly from apparently serious health problems.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[5] One issue that I must address before moving on to the substance of this case is delay. There has been a very substantial lapse in time since DC's need for the vaccine was first identified by the CCG and this matter reaching court. Having briefly considered some of the other recent cases concerning the COVID-19 vaccine, this seems to be a common theme. I appreciate there has been an attempt by the CCG and DC's parents to discuss and consult over the vaccine. However, as long ago as February 2021 it was clear that there was a dispute over this issue. There was then a delay until July 2021 for a review of DC's unvaccinated status. It was not until September 2021 that a best interests meeting was convened. Then there was a further delay until December 2021 until these proceedings were issued.</span></p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">[6] It seems to me this is unacceptable. If, as the CCG contends, DC is a highly vulnerable person for whom infection with COVID-19 could be extremely serious, then they have a duty to act speedily to protect him. Once it becomes clear there is a dispute between clinicians and the family on an urgent matter over important treatment of a mentally incapacitous adult, an application to the Court of Protection should be brought- and determined- with urgency.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have stated, it is beyond any contrary coherent argument that DC is within the category of those vulnerable to Covid infection. He was amongst the first cohort to be approached for vaccination. The lengthy and avoidable delay exposed him to risk of harm, including death. It was the responsibility of the CCG to bring the dispute before the Court as a matter of urgency. The delay here was egregious and requires to be identified as such. Whilst there may have been attempts to negotiate with the parents, Judge Burrows was entirely correct to identify a clear dispute by February 2021. </p>

This signals that his rights have properly to be scrutinised and meticulously protected. His condition does not occlude his rights as an autonomous adult. In the negotiations between the doctors and the parents, DC&#8217;s voice was effectively silenced. In the court process, that is restored through the appointment of the Official Solicitor on his behalf. </p>

There are risks associated with the vaccine, and these are not yet fully understood. However, I am satisfied on the basis of the CCG's evidence that those risks do not outweigh the advantages. The main reason I will allow the application from the CCG is because I can see it having a positive effect on DC's enjoyment of life by allowing him to be more involved in the life of his care home and with his parents. If DC were able to make a decision for himself, I am satisfied that would be a magnetic factor for him.&#8221;</span></p>

DC had contracted Covid-19 in early April 2022.

They love their son deeply and unconditionally but, they could not have known what his response to infection might be. Their minimisation of his symptoms is a facet of their own belief structure. DC&#8217;s health was never compromised to a degree that threatened his life, nor did he require hospitalisation. However, his experience of Covid infection must not be minimised to support a particular perspective on the vaccination. This not only risks suppressing DC&#8217;s voice, it goes further, it misrepresents him. It must also be remembered that DC does not have the capacity to communicate any symptoms.

The second point, which resonates to some degree with the fifth Ground of Appeal, is whether the available, up to date, guidance is sufficiently robust for it effectively to stand without interrogation. </p>

He follows the guidance that I have referred to and considered that on an application of the principles, DC was at high risk of serious consequences because of the complexity of his condition, the profundity of his learning disability and his residence in a care home. At that stage i.e., before infection and apparently absent any antibody reaction, Dr H considered that a failure to get a vaccination exposed DC to significant risk, whereas any risk from the vaccination was effectively remote. Thus, he analysed the adverse risks of the vaccine to be greatly outweighed by the protection it offers towards a virus that could be catastrophic for DC.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The above passage indicates that vaccination is likely to boost pre-existing antibodies arising from pre-existing infection. Thus, DC&#8217;s interests would appear to remain best protected by receiving the vaccination. I have considered whether on application of the general principles identified above, and following the approach in the established authorities, this appeal should therefore be dismissed. It may well fall to be in due course. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, an understanding of the impact and effects of the Omicron variant must, inevitably at the time the publication of Chapter 14a, have been incomplete. Additionally, it strikes me that what is most likely contemplated by &#8216;vaccination&#8217; here, is a series of both vaccinations and/or boosters. It seems likely, in the light of DC&#8217;s clinical vulnerability, that he might be advised to receive a greater number of injections than the average member of the population. I have no doubt that this will cause real and visceral distress to the parents. As Judge Burrows noted, DC&#8217;s father advanced an argument which he sought to root in emerging studies and data. The Judge found he was not a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;conspiracy theorist&#8217;</span> and did not identify himself with some of the more extravagant prejudices ventilated in some social media outlets. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the courtroom in this appeal, I was struck by the parents&#8217; almost palpable anxiety. I have no doubt that they will attempt to conceal this distress from DC, but I very strongly suspect they will be unable to do so. I have equally little doubt that in this very intimate relationship, DC will in some way sense their distress and in turn, at very least potentially, become distressed himself. Thus, the parents&#8217; reaction to the vaccination process indirectly becomes one of the factors illuminating DC&#8217;s best interests. </p>

With respect to him, I do not think he has been sufficiently clear of the expertise that he wishes to target. It strikes me that an opinion from an epidemiologist has the potential to be helpful and I propose to adjourn this appeal, for a very short period, to investigate these identified and tightly circumscribed issues. </p>
