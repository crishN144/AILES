In fact, as an affidavit sworn by the mother&#8217;s solicitor on 11 May 2006 makes clear, although the father is indeed the registered proprietor of one of the properties, the registered proprietor of the other property is a company all the shares in which are held by the father. The submission made by the solicitor in that affidavit, without any further elaboration, was that &#8220;accordingly&#8221; this property is &#8220;beneficially owned&#8221; by the father. An interim charging order was made by District Judge Redgrave on 2 May 2008, but limited to the property of which the father is the registered proprietor. </p>

I set out the proposed amendments, which were lengthy, in Appendix 1 below. The father&#8217;s application asserted that the District Judge had jurisdiction to make the orders sought, without recourse to appeal, by virtue of (a) the &#8216;slip rule&#8217; (CCR 1981 Order 15, Rule 5) or (b) what was described as &#8220;the court&#8217;s inherent power to carry out its own meaning and intention or to clarify and give expression to that meaning and intention and make it plain&#8221; or (c) what was described as &#8220;its general power to give directions and orders as [to] the implementation of its own substantive orders&#8221; or (d) the court&#8217;s power (CCR 1981 Order 37, Rule 2) to set aside and rehear an order made in the absence of a party.

At a further directions hearing on 16 July 2007 I ordered that all proceedings in the Principal Registry under case number FD03P02333, including the pending financial proceedings, be &#8220;transferred forthwith to the High Court&#8221;. As I understand it, it was because of this transfer to the High Court that when the father's application came before District Judge Roberts on 6 September 2007 for directions she was reluctant to exercise jurisdiction.</p>

The mother&#8217;s solicitors objected to this in a letter to the court dated 21 September 2007, but District Judge Roberts vacated the hearing on 26 September 2007 shortly before it was due to commence.</p>

Immediately before making the order on 10 May 2005 with which I am directly concerned, District Judge Roberts had dismissed the father&#8217;s application for residence and made a residence order in favour of the mother. The father&#8217;s appeal against that order was dismissed by Sumner J on 9 December 2005. But the issue did not go away and eventually, on 16 July 2007, I made an order directing, inter alia, that the father&#8217;s renewed application for a residence order be listed for hearing for 5 days on 4 February 2008. At the same time (and in accordance with advice from CAFCASS in a letter dated 3 July 2007) I directed that N be joined as a party to the section 8 proceedings and, pursuant to FPR 1991 Rule 9.5, that an officer of CAFCASS be appointed as his guardian. </p>

Unhappily, as matters turned out, the section 8 proceedings were not ready for hearing on 4 February 2008 and the hearing had to be re-fixed, as it happened before me, on 21 July 2008.</p>

In the upshot I made an order requiring each party to file by the following day (25 July 2008) a written statement setting out (1) a list of the issues or topics, if any, that they believed remain to be argued in the Schedule 1 proceedings and (2) any further directions they sought with a view to concluding the Schedule 1 proceedings. Both parties filed statements to the effect that there were no issues or topics which required further argument in the Schedule 1 proceedings &#8211; both parties saying that the issues had been &#8220;fully argued&#8221; in November 2007 and that they were awaiting judgment &#8211; and that no directions were sought. The father, however, qualified his answer to (2) by adding the words &#8220;But [he] reserves the right to apply under liberty to apply, in the light of the judgment when received and possibly in the light of the conclusion of the current [section 8] proceedings.&#8221;</p>

He supports that submission by pointing to paragraph [15] of the District Judge&#8217;s judgment, where District Judge Roberts said &#8220;I &#8230; accept that the Mother will need the sum of &#163;20,000 absolutely for the cost of moving&#8221;.

I propose to stipulate for repayment if and to the extent that the money has not been used within a reasonable time not to encourage delay on the part of the mother but simply in recognition of the reality that events beyond her control may mean that some of the bills remain payable somewhat longer than four months. </p>

He points to what Thorpe LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (Child: Financial Provision) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2003/837" uk:canonical="[2003] EWCA Civ 837" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWCA Civ 837</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 865" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 865</ref>, at paras [49], [52], [54], echoed by May LJ at para [75] and Bodey J at para [83].

He says that every case must be decided on its own facts and that the approach of District Judge Million is appropriate &#8211; indeed, he suggests, particularly apposite in the circumstances of the present case. The mother&#8217;s secondary position, he says, is that a single written statement (without receipts) a year after the property has been purchased will suffice to meet any concerns that her expenditure has been otherwise than for the purpose of moving to and furnishing the property &#8211; a proposal which the father in response describes as &#8220;plainly fatuous.&#8221;</p>

May LJ stressed, however, (at para [75]) that &#8220;in other cases where available resources are much more modest, &#8230; accounting for how exiguous payments are spent may be positively undesirable.&#8221; District Judge Million went somewhat further in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Financial Provision) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 2 FLR 13" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 2 FLR 13</ref>, saying (at para [84]) that &#8220;it [is] almost always unhelpful and counterproductive to encourage a father to ask that the mother keep such accounts of her expenditure.&#8221; But that, as the father points out, was concerned with the quite different question of accounting for the expenditure of periodical payments, and here I am concerned, says the father, with the question of accounting for the expenditure of a one-off sum and, moreover, a sum which was, unlike an award of periodical payments, awarded for and intended to be used for a specified purpose.

Where the sum is substantial, then, for the reasons given by Thorpe LJ, an appropriate accounting will be directed. The sum involved in the present case is significantly smaller than the sum with which Thorpe LJ was concerned, but it is not insubstantial, and although it approaches it does not, in my assessment, reach the level at which, applying May LJ&#8217;s approach, accounting is inappropriate. The father, in my judgment, is in all the circumstances entitled to require the mother to provide a proper account of how the &#163;20,000 has been applied, together with receipts for all items costing more than &#163;10.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">(5)<marker name="tab"/>Fifthly, and turning to paragraph 2 of the District Judge&#8217;s order, the father says that it cannot conceivably have been intended by the District Judge that the mother should be sole trustee of a settlement under which the capital will revert to him at the end of the specified period. He submits that there should be two trustees, one nominated by the mother and the other by the father; that neither the mother nor the father should be a trustee &#8211; he say he knows of no reported case where the mother was made a trustee, asserts that it is plainly not the practice to make such an appointment and suggests that there are obvious general reasons why it is undesirable; that in order to avoid deadlock there should be a third trustee (to be selected by the court in such manner as it thinks fit if the mother and the father cannot agree who it should be); and that the trustees should be empowered to act by majority. In support of this general approach the father points to the observations of Ward J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A (A Minor: Financial Provision) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 FLR 657" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 FLR 657</ref> at page 663, and to what Thorpe LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (Child: Financial Provision) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2003/837" uk:canonical="[2003] EWCA Civ 837" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWCA Civ 837</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 865" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 865</ref>, at paras [45], [54].

For good measure the father says that this particular mother is wholly unfit to be a trustee of a valuable settlement and says that in this particular case it would be desirable to have a third &#8211; professional &#8211; trustee who, he suggests, would, cost-effectively, only be involved to overcome a deadlock or to advise the lay trustees on legal matters if need be. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For her part the mother submits that there should be two trustees, herself and an independent professional trustee. She opposes the father being a trustee, or having the right to appoint a trustee, given the intense acrimony between the parties. She says her proposals should be preferred because the father will have the protection of knowing that the two trustees, one of them wholly independent, will have to act unanimously; it will limit the costs of administering the trust; and, since she will actually be living in the property, she will have a close personal interest in the proper administration of the trust. Insofar as the father seeks to impugn her ability to act as a trustee, she disputes that there is any validity in his complaints. Alternatively, if I am not prepared to accept her proposals she says that there should be two independent professional trustees &#8211; not lay trustees &#8211; or alternatively a trust corporation. This is because, as I understand Mr Cronshaw&#8217;s submissions, were the parties to be left to appoint any person at their unfettered whim there is the very real danger that the conflict presently existing between the parties would continue via their proxies, with unhappy and expensive consequences. Moreover, the task of the (third) professional trustee would potentially become even more onerous and expensive. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, there should be two trustees, one appointed by the father and the other by the mother; neither need be a professional person. Neither the father nor the mother should be eligible to be a trustee. My reasoning is simple: given the acrimony between the parties it is essential that the trusteeship should not be seen to be in any way &#8216;slanted&#8217; either in favour of or against either parent, but at the same time, and for precisely the same reason, it is essential that the trusteeship be vested in persons other than the parents themselves. I have considered with care the suggestions that there should be professional trustees, either, as the mother suggests, that both trustees should be professional persons or, as the father suggests, that there should be a third, professional, trustee. I have decided, on balance, to reject both suggestions, essentially on grounds of cost, because I am somewhat sceptical as to the ability of the parties to find a professional person in private practice willing to take such a trusteeship in the circumstances of this particular case, and because I cannot think that it is going to be helpful to any of those involved &#8211; and one must not forget N in all this &#8211; if the affairs of this trust were to be managed either by a trust corporation or by the Public Trustee. An appropriate provision to this effect will accordingly be included in paragraph 2 of the order. </p>

And given what he says is the history of the mother&#8217;s unreasonable failure in this respect she should now be required to do so within a reasonable time &#8211; six months &#8211; on the basis that if she fails to do so the order should immediately cease to have effect. He says that he should not be required to pay over the &#163;220,000 until execution of the Deed, at which point he will have the security of paying it to the trustees; he should not, he says, be required to pay it over to the mother. For this reason he strongly resists the mother&#8217;s application to vary the District Judge&#8217;s order so as to provide for payment to her of the &#163;220,000. The mother takes issue with the suggested &#8216;cut-off&#8217; date and further says that the costs of preparing the Deed should either be shared equally between the parties or that the parties should each be left to bear their own costs. However, if it becomes necessary to appoint conveyancing counsel pursuant to paragraph 13 of Schedule 1, those costs should, she says, be borne equally by the parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a squabble between the parties as to who had the responsibility of proposing the terms of the settlement and preparing a draft Deed and as to who is to blame for the delays in moving matters forward since the dismissal by Sumner J of the father&#8217;s appeal. Each seeks to throw both the responsibility and the blame on to the other. I do not propose to become involved in this unedifying history save to observe that the father seems to have been far too willing to delay matters and avoid his responsibilities and that the mother in large part has only herself to blame for not having taken a more pro-active and prompt stance in seeking to give effect to, and if need be enforce by compulsive means, the terms of the order made by District Judge Roberts. She says that it was incumbent on the father to make proposals as to the terms of the settlement, and complains that he did not do so until he made his application on 15 June 2007. I decline to take up time debating the technical issue as to who, in strict legal theory, had the obligation to make the first move; I observe only that the mother could have taken the initiative in formulating the terms of the settlement and producing a draft Deed at a much earlier stage and, in that sense, has in large part only herself to blame.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with the father that he should not be required to pay over the &#163;220,000 until the relevant trust deed has been executed, at which point there will be trustees able to give a good receipt and who will be accountable to him as settlor. I therefore dismiss the mother&#8217;s application dated 10 May 2007 for the variation of paragraph 2 of the order. But I see no reason why there should be some arbitrary &#8216;cut-off&#8217; date, after which the order simply ceases to have effect. The appropriate protection for the father against any undue delay by the mother is a liberty to apply. The costs hitherto incurred by the parties in and about the drafting of the Deed will, in the circumstances, be left to lie where they fall. Neither party, in my judgment, is so clearly in the right or has so clearly misconducted themselves as to justify throwing these costs onto one rather than the other. I will give the parties a short period &#8211; I propose one month &#8211; during which they can (each at their own expense) seek to reach agreement as to the drafting of a suitable Deed, after which I will direct that the Deed is to be settled by conveyancing counsel at the joint and equal expense of the father and the mother. Appropriate provisions to this effect will accordingly be included in paragraph 2 of the order. Counsel will, no doubt, be alert to the fiscal problems identified (at least in part &#8211; there may for all I know be other tax matters to be considered) by Tod and Ellis, <span style="font-style:italic">Tax Implications: Schedule 1 Trusts</span>, [2007] Fam Law 708.</p>

I should spell out what I have in mind. Quite apart from any express provision in the Deed, if it is ever executed, the father is entitled to the benefit of the <span style="font-style:italic">Quistclose </span>principle in relation to both the &#163;20,000 and the &#163;220,000, so that if the monies are not applied in accordance with the specified purposes they will revert to him under the <span style="font-style:italic">Quistclose</span> trust. I see no reason why, in a case of this kind, the court should not in appropriate circumstances, and in particular if the mother is unreasonably &#8216;dragging her feet&#8217;, have power to impose a time limit after which the monies are to revert unconditionally to the father or (if they have not yet been paid) where any obligation to pay them is to cease. And I see no reason why, in an appropriate case, that power cannot be exercised pursuant to a liberty to apply of the kind which I have in mind here. In my judgment it would not be appropriate to impose a &#8216;cut-off&#8217; date at this stage, but it is not impossible that the time may come when it will be appropriate; at which time the court will have power to do so under the liberty to apply.</p>

It is not, he says, open to the father now to seek to impose unilateral conditions on payment of a sum where the obligation on his part to make that payment has now arisen on an unqualified basis. He abandons any claim for a charging order in respect of the other property registered in the name of the father&#8217;s company. The father says that, quite apart from any application he is making in relation to the &#163;20,000, the application for a charging order is misconceived and premature because the cost of moving, which the payment is directed to, is not even on the horizon.</p>

Parliament, after all, has been careful in paragraphs 2, 3, and 6 of Schedule 1 to define narrow circumstances in which orders for financial provision can be made to extend beyond a child&#8217;s eighteenth birthday or, indeed, be made on application by a person who has already reached the age of 18. As Ward J pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A (A Minor: Financial Provision) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 FLR 657" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 FLR 657</ref> at page 661, paragraph 2 (which alone of those provisions relates to capital provision &#8211; see paragraph 2(2)(b) &#8211; the others relating only to orders for periodical payments) does not confer any power to make a form of property adjustment.

That policy decision, which resulted as is well known from one of the recommendations of the 1967 Report of the Committee on the Age of Majority (Cmnd 3342) chaired by Sir John Latey (Latey J), must be respected and is not to be whittled away by the judges unless Parliament has elsewhere legislated to that effect. Nor in this context is there any justification for importing from the equitable principles of undue influence the doctrine of emancipation subsequent to majority (see <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire Loans Ltd v Black </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1934] 1 KB 380" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1934">[1934] 1 KB 380</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re Pauling&#8217;s Settlement Trusts, Younghusband v Coutts &amp; Co </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1964] Ch 303" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1964">[1964] Ch 303</ref>) or, from Scots law, the concept of forisfamiliation. Whatever may be the position in relation to child maintenance (periodical payments) after the age of 18, there is, in the context of capital provision, no justification, in my judgment, for disregarding either the general statutory principle that a child attains majority at the age of 18 or the more specific statutory principles which are to be found in Schedule 1.</p>

So if it is to be said that, in the event of the child not pursuing education beyond attaining majority, capital provision should nonetheless extend beyond the child&#8217;s eighteenth birthday, what has to be shown is that there are special circumstances justifying the view that the child&#8217;s dependency will indeed extend beyond majority. And it is not enough, as it seems to me, simply to have regard to the fact, if fact it be, that increasing numbers of legally emancipated adults are continuing to live at home rent free with their parents, or that, absent such special circumstances as disability &#8211; no doubt widely defined for this purpose &#8211; the particular child in question is likely for whatever reason to go on living after majority with one or other parent. It is not for the courts to impose legally binding obligations on unwilling parents merely because some parents choose, for whatever reason, voluntarily to assume a financial burden which the law of England does not, generally speaking, impose upon the parent of an adult child with legal capacity. </p>

She did not describe the case as having any &#8220;special&#8221; or &#8220;exceptional&#8221; features, nor did she refer in her judgment to any circumstance which was capable, in my judgment, of amounting in law to something &#8220;special&#8221; or &#8220;exceptional.&#8221;  Indeed, quite manifestly, in my judgment, this case did not and does not involve any such feature. It follows, in my judgment, that the District Judge was plainly wrong to make the order she did. The order should have identified 18 as being the relevant age. I shall accordingly substitute &#8220;18&#8221; for &#8220;21&#8221; in paragraph 2 of the order.</p>

I quite take the point that a parent is entitled to be protected against the child&#8217;s prolonged or indefinite deferral of attendance at university, but one has to bear in mind that in modern conditions an aspiring undergraduate may choose, or if he has to reapply may be compelled, to have a gap year between school and university or, if he has not had a gap year between school and university, may choose to have a gap year between university and starting employment. In principle, it will often be appropriate in cases such as this to provide that the settlement should at the latest conclude at the point at which the child has had a gap year (whether after school or after university) and finished any first degree course. This was, for example, the approach adopted both by Ward J in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A (A Minor: Financial Provision) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 FLR 657" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 FLR 657</ref> at page 663 (&#8220;a reasonable gap between completing her school education and embarking upon her further education&#8221;) and by Johnson J in <span style="font-style:italic">Phillips v Peace </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 2 FLR 230" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 2 FLR 230</ref> at page 238.

After all, the precise terms of the order are set out in paragraph [18] of the approved transcript of the judgment of District Judge Roberts. More controversially he submits that the father cannot bring himself within RSC Order 35, Rule 2 (just as, he says, the father could not have brought himself within CCR 1981 Order 37, Rule 2, whilst the matter remained in the Registry). In support of this contention he points to the following matters: (1) what he says is the father&#8217;s significant history of non-compliance with the court&#8217;s orders prior to 10 May 2005 for production of financial evidence; (2) the fact that the father failed to appear at the hearing on 10 May 2005 without even applying for an adjournment despite the fact that both Wilson J (as he then was) on 26 April 2005 and Bracewell J on 5 May 2005 had indicated that the case should go ahead, being seemingly unimpressed with the medical evidence the father had presented; and (3) the fact that the father has already sought to appeal the order. In support of points (1) and (2) Mr Cronshaw points to what Sumner J said when giving judgment on the appeal on 9 December 2005 (see in particular paragraphs [4], [84]-[88], [92] of his judgment). </p>

He says that it is, if anything, to his credit that he chose not to exercise the right to a full rehearing granted by Sumner J conditional on payment of costs (which costs, together with certain other costs, totalling in all &#163;44,000 have in fact since been paid), choosing not to contest the principle that he should pay both the &#163;20,000 and the &#163;220,000 and thus obviating the necessity for a full scale and expensive rehearing. </p>

And, he says, there is no rule of law which requires a litigant to proceed by way of appeal rather than by way of rehearing when both options are legally available &#8211; that may be but it does not meet Mr Cronshaw&#8217;s point which is not that the father should have appealed rather than sought a rehearing but rather that, having elected to pursue his remedy by way of appeal, albeit he elected not to avail himself of the remedy given him by the appellate court in its judgment on the appeal, it was no longer open to him to pursue what is properly to be regard as an alternative rather than an additional remedy.</p>

Let it be assumed that the father was too ill to go to court even for the limited purpose of seeking an adjournment. It is clear from the father&#8217;s own account in his statement of 19 October 2007 that the problem had not, as it were, blown up just the day before the hearing. So he could have written to the court seeking an adjournment or, as Sumner J pointed out in his judgment (paragraph [87]), asked Dr Pelling to attend for that purpose or instructed a solicitor. He did none of these things but simply did not turn up. The fact is, as he himself admits, that he decided quite deliberately to act in this way because, as he puts it in his statement, although </p>

Having chosen simply to stay away from the hearing, having elected to pursue a remedy by way of appeal, and having then chosen not to satisfy the condition imposed by the Sumner J as the price to be paid for achieving his objective, the court would be entitled to say, &#8216;Enough is enough. The father has only himself to blame for the predicament in which he now finds himself. There must be an end to this litigation.&#8217; But that is not, of course, what the father is seeking. Wisely, he has chosen to proceed on a much narrower front. Not without misgivings, I have to confess, I have decided that it is possible and appropriate to exercise discretion in his favour, because (a) he confines his endeavour to a single ground of challenge and (b) he has demonstrated, as I have found, that on this point the District Judge was plainly wrong.

There was no corresponding claim to interest in relation to the other sum of &#163;20,000, but Dr Pelling seeks the insertion in the order of such a provision, seemingly on the basis, as the father put it in his &#8220;submission&#8221;, that &#8220;under the <span style="font-style:italic">Quistclose</span> principle interest earned on it would belong to me&#8221;. The mother, in her response, concedes the general point but raises her concern that the interest may be rather difficult to calculate when monies are deposited in a current account which does not provide for interest, and may involve interest calculations on small sums of money for very short periods of time. She adds &#8220;I can deposit the sum in an interest bearing account, but I will need to transfer sums to a current account, from time to time, which do not attract interest.&#8221; There will, in my judgment, be no difficulty if any sums placed in a current account are kept there for the shortest possible periods, consistent with the mother&#8217;s ability to deploy the monies in the manner contemplated by the order. Her obligation is to account, in the manner prescribed by the order, for &#8220;any interest that may have accrued&#8221;; her obligation to keep the unspent monies in an interest-bearing account does not require that every penny has at all times to be kept in such an account if the practicalities of applying the monies require the use, for short periods and in relation to small sums, of a non interest-bearing current account. </p>

It is also to give the parties the opportunity to attempt to reach agreement on costs and to consider whether they wish to appeal. Consideration of such matters before hand down can save costs. Circulation of the draft is not intended to provide counsel with an opportunity to reargue the issues in the case.</p>

Those circumstances might be, for example, where counsel feels that the judge had not given adequate reasons for some aspect of his/her decision. Then it may be appropriate to send a courteous note to the judge asking him/her to explain the reasons more fully. By way of further example, if the judge has decided the case on a point which was not properly argued or has relied on an authority which was not considered, the appropriate course will be to ask him/her either to reconvene for further argument or to receive written submissions from both sides. Letters such as the one sent in this case, which sought to reopen the argument on a wide variety of points, should not be sent.&#8221;</p>

It was stopped on Dr Pelling&#8217;s advice who drew [the father&#8217;s] attention to the stated purpose of the &#163;20000, for the mother's cost of moving, &#8230; , and pointed out that no move of the mother was on the horizon and that of course the problems of the settlement deed etc had not been resolved so the move was not going to take place in the near future. It was not reasonable to pay under those circumstances, especially as the Order made no provision for what would happen to the money if the move was not taking place, and on the mother&#8217;s record there was real concern it would just be spent improperly and dissipated. It is not fair to [the father] as a businessman of probity to damn him in a judgment as a person who stops cheques when he owes money, which prima facie does not enhance reputation. [The father] cannot publicly reply to such aspersions because of the anonymisation (which does not guarantee that [he] will not become known to some people as the A in question).&#8221;</p>

The facts as I set them out in paragraph [6] are not disputed; nor could they be. The fact is that the father stopped the cheque in December 2006, at a time when his appeal against the District Judge&#8217;s order stood dismissed, when the stay had long since been lifted and long before he made his application to the court on 15 June 2007. The fact is that when he stopped the cheque he owed the money. The fact, as now appears, that the father acted on the advice of Dr Pelling can hardly assist him; it merely throws an interesting light on Dr Pelling&#8217;s approach to orders of the court.</p>

My personal approach to procedure is normally to take a strict view of applying the rules of court, which some FD judges have little respect for [I shall not name names but I have heard at least 2 judges boast how they can get round the rules]. So I do not disdain the court and its procedures and I do not accept my approach is one of arrogance. It was rather polemical against Mr Cronshaw but <span style="font-style:italic">qua</span> advocate I like to make points forcefully. Here, the rules of court (as in fact Munby J now holds) did not prevent exercise of jurisdiction and the issue was one of discretion. I always knew and accepted that to invoke CCR O.37 R.2 or RSC O.35 R.2 in the way we did here was pushing it, knowing the sort of situation where the power under those Rules would normally be exercised. But I felt that the 21-18 point was so important, especially with the case law in apparent conflict, that it was wrong not to allow the Court to decide it. I don&#8217;t think in general that one should prevent development of the law and prevent judgment being given on interesting and important points of law, by invoking procedural points when the point is one of discretion and not strictly prevented by a rule of court. I don&#8217;t find it attractive when members of the legal profession behave like that since, and I suppose this has something to do with my academic background, one would hope that they should rather honour the Law and welcome its development, and work to remove uncertainty and inconsistency. I am sorry if my approach appeared arrogant or disdainful; I can only say that was not intended and that normally I would not attempt to exploit CCR O.37 R.2 etc in the way done here (eg. to get a complete rehearing).&#8221;</p>

Danger of dissipation is real: see my Witness Statement No.12 of 19 October 2007 concerning the Mother&#8217;s financial reliability, trustworthiness etc &#8211; and if the money were dissipated then why should I (and indirectly N, who is nearly always aware of litigation) be burdened with litigating to recover under <span style="font-style:italic">Quistclose</span>?

There is, once again, not a scrap of evidence that [the father] would default. [The father] has paid all legal obligations by way of maintenance to N, and has settled by agreement all costs orders in favour of the mother &#8230; He has paid and continues to pay all obligations in respect of his 3 older children.

This is a case, it must be remembered, where the father has defaulted at least in relation to the &#163;20,000 and where, as I recognised in paragraph [55], the mother, although not entitled to a charging order in relation to the &#163;220,000, in principle was entitled to seek the appointment of a receiver, albeit that was not something which in the circumstances seemed to me to be &#8220;appropriate&#8221; given that it would serve only to soak up more resources. In the circumstances it seemed to me, and it still seems to me, that the appropriate mechanism, best holding the balance between the father and the mother, was an injunction.</p>

The mother responded with some minor drafting points on 8 November 2008 in addition to the points which she had earlier raised on 5 November 2008. I am grateful to both of them for their assistance. The order in the form in which I have settled it, making some adjustments to ensure that it gives effect to my intentions, and as it will now be sealed by the court, is set out in Appendix 2 below. It will be dated 6 January 2009.</p>
