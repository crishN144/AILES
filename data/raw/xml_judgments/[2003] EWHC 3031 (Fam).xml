	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case a father applies to withdraw his application for contact with his 12 year old son (identified in the attached judgment only as O). For that, he needs the court&#8217;s permission. The application is not opposed either by the child&#8217;s mother, or by CAFCASS Legal (the Children and Families Court Advisory and Support Service) which represents O.</p>

A measure of O&#8217;s distress at what was happening was his statement to the independent social worker appointed in the county court: &#8220;It is like a war.

The principal reason that O is hostile to contact with his father is because of his father&#8217;s behaviour, and not because his mother has influenced O against his father.  Unfortunately, the father is quite unable to understand or accept this. The father&#8217;s reliance in this case on the so called &#8220;parental alienation syndrome&#8221; is misplaced. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in">The court system for dealing with contact disputes has serious<marker name="tab"/> faults, which were identified and addressed in Chapter 10 of the report of the Children Act Sub-Committee (CASC) of the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s Advisory Board entitled   <span style="font-style:italic">Making Contact Work. </span>I discuss these further in paragraphs 83 to 86 of the judgment. In particular, the court process is stressful for both parents and children, it is expensive for those who are not publicly funded; it is slow and adversarial. It tends to entrench parental attitudes rather than encouraging them to change.  It is ill adapted to dealing with the difficult human dilemmas involved, notably when it comes to the enforcement of its orders. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in">Parents must, however, take their share of responsibility for the state of affairs they have created. Blaming the system, as the father does in this case, is no answer. He must shoulder his share of the responsibility for the state of affairs he has helped to bring about. All the evidence is that he has proved incapable of doing so.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in">The suggestion, made by the father, that joint residence orders should be standard is not, in my judgment, an answer. There may well be more cases than we have up to now recognised in which joint residence orders are appropriate. The philosophy behind such orders (the exercise of ongoing parental responsibility by both parents post separation) is contained within the Children Act and is sound.   But joint residence orders are not a panacea, and such an order would be quite inappropriate in this case.</p>

		<p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:1in">Contact in my experience works best when parents respect each other and are able to co-operate; where the children&#8217;s loyalties are not torn, and where they can move between their parents without tension, unhappiness or fear of offending one parent or the other. Such cases rarely come to court.. The courts, therefore, have to deal with the cases in which there is no agreement. These are often, like the present case, the most intractable.</p>

		<p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-weight:normal">This is, accordingly, once of those rare cases in which an order for direct contact would be both ineffective and counter-productive.  I reach that conclusion with regret. I am, however, reassured by the opinion of the child psychiatrist Dr. B that in late adolescence or early adulthood O is likely to revisit his decision not to have contact with his father. I hope the father also takes heed of Dr. B&#8217;s message that if he maintains his hostile attitude to O&#8217;s mother, O is likely to remain alienated from him..</span></p>

She directed that there should be staying contact between O and his father on alternate week-ends; staying contact for three weeks during the school summer holidays starting in 1999 and all other holidays to be shared equally. Christmas day was to be spent in alternate years with the father, also commencing in 1999. There was provision for telephone contact three times a week on those weeks when there was no staying contact and twice a week on those weeks when there was. There were some detailed directions as to implementation. The father&#8217;s application for a prohibited steps order was refused.</p>

Instead of directing a report from the Court Welfare Service, she made an order joining O as a party to the proceedings. She appointed a solicitor to represent O, and that solicitor in turn appointed an independent social worker (Mr. H). Mr. H was given permission on 10 August 1999 to have access to all the court papers. </p>

		<p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:1in">Here, it is common ground that O should have contact with his father. It is common ground that O loves his father and it is quite plain that when there is contact it is usually, if not always, successful. When Mr. H saw O in his father&#8217;s presence part of the way through an extended period of staying contact, what he saw was, he said ,,,,,,&#8221;a very happy child&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge then identified what is a common dilemma. The mother&#8217;s case was that O found the level of staying and telephone contact burdensome.  Frequent weekend staying contact meant that he could not see his friends at weekends, play with them and go to parties. Telephone contact was burdensome because there were too many calls, and (the judge suspected) because in common with many small boys O found it a chore to be questioned too much about what had been happening.  On the other side, the father felt strongly that the attempt to reduce contact was a ploy to drive him further from O and eventually to lead to him disappearing altogether from O&#8217;s life.</p>

He was satisfied that O&#8217;s mother was not deliberately thwarting contact, and rejected the father&#8217;s argument that the mother was active in trying to persuade O not to take up contact with his father.  The judge&#8217;s only criticisms of the mother were that &#8220;she does not push it as far as she properly might&#8221; and that &#8220;she tends to give in too easily to assertions of not wanting to go to see the father or to answer the phone&#8221;. The judge, however, clearly rejected any suggestion of parental alienation on the mother&#8217;s part. He said in terms: &#8220;Whatever the father&#8217;s fears, I do not accept that the mother is seeking to remove him from O&#8217;s life&#8221;.  </p>

These were that O at present did not want and actively disliked the amount of contact he saw himself as forced to endure. He had recently told his mother that he did not want to see his father at all, although she told the judge that she did not think he meant it.  Mr. H said O did not want staying contact more than once a month, and was reluctant to take all the phone calls. </p>

	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:1in">It may be that this is in part due to the differing attitudes the parents have towards appropriate behaviour and discipline; it may be in part an over-assertive manner by the father when speaking to O, in criticising his mother, discussing adult topics concerning the divorce and contact, and in telling him what to do; it may be in part that as he grows up, O likes to have weekends to do what he wants and evenings similarly. It does not, it seems to me, matter very much why the current regime does not work so long as it is not because of any active interference by the mother, which I have found is not the case, thought I repeat that I think she could have done more to encourage contact. What is important is what is the way forward from here.</p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:1in">The father cannot understand how less contact can be the way forward. This, I think, is a classic example of what Mr, H described as rigidity in approach. If, as I find, O is sufficiently unhappy with the current degree of contact that he is more and more turning away from any contact, there is surely the very great risk that he will become alienated from his father to the extent that what the father fears, namely the worst case scenario of contact having to cease altogether may well come to pass. I am quite satisfied that the most important thing is to get contact working again; that this is best done by starting with modest levels of contact and then attempting to build them back up to a higher level.</p>

He described both parents as capable but identified an &#8220;excessive rigidity of approach&#8221; on the father&#8217;s part. He rejected a suggestion that the mother was suffering from any problem with her mental health, and commented favourably on her evidence in the witness box under what he described as a rigorous and quite lengthy cross-examination from the father.</p>

The judge found that O felt (for whatever reason) that his father was more the perpetrator. This had affected his attitude. The judge found that this episode would have caused O emotional harm.</p>

Those criticisms are based on the judge having seen the witnesses, heard them give evidence, having read the reports, having assessed the facts and made findings. The father would be well advised to read what the judge has said because the judge is a sensible man. He formed a view of the father which is not the father&#8217;s own view of himself. It would not do the father any harm to wonder &#8211; as all grown ups ought to wonder &#8211; whether their own perception of themselves is necessarily the perception of others. That also applies to the mother. Is she being as helpful and as positive towards the re-introduction of contact between her son and her former husband as she could be?  Is she doing it as a distasteful duty or is she recognising that this child would gain if he could renew a contact arrangement with his father in which he had pleasure in the past? Both parents need to re-examine themselves; everybody does, and they particularly need to do so in the context of this case.</p>

Dr B witnessed a close and affectionate bond between O and his mother which suggested to him a positive attachment. He did not detect any undue influence being exerted by the mother on O about his views on his father or contact. Whilst O&#8217;s alienation from his father was unfortunate, Dr. B did not see it having any clear and direct negative influence on O&#8217;s development. He was doing well by all parameters, and had made progress at school in problematic learning areas.  The unresolved issue of contact was identified by O as a significant stressor.</p>

There would then (but not until then) be time and opportunity for him to review his opinions, and perhaps forge a more progressive and positive relationship with his father.  However, if interaction between himself and his father was accompanied by complaint about his mother, Dr B&#8217;s opinion was that it was likely O would remain alienated. </p>

Despite what (his father) thinks, I have sought to encourage O to be more compassionate and to try and understand how important he is to his father. I, on many occasions, when the opportunity arises, suggest to O that he might like to respond to his father&#8217;s letters or give his father a ring, or in some way move towards a better relationship. Unfortunately, O&#8217;s stubbornness means that those attempts on my part are often rebuffed, and I do not pursue them any further because I do not wish to exacerbate the difficulties or push O into a corner. </p>

He has lost the capacity to look at a situation objectively and to recognise that there may be some validity to views held by others. His determined and single minded pursuit of his own agenda is a reflection of that to which I believe O was exposed throughout the period when contact was taking place and provides an explanation as to why, despite there having been some good times, O&#8217;s decision in the end was to cut off that contact and protect himself from the incessant pressure imposed upon him by his father. Until and unless (O&#8217;s father) accepts and realises that, I do not believe that there is a prospect of a good relationship between father and son.</p>

I venture to think that were he to be engaged in a discussion on any other subject than that of his contact with O, I would find him quite rational. Indeed, on any other subject, the positive aspects of his personality, which plainly exist, would be likely to emerge. </p>

Apart from the hearing before the district judge in the county court which resulted in the initial order, there have been two full hearings before experienced circuit judges, both of whom, in my view, dealt carefully and conscientiously with the case, and did their best to promote contact.  In addition, a well-meaning but ill-advised attempt by the county court to engage a solicitor and independent social worker for O proved unsuccessful. Even then, the court did not draw the line. The Court of Appeal  held that the county court had given up too soon, and directed a further attempt to achieve contact. That led to O being represented by CAFCASS Legal and the report of a consultant child psychiatrist. I did my best, without success, to ensure that the father obtained a second opinion from a distinguished source. I failed. </p>
