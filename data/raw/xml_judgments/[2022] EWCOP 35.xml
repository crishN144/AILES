There was very little warning, and the incident was distressing and frightening for all.   S home stated that his behaviour had become unpredictable and challenging.

The staff have enhanced DBS clearance, and are fully trained to care for someone with DN&#8217;s needs and in the use of restraint should it become necessary.  The provision is for 3:1 care during the day and 2:1 during the night.  With such a wrap around package, the local authority and DN&#8217;s representatives argue, there is minimal risk to anyone either working at, or attending S school, or even making use of the facilities and grounds.  </span></p>

Although submissions have been made to me to the effect that (a) the placement according to the local authority&#8217;s proposals would be akin to a holiday placement it only for 28 days and therefore would not likely fall foul of OFSTED; and (b) that OFSTED are unlikely to deregister a body which has allowed a vulnerable young man with nowhere else to go to stay on their property for a relatively short period of any deprivation of Liberty is authorised by this court, S school maintain their position, namely that whether or not DN has somewhere suitable to go, he must leave by Monday 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July. </span></p>

The home is cramped, and so some of the family at least will have to move out to other accommodation.  I note that Judge Wildblood last week described this option as &#8216;wholly unworkable&#8217;.  The difficulty for this court and for DN, his parents and the local authority, is that there is no workable option available at all.  It may be possible in time for the local authority to find an entire property to rent, but there is nothing available now or by Monday. </span></p>

The local authority and those representing DN submitted that the school were putting up unnecessary barriers and hiding behind regulations in circumstances where it was entirely unwarranted and at the expense of the wellbeing of a young man they had cared for for three years. I believe that feelings were running high amongst those responsible for S school as well, as it was pointed out to me that some staff had been off work for weeks as a result of the stress of the incident in May and there had been resignations too.</span></p>

This is not the place to decide who (if anyone) is at fault, or whether the school are being rigid and hiding behind &#8216;health and safety&#8217; regulations at the expense of a vulnerable young man.  There are questions to be asked as to why the local authority did not bring this case before the court earlier, not least to regulate DN&#8217;s deprivation of liberty and why staff caring for this vulnerable young man were not trained in or familiar with the use of restraint.  These are all, however, for another day.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">What is not in doubt is that this case is one of many that have been before the courts where very vulnerable young people with a high level of need have nowhere to go because there are no places available. The irony is that many places say they are not equipped to meet such a high level of need for care and supervision, with the effect that, on the ground, their needs are not properly met at all.  DN was doing well in the placement. Going into a new situation where he is at home, being cared for by people he does not know, will be damaging for him.  Nonetheless, with the alternatives being on the street or in a hotel room, it is better than those. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Very sadly, I cannot wave a magic wand and find a placement that does not exist. At the end of the hearing, there was no change in the position of any of the parties.  In those circumstances, and with the greatest of reluctance, the local authority, those representing DN and the parents consented to the application for me to authorise a move for DN from S school to the home of his parents with the level of supervision set out in the care plan (which constitutes a deprivation of his liberty).   </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It is accepted that there is reason to believe DN lacks capacity to make decisions as to his residence and care.  Likewise, it is agreed that the care plan amounts to a deprivation of his liberty.  I have to determine whether the proposals are in his best interests.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 4</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> sets out the checklist of factors which must be considered in order to reach a determination.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">DN is not able to express his wishes and feelings, but those that know him consider he is likely to be unhappy and disturbed as a result of the move, as he does not like change and finds it difficult.  He is not likely to understand why this is happening.  All concerned will do their best to reassure him, but he cannot be fully protected from the effects of what is going to happen.  All that can be hoped is that the situation will be temporary.  DN&#8217;s mother said that she would remain in the property, which will be likely to make things a little easier.  Both his mother and father are very unhappy with the behaviour of the school, and have mounted a complaint.  Nonetheless, they recognise that there is no other realistic alternative. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There have been cases under the inherent jurisdiction where judges have refused to grant the necessary authorisations to place children and young people in wholly unsuitable placements.  No doubt it would be open for me to take the same course either under the inherent jurisdiction or the Mental Capacity Act but in all the circumstances and on the facts of this case, I think it would be even more harmful to DN if I were to do that.  He cannot look after himself and needs a high level of care in all matters of daily living.  He is going to be living at home and I think that there needs to be a structure surrounding that, given third parties are going to be providing him with care.  Although it is very sub-optimal at least he will have somewhere to live, and people able to keep him physically safe. His mother will be living in the property and other family members will be able to visit. </span></p>

I express my greatest sympathy to him and his parents, who were clearly very distressed at what is happening.
