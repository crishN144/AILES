	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At the centre of these proceedings is a two-year-old boy whom I will identify as X. He was born in Morocco and is a Moroccan national. He was abandoned shortly after his birth. Neither of his parents can be traced. X lived in an orphanage before being placed in the care of the applicant who has since brought him to the UK and now applies to adopt him. The case raises principal issues about the interpretation and application of the domestic laws of England and Wales and its operation in the context of international law. More specifically, the issues in the case may be distilled to the following:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The applicant was born in the UK and is a UK national. She was previously married but divorced in 2016. Following her divorce she decided to adopt a child from Morocco where she has previously spent some time in 2011. In 2017 she contacted the Intercountry Adoption Centre (&#8216;IAC&#8217;) that is now known as Coram IAC. Following an assessment, the IAC approved her as prospective adopter for a child from Morocco and in 2019 she was granted a Certificate of Eligibility by the Department for Education. In 2020, the family court in Morocco granted her a <span style="font-style:italic">Kafala </span>for her first adopted child, Y, who was brought to the UK and subsequently adopted in April 2021 under the laws of England and Wales.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The applicant wished to adopt a second child from Morocco and contacted the IAC in the summer of 2021. By this time the process for adoption from Morocco had changed and after some exchanges with the relevant local authority and adoption agency, IAC approved the applicant as a prospective adopter in February 2022. X was born later in the same year and relinquished in the same orphanage as Y when he was three days old. Pursuant to an application by the Public Prosecutor in Morocco, on 15 November 2022, the court of First instances in Meknes, Morocco declared X to be an &#8216;abandoned child&#8217;. </p>

The matching process was completed by IAC and the relevant adoption agency in December 2022 before the applicant and Y travelled to Morocco. She and Y met X for the first time on 20 December 2022.. Following a further court hearing, on 28 February 2023, the Moroccan courts granted a <span style="font-style:italic">kafala</span> in respect of X and after completing the necessary immigration procedures, X arrived in the UK on 6 May 2023. He has continued to live with the applicant and Y since this date. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 28 September 2023 the applicant applied to courts in England to adopt X. Due to the issues in the case, the matter was allocated to the High Court of Justice and the IAC, Secretary of State for Home Department and the Department for Education were served with notice of the proceedings. Happily, the Secretary of State for Education has since intervened in these proceedings with the former two confirming that they did not seek to intervene. The Moroccan authorities have also been notified of the proceedings but have not sought to intervene in the same. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In summary, the Moroccan domestic laws make a clear distinction in the treatment, legal rights and obligations towards children that are born within the family and those that are not. The former have clear legally delineated rights that arise from their filiation. This is so, as the Moroccan Family Code applies to families and the concept of family is strictly based on filiation. The second category of children do not have any recognised filiation and this impacts on many of their rights including inheritance. Importantly, the Code specifically provides that adoption has no legal effect in Morocco. In some Muslim countries adoption is expressly prohibited.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Moroccan Kafala is specifically addressed in the Kafala (guardianship) Law (2002) which provides that a kafala may only come to being by two distinct processes. The first is the grant of the Kafala by the family court, a <span style="font-style:italic">judicial Kafala,</span> and secondly a <span style="font-style:italic">notarial Kafala</span>. The former is by far the most commonly utilised route. The judicial Kafala is a contractual arrangement that is endorsed by the court following the completion of a set procedure. The formal procedural steps include efforts to find the child&#8217;s biological parents, which when exhausted lead to the next stage, the declaration of the child as abandoned. The prospective kafil (guardian) will be the subject of an assessment. Once these formal procedures have been satisfied, the court will make a welfare decision as to whether to grant a Kafala. The Kafala is a contract between the kafil and the Royal Prosecutor for child welfare in the relevant province. Once the Kafala is contracted and endorsed by the court, the kafil cannot rescind from their obligations but it is possible for the court to terminate a Kafala in certain circumstances which include the biological mother&#8217;s request to do so and to place the child in her care. The Kafala permits the child to travel with their guardian across other jurisdictions. </p>

The ACA 2002 governs all adoptions within England and Wales including intercountry adoptions effected within England and Wales. An intercountry adoption is an adoption of child who is habitually resident in a different country to the prospective adopter. In this context the Act sets out the requirements of residence by the prospective adopter as follows:</p>

They have each taken a different approach to the issues in the case. Ms Hannett KC&#8217;s and Mr Laing&#8217;s submissions have helped to further crystalise the parties&#8217; respective positions and to narrow the issues. There is no dispute that X should remain living with the applicant and if permissible, the applicant should adopt X (save that the Secretary of State for Education took no position on the merits). This is a welfare issue that I will return to later in this judgment as I must first consider if there is a lawful route through which this may be achieved. Miss Weston KC, Dr Cronin and Miss Kakonge submit on behalf of the applicant that there are three permissible routes through which the court may make an adoption order in the present circumstances. These may be summarised as:</span></p>

I entirely endorse this approach and for completeness observe that there are no such powers. As Ms Hannett KC and Mr Laing correctly submit on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, there is a complete statutory and regulatory scheme dating back to the Adoption of Children Act (1926) that governs adoptions in England and Wales and the court has never had a power to make adoption orders outside these provisions. I will address the applicant&#8217;s proposed permissible routes to adoption by reference to the issues that I have identified at the start of this judgment. </span></p>

Therefore it is essential that appropriate safeguards are put in place so that all adoption orders are made on the correct premise.

In the main the guardian follows the same route by submitting that the court has the power to make an adoption order despite any non-compliance and that it may disapply the AFER 2005 if the court finds it is required to observe X&#8217;s Article 8 rights. </span></p>

The thread running through her evidence is her wish and plan to adopt both children. There is nothing in her evidence that points to her wishing for Y to have a different legal status to X.

To state otherwise would be to create an unsustainable and impermissible legal fiction designed to avoid the legislative controls and restrictions that Parliament has put in place. In  my judgment the provisions of s. 83 of the ACA 2002 and AFER 20005 are engaged and the applicant, albeit unwittingly, has breached the terms of the aforesaid provisions.</span></p>

In my judgment the silence of the legislation about the court&#8217;s powers to make an adoption order in the face of a breach or non-compliance, can only be purposeful and intentional. The legislation is carefully drafted so that on the one side of the scale it recognises the significance and the importance of compliance with s. 83 which is designed to safeguard and promote the welfare of the children that are brought to this jurisdiction for the purposes of adoption. This is balanced by the other side of the scale by not fettering the court&#8217;s exercise of its powers  to make orders that promote and safeguard the subject child&#8217;s welfare throughout his life. To do otherwise can lead to perverse outcomes in some circumstances where the court would be forced to make decisions that are contrary to the child&#8217;s welfare which the ACA 2002 itself requires the court to regard as its paramount consideration. Indeed the thread that runs through the legislative framework is the protection of the child, his or her rights and the paramountcy of the child&#8217;s welfare interest throughout his or her life. </span></p>

This is entirely consistent with the European jurisprudence that is enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998. Therefore, in my judgment, in this instance there is no requirement for the court to engage with the merits of disapplication of the secondary legislation or any </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#1E1E1E">&#8216;read down&#8217; </span><span style="color:#1E1E1E">of the legislative framework.
