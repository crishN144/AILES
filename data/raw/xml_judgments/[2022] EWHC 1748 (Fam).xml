That statement did not say that the whereabouts of the children was unknown, nor could it have, given the discussions about mother&#8217;s residence in the Family Court on 26 November 2020 and 25 October 2021. Rather, it set out the father&#8217;s suspicion that the mother was preparing to abduct the children to Egypt.</p>

Due to the extreme risk on my life and for safeguarding reasons I would make a copy of this text message available only to the court at the hearing. The respondent and her brother could never be able to be aware of the making of this court order but through the defendant. The respondent&#8217;s brother stated clearly in his horrific text message that the defendant has informed his sister (the respondent) of the court order and mentions him by name.  The information in the text message matches the defendant&#8217;s dishonest intention to disobeying the court order and to do this only as a revenge. These threats and the whole message has been reported to the police and a life threat crime has been recorded at CRI/06LL/0000555/22 and is currently being investigated and Police are currently taking serious safeguarding measures to maintain my safety. The defendant acted dishonestly and hit the court order into the wall showing his extreme undermining and degrading of the court&#8217;s decisions and prohibitions. </p>

Moreover, by making such application the defendant has proven on himself the breach of the prohibition in section 8 of the court order, as he cannot make an application on behalf of the respondent without her consent, which implies his disclosure of the whole matter to the respondent.&#8221;</p>

As explained above, as originally formulated this count was evidenced solely by a text message which the father claims he was sent by the mother&#8217;s brother. Before Peel J the father withdrew reliance on that text, leaving the count entirely unsupported by any evidence. The father now seeks to adduce further evidence to support this charge. But the proposed further evidence does not in my judgment take the matter any further at all. Taken at its highest it is not potentially probative of the allegation. On analysis the proposed new evidence is no more than a statement of the father&#8217;s &#8220;strong belief&#8221; that Mr Khan tipped off the mother. I refuse the father&#8217;s application to adduce this new evidence in support of Count 2.</p>

The father told me that he specifically raised in those fact-finding proceedings the complicity of Mr Khan in the manufacture of a deliberately false case by the mother.</p>

The first problem is that the Recorder&#8217;s judgment does not record that the father raised Mr Khan&#8217;s complicity in advancing a false case in the fact-finding proceedings. The second problem is this: if it must have been obvious to Mr Khan on the evidential material that the mother&#8217;s case was false then that must have been equally obvious to the mother&#8217;s counsel Ms Horren. And she would therefore have been equally complicit in running a false case. Yet, the Recorder in his exhaustive judgment made no findings of complicity against Mr Khan or counsel, or indeed any criticism of their conduct of the proceedings. </p>

I agree that the phrase would have been better expressed with the use of that adverb. At a time when the mother&#8217;s allegations against the father were hotly contested and awaiting trial it would have been less inflammatory to have stated that she had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">allegedly</span> been a victim of domestic abuse perpetrated by her ex-husband&#8221;, rather than stating as a categorical fact that she was such a victim.</p>

But that solecism certainly does not mean that Mr Khan made a deliberately false statement.

He does not show that the public interest requires committal proceedings to be brought against Mr Khan. On the contrary, the poverty of the evidence adduced against Mr Khan, and the objective of seeking to have the maximum possible penalty meted out to Mr Khan including imprisonment, all very clearly show that it would be contrary to the public interest for permission to be granted. The proposed committal proceedings would be disproportionate and contrary to the overriding objective in numerous respects. </p>

For example, it is provided that there must be personal service of the motion on him even though he appears by solicitors, and that the notice of motion must set out the grounds on which he is said to be in contempt; further, he must be served as well as with the motion, with the affidavits which constitute the evidence in support of it.''</p>

For example, if the notice has not been personally served, the fact that the respondent knows all about it, and indeed attends the hearing of the motion, makes no difference. In the same way, as is shown by <span style="font-style:italic">Taylor v Roe </span>[1893] WN 14, if the claim form does not give the grounds of the alleged contempt or the affidavits are not served at the same time as the notice of the motion, that is a fatal defect, even though the defendant gets to know everything before the application comes on, and indeed answers the affidavits. On the other hand not every defect in the claim form will be fatal to the action, for provided that the alleged contemnor can in no way be prejudiced by the defects: 'then it seems&#8230;that there is no reason why the courts should be any slower to waive such technical irregularities in a committal proceeding than they would be in any other proceeding'.</p>

It was also argued that the affidavits were defective because the commissioner of oaths had not stated his address but it was held that while there may have been force in that argument had the affidavits been sworn in London, since the object of the requirement was to ensure identification of the commissioner in case of difficulty, this was not the case here since in a small town there would be no more than one or two commissioners altogether. As Cross J said, 'The absence of the address seems to me to be a matter of little importance, although I think strictly it should be given.

That rule requires the court specifically to consider whether this vital procedural safeguard for an alleged contemnor should be disapplied. The order in this case was made on the basis of a paper application and there is nothing to suggest that the court was asked to consider specifically the dis-application of this procedural safeguard. Naturally, the order is effective to notify Russell and Russell LLP of its obligations, and there may be consequences (disciplinary or regulatory consequences, for example) if the order is not complied with. Where a disclosure order is made against a firm of solicitors it would not normally be necessary to think about personal service for the purposes of committal  because everyone would take it as read that the firm, as officers of the court, would comply with the order unquestioningly.</p>

That juridical person is a corporate body, registered at Companies House. It is a type of hybrid entity, adopting many characteristics of a company and a partnership.</p>
