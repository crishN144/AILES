	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">On 11 September 2013, I delivered a judgment at the conclusion of an interlocutory hearing in which a mother sought a declaration that the English Court should assert jurisdiction to determine her application under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span> concerning her daughter M, now aged 13 years old (see <span style="font-style:italic">N v K</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/2774" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 2774 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 2774 (Fam)</ref>). </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">In that judgment I gave my reasons for concluding that the English Court does indeed have such jurisdiction (per <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">Council Regulation 2201/2003</span> (BIIR)); I formed the clear view, on the evidence, that M is habitually resident in England, applying the test then only very recently clarified by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/60" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 60</ref>.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">At the time of that hearing, proceedings concerning M were being pursued simultaneously on two continents: here and in the United States of America.  In my earlier judgment (see &#167;28-30), I referred to the benefits of international judicial liaison in a case such as this.  I specifically made this plea concerning the future conduct of the litigation (&#167;30):</p>

It is unfortunate that judicial liaison has not been achieved thus far, particularly as both parents wish for it to happen. The result is that, simultaneously in two jurisdictions, welfare-based decisions are being sought and made in respect of the child</span>&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Regrettably, the legal process here &#8211; which has been indulgent to parental requests for opportunity to negotiate an agreed outcome &#8211; has so far led to further frustration.  Frustration for the mother.  Frustration for the Court.  But more significantly, frustration for M who has been denied the certainty and clarity of parental agreement or court determination on issues concerning her welfare.</p>

I do so specifically for the father who has not been present or represented at this hearing, but who had expressed a hope &#8211; through correspondence issuing from his recently disengaged solicitors &#8211; that resolution to these proceedings may still be achieved by direct judicial communication.  I also do so for the benefit of practitioners in the field, given (as is apparent from my comments at &#167;22 and &#167;36-37 below) that even experienced family law solicitors had a mistaken understanding of the ambit of, and procedure involved in, this exercise.</p>

Mr. Bennett gives practical advice to practitioners, consistent with the DJC Guidance referred to above, which I respectfully endorse.  Relevant to the problems which arose in this case, I draw attention to a particular passage from that article (at p.850):</p>

Direct judicial communication is not intended as a tool for practitioners to: (a) receive legal advice by the back door; (b) avoid having to seek expert evidence as to foreign law or procedure in circumstances where it is appropriate; or (c) use as a substitute for their own legal research into English family law and practice. Likewise it would be a grave abuse of process to attempt to use network judges as a means of making submissions to a foreign court, thus short-circuiting the relevant procedural rules for such matters in the jurisdiction concerned. This is not to say that sealed orders and judgments cannot be transmitted to judges in other jurisdictions quickly via network judges in certain circumstances, which is relatively common</span>&#8221;.</p>

The solicitors for the father wrote in similar terms to the Court, adding specifically that the father:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Arrangements were made for the father to participate in the hearing in person on 24 January 2014 by telephone from Florida.  The mother&#8217;s solicitors had e-mailed the father on 23 January 2014 to inform him that arrangements had been made for a video-link, and requested that he be available on the telephone from 10:15hs (GMT).  When the case was called in on 24 January, I was advised of the considerable efforts which had been made to contact the father on the day by e-mail, telephone (landline and mobile phone), and text, but that he had not responded to any communication.  The case was not reached until 16:30hs, and did not conclude until 17:45hs; so although the calls earlier in our day would have been made to the father pre-dawn, by the time the hearing started it would have been 11:30hs in Eastern Florida.  He did not respond to the many calls (14 or more), or otherwise make himself available at the hearing.</p>

I heard representations from Ms Chaudhury, and reserved judgment.  The reservation of my judgment was in part due to the hour and partly because I wished to ascertain whether the father wished to put to the court an explanation or excuse for not participating in the hearing. </p>

They wrote on 27 January 2014; they sent the father a copy of the order which the mother is inviting me to make.  At the date of delivering this judgment, neither the court, nor the solicitors, has heard from the father.</p>
