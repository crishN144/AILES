It was, I am told, apparent on 25 January that there was no prospect of the hearing finishing within the two days that had been allotted.  A further day was allowed for on 12 February and the matter was once again unfinished and was adjourned part-heard.  It did not come back before the court until 8 October when the hearing was concluded with judgment reserved.  As I understand it, the delay was in part caused by illness of counsel and in part because the deputy district judge, either then or very soon thereafter, was appointed a full time district judge on a different circuit.  It took until 18 March 2019 before a draft judgment was circulated by the district judge.   </p>
