On X-Ray a spiral femoral fracture was discovered. Whilst no explanation for the injury could be given at the time by the parents, the mother subsequently said that A had been jumped on by her older two year old brother. Understandably, the hospital staff were concerned that they may be dealing with a case of inflicted injury and alerted children&#8217;s services.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The hospital wished to carry out a full examination of A, including a full skeletal survey. The parents refused, not finally acquiescing until the following afternoon. The skeletal survey carried out the next day by Dr M (19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>July), confirmed the right femoral fractures, but also discovered fractures to the left sixth to ninth ribs, an irregular proximal right humeral and tibial metaphysis (suggesting fracture) and an unusual appearance on the right scapula. A&#8217; s bone density appeared normal.  A remained in hospital and her brother B was placed under police protection and thence into foster care. The parents were arrested, and later interviewed making &#8220;no comment.&#8221;  </p>

The Court has had the benefit of some of the best experts in their fields, the case has been described by at least one as &#8216;challenging&#8217;. There are over 16 bundles of documents and a number of other materials. Whilst it is not unusual for the Court to thank Counsel for their assistance in a case, I especially wish to record<span style="color:#FF0000"/>the impressive professional conduct of those representing the parties. For many reasons, not least its litigation history, this is a difficult case, raising complicated issues of conflicting evidence, it is a good example of the absolute necessity for really experienced specialist advocates and solicitors at the highest level. </p>

In other words, there has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown. That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof. It is simply a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the causation advanced by the one shouldering the burden of proof is established on the balance of probabilities&#8230; a conclusion of unknown aetiology in respect of an infant represents neither a professional or forensic failure.it simply recognises that we still have much to learn and&#8230;it is dangerous and wrong to infer non-accidental injury merely from the absence of any other understood mechanism&#8221; </p>

Both parents have the great advantage of extensive, close and loving parents and families, and a wide range of supportive friends. Both had loving, stable childhoods. The parents are intelligent and articulate. They are both respectable people. They describe themselves as family orientated.  Both children were planned, their son B was born 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2015 and their daughter A,on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2017.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Apart from the circumstances which led to these proceedings, the only significant contentious event occurred in October 2015 when B (then a couple of months old) was taken to the Hospital with an injury to his nose and cheek. The explanation for the injuries was accepted by the hospital and he was discharged home. On subsequent review by the hospital (as happens in all cases), it was evident that the protective protocol of the hospital had not been followed and the family were asked to return, which they did. The meeting was not a productive one, the parents conduct was remarkable, they refused to agree to any further tests and in particular a full body scan. They returned home. The mother&#8217;s behaviour at the hospital in particular was really quite extreme, conducting herself in a most unusual, even bizarre fashion. That event, and the responses of the parents are relied upon by the authority now, contending that having successfully avoided further enquiry in 2015, the parents&#8217; avoidant, hostile and obstructive conduct in July 2017 was designed to achieve the same end. The parents countering that their (largely admitted) conduct was due entirely to the closed attitudes, minds and approaches of the hospital safeguarding teams. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dr Offiah concluded that on balance inflicted injury was the most likely mechanism to account for the fractures seen. In particular, self-evidently A was non-ambulant and no satisfactory mechanism by way of explanation had been provided; there were no abnormal test results or examination, and nothing in the relevant radiographic features suggested any cause other than inflicted injury. Outside the context of a reported accident or inflicted injury fractures may be seen in conditions associated with brittle bones (e.g. rickets or osteogenesis imperfecta), Menke&#8217;s Kinky Hair syndrome, osteopathy (bone disease) prematurity or scurvy. It is also reported in children with cerebral palsy, with diminished mobility, and EDS.  She expressly addressed the possibility of EDS. She said even if A had the relevant type of EDS (which she maintained should only be determined on a face to face assessment) the paper produced by Professor Holick was not persuasive because (a) the author refers to &#8220;temporary brittle bone disease&#8221; as if it were a recognised condition (and such a theory has been discredited) and (b) bone density is reduced in those patients with a predisposition to fracture. Whilst the images relating to A cannot exclude reduced bone density, the best evidence would have been on-going fractures occurring in a safe environment. Importantly too, had A been so susceptible she would have sustained observable birth injuries, which were absent. </p>

One of the main difficulties is that all the main case studies concerning reduced bone density are in adults. There are no studies of children, for whom very different considerations may apply. Of the 6 studies relied on by Professor Holick in his paper, she observed that 5 examples had abnormal biochemistry or bone disorder. In the sixth example (who had simple EDS), Professor Holick had omitted to mention that the father had pleaded guilty to charges of assault. Dr Offiah was clear that the journal should be told, it was, she said, unethical to leave the information uncorrected. In fact, Professor Holick was the deputy editor of the journal, which was, he told the Court later, in any event no longer in production. Whilst children can sustain fractures even in utero, or during the birth process, and obviously post birth, Dr Offiah gave clear reasons as to why she did not consider that any of the fractures sustained by A were caused by the birth process, or before. She held firm to her advices that if the fractures sustained by A had occurred during normal handling, it was unlikely that the process of birth (especially as it was being maintained that the birth was not straightforward) would have resulted in no fractures. </p>

That would be irrespective of any question into the area of bone density, and/or the risk of easy fracture whether through circumstance, genetics or hEDS, or their combination.  In her earlier evidence (in February) Dr Offiah had said, in line with current teaching, that reduced bone density was not apparent unless 30% or more, but was prepared to agree up to 40% (Dr Saggar, who is not an expert radiologist had contemplated up to 50%). </p>

I did not consider that her evidence was dogmatic or didactic, in fact quite the reverse, she was firm in relation to some of the contentions put to her, but it was very apparent that she was keen to restrict her considerations to what was (or was not) known medically, and not be side-tracked by hypotheses which had no real basis. Her evidence in relation to hEDS was especially pertinent in this regard. She acknowledged that whilst genetically, A had a 50% chance of having hEDS, she also had a 50% chance of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> having hEDS.

He agreed with the proposition that it was a big unknown.  Microdeletion affects collagen, collagen is within the vascular system, so logically hEDS and the microdeletion might affect the vascular system (although in his third report he had however said that he could find no evidence that microdeletion would be involved with vascular fragility).  His ultimate concluding position, as I have already recorded, was that there was no known evidence that this microdeletion is associated with vascular fragility.  In evidence at the County Court he had said if there is no credible alternative for inflicted injury we have to assume some susceptibility in this child, the way OI children fracture for no reason during something normal and innocuous.  With that hypothesis, no memorable event would likely be evident or capable of recollection.  However, weighing everything together, he still concluded and maintained that abusive injury was the most likely reason for A&#8217; s fractures, not least because this microdeletion is generally well understood, and not relevant to fractures.  Dr Saggar is a widely respected witness of considerable authoritative experience. He was prepared to entertain a number of possible contributory or causative factors individually and together, but nonetheless his conclusions were perfectly clear, and completely in line with the other expert advice to the court (save for Professor Holick), that abusive injury was the most likely cause of the fractured bones in A. </p>

A&#8217; s vitamin D test was taken on 18 July 2017.  It was normal.  She had always been fed fortified formula milk.  Professor Holick had no difficulty in asserting that the reading for the mother 15 months after birth was sufficient to say that A had been vitamin D deficient at birth.  Such a startling conclusion is quite obviously insupportable.  It was however similar to Professor Holick&#8217;s hypothesis that because a fracture had been observed in adults, being down to EDS, the same would apply to children (it stands to reason).  Whereas as I have already said, in fact the more considered witness, for example Dr Saggar, was very clear why extrapolation from adults to children may well be inapt and unsafe. </p>

Whilst I do not doubt the sincerity of his beliefs, nor the breadth of his clinical experience, I am afraid that whilst his observations and opinions might have some foundation, in experience, they are hopelessly undermined by a lack of intellectual rigour or analysis, they all inexorably lead him to one conclusion which may well not be correct, effectively starting at the conclusion and working backwards.  His undoubtedly invaluable experience is hopelessly marred by what has, I am afraid, become for him a crusade in helping (as he put it, wrongly accused) families to reunite. </p>

Her evidence and approach towards the family seemed to me rather moderate and far from unsympathetic.  Obviously, she might have behaved entirely differently when not in the spotlight of the Court, but I doubt it.  Of the mother&#8217;s behaviour in 2015 she said it was unusual, erratic and uncontrolled.  She had only once before encountered a parent who had behaved in such a fashion and would not consent, which no doubt in part was why the Police became involved.  I detected absolutely nothing in her approach or demeanour that was remotely reprehensible, let alone responsible for the extraordinary behaviour of the mother; quite the reverse, I thought in fact that she was calm concerned and completely professional when faced with the extremely confrontational behaviour of the mother.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">father</span> gave evidence from behind a screen rather than by video link as before, whilst it was a nerve racking experience for him, his anxiety being palpable, nonetheless his evidence was the much more powerful.  Whilst I might have anticipated some difficulties, there were in fact none, that was of itself in fact quite surprising, there having been really quite determined and forceful submissions through (different) counsel, both about the giving of his evidence and when his evidence should be taken.  Such anxieties as I might have anticipated as to both, simply did not arise.  The existence of the screen only appeared to be really significant when he was asked about his dealings with Professor Holick and why he had not spoken to his brother when he visited on 17 July.    I found him generally to be quite a good witness.  A decent man, devoted to his wife and children, speaking with remarkable and conspicuous pleasure and affection about both B and A.  He is rather straightforward, speaking of the marriage to the mother in 2013 he had, I thought, a rather romanticised idealised view, describing it as a &#8220;perfect marriage&#8221;, the &#8220;marriage you dream of&#8221;.  What became strikingly clear, especially when the mother gave evidence was the very unequal dynamic between them.  The father is essentially a quiet compliant man, loyal, and rather sensible, whose instincts are as straightforward as his personality.  The same, I am afraid, cannot be said of the mother.  He was asked about the exchanges with Professor Holick in September and October 2017, he was very obviously uncomfortable, discomforted by the suggestions put to him, he kept looking towards the mother (although obviously, presumably he could not see her because of the screen).  What is extraordinary is that Professor Holick&#8217;s advices took such a long while to surface, on my view of the evidence it is difficult to hold that at just the father&#8217;s door.  What was unusual about much of this evidence was the father&#8217;s lack of memory of the detail, that may be for all manner of reasons, for example, nerves or elapse of time; although the emails are all mostly framed from the father (with one notable exception, having regard to these, the 2 similar but obviously doctored emails, and the amendments in red to the draft report from Professor Holick), even as he was giving evidence I wondered whether in fact it was not he who was the author of the correspondence, but the mother.  Subsequently, the father was asked that very question, whether it was his wife who had told him what to say. His response was unconvincing, the father at his most discomforted. </p>

Watching him carefully in the witness box this was the second area of evidence where he was evidently highly uncomfortable, whilst that deliberate omission, as I find it was, might have any number of possible reasons, I am satisfied that he wanted to talk to his brother about it, but something held him back.  I am satisfied that at no point was the father ever alone in the house caring for the children on his own.  Overall, I found the father to be a genuine man, his evidence riddled with regret, torn by his unquestioning and absolute loyalty to the mother, and his well grounded instincts, which on 17 July, only triumphed when A was taken to hospital. </p>

Rare and unknown conditions do exist.  It is sometimes not possible to identify what is not known, what has been described in this case as &#8220;known unknowns&#8221;.  So particular scrutiny is required here where medical witnesses agree that A&#8217; s case is unusual, described by one as challenging.  This characteristic undoubtedly heightens the need for the most careful and cautious scrutiny, with particular attention being paid to the possibility that the injuries individually or collectively result from an unknown cause.  That is particularly so where the medical evidence is only one part of the evidence, and as there is no direct evidence of inflicted injury, that diagnosis may be just as much a hypothesis, and just as contentious as an unknown cause.  Selfevidently, of course, it is not for the parents to prove anything.   </p>

Each, I thought, despite submissions to the contrary, was a) willing to acknowledge the perspectives of the others and b) possessed a good knowledge of the science and research beyond their specific specialisations.  Some (Dr Offiah and Dr Ng in particular) have been criticised for being too dogmatic or unprepared to acknowledge or concede any other alternatives, yet I did not understand their evidence in that way.  Quite the contrary.  It was for example, Dr Offiah who raised the possible alternatives.

Notwithstanding his avowed longitudinal experience, he case studies upon which he relies (published in a journal of which had an editorial role), do not stand up to examination.  The only case which on its facts might (number 6) self-evidently should not appear in the study at all, since the father subsequently pleaded guilty to two counts of assault.  What was immediately worrying was far from causing Professor Holick to reflect or explain (he told me the conviction arose post publication), he was evidently unconcerned and unrepentant, he immediately went on the offensive suggesting as I have recorded that many parents &#8220;fall on their sword &#8220;to preserve the family.  The manner of his evidence at that point was most unfortunate, he blustered, he was hostile and evasive.  The short point is that the example should never have been there, it required removal and correction.  I am afraid that I am driven to the conclusion that he is so convinced of the correctness of his contentions, that he merely overlooks anything which is inconvenient, which does not fit his general proposition or thesis; which is that he regularly sees such fracturing, the same applying to children as adults as &#8220;it stands to reason&#8221;. </p>

Suspicion increases when the reported mechanisms of trauma seem inconsistent with the injury, when trauma is denied as when there is a delay in seeking medical care.   Such inferences are frequently no more than a clinician&#8217;s expectations about an average child&#8217;s response, crying, guarding the injury or behavioural changes, in turn prompting the parents to seek medical attention.  Perceived delays in seeking medical assistance may raise a concern of abuse.  Recent guidelines regarding medical evaluations of physical abuse recommend asking about the child&#8217;s behaviours relating to the injury.  In addition, law enforcement and child welfare professionals request medical opinion about a child&#8217;s expected behaviour after sustaining a fracture&#8221;, as here. </p>

The majority of children with accidental fractures are therefore symptomatic at the time of injury, but a significant notable minority do not follow the expected pattern of behaviour, either they use their extremity post injury or exhibit little irritability after injury. When a delay in seeking medical treatment occurs it is most likely to be related to the absence of physical signs of injury rather than crying or irritability&#8221;. </p>

He accepted that the associated swelling with the skull fracture, which he had not spotted.  He accepted that birth skull fractures were possible, but here, having regard to the swelling, the fracture would have been as a result of recent trauma, (as swelling would disappear after 14 days).  In relation to all the fractures, he too considered that a memorable event was necessary.  In the absence of any bone distress &#8220;we were looking at trauma&#8221;.  The skull fracture and bleeding are consistent with having occurred at the same time, but they did not necessarily have to have occurred together. Of the two bleeds, the outermost is more associated with any abnormality unless there is one associated with bleeding.  The clefts were probably caused by trauma (probably not birth) they are weeks old, possibly a second trauma caused a re-bleed.  He conceded that the clefts could pre-date birth.  Whilst comparable with shaking, it did not explain why there is only damage to the front of the brain.  The cleft may have an unknown cause, but the left sided bleeding was likely the result of trauma unless there is predisposition.  The left damage and fracture undermined the explanation of unknown cause.  Taking hEDS out of the picture points to trauma.  With such brain injury you would expect to see a change in the behaviour of the child. Whilst on one view this evidence might be considered equivocal, taking it in the round I consider that it is more likely than not that head injuries were all precipitated by trauma. </p>

Neither can explain the skull or femoral fracture, and go no way to explain the other injuries. The mother was the primary carer of A,it is reasonable to ask how was it that A&#8217; s leg was twisted and pulled, how were her arms levered above her head, how was it that she sustained metaphyseal fractures?

But it is not difficult to envisage, being responsible for A&#8217; s feeding, quite possibly, in exasperation at her slowness or inability to feed, how a carer might momentarily have lost control, and indeed how this might lead to a vicious circle.  With that background it is instructive to examine the events of the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July with some care. This was an extremely busy day which required careful planning by the mother so that she could attend the dentist. On noticing the swelling and lack of movement the mother contacted the father by WhatsApp with accompanying photographs. She was also in touch with a friend.  From 3.30pm there was a delay. It is unclear what was happening. The mother endeavoured to speak to the doctors&#8217; surgery, her account for telephoning, as opposed to simply going straight there was unconvincing. The father returned home, and arrangements were made to consult an online doctor. The paternal uncle attended the home to see B.He is a caring, concerned, sympathetic man, yet no one mentioned a word about A&#8217; s predicament. Although there are conflicting accounts, the online doctor was clear that the parents were reluctant to seek direct medical assistance that night. The mother was resistant to taking A to A and B. I accept no doubt in part because of the unsatisfactory procedures then employed by Pushdoctor, that Dr McGuiness felt she had no alternative but to make a safeguarding referral (3 different referrals have arisen because of the family&#8217;s conduct).  Only after that call, was A taken to hospital, I sensed at the father&#8217;s insistence. All those factors taken together present a powerful and unusual picture, an anxious mother keen I find to avoid direct examination, perhaps hoping that the symptoms would resolve by the next day when the mother was attending the doctors in any event.  A father who was unprepared or unable to stand up to ensure that his daughter received prompt medical attention, not even consulting his brother. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I haven&#8217;t lost sight of the fact that some families, some individuals, question to the point of confrontation, and are unable to see a wider more balanced perspective. But that does not apply here. The mother is intelligent and articulate; she is very aware of the effect of her behaviour and language and the effect that it can have, as her live evidence so graphically showed. The mother was A&#8217; s primary carer, certainly from 19 June 2017.  Taking everything together, I find that the mother knew that something was seriously wrong with A&#8217; s leg that day.  There is no evidence of timing for the leg injury, despite my suspicion that it did occur that day I cannot say with certainty that it did.  I cannot say to what extent if at all, the mothers stress (it being the busiest day), or her previously unmentioned baby blues even to her close family (which whilst ordinarily would be an enormous strength, could in those circumstances be precisely the opposite), played any part, nor whether it was through frustration at feeding or some other cause that precipitated the injury.  Having considered all the evidence and having considered in particular the submissions of Mr Twomey QC and Ms McKenna QC, (that it is not possible to identify which parent was responsible,) everything is at large, and I take a different view.  I am satisfied that the mother was more likely responsible, and having regard to the burden and regime of care, all provided by the mother, all the injuries sustained by A were inflicted by her. I don&#8217;t lose sight of the fact that A&#8217; s unusual responses to pain, sometimes a check on aberrant behaviours, may not have demonstrated the pain which might normally be so apparent. However, the mechanisms being the same, in any event, the mother knew what she had done.  Whilst the mother very much supports her husband, her conduct and behaviour are entirely inconsistent with his responsibility for any of the injuries.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">What of the father? He is devoted to, but dominated by his wife. He knew something was very wrong with A that evening, yet his better instincts were displaced and suborned, I am satisfied, by the mother&#8217;s direction, I have little doubt that she told him to say nothing to his brother when he visited, and he complied.   Although the father has been less than forthcoming over the events of that evening, and his dealings with Professor Holick, as well as the issue of A&#8217; s pain threshold in relation to injuries possibly occurring without A crying (thus alerting the mother), it might be reasonable to conclude that either of the parents might potentially be responsible for the injuries to A; but the totality of evidence (of care, conduct, and response) falls against the mother, and not the father. The authority rely strongly in their submissions on the dealings with Professor Horlick, which they primarily lay at the father&#8217;s door, whilst they are unimpressive, I think it unlikely on the evidence that any of them occurred at his sole instigation. There is however the clearest evidence that he failed to protect A on the evening of July 17th by not ensuring that she received immediate medical attention, and by not standing up to his wife&#8217;s direction. In short, he failed through misplaced loyalty to fulfil the most basic expectation and requirement of any parent. </p>

On 22 March 2019 Dr Pipon-Young filed her psychological assessment of the parents and maternal grandparents.  In that Report she concluded that the parents did possess the capacity for change, and supported the family undertaking further work with Resolutions.  She advised that the parents engage in therapy for at least 6 months. </p>

Over the ensuing two months the children were gradually rehabilitated from the grandparents&#8217; care to their parents&#8217;.  The children have settled well, and the professional advice from all quarters is that the children have remained safe.  A very significant plank of this arrangement has been the impressive family support network, and the parents&#8217; very considerable change in their stance and relationship with the local authority.  The local authority (with the comprehensive concurrence of the professional witnesses and parties) submits that the Court can and should make a Supervision Order for 6 months, and I do so.  I have seen a full &#8220;Working Together Agreement&#8221; which forms a clear map for the parties&#8217; expectations and conduct.   </p>
