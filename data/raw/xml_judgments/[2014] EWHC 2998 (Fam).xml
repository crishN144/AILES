	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">This is my judgment on the wife&#8217;s claim for ancillary relief following divorce.  I use the old expression &#8216;ancillary relief&#8217; rather than the neologism in the Family Procedure Rules of &#8216;financial remedy&#8217;, as ancillary relief is still the heading to that part of Part 2 of the Matrimonial Causes Act beginning at Section 22, where it sets out the powers of the Court and describes them as "ancillary relief in connection with divorce proceedings".</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I have to say that the case has been conducted in a model way.  The parties and the interveners filed very full skeleton arguments which obviated the need for any opening, evidence in chief was not permitted in accordance with the new prescription, we heard all of the evidence and final submissions in one day and I am giving judgment at 10:15 on day two.  </p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The efficiency with which the case was done is a credit to all concerned and it should serve as a reminder to those who practise in this field that with goodwill and effort it is possible to do what are quite complex cases extremely economically, both in terms of time and money.</p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The applicant wife, and I will refer to her as the wife because that is the convention and because in fact she still is the wife, the decree absolute not having yet been issued, is aged 44. She is a journalist by profession, the daughter of a man who was a pensions manager.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">When she and the husband first met in 1999 she had by then acquired her first home in Bristol, which she still has.  That is pre-marital property and indeed by making further borrowings on that property she has bought another property in Pembroke Dock, which again is to be characterised as non-matrimonial property even though that latter property is in fact in negative equity.  I will deal with her financial position in more detail a little later.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The husband is aged 41, being born on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 1972.  On paper he has almost no assets at all and his income is extremely modest.  On paper his only asset is a plot of land called Plot A, in Pembrokeshire, with a net value after subtraction of notional Capital Gains Tax, of just under &#163;38,000.  His income from all sources, including from welfare benefits, is said to be just under &#163;3,000 a month.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">So on paper, and I emphasise on paper, he presents as somebody who is rather less well off than the wife. I perhaps should mention that in addition to Plot A he has a microscopic pension fund as well. However, that does not tell the true story by any means.  </p>

	    <num>10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The husband is the third child of DB and VB.  He has an older sister LB who is 46 and who lives in London, and an older brother EB who is aged 44, who is married and who has four children and who is a farmer in Pembrokeshire.  The husband comes from a distinguished Welsh family which own substantial lands in Pembrokeshire and have done so for generations.</p>

	    <num>11.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The family as a whole is obviously of great wealth and I heard evidence from EB, who confirmed that as a result of transfers, some of which I think have been relatively recent, from his father and possibly from his mother as well (although I did not enquire as to the precise origin of the donations) that he (EB) has assets net of borrowings of around &#163;3,500,000 in farm land and property. That excludes the valuable home in which he lives, which happens to be owned by his father; his father living in another valuable home which happens to be owned by his wife.</p>

	    <num>12.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The husband told me that his trade or profession is as a copywriter, working in the field of media, but again that does not tell the whole story by any means.  He works within the overall family enterprises as an agent for the family in advising on developments; he is a shareholder and director of the enterprise company that has been set up in order to undertake developments; and he is involved in other aspects concerning the economic life of the village, which have been explained to me and which I do not need to go into.  On any view, although there is no sense of entitlement on his part, his position in terms of financial security is absolutely assured.</p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The parties, having met in 1999, moved to Pembrokeshire in 2002 and began living together in the husband&#8217;s parents&#8217; home and they were married on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2003, having some months before that established a media consultancy company, a service company, in which they each held a 50% shareholding and through which they conducted their media consultancy work.</p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">Shortly after the marriage in February 2003 the enterprise company, which I have just mentioned, was incorporated with four directors, the husband, his brother and his parents each holding a 25% share.</p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">In March 2004 a property on the estate, a cottage, then derelict, was gifted to the husband and wife by the husband&#8217;s parents and the parties worked hard in converting that property into a house, for which purpose they borrowed money, but in addition they invested considerable brawn in making it an attractive property fit for sale, and it was duly sold on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2004. There is a spreadsheet, which is not disputed, which has been produced by the husband which explains with some precision what happened to the proceeds of sale.</p>
	    </content>
	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_16">
	    <num>16.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">For my purposes all I need to note is that from the proceeds of sale certain sums were paid back to the parties to discharge their individual debts, but those individual debts were in truth joint debts, and nobody has disputed otherwise, leaving a surplus, and that surplus was used in three ways.  First &#163;15,000, money that was jointly owned by the husband and wife, was lent to the enterprise company; &#163;21,000 was spent on their new home, which I shall describe in a minute, a farmhouse; and &#163;21,625 was spent by the parties on buying things and living, and there is a list of that which descends even to things like cash at Tesco, which explains exactly how that money was spent.</p>
	    </content>
	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_17">
	    <num>17.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">In 2005, after the cottage had been sold, the parties moved into the farmhouse. It is on the public highway next to the dairy unit, which I think, at that point, although I may be wrong, was in disuse.  It had been, in the past, used as a herdsman's accommodation. It had also been, in the past, rented out. It was not in good shape, and following the moving in significant renovation work was undertaken which was funded, in part, as I have just mentioned, from the proceeds of the cottage, that is the &#163;21,000.  So it can be seen at this point that even though the farmhouse, the title of which was held at that point by the husband&#8217;s father and then later by the husband&#8217;s father and mother, the parties applied their own monies which derived from the cottage. This unquestionably was their money, notwithstanding that it had been gifted to them by the husband&#8217;s father.</p>

This will make necessary the release of the house from the farm mortgage.  Management of the housing development over the next few years will be a demanding full time occupation and CB will need to live close by and attend the office there most days and this is the only suitable house available.  The point of putting the house into trust is to ensure that in the long term it remains available as a farm or estate asset.  We are anticipating it may improve the planning case for the restoration of a disused building opposite for the use of a farm worker or manager.  This would restore in the medium term any value to the secured land that might notionally be lost with the release of the farmhouse.  The completion of this operation will enable me to carry through the long delayed transfer of the farm land to EB.&#8221;</span></p>

It was their matrimonial home for a long time.  They moved in in April 2005.  They lived there together until the end of the marriage in September 2012.  It was the focal point of their marriage and in this regard I remind myself of the important words of Lord Nicholls in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miller -v- Miller [2006] UK HL 24</span>, at paragraph 22, when discussing the conceptual division between matrimonial and non-matrimonial property, he said this:</p>

The statute requires the court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case.  One of the circumstances is that there is a real difference, a difference of source, between (1) property acquired during the marriage otherwise than by inheritance or gift, sometimes called the marital acquest but more usually the matrimonial property, and (2) other property.  The former is the financial product of the parties&#8217; common endeavour, the latter is not.  The parties&#8217; matrimonial home, even if this was brought into the marriage at the outset by one of the parties, usually has a central place in any marriage.  So it should normally be treated as matrimonial property for this purpose.  As already noted, in principle the entitlement of each party to a share of the matrimonial property is the same however long or short the marriage may have been.&#8221;</span></p>

And so in this case I have to resolve the familiar tension between balancing the right to share matrimonial property of which the most important element is the matrimonial home, however provided, with the fact that there is a trust here and the intention of the trust was, as the husband&#8217;s father clearly stated, to ensure that in the long term the property remained available as a farm or estate asset.</p>

There would be, were it to be sold, notional costs of sale of around &#163;11,000, giving a net value, for my purposes, of &#163;314,000.  If this were a straightforward case without trust complications, then having lived in it for nine years, applying paragraph 22 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miller</span> that would, under the sharing principle of the most important piece of matrimonial property, subject always to the question of need, entitle the wife, as a starting point, to half of its value, i.e.  &#163;157,000.

In addition the wife, from her own personal resources, prior to the creation of the trust, contributed &#163;5,000.  In my judgment half of the &#163;36,000, or &#163;18,000 plus the &#163;5,000, a total of &#163;23,000 is a sum that the wife is entitled to recover outright from the trust fund by way of variation.

I am not satisfied that I need even to venture down that road.  It is a complex area of law, and gives rise to the familiar question of whether contributions alone, outside <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 39</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, can give rise to a beneficial interest in circumstances other than through evidencing a common intention or giving rise to a proprietary estoppel.  I believe that were I to have to render a judgment on that the wife would be likely to fail in establishing that her financial contributions give rise to an actual beneficial interest.  It is not necessary for me to do so because I can do justice by varying the trust to make outright provision for her for the value of her contributions which I assess at &#163;23,000, for the reason I have given.</p>

Half of the net value of the farmhouse is &#163;157,000.  She will be getting &#163;23,000 outright, so that leaves &#163;134,000.  That sum will be extracted from the trust and appointed to the wife, but on the terms of a life tenancy.  There will be independent trustees, no power of advancement, and on her death the sum will revert to the estate.  The details will need to be sorted out in circumstances which I will mention.  It therefore follows that the trust will be varied to create a wife&#8217;s fund, of which &#163;23,000 will be outright and &#163;134,000 will be on the life tenancy terms which I have mentioned.</p>

The wife has the two properties which I have mentioned, Pembroke Dock in negative equity of minus &#163;5,890, and 8 Melbourne Road in Bristol with a positive equity of &#163;199,641.  The calculation of the notional Capital Gains Tax, were those properties to be sold, is &#163;26,266.  I take all these figures from Mr Anelay&#8217;s helpful schedule.  In addition she has monies in bank accounts of &#163;3,675, and she owes her father, in relation to the costs of these and the adoption proceedings, &#163;84,000.  This represents the great majority, 85%, of the father&#8217;s savings, and the wife, understandably, would like to be able to repay that just as the husband would like to be able to repay the six figure sum that he has borrowed from his own father for the purpose of this litigation.</p>

On the other hand I cannot ignore the existence of the relationship with Mr P and so I reach the conclusion that the net figure that I leave the wife with of just over &#163;250,000 is sufficient to meet her needs.

In many cases the difficulty of raising a large lump sum immediately may be very real, in which case arrangements for some form of deferred payment may be appropriate, in other cases the husband might prefer to put forward alternative proposals to avoid having to raise a large cash sum, in others the court may be able to find there are ways and means of complying with the order.  In the present case one of the family companies has recently sold a hotel for &#163;500,000 and has bought the building next door to the Sea Hotel.  It appears still to have large liquid assets so that the family are or may be in a position to invest some of these funds in the Sea Hotel, thus freeing some of the husband&#8217;s resources at present invested in it without prejudicing in any way his position as manager.  It is legitimate, as the judge did, to take such matters into account when considering the husband&#8217;s submission that the lump sum should be reduced owing to his difficulties in realising part of his assets, probably, it will be found convenient in cases like this one, to adopt the practice which in the past was used in cases where secured provision was ordered.  The court would indicate the amount to be secured and then adjourn the application to give the husband an opportunity of putting forward proposals for compliance with the order and for the wife and her advisors to consider them.  The court itself refrained from selecting the security unless the parties were unable to reach agreement upon the matter, so in a case like this the husband should be given every opportunity of putting forward a scheme which will enable the order to be complied with within generous time limits and the court should refrain from devising ways and means itself once it is satisfied that the order it makes or intends to make is practicable.  Indeed in some cases it may be found on further consideration that the most practicable way of dealing with the wife&#8217;s position is to make one or other of the orders provided for in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 24</ref> in substitution in whole or in part for the lump sum order, the drawing up of which can be postponed until after discussions have taken place between the parties.&#8221;</span></p>

Nobody sought any kind of adjournment to deal with this suggestion.  There was ample time to seek an adjournment for reflection, if indeed it was the case that reflection needed to be taken, and so I comprehensively reject the criticism in para.13 of the skeleton argument.</p>

So it seems to be the case of the husband, for the purposes of appeal, that the wife here should be deprived of a settlement which would enable her to be housed properly with the child SB, for the periods when SB is with her, because of the demands made on the husband by virtue of his new relationship.  This is directly offensive to the principle affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Vaughan v Vaughan</span> [2011] 1 Fam. 46 at para.37 and 38 where it was said unambiguously by Lord Justice Wilson (as he then was) that an award should certainly not give priority to the claims of a second wife;  <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori</span> I suggest in relation to a new partner who is not married to the husband.</p>

First, there was an absurd argument put up that the property was needed as a herdsman or stockman's house.  Secondly, it is put up that the husband has to live there rather than the other property on the estate where he is currently living because of the demands made by his new relationship and newly arrived child.  In my judgment, the argument in relation to the children's needs and the husband's needs is completely untenable and the appeal in that respect has no realistic prospect of success.</p>

			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-weight:bold">&#8220;The simple point on this appeal is that the trustees do not have the assets available to make the provision ordered.  Their only asset in the home.  They have no cash assets and no income to service any indebtedness.  The consequence absent a rescue from the family, as to which see below, is that the home must be sold in order to make the provision ordered by the judge.  But a sale means there will be no home for CB or the children of the family and prejudices the interests of the beneficiaries&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">As to whether the trustees have access to any other money I would remark that I have established today that the trustees' costs, which were at trial &#163;50,000, and which no doubt will be appreciably more by virtue of the application made in relation to the proposed appeal, are being all entirely met by DB.  So it is, in my view, fantasy for it to be suggested that the trustees do not have access to other resources.</p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The suggestion that I failed to take into account the interests of the other beneficiaries is, in my judgment, completely untenable.  I took them fully into account in para.60 of my judgment, in that I provided that the wife's interests in the great majority of the fund carved out for her would be only as a life tenant, thereby ensuring that on her death the funds would revert to the estate for the benefit of the other beneficiaries.  That is said in the skeleton argument to be so far in the future that it is for practical purposes to extinguish the interests of the remaindermen, but that would be the case anyway if I were not to make any kind of variation in favour of the wife because of the life interest in favour of the husband, where I assume that he will live at least as long as the wife.  So that particular argument demonstrates no merit to me at all.</p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The third and fourth grounds are basically the same thing and suggest that I sought to put improper pressure on the husband's family to satisfy the order.  I did nothing of the sort.  I have given them choices, that is true, but I have not put any pressure on this father, DB, or his brother, EB, to satisfy this award.  If they want to satisfy the award and avoid the sale of the property that is up to them.  If they choose not to then the property will be sold and the property will be converted into cash.  In <span style="font-style:italic">White v White</span>, in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Thorpe memorably stated that the only difference between real property and cash is the sound of the auctioneer's hammer.  In this case, if the family do not rescue, the property will be sold.  It will be divided in half and become two cash funds.  In relation to the cash fund that is retained by the trust, the husband will have a life tenancy under the existing terms of the trust.  In relation to the cash fund that is awarded to the wife, the great majority of that is on life tenancy terms.  I do not regard it as any kind of disadvantage to the estate or to the children if there were to be a sale.  I am not at all satisfied that the husband or the children would suffer any kind of hardship if the property were sold.  If Abbey View is, for the time being, somewhat cramped because the property is sold then so be it.  That is not unjust, in my judgment, particularly where the position of the wife would be that she herself would not be able to live in a property of any particular value as I explained in para.64 and 67 of my judgment.</p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The final ground of appeal is that I failed "to properly or sufficiently consider the extent to which the wife's needs were met by her own or other assets". In the skeleton argument it is said, at para.31, that I "effectively ignored her ownership of two rental properties and the equity in those".  I have to say that when I read that I was startled, to say the least, having regard to the fact that in para.61of the judgment I very explicitly compute the equities in the two properties that are there referred to and take them into account.  So how it can be said that I ignored those is beyond me.  </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The judge referred to the fact, discovered only just before the trial, that the wife had begun a new relationship but considered that her new partner could not be expected to be relied upon.  It is unclear to what extent this second aspect was sufficiently explored at trial&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I cannot understand how Mr. Dew suggests that it is unclear how this second aspect was sufficiently explored.  He was there.  He knows perfectly well that it was explored in some depth and the wife was cross-examined at some length about it.  There was no application made for an adjournment for the wife's boyfriend to be summoned before the court or for further disclosure. Both Mr. Dew and Mr. Anelay were content for the matter to proceed to judgment on the evidence that was given at trial. That aspect was taken into account by me fully in para.64 to 66 of my judgment.  They amount, in effect, to findings of fact which it would, in my view, be impossible to challenge on appeal.  In this respect I am not satisfied that the ground of appeal has any attraction at all.</p>
