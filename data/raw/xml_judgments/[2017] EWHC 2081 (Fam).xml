That was a delay of three months, when these proceedings have been afoot since October of last year.  I made it plain that I would not tolerate such a delay.  </span></p>

I directed the mother to file a statement setting out chapter and verse of every issue that the grandmother took with the statement.  No statement has been filed.  I am told that it was not possible for her solicitors to obtain the appropriate interpreter.  In any event, I am told that the grandmother has sought legal advice and may challenge the assessment.  As matter stand, there is no challenge to the negative viability assessment of the maternal grandmother.  Accordingly, in my judgment the local authority may proceed on the basis of the negative viability assessment of the maternal grandmother.  There is no need for any further assessment to be undertaken.</span></p>

For my part, I see no basis at all for imperilling the timetable of this case, where we are concerned with four very young children, who have now spent seven months of their young lives in foster care and for whom a final decision needs to be made without any further delay.</span></p>

I cannot begin to understand how the father can put forward his father without having discussed with him whether he is even able or prepared to care for all four children.  He is still married to the paternal grandmother, but they live separately and apart, she in this jurisdiction, he in Lithuania.  He is 55 years of age, he lives alone and he has a full-time job.  Five years ago he suffered a heart attack.  How it can be thought that he could possibly be an appropriate alternate carer for four young children ranging in ages from 1 to 7, I cannot begin to conceive.  </span></p>

I am reinforced in refusing any assessment of him because of  the adverse impact it would have on the timetable.  Whether it was a simple and quick Skype assessment, of which I see no purpose at all, or whether it is a longer piece of work undertaken by the independent social worker, which would seriously imperil the timetable, it is simply not merited.  Nor is a further assessment merited in  respect of all the other family members referred to above. I am well alive to the fact that the local authority plan may well be for these children to be adopted.  I am well alive to the fact that I have to be satisfied when considering that plan that nothing else will do in the welfare best interests of the children.  </span></p>

As it is, these proceedings will not be concluded within twenty-six weeks.  That is regrettable.  But, it is my duty, and it is the welfare best interests of the children that these proceedings are determined, whatever the outcome, as soon as ever possible.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There is no written challenge presented by any of the paternal family members, and, once again, the local authority may proceed on the basis of the negative viability assessments filed to date.  In coming to that conclusion, I recognise and acknowledge that I have come to a different view than that of the children&#8217;s Guardian.  I do so because in my judgment the Guardian: (a) has failed to provide a timetable as to when these further assessments could be undertaken and completed, and (b) the Guardian has not, in my judgment, had proper regard to the severe, adverse consequence for these children of any further unwarranted delay.  </span></p>

I also cannot understand why these challenges, or attempts to challenge, emerged so late in the day, when both parties have had perfectly competent legal representatives advising them throughout the entirety of these proceedings.  </span></p>
