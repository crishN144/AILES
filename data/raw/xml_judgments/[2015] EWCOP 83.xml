The issue was whether she had capacity to refuse treatment that would extend her life. The treatment in question is renal dialysis. MacDonald J heard the matter on 13 November. At that hearing he heard oral evidence from three psychiatrists and one of C's daughters, G. He announced his decision on that day, with reasons to follow. He concluded C did have capacity to refuse the treatment and dismissed the application by the Hospital Trust. </p>

I made enquiries through my clerk as to whether notice had been given to the press and, if not, it should be. The message came back that Mr Farmer from the Press Association had been informed and was going to join the hearing.

In the first statement she confirms she was contacted by the BBC to ask whether her client, V, wanted to comment on the case. On contacting V she was informed C had died on Saturday. She states the family had not anticipated the widespread press attention the case could receive. She was informed that the press had been in contact with a number of the family members. C had three daughters, two attended the hearing on 13 November and one of them, G, gave oral evidence. At the hearing the other daughter V was unable to speak to her statement due to what MacDonald J said was <span style="font-style:italic">'the emotions generated by the current situation'.</span> C's youngest daughter is 15 years and is described as being vulnerable to the effect of her being identified as the daughter of the woman described in the judgment. Details of her mother's life have been kept from her, in particular some of the details given in the statements to the court by her older sisters. The same vulnerability applies to C's grandson. V's solicitor set out in her statement the large number of email requests about the case from the press they had fielded during the day. </p>

The terms of the order made it clear it would lapse upon the death of C and that did not deter them giving evidence or providing statements. The question of extending the RRO beyond death was not raised at the hearing on 13 November.</p>

However, notice should have been given to the press through the CopyDirect service once the decision was made to apply for the order. That was not done for reasons that do not stand up to scrutiny. Save where there are compelling reasons these applications must be on notice, however short that notice is. In the event Mr Farmer and Mr Wolanski were able to attend. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.12in">The submission by Mr Wolanski that the issue of the time period of the RRO was known at the hearing on 13 November, that it did not deter the family giving evidence and was not the subject of further consideration by the court on 13 November needs to be viewed in the very difficult and deeply personal issues being considered by the court at that hearing. It is clear from the judgment the hearing was, understandably, extremely difficult for the family, to such an extent that one of C's daughters felt unable to give oral evidence. The focus of that hearing was the issues surrounding C's capacity and her difficult history. The RRO is only mentioned in passing in the judgment.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.12in">The press interest in the case was not anticipated and clearly intensified during the course of 2 December. The impact on the family is set out in the statement from V's solicitor. The position of C's 15 year old daughter is that she has no or limited knowledge of her mother's circumstances and would be at risk of harm, due to her age, if she was identified as being the daughter of C. The same applies to a lesser extent in relation to her older sisters and wider family members.</p>
