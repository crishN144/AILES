He is fortunate to be able to live in a self-contained flat in his parents&#8217; house. He requires 24-hour care, and is in receipt of a significant package of care funded by London Borough of Brent and Brent Clinical Commissioning Group, though the two statutory bodies are engaged in a long-running dispute over what his care needs are and which of them should be providing funding.  In common with the other two young adults, I was struck by how impressively well cared for Oscar is. Also, if I may say so, I had at least a glimpse of how physically and emotionally exhausting it must be for the parents to meet his needs. It is obvious that each of the parents in this case, though sensitive to the challenges they must confront, nonetheless properly regard their responsibilities as a privilege. </span></p>

The first additional principle is that a decision of the court is preferable to the appointment of a deputy and the second is that, if a deputy is appointed, the appointment should be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. In welfare (including health care) matters a deputy is never required in order for care or treatment to be given to a person because section 5 provides sufficient scope for carers and professionals to act. Nevertheless, a deputy may be particularly helpful in cases of dispute. For matters concerning property and affairs, a deputy may be needed in order to provide the authority to deal with contractual matters and where there is an ongoing need for such decisions to be taken. Subsection (5) enables the court to grant the deputy powers or impose duties on him as it thinks necessary to avoid repeated applications to the court. However, it also enables the court to require the deputy to seek consent before taking certain actions. Subsection (6) gives the court an &#8216;own motion&#8217; power to make whatever order is in the person&#8217;s best interests.&#8221; </p>

Paras 5.33 and 5.36 speak in terms of an application being made if there is any doubt or dispute about the doctor&#8217;s assessment of the patient&#8217;s best interests. Although para 6.18 suggests that the court &#8220;has to make&#8221;/&#8220;must be asked to make&#8221; the decision about withholding or withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration from a patient in PVS, that statement seems to have been derived from the case law, which dealt only in terms of good practice, not of legal obligation. And paras 8.18 and 8.19, to which para 6.18 invites reference, say that an application &#8220;should&#8221; be made to the court and that &#8220;as a matter of practice&#8221; such cases &#8220;should be put to the Court of Protection for approval&#8221;, referring to a &#8220;case law requirement to seek a declaration&#8221;, the source of which is given as the Bland case.

I prefer the analysis of Mr McKendrick on behalf of the applicant and accordingly construe the threshold test for the appointment of a deputy, whilst not failing to keep sight in managing the appointment of the need for any deputy to engage in the collaborative approach which will include collaboration with members of the family as enjoined by Hedley J and Baker J in the cases of Re P (Vulnerable Adult: Deputies) and G v E (above) and in taking into account, as any deputy should, the guidance given in the Code of Practice.

In 2007 there were only three PW cases. In 2005 there were ninety-five. There was a significant spike in 2015, for no reason that I have been able to identify and the numbers have remained relatively static since then (averaging around 375 per year). Of course, this must be placed in the context of very significant increases in applications generally. Ms Lindsay has provided some useful information from the OPG which places these appointments in practical context and casts light on the realities of what is involved as a PWD. This data is important in understanding the likely consequences of the different constructions contended for.

This does not extend to legal advice. A deputy will be provided a guidance booklet &#8216;How to be a Health and Welfare Deputy&#8217; (SD4) and will be referred to their duties under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>: Code of Practice&#8230;  </p>

That is two visits in two years.

The visitor will also seek comments from any relevant care provider, etc in order to get their view on how the deputy is acting under their order. Following the visit, the visitor will compile a report that details the visit and the information they have obtained. In each report the visitor rates the visit &#8216;green&#8217;, &#8216;amber&#8217; or &#8216;red&#8217;. A &#8216;green&#8217; visit indicates that the visitor believes there are no concerns regarding the case and will result in the visit schedule as set out in paragraph 17 above.

In some circumstances, OPG may offer further support and guidance to a deputy and signpost them to further information where necessary. Where there is a dispute between a PW deputy and another relevant authority or organisation, OPG will often try to assist those involved in the dispute to resolve the matter and may advise when it might be necessary to consider that an application to the court is made.&#8221; </p>

That was the position prior to the passing of the MCA under the principle of necessity: see Re F (supra) and in particular the speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley. In passing the MCA, Parliament ultimately rejected the Law Commission's proposal of a statutory general authority and opted for the same approach as under the previous law by creating in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> a statutory defence to protect all persons who carry out acts in connection with the care or treatment of an incapacitated adult, provided they reasonably believe that it will be in that person's best interests for the act to be done. Crucially, however, all persons who provide such care and treatment are expected to look to the Code. Certain categories of person are required by the statute, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/42/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42(4)</ref>, to have regard to the Code (for example, anybody acting in relation to the incapacitated person in a professional capacity). In addition, however, as the Code itself makes clear, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> applies more generally to everyone who looks after incapacitated persons, including family carers. Although not legally required to have regard to the Code, the Code itself stipulates that they should follow the guidance contained therein insofar as they are aware of it.&#8221;  </p>

It is emphatically not part of the scheme underpinning <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that there should be one individual who as a matter of course is given a special legal status to make decisions about incapacitated persons. Experience has shown that working together is the best policy to ensure that incapacitated adults such as E receive the highest quality of care. This case is an example of what can go wrong when people do not work together. Where there is disagreement about the appropriate care and treatment, (which cannot be resolved by the methods suggested in Chapter 15) or the issue is a matter of particular gravity or difficulty, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and Code provide that the issue should usually be determined by the court.

Manifestly, it will usually be the case that decisions about complex and serious issues are taken by a court rather than any individual. In certain cases, as explained in paragraphs 8.38 and 8.39 of the Code, it will be more appropriate to appoint a deputy or deputies to make these decisions.

As the examples in paragraphs 8.38 and 8.39 demonstrate, it is sometimes impracticable to insist on decisions being taken by the court. The instances which stand out are those which involve a series of decisions (for example, about medical procedures) and where the assets of an incapacitated adult are of a magnitude that requires regular management. Common sense suggests that the second of these examples is likely to arise more frequently than the first, and that the appointment of deputies is likely to be more common for property and affairs than for personal welfare. &#8230;&#8221; </p>

That does not, however, justify the appointment of family members as deputies simply because they are able and willing to serve in that capacity.

Even then, the appointment must be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. It would be a misreading of the structure and policy of the statute, and a misunderstanding of the concept and role of deputies, to think it necessary to appoint family members to that position in order to enable them better to fulfil their role as carers for P.&#8221;  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.65in">&#8220;I do not consider that this is an appropriate case for the appointment of a welfare deputy. The Code clearly provides that deputies for personal welfare decisions will only be required in the most difficult cases (paragraph 8.38) and that, for most day to day actions or decisions, the decision-maker should be the carer most directly involved with the person at the time (paragraph 5.8). That is simply a matter of common-sense. If a situation arises in which TZ is perceived to be at risk, a decision needs to be taken by the person on the ground who is giving him support. It would be impractical to refer the decision to anyone else, either the Court or a deputy. Any decision that has to be taken arising out of an immediate risk of harm should be taken, so far as possible, collaboratively and informally by TZ's care worker.&#8221; </p>

So those particularised factors have to be weighed against factors that would favour the appointment of a deputy rather than the COP making a series of orders. To my mind this applies whether or not the deputy is appointed to make decisions relating to property and affairs or welfare or both. In both property and affairs cases and welfare cases there will be important one off decisions and in such cases the principles and so factors set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 16(4)</ref> would be likely to point in favour of the COP making the decisions. But in both a need to make a number of decisions on a single matter (e.g. selling a house or a course of treatment), or on a number of day to day matters over a long period (e.g. management of a person's day to day affairs relating to expenditure and/or their care and support plan) will often arise that will clearly outweigh the principles identified in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 16(4)</ref>. In many such cases regular return to the COP would be unnecessarily time consuming, emotionally stressful and expensive and so contrary to P's best interests. I add that it seems to me that a refusal or reluctance based on <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 16(4)</ref>, or a general approach, to appoint a deputy in welfare cases simply because they are welfare cases and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 5</ref> applies is not justified.&#8221;</p>

In a discussion on &#8216;What happens when there are conflicting concerns?&#8217; the Code emphasises that carers or family may disagree with professionals, and that although it might be possible to reach agreement that agreement may not be in the person&#8217;s best interests.  The Code goes on to say that &#8216;Ultimate responsibility for working out best interests lies with the decision-maker&#8217;; it does not imply any restrictions on informal decisions or a duty to apply to court in the case of such disputes.&#8221; </p>

To disregard the very clear lessons from both research and public enquires, stretching back over thirty years, which emphasise the importance of agencies working together in order most effectively to promote the best interests of the vulnerable, would be irresponsible. Thus, evaluating the proportionality of the two options is misconceived. They are apples and pears.

Instead, it sets out a process to be followed when taking a decision. In some cases, the process will be reasonably straightforward in others it will be more extensive and formal. It is properly described as an exercise requiring subtlety and nuance and must not be skewed by giving weight to one particular factor, such as P&#8217;s wishes and feelings. To my mind this would have the consequence of replacing one perceived &#8216;presumption&#8217; with another. The magnetic north in the legislation is that every P is an individual and every decision is issue specific. Furthermore, promoting supported decision making is, to my mind, more likely to be achieved by the informal holistic approach contemplated by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 5</ref> MCA.  </span></p>

It is also discernible that the Court is gradually and increasingly understanding its responsibility to draw back from a risk averse instinct to protect P and to keep sight of the fundamental responsibility to empower P and to promote his or her autonomy.

The extension of parental responsibility beyond the age of eighteen, under the aegis of a PWD, may be driven by a natural and indeed healthy parental instinct but it requires vigilantly to be guarded against. The imposition of a legal framework which is overly protective risks inhibiting personal development and may fail properly to nurture individual potential. The data which I have analysed (paragraph 26 above) may, I suspect, reflect the stress and anxiety experienced in consequence of the transition from child to adult services. As a judge of the Family Division and as a judge of the Court of Protection I have seen from both perspectives the acute distress caused by inadequate transition planning. The remedy for this lies in promoting good professional practice. It is not achieved by avoidably eroding the autonomy of the young incapacitous adult; </span></p>

The existing law erects a presumption against a child giving evidence which requires to be rebutted by anyone seeking to put questions to the child. That cannot be reconciled with the approach of the European Court of Human Rights, which always aims to strike a fair balance between competing Convention rights. Article 6 requires that the proceedings overall be fair and this normally entails an opportunity to challenge the evidence presented by the other side. But even in criminal proceedings account must be taken of the article 8 rights of the perceived victim: see <span style="font-style:normal">SN v Sweden</span>, App no 34209/96, 2 July 2002. Striking that balance in care proceedings may well mean that the child should not be called to give evidence in the great majority of cases, but that is a result and not a presumption or even a starting point.&#8221; </p>
