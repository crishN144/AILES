The father&#8217;s position was unjustified in circumstances where the court in Country B was seised of welfare matters concerning X, with those proceedings having been instigated by the father. Mr Gupta submits the father should be liable for the costs incurred by the mother&#8217;s first solicitor, as even though their costs were incurred prior to the issue of these proceedings as the mother had no choice but to instruct them in the light of the father&#8217;s conduct.</p>

The parties were living here together for a number of months prior to their separation. This was a summary process where the court made no factual findings and the court should, in those circumstances, be cautious in seeking to infer any conclusions from the father&#8217;s early instruction of solicitors in this jurisdiction or any other motive for the father&#8217;s behaviour as suggested on behalf of the mother. Further, she submits, it needs to be viewed in the context of the mother&#8217;s evidence that she had decided not to return to this jurisdiction with X, despite the return tickets and the plan to return when they went to Country B in December 2020. In the correspondence between solicitors in 2023, prior to the issue of these proceedings, the mother did not assert X&#8217;s habitual residence was in Country B and reference was made to issuing proceedings in this jurisdiction for leave to remove the child from the jurisdiction. In the judgment the court referred to the time the parties were here with X in early 2023 as being by consent albiet a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;fragile temporary arrangement&#8217;.</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s first solicitors stance in their letters was to issue proceedings here and part of their costs include instruction of leading counsel to advise whose practice is described as being primarily in high value financial remedy claims. These proceedings were not issued until after the change in solicitors and the costs of the first solicitors were not included in the Form N260 filed before the final hearing. As a consequence, Ms McKenna submits, they should not form part of any order against the father.</p>

The order made at that hearing was costs in the application so, Ms McKenna submits, part of the mother&#8217;s claim for costs includes the father&#8217;s interim application for contact which, she submits had to be made due to the mother&#8217;s failure to properly engage in that issue.</p>

There is some force in the mother&#8217;s position about the father&#8217;s stance taken in relation to habitual residence and consent/acquiescence. This is particularly when he had instigated steps prior to December 2022 to issue divorce proceedings in Country B, which were based on the mother&#8217;s habitual residence there and the petition actively sought arrangements regarding X to be considered within those proceedings, thereby accepting that court had jurisdiction. In addition, the father had taken the active step to serve those proceedings just prior to the mother coming here with X. That was at the same time as both parties signed the document that confirmed X would be absent from Country B until 10 June 2023 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;at the latest&#8217;.</span> All that giving the mother the reassurance she sought.</p>

The father accepted X&#8217;s habitual residence was in Country B when he issued the divorce proceedings in October 2022. From the text messages exchanged between the parties in late 2022 he knew the mother&#8217;s concerns if things did not work out between them if she and X came here, and that she wanted reassurance she would be able to return to Country B with X.</p>

The father&#8217;s position in this litigation was unhelpful from X&#8217;s welfare perspective. It caused inevitable uncertainty and insecurity for her due to the inability of longer term plans to be made until the mother&#8217;s application was determined, there were issues of interim contact that required determination by the court. However, they could equally have been considered, if the father had not defended these proceedings, in Country B where the father had issued divorce proceedings where such issues could be determined.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having stood back and looked at the wider canvas in this case and not without some hesitation, I have reached the conclusion that there should be no order as to costs in these proceedings. I agree that the costs incurred with the mother&#8217;s first solicitor do not appear to wholly relate to the issues raised in this application and were in the context of different applications being considered. In relation to the costs incurred in these proceedings, whilst I rejected the father&#8217;s defence as not reflecting the reality of the position, particularly in the circumstances of the documents he had signed and the divorce proceedings he had issued in Country B, when considering the wider context of the case, the background to the parties relationship and the decisions made since December 2020, there should be no order as to costs.</p>
