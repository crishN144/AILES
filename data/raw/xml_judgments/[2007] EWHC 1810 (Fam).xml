	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I found the matrimonial assets to be worth a total of &#163;2,669,715 (paragraph [163]). Even if the wife's case in relation to the ownership of HDC had succeeded &#8211; which it did not &#8211; the matrimonial assets would still have been worth only &#163;4,290,315. It is therefore with considerable dismay, though I have to confess without any surprise, that I have to record that the costs incurred in this litigation amount to no less than &#163;1,104,347.46 (inclusive of VAT). That is 41.36% of the matrimonial assets. Even if one strips out for this purpose the costs &#8211; &#163;109,073.40 &#8211; incurred by the trustees, the combined costs of the wife and the husband &#8211; &#163;995,274.06 &#8211; amount to 37.28% of the matrimonial assets.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Another way of illustrating the ruinous cost of this litigation is to quantify the impact on the parties of the costs they have incurred. I awarded the wife a total of &#163;1,339,650. Her costs amount to no less than &#163;510,531.10. So even before facing the claims being made against her by the husband and the trustees she is left with only &#163;829,118.90 (61.89%) of her award. Were I to accede in full to the husband's and the trustees' applications, she would be left with very much less. Similar calculations could be made in relation to the impact of this litigation on the husband. </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">It will be recalled that the wife served her Form A on 10 July 2003. The trial started on 12 December 2005. I handed down judgment on 29 January 2007 (the long delay is explained in paragraphs [178]-[179]). The order was eventually finalised on 4 April 2007 though not made until 16 April 2007. The following Table shows the costs incurred by each party (i) prior to the commencement of the trial (but excluding counsel's brief fees), (ii) during the trial (including counsel's brief fees) and down to judgment, (iii) from judgment to finalisation of the order and (iv) since the order was finalised &#8211; ie., in preparing for and arguing the question of costs.</p>

An order was made by the Deputy Bailiff sitting in the Samedi Division of the Royal Court of Jersey on 20 November 2003. The order is relevant only because it reveals the wife's case as being that "the assets in this case exceed &#163;6.7 million," whilst the husband's case was recorded as being (much more realistically as events proved) that the assets were "no more than &#163;2.5 million, divided broadly equally between the parties." I should add that at one stage during his submissions Mr Wagstaffe sought to place some reliance upon the cross-undertakings in damages and costs which the Royal Court of Jersey had taken from the wife. But this reliance, as Mr Moor was quick to point out, was wholly misconceived, the cross-undertakings extending only to loss caused to the husband or costs incurred by the trustees as a result of "this order" &#8211; the Jersey order &#8211; and thus not having any wider significance.</p>

The wife replied with a further schedule of deficiencies on 16 August 2004, which produced a response from the husband on 2 September 2004. A further schedule of deficiencies followed the next day on 3 September 2004, producing (under the spur of an order made by District Judge Bowman on 6 September 2004 to which a penal notice was attached) further answers from the husband on 29 September 2004. The wife returned to the attack on 16 December 2004 with both a further schedule of deficiencies and a supplemental questionnaire, to which the husband (under the compulsion of an order made by Holman J on 17 December 2004) responded on 17 and 19 January 2005 respectively. (I should note that Holman J's order contained a recital making it clear that in the event that the order was not fully complied with the wife would invite the court to draw inferences adverse to the husband.) There matters seem to have rested until, starting with a letter from the wife's solicitors dated 11 October 2005, there was correspondence relating to the production of HDC's accounts for the year ending 30 June 2005. </p>

Certainly &#8230; it was doomed the moment Mr St George's witness statement was filed and it became apparent that he was prepared to go into the witness box to defend himself. At that point the wife and her advisers were faced with a simple if stark choice: they could either accept Mr St George's evidence &#8211; which would have been the end of their case &#8211; or they could, if they thought they had the material to justify such an attack, have mounted a frontal attack on Mr St George's credibility and professional integrity. Understandably, Mr Moor shrank from the latter course. But a case which, as I have said, should probably never have been brought, was allowed to continue, limping on to inevitable defeat and, in the process, significantly increasing both the length and the cost of the proceedings."</p>

A little later Holman J observed of the trustees that "it is plain as a pikestaff that essentially they, and the husband, will be playing to the same song sheet &#8230; Plain as a pikestaff on what little I've read already." He added, "the trustees and the husband are mounting the same case, and the wife must be protected." The order made by Holman J gave the trustees permission to intervene and be joined as interveners "upon the following terms and conditions which, if they elect actually to intervene, the trustees will be deemed to have accepted," one of those conditions, set out in paragraph 1(iii) of the order, being that "in no circumstances will the trustees seek an order for costs directly or indirectly against the &#8230; wife."</p>

The notice of application indicated that the trustees would be seeking the adjournment of the application, to be dealt with when the court was dealing with the other costs issues. The grounds of the application, as set out in the notice of application, were in substance twofold: first, that the court "had no jurisdiction to fetter its own discretion in the way in which Holman J sought to do;" and, second, that "the basis upon which the intervention was originally made has been superseded by further developments in the litigation" which "in any event would have made it appropriate for the Intervenors to seek to intervene," namely the emergence of the parallel trading issue. </p>

Although the wife said that this was a sum which Mr G was owed by way of bonus &#8211; owed, it may be noted, by HDC and not by her &#8211; the fact is that he was being paid for his evidence, knew that he was being paid for his evidence, knew that his evidence was crucial in relation to the allegation of cash dealing, and knew perfectly well what the wife wanted to hear him saying in the witness box.

True it is that the husband was shockingly tardy in producing the accounts of HDC for the year to 30 June 2005, but that generated few additional costs and in any event went only to the question of the value of HDC. And despite the very clear marker put down by the wife before Holman J on 17 December 2004, she wholly failed to establish, either thereafter or at trial, that there had been any further significant non-disclosure by the husband. </p>

His evidence if true, and Mr Moor did not seek to mount a frontal attack on his credibility, sounded the death knell for any case on sham (see paragraph [87]).

These complaints fall into two categories. First, says Mr Moor, there was what I might call litigation misconduct in the narrow sense of the expression: in addition to the husband's failures in relation to disclosure, his obstruction of the accountants (and the valuer) in their endeavours to value HDC and its assets; his failure to comply timeously with orders of the court; his failure to deal promptly or in some cases at all with issues raised in correspondence; all this bearing out the threat he is alleged to have made to the wife that he was looking forward to "giving your solicitor the run around." Secondly, says Mr Moor, there were such matters as the husband's attempt to remove the wife as a director of HDC; his failure to pay the outgoings on Drum Grange and on the Antigua property; his delay in paying the wife's maintenance; and his delay in returning the executed deed of transfer of Drum Grange and in paying the wife (as agreed) an advance instalment out of the proceeds of sale. Much of this is disputed by the husband both as to the facts and, with somewhat less plausibility, as to its relevance.</p>

Mr Moor seeks to parry this blow by pointing to what he calls the "damning" judgment of Mr Registrar Turner. The scant reference I made to that judgment indicates its peripheral significance but Mr Moor's choice of words is telling. I have little doubt that the wife's case in relation to sham found its origin in Mr Registrar Turner's judgment and that she attached (or was advised to attach) undue weight to what it said. </p>

A claim that was always central to her case, and even more importantly in the present context was always central to the wife's thinking about her case, was (see paragraph [87]), probably always doomed to complete failure and certainly doomed the moment Mr St George's witness statement was filed and it became apparent that he was prepared to go into the witness box to defend himself. As I said (paragraph [62]), the wife's case on sham was lacking in any factual basis and in large measure it was in any event misconceived in law. The simple fact, in my judgment, is that the entire litigation was skewed from the outset by the wife's determined pursuit of a quite hopeless allegation that the trusts were shams. That allegation was, as Mr Howard rightly says, the cornerstone of the wife's case.</p>

But it was the wife's pursuit of a number of issues on which she failed (five out of the six issues which fell to be decided at trial), and in particular her pursuit of the allegation of sham, which turned this from a case which could have been concluded in (say) 5 days &#8211; Mr Howard says even that estimate is being generous to the wife &#8211; into a case that took 14 days and which, in consequence, inflated the costs from the substantial to the very substantial. The simple fact is that a very large part of the costs of this litigation was generated by the issues on which the wife lost, issues, moreover, which were pursued with tenacious zeal to the very end.</p>

Such an order would not fairly reflect the realities of the litigation during that period. Mr Moor for his part asserts that the wife should have all her costs. Again, I do not agree. Such an order would not fairly reflect the realities of the litigation, in particular the wife's zealous pursuit of so many issues on which she ultimately failed. Nor in particular can the wife seek to shelter (as in effect she does) behind the inadequacies in the husband's disclosure as justifying the stance she was adopting.

As Mr Moor points out, that principle is reflected in rule 2.69D(1), which provides that in considering whether it would be unjust or just to make an order for costs in this context the court must take account of all the circumstances including "the information available to the parties at the time the offer was made" and "the conduct of the parties with regard to the giving or refusing to give information for the purpose of enabling the offer to be made or evaluated."

I can see no justification for this approach, though to be fair to the wife it is merely an aspect of her wider claim that she should have all her costs down to and including 12 December 2005. I have already explained why she should not have her costs prior to 22 July 2005 and why, on the contrary, she must pay the husband's costs from 22 July 2005 to 11 December 2005. Precisely the same reasoning as led to my conclusion in relation to the latter period applies to the trial itself. The husband is accordingly entitled to his costs of the trial and thereafter of the period until judgment, not merely from 13 December 2005 to 28 January 2007, as the wife accepts, but also of the first day of the trial.

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">By parity of reasoning the husband is likewise entitled to his costs from 29 January 2007 to 4 April 2007. That leads inevitably, in my judgment, from my decision as to the consequences of the husband's successful Calderbank offers. It also follows, despite Mr Moor's protests to the contrary, from the wife's proper concession that the husband is entitled to his costs from 13 December 2005 to 28 January 2007. There is nothing in the events which took place between 20 January 2007 and 4 April 2007, and nothing in the husband's conduct of the litigation during that period, to disentitle him to the costs to which he would otherwise quite plainly be entitled. The husband is entitled, in my judgment, to his costs from 29 January 2007 to 4 April 2007.</p>

This is not a case where there is a great disparity of wealth between the husband and the wife. On the contrary, I awarded the wife a fraction over 50% of the matrimonial assets. I bear in mind that the husband may have certain expectations under the trusts and conceivably (though he denies it convincingly) under the estate of his now deceased brother Anthony, just as I bear in mind that the husband, with the advantage of HDC's business, may (although this is far from certain) be better able than the wife to maintain or improve his financial position. I accept that the order I propose to make will significantly impair the wife's ability to maintain herself in the style to which she has become accustomed, but the brute fact &#8211; and fact it is &#8211; is that the wife has brought this upon herself. It was the wife, whatever may be said against the husband (and I have already taken his conduct into account in arriving at my conclusions in relation to costs), who chose to make this litigation much more complicated and expensive than it needed to be. It was the wife who chose to reject a series of generous Calderbank offers and whose unrealistic approach to the litigation is only exemplified by the terms of her Calderbank counter-proposals.</p>

In all the circumstances justice will best be done if I order the wife to pay 50% of the trustees' costs of the argument about the costs. That, on their figures, comes to &#163;3,932.75.</p>

Bearing in mind the great delays there have been in the past in agreeing previous orders I have made, I am going to direct that a draft (to be agreed between Mr Howard and Mr Wagstaffe) of the order being sought by the husband and the trustees is to be served on the wife's representatives (and sent at the same time to me) by no later than 12 noon on Wednesday 18 July 2007. A copy of that draft, amended to show any different provisions being contended for by the wife, is to be served on the husband's and the trustees' representatives (and sent at the same time to me) by no later than 12 noon on Tuesday 24 July 2007. If the parties cannot agree, then I would propose to decide any remaining issues on the basis of written submissions, rather than putting the parties to the further expense of a hearing which, if past experience is anything to go by, may well be difficult to arrange at a time convenient to all. I am sitting in London until 3 August 2007. I make it clear that I am determined to finalise the order before I leave.</p>

I have had occasion before to deplore the expenditure &#8211; one is tempted to say the waste &#8211; of money in such cases: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (Maintenance Pending Suit)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/1834" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 1834 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 1834 (Fam)</ref> at para [46]. Other judges have also expressed their concerns. A very recent example is provided by <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Wood v Rost</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2007/1511" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 1511 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 1511 (Fam)</ref>, where, speaking of a case which had been conducted at "vast expense," the Deputy Judge lamented that the late Mr Charles Dickens was no longer alive to write a 21st century sequel to Bleak House. The simile, if I may say so, is all too apt. The accusatory finger which in the 19th century was appropriately pointed at the High Court of Chancery is, in the modern world, more appropriately pointed at the Family Division.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The other point relates to the impact of all this on the wife. The wife, out of her award of &#163;1,339,650, has to meet her own costs of &#163;510,531.10, thus reducing what she is left with to &#163;829,118.90, or 61.89%, of her award. On top of that she has to pay the husband and the trustees costs which (see paragraph [264] above) will swallow up a further &#163;244,281.25 [Postscript: this figure has now been agreed (see below), subject only to deduction of the sum of &#163;2,065.19 referred to in paragraph [202] above] thus reducing what she is left with yet further to only &#163;584,837.65, or 43.65% of her award. (The husband does not escape lightly, for he is left having to pay the balance of his costs &#8211; some &#163;275,000.) That is a heavy price for the wife to have to pay, but it is the consequence of the misplaced zeal with which she chose to conduct a case built on exiguous foundations. I only hope that others will pay heed and that similar cases will in future be pursued with more circumspection.</p>
