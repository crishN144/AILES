I specifically invited the Claimants (and this was recorded on the face of my order) to take a critical view of their particulars of claim, to see what remained in issue. I encouraged them to consider carefully what outstanding relief they sought, and to provide to the Local Authority a detailed breakdown of their costs.  I specifically encouraged the parties to negotiate realistically.  </p>

In mid-January 2017, lawyers for the parties met at a round table conference, and settled the substantive issues, leaving only the issue of the costs of both sets of proceedings for determination.   The issue of costs has particular significance because of the impact of <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10" uk:canonical="2012 c. 10" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012</ref></span> (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10" uk:canonical="2012 c. 10" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LASPO 2012</ref></span>&#8217;) on any award of damages.</p>

No reading list was provided, and only the sketchiest agreed note of the points of agreement.   I was advised at the hearing on 8 February 2017 that the overall cost of the two associated claims was in excess of &#163;120,000, all of which &#8211; one way or another &#8211; are to be paid from public funds, unless I make an order against the lawyers responsible.   I am dismayed that the preparation of this case has been undertaken in a way which was not only contrary to my formal direction, but was wholly disproportionate to the issues.  I deprecate the unwarranted expenditure.  </p>

The mother is believed to suffer some minor mental ill-health, and she is hearing impaired.  The father at times struggles to manage his frustrations at times, and has displayed controlling and aggressive behaviours to others.  Both parents have received assistance from adult social care over the last 8 to 10 years, and during the mother&#8217;s pregnancy local health services had been involved with the family during 2015 in planning for the birth of their first baby.  In spite of these challenges, there was no pre-birth referral to children&#8217;s services.</p>

It was suggested that the mother had no family support, and that the father was expressing unorthodox views about the need for sterilisation of bottles, and the benefits of formula milk.  It was nonetheless noted, in the referral, that the paternal grandmother of the baby was being supportive to the couple and was planning to move in with them at least in the short-term after discharge from hospital.  </p>

This was, indeed, planned for later that day.  The social worker claims that she advised the mother that the Local Authority would be issuing care proceedings, and making an urgent application for an interim care order.  The mother disputes that she was given this information.  The father was not on the ward during the social work visit, and plainly did not receive (indeed could not have received) any such information.  The mother was asked to sign a <span style="font-style:italic">section 20</span> agreement for the accommodation of the baby, and she apparently did so, notwithstanding that ward staff had some minor concerns about her capacity; the social worker was of the view that the mother understood what was being asked of her.</p>

Early in the hearing, the District Judge was informed by the Local Authority&#8217;s solicitor that the parents knew that the hearing was taking place. This assertion was repeated to the Judge during the hearing no fewer than three times.  The solicitor further informed the Judge that the parents agreed with the plan for CZ to be removed from their care; this was not accurate, at least so far as the father was concerned.  The order which was made at the conclusion of the hearing reflected, erroneously, that the application had been heard &#8220;on notice&#8221; to the respondent parents; separately it was recorded that the hearing was conducted &#8220;upon the parents having been informed of the hearing but not in attendance at court&#8221;.

The solicitors for the child did not raise in this letter, and the Guardian herself did not raise in her report, any query or objection to the fact that a hearing took place in the parents&#8217; absence, and in the absence of Cafcass, on 13 November 2015, yet this was obviously known to Ms. H by this time.</p>

The failure of the Local Authority to notify the Claimants that the hearing was taking place on the afternoon of 13 November was particularly egregious; misleading the District Judge no fewer than three times that the parents knew of the hearing aggravates the culpability yet further.   This infringement will rightly be subject of a declaration of unlawfulness (see above), and to a very great extent this represents the essential vindication of the right which they have asserted.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The separation of a baby from his parents represents a very substantial interference with family life, and requires significant justification.  In this case, my assessment of the seriousness of the interference has been moderated by two facts: first, because the actual arrangement effected under the interim care order, with CZ living with the paternal grandmother for the period while the parents enjoyed virtually unrestricted contact, was a variation of a plan which the parents had formed with Health Professionals prior to and following the birth in any event, namely for the paternal grandmother to reside with them for that period, and secondly, because once the parents and Cafcass obtained legal representation and were able to consider the situation with legal advice, none of them sought to challenge the living arrangement immediately and did not in fact do so until 20 January 2016. </p>

Nor does it wish to reduce the chance of their co-operation around the future life of the child by casting one as the successful party entitled to his costs and another as the unsuccessful party obliged to pay them. The proposition applies in its fullest form to proceedings between parents and other relations; but it also applies to proceedings to which a local authority are a party. Thus, even when a local authority's application for a care order is dismissed, it is unusual to order them to pay the costs of the other parties. But the proposition is not applied where, for example, the conduct of a party has been <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">reprehensible</span> or the party's stance has been <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">beyond the band of what is reasonable</span>&#8221; (emphasis by underlining added).</p>

In any event, I am wholly satisfied that the Claimants have been able to access a court effectively, and have a remedy in the form of a declaration and an award of damages.  The fact that the damages award is vulnerable to recoupment by operation of a statutory charge for costs arises because Parliament, in devising a scheme for assisting litigants to bring legal claims, has also devised a method of recoupment; the significant benefits of public funding to enable litigants to prosecute legitimate claims do not come without some trade-off.

Ms. Irving QC indicated that if the Court approved it, the Local Authority would not contest this approach.
