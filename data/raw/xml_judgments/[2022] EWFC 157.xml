They all involved situations where the status of the legal parent was in doubt due to administrative errors made by clinic staff during fertility treatment. In each case, the court took a purposive and constructive interpretation of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>) to ensure the children and parents involved in these cases obtained orders that gave them the legal status that had been intended.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The situation in this case is not one that has arisen before. For reasons which will be set out below, neither the father or mother completed the PP or WP forms, which are the prescribed forms that secure the legal parent status relating to children born following fertility treatment. There is an internal consent (IC) form that has been signed by both parents, but unlike the IC forms in the other cases this form does not contain a parenthood notice. The issue that I have to consider is whether the written documents that were signed meet the requirements for the parenthood conditions under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court has had the enormous benefit of a detailed skeleton argument on behalf of the father prepared by Ms Fottrell QC and Ms Elsworth, both specialists in this area, supported by their instructing solicitor, Ms Dally, who is equally expert in this field. Having heard oral submissions on 27 January 2022 the court announced its decision to make the declaration sought. This judgment sets out the reasons for that order.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Bearing in mind the intolerable stress and anxieties these cases cause consideration may need be given to restoring the declaration that had previously been in IC Forms. I take on board the points made by Mr Burrows, on behalf of the Clinic, including that the intention behind removing the declaration from the IC Form was to encourage compliance with signing the PP and WP Forms. However, it may still be sensible to consider the declaration being restored to these forms as a safety net, to deal with situations such as arose in this case caused by human error, which remains a risk however robust the system may be. Mr Burrows outlined the constructive and positive steps the Clinic has taken since this incident, including a flagging system when a change is noted on the system, which triggers a full check and the revised guidance the Clinic now operates under. In this case, if the revised system was in place, the change in marital status would have highlighted the forms WP and PP needed to be completed.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>In addition, at paragraph 20 below the applicant&#8217;s skeleton argument outlines how some of the wording in the PBR form could be improved to make the position clearer.</p>

The father completed and signed this form on 6 December 2020. The Clinic accepts that this form should not have been sent to the father, as the parents were not married and that he should have been sent a PP Form. In her statement Dr Gadd accepts that this error came about as the Clinic&#8217;s computer system had the father marked as &#8216;married&#8217; and the assumption was the parents were married to each other.</p>

That statutory language is tracked in the Form WP formula, 'I consent to my partner &#8230; being the legal parent'. These words do not appear anywhere in either the Barts Form IC or the MFS Form IC. But this, in my judgment, is not fatal. The Form IC is, as we have seen, a single composite document which has accordingly to be read and construed as a whole, the first section or sections providing for W's consent to the various stages of the IVF process and the final page providing for the signed consent of W's partner. If W is consenting to the treatment and, in the same document, W's partner is consenting to becoming the parent of the child resulting from that treatment, it seems to me to follow by necessary implication, even if not by express words, that W is consenting to her partner being the other parent&#8230;.&#8217;</span></p>

These sections do not prescribe a specific form. What is required is a 'notice' and that is not defined, although I would agree with Miss Broadfoot that, given the context, what is required is a document of some formality. The argument must be that it is the combined operation of s 12(1)(d) of the 1990 Act, which in effect elevates this requirement into a condition of the licence, coupled with the words 'treatment provided &#8230; under the licence' in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 37(1)</ref>(a) and 44(1)(a) (and the corresponding words 'being so treated' in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 37(1)</ref>(b) and 44(1)(b)), that invalidates what would otherwise be a consent valid for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 37</ref> or s 44</span>.&#8217;</p>

Suppose that what are completed are copies of Form WP and Form PP which, in their operative parts, follow to the last dot and comma the text of the required forms, but which omit all the explanatory text which is included in those required forms. Can Parliament really have intended that to be fatal? Surely not. So, surely, what one is looking for is compliance with the substance, not slavish adherence to a form.
