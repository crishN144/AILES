I indicated I approved this course of action however, given the significance of the decision for the parents I considered it was appropriate to provide written reasons for my decision.

On review the clinicians were not unduly concerned and she was discharged. It is important to note that none of the concerns identified two days later were part of her presentation.</span></p>

She was felt to have been gasping and her breathing was very slow. Whilst under observation she started to have a seizure and received medication and was brought into A&amp;E. She was kept under observations which confirmed a very low breathing rate together with gasping. Over time her breathing began to improve and by the morning of the next day was felt to have returned to an acceptable level and was ready for discharge. As part of their review tests were undertaken which indicated X had morphine in her urine. Morphine may have impacted on X&#8217;s respiratory presentation and may have contributed to or caused her low respiration. An investigation did not provide a satisfactory explanation as to how this had come to be the case.</span></p>

This related to benzodiazepine and midazolam. Both drugs had the potential to impact on respiratory depression quite aside from the potential for morphine to have the same impact and had been recorded as being administered on that day. The applicant would have to satisfy the Court that this was not a case in which the child had a non-harmful level of morphine in her system but that her respiratory changes had arisen when this was overlaid by other treatment or that the other treatment was quite separately the cause of the respiratory decline.</span></p>

This questioned the ability of AH to administer morphine in the relevant period. Further, there was a suggestion that there was no opportunity in any event open to AH to administer the drug on the day in question given her account of constant nursing supervision at the home on that day. Further, the allegation sat rather uncomfortably with a broad canvas point as to AH&#8217;s consistent push back against medical advice which appeared to suggest efforts should not be taken to prolong X&#8217;s life if her position deteriorated.

I am grateful for the speed with which this was provided. In his conclusions the expert made clear the positive morphine result on admission could be plausibly explained by either the agreed administration of the same on 29 December 2023 or a subsequent administration. On the information available (which was unlikely to change) either were plausible and the expert was unable to offer an opinion on which might more readily explain the results. In drawing this conclusion, the expert drew attention to the difficulties arising from the fact that whilst the urine results could establish the existence of morphine in the sample it could not offer any information as to the quantity of morphine in the sample. The expert advised one could not undertake a &#8216;back calculation&#8217; so as to better answer the question. &#8216;Without evidence as to the quantity of the drug in the urine and the amount ingested it would be impossible to rationally assess how long the morphine would be detected in the urine.&#8217;</span></p>

Such evidence would need to establish to a satisfactory level that the drug was not found as a consequence of the acknowledged administration in December 2023. Without this there would be no case that could be brought against AH. There is no suggestion that the December administration was anything other than proper. Yet for the reasons given by the expert this cannot be established. He explains why he cannot select a later administration as being any more plausible than a December administration. </span></p>

Finally, it elevates as being far more plausible the logic of the treatment regime on the day (benzodiazepine and midazolam) as being contributory to the deterioration in respiration following the noted seizure activity whilst at home. </span></p>

In contrast they point to a handover between the nurses at around 7.50am with the night nurse updating the day nurse as to a deterioration in the X&#8217;s breathing in the last hour and whilst in the care of the night nurse. They confirm the night nurse administered Midazalom as per instructions. The statement evidence suggests AH attends the room after the night nurse has left the premises. </span></p>

I need to make clear this decision does not equate to an implied criticism of the applicant for bringing the application. Pending receipt of the updating information, and notwithstanding there were issues with the case, it was entirely appropriate for the applicant to take a safeguarding approach to the circumstances and to bring the application. At first blush the case had a level of complexity and uncertainty and justified a cautious approach. </span></p>

A focus on avoiding delay was particularly important in a case in which the child in question has ongoing significant medical challenges and in which every moment spent with her family is of immense value both to her and to them.
