No explanation was provided.  The parents were arrested on suspicion of causing the injury and R was placed in foster care, where he remains.  </span></p>

The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.  All relevant evidence, and not just medical evidence, must be taken into account.

However, the fact that a witness may have lied about one thing does not mean that they are lying about everything.</span></p>

R&#8217;s bones are normal and there is no sign of any condition that would predispose him to fracturing.  The cause of the fracture was severe, excessive, twisting, torsional force applied to the end of the bone.  It would not occur from normal domestic handling, over-exuberant play or rough, inexperienced parenting.  The perpetrator would have realised that their actions were inappropriate and likely to cause harm, though they may not have realised that they had caused a fracture.  At the time of the incident, R would have been in pain and shown signs of distress that would have lasted for some moments.</span></p>

He considers it likely that the fracture was sustained at most only a few hours before R was first seen to be in discomfort when his leg was moved or handled.  Fractures of this kind are strongly linked to the child being "grabbed and yanked".  It might be caused by a momentary loss of self-control by a carer. R would have cried and is likely to have been upset for some minutes.  After that, he might have appeared to be fine unless the leg was handled.  It is difficult to say whether the non-perpetrator would be aware that something had happened.</span></p>

The mother has described handling his legs when putting him into a pool flotation device.  She also describes him being manipulated when the x-rays were taken.  Dr Johnson and Dr Mecrow entirely discount these as explaining the fracture.  Dr Mecrow describes the suggestion that the fracture was caused by the radiologist when the child was being investigated for an abnormal leg as "close to nonsense".</span></p>

She went and lifted him out of his basket and went to change his nappy.  When she lifted up his legs to slip the nappy under him, he cried a bit.  She thought it strange, so she lifted him up again and he cried again.  She thought that it might be due to discomfort from a hernia in his right groin.  She put his nappy on and gave him some Calpol, the first time she had done so for some days.  (The mother described this sequence twice in her evidence in chief: in cross-examination she described giving Calpol after feeding R.)  She took him downstairs, gave him his bottle, winded him and put him back upstairs in his basket.  By the time he was asleep, it had taken about an hour.  She went back to bed.  She nudged the father, who was half asleep, and told him that R&#8217;s hernia was giving him a problem.  They agreed to see how he was in the morning.  The father says he does not remember this conversation -- in his evidence he said he might have been talking in his sleep.</span></p>

At that point she saw that he was holding his right leg up, something that he did when he was a newborn baby.  He was not crying or upset, he was settled.  She thought that it was strange, so she decided to telephone her mother, even though it was only about 5.30 am.  She did not get through, so she decided to get medical advice by calling 111.

That is not the situation here.  Both these parents are responsible for the removal of R, because of their joint decision not to tell the truth.   Causing a serious injury to a baby is a terrible thing, but experience shows that it can be done by an otherwise good parent in a moment of impatience and loss of control.  What is to my mind just as blameworthy, if not more so, is a deliberate cover-up of a kind that has taken place here.</span></p>
