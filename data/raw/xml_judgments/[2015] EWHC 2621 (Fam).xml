	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The principle of open justice has deep roots. Lord Bingham, writing in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">The Rule of Law</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> (Allen Lane, 2010, p8), stated that at the heart of the concept of the rule of law is the principle that laws should be publicly made and </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt">publicly administered in the courts</span><span style="font-size:14pt">. He was reflecting Jeremy Bentham&#8217;s famous aphorism that "publicity is the very soul of justice" (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Works, Vol 4, 1843</span><span style="font-size:14pt">). Bentham was seeking to answer Juvenal&#8217;s famous question: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">quis custodiet ipsos custodes</span><span style="font-size:14pt">? The reason why justice should be administered openly was that "it is the keenest spur to exertion, and the surest of all guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself, while trying, under trial". By virtue of publicity the corrupt judge would find himself condemned in "the court of public opinion". In this way "justice becomes the mother of security". These sentiments were strongly endorsed by the House of Lords in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Scott v Scott </span><span style="font-size:14pt"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1913] AC 417" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1913">[1913] AC 417</ref>. In more recent times Lord Widgery CJ said much the same thing in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">R v Socialist Workers Printers ex parte Attorney General </span><span style="font-size:14pt"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1975] QB 637" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1975">[1975] QB 637</ref>, as did Lord Diplock in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Home Office v Harman</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1983] 1 AC 280" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1983">[1983] 1 AC 280</ref> at 303 and Lord Steyn in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re S (a child)(Identification: Restrictions on Publication) </span><span style="font-size:14pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2004/47" uk:canonical="[2004] UKHL 47" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] UKHL 47</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 AC 593</ref> at para 30 ("the glare of contemporaneous publicity ensures that trials are properly conducted"). When Bentham was writing in 1843 there was, however, neither a developed appeal system (with published judgments) nor a regulated system of adjudicating complaints about judicial misconduct (the results of which are published in perpetuity on the internet). It might be thought that these developments have supplied an equally sure guard against improbity and an equally keen spur to exertion. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Bentham was of the view that it is not only the probity of the judge that is secured by publicity. He considered it equally "auspicious" to the veracity of witnesses:</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">So these are the principal reasons for publicity: to secure the probity of the judge, and to enhance the veracity of witnesses. I would accept, of course, that a subsidiary, but not principal, reason is to promote understanding and debate about the legal process, but that could equally be achieved by education. It obviously follows that if a case is heard openly then the media can publish a full report of it, unless the court makes some kind of reporting restriction order, or a statutory provision restricts it. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">But publicity of proceedings is not an absolute principle.

Or that a civil arbitration, again heard in private, was an unjust process. There are some processes which by virtue of their subject matter should be heard in private. When Bentham wrote over 170 years ago adoption did not exist and I suppose that just about the only matter then justifying secrecy would have been national security.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The debate is not confined to the polar alternatives of openness and privacy. There are many cases which are heard publicly, or privately with the media in attendance, but where, by a process of anonymisation, the privacy of the parties, and of their personal and other affairs, is sought to be preserved. This compromise, or balance, between open justice and the privacy of the individual has arisen for two reasons. First, the increased recognition that is given to the interests of children who are caught up in the dispute between the adult parties. And secondly, the rise of the idea that privacy is an independently enforceable right. Privacy was not recognised as a constitutional right in the USA until 1965 (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Griswold v Connecticut</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> 381 US 479).  Canada embraced it in 1982 by Article 7 of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</span><span style="font-size:14pt">. Here, with the enactment of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> and the incorporation of Article 8 of the European Convention into domestic law, privacy has become an independently actionable right.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It is because of the existence of this right that in many cases the court must undertake the familiar and highly fact specific balancing exercise between the Article 8 right to privacy and the Article 10 right to freedom of expression of proceedings heard in open court or otherwise in the presence of the media: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re S. </span><span style="font-size:14pt">However, as I will explain, there are some categories of court business, which are so personal and private that in almost every case where anonymisation is sought the right to privacy will trump the right to unfettered freedom of expression.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Ancillary relief (or financial remedy) proceedings are quintessentially private business, and are therefore protected by the anonymity principle set out above.  That they are so protected is to be deduced from a number of sources. First, and most obviously, Parliament has in FPR 27.10 specifically provided that the proceedings shall be heard in private. The fact that the media may attend the hearing pursuant to FPR 27.11 and PD27B does not alter the fact that the hearing is in private. Second, the process involves the extraction of highly personal and private information under compulsion which the recipient may not use save for the purposes of the proceedings: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Clibbery v Allen (No 2)</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2002/45" uk:canonical="[2002] EWCA Civ 45" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWCA Civ 45</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 FLR 565" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 FLR 565</ref>, and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Lykiardopulo v Lykiardopulo</span><span style="font-size:14pt">. Therefore, according to those authorities, the media may not report any such information without leave. Third, Article 14 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the UK ratified in 1976, stipulates that (a) the press or public can be excluded from all or part of the trial when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires; and (b) that judgment is not required to be public where the proceedings concern matrimonial disputes. In my judgment Article 14 creates a presumption against public judgment in matrimonial disputes, and therefore it logically follows that the proceedings should not be public either as otherwise the privacy of the judgment would be fatally undermined. It is trite law that when exercising a power a court should do so consistently with the state's international obligations. Fourth, it is my firm opinion that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/61" uk:canonical="1926 (16 &amp; 17 Geo. 5) c. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Act 1926</ref> applies not merely to the suit for divorce itself but also to the proceedings for ancillary relief. At the time it was passed ancillary relief was an intrinsic part of the divorce itself.

This ground is directly related to the Appellant's failure to attend the trial.  The decision whether to grant or to refuse an adjournment is a case management decision.  It is to be exercised having regard to the &#8216;overriding objective&#8217; in CPR 1.

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Registrars, Masters and district judges are daily faced with cases coming on for hearing in which one party either writes to the court asking for an adjournment and then (without waiting for a reply) does not attend the hearing, or writes to the court simply to state that they will not be attending. Not infrequently &#8216;medical&#8217; grounds are advanced, often connected with the stress of litigation.  Parties who think that they thereby compel the Court not to proceed with the hearing or that their non-attendance somehow strengthens the application for an adjournment are deeply mistaken.  The decision whether or not to adjourn remains one for the judge.  The decision must of course be a principled one.  The judge will want to have in mind CPR1 and (to the degree appropriate) any relevant judicial guidance (such as that of Coulson J&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Fitzroy</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;or Neuberger J in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Fox v Graham</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;(&#8216;Times&#8217; 3 Aug 2001 and Lexis).  But the party who fails to attend either in person or through a representative to assist the judge in making that principled decision cannot complain too loudly if, in the exercise of the discretion, some factor might have been given greater weight.  For my own part, bearing in mind the material upon which and the circumstances in which decisions about adjournments fall to be made (and in particular because the decision must be reached quickly lest it occupy the time listed for the hearing of the substantive matter and thereby in practice give a party relief to which he is not justly entitled) I do not think an appeal court should be overcritical of the language in which the decision about an adjournment has been expressed by a conscientious judge.  An experienced judge may not always articulate all of the factors which have borne upon the decision.  That is not an encouragement to laxity: it is intended as a recognition of the realities of busy lists.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In my judgment there were ample grounds upon which the Registrar could properly refuse the adjournment (whether she expressly referred to them or not).  There was a history of making applications for adjournments at each stage.  The hearing before her was itself a re-listed hearing.  There was evident non-cooperation in preparing for the trial.  Even on the Appellant's own case he had made his application for an adjournment at the last possible moment.  He adduced no medical evidence.  His solicitor deliberately withdrew instructions from Counsel and told Counsel not to attend the hearing.  The solicitor on the record made a conscious decision not to attend the hearing.  The application was already a year old (partly because the Appellant had sought adjournments to put in evidence and had then not done so) and related to a bankruptcy that had commenced in 1994.  The Court could if the hearing proceeded take into account such evidence as he had adduced (even if it did not have the benefit of the criticisms he wanted to make of the trustee's case all the benefit of any argument he wanted to advance in support of his own).  The Appellant would always have available the opportunity afforded by CPR 39.3.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Can the Appellant demonstrate on this appeal that he had good reason not to attend the hearing (as he would have to do under CPR 39.5)?  In my judgment he cannot.  The Appellant was evidently able to think about the case on 24 May 2011 (because he went to a doctor and asked for a letter that he could use in the case, plainly to be deployed in the event that an adjournment was not granted): if he could do that then he could come to Court, as his wife did.  He has made no application to adduce in evidence that letter (and so has not placed before the court any of the factual material necessary to demonstrate that a medical report could not with reasonable diligence have been obtained before the hearing before the Registrar).  But I will consider that additional evidence.  In my judgment it falls far short of the medical evidence required to demonstrate that the party is unable to attend a hearing and participate in the trial.  Such evidence should identify the medical attendant and give details of his familiarity with the party's medical condition (detailing all recent consultations), should identify with particularity what the patient's medical condition is and the features of that condition which (in the medical attendant's opinion) prevent participation in the trial process, should provide a reasoned prognosis and should give the court some confidence that what is being expressed is an independent opinion after a proper examination.  It is being tendered as expert evidence.  The court can then consider what weight to attach to that opinion, and what arrangements might be made (short of an adjournment) to accommodate a party's difficulties.  No judge is bound to accept expert evidence: even a proper medical report falls to be considered simply as part of the material as a whole (including the previous conduct of the case).  The letter on which the Appellant relies is wholly inadequate.</span></p>

The complaint is misconceived.  The Appellant's right to a fair trial means that he must have a reasonable opportunity to put his case.

He was urged to exercise that right by the trustee's solicitors on 23rd May 2011; but he and his legal representatives chose not to avail themselves of it."</span></p>
