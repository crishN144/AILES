It is an application pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention and the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction in relation to O.  The Convention is, of course, embodied now within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref>. O was born in 2018.  I shall refer to O as &#8220;the child&#8221; in the course of this judgment.  It follows therefore that the child is now aged four years and nearly five months in age.  </p>

There was then extremely limited focused evidence by each parent.  That evidence was confined to the issue of consent and/or acquiescence. </p>

Similarly, in the simple paradigm case of wrongful retention, one parent will have travelled with the child from the State of habitual residence to the destination State, for example for an agreed fortnight's holiday (and thus without the removal being wrongful), but will then wrongfully have refused to return. In each of those paradigm cases, the child will have remained habitually resident in the home State. An application under the Abduction Convention will be made in the destination (or 'requested') State for the return of the child to the State of habitual residence. The return will be a summary one, without investigation of the merits of any dispute between the parents as to custody, access or any other issue relating to the upbringing of the child (Art 16). Such merits decisions are for the courts of the State of the child's habitual residence.</p>

It is perhaps improbable in the case of removal, but it is not in the case of retention. It may particularly happen if the stay in the destination State is more than just a holiday and lasts long enough for the child to become integrated into the destination State. It is the more likely to happen if the travelling parent determines, however improperly, to stay, and takes steps to integrate the child in the destination State. Even in the case of wrongful removal, it may be possible to imagine such a situation if, for example, there had been successive periods of residence in the destination State, followed by a removal from the State of origin which infringed the rights of custody of the left-behind parent&#8221;.</p>

Thus the wronged parent may sign a formal agreement that the child is to remain in the country to which he has been abducted. Again, he may take an active part in proceedings in the country to which the child has been abducted to determine the long-term future of the child. No developed system of justice would permit the wronged parent in such circumstances to go back on the stance which he has, to the knowledge of the other parent, unequivocally adopted: to do so would be unjust.</p>

However, in my judgment these will be strictly exceptional cases. In the ordinary case behaviour of that kind will be likely to lead the judge to a finding that the actual intention of the wronged parent was indeed to acquiesce in the wrongful removal. It is only in cases where the judge is satisfied that the wronged parent did not, in fact, acquiesce but his outward behaviour demonstrated the contrary that this exceptional case arises. </p>

Such clear and unequivocal conduct is not normally to be found in passing remarks or letters written by a parent who has recently suffered the trauma of the removal of his children. Still less is it to be found in a request for access showing the wronged parent's desire to preserve contact with the child, in negotiations for the voluntary return of the child, or in the parent pursuing the dictates of his religious beliefs."</p>

The terms of Article 13(b) are plain, require neither elaboration nor gloss and by themselves demonstrate the restricted availability of the defence and where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable position.  If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected from that risk. If the evaluation of the protective measures fails to meet the identified grave risk, the court may have to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues of fact.</p>

Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest on the evidence available to the court and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm are identified.  It follows that if, having considered the risk of harm at its highest on the available evidence, the court considers that it does not meet the imperatives of Art 13(b), the court is not obliged to go on to consider the question of protective measures.</p>

In analysing whether the allegations are of sufficient detail and substance, the judge will have to consider whether, to adopt what Black LJ said in In re K, &#8220;the evidence before the court enables him or her confidently to discount the possibility that the allegations give rise to an article 13(b) risk&#8221;.

This may be relevant in a subsequent custody case but has no relevance to an Article 13(1)(b) analysis.  More modest living conditions and/or more limited developmental support in the State of habitual residence are therefore not sufficient to establish the grave risk exception.  If the taking parent claims to be unable to return with the child to the State of habitual residence because of their difficult or untenable economic situation, eg because his or her living standards would be lower, he/she is unable to find employment in that State or is otherwise in dire circumstances, this will usually not be sufficient to issue a non-return order.&#8221;</p>

The father had earlier in the autumn of 2021 opposed the mother&#8217;s application for permission to relocate the children to this country. However, by the end of 2021 the father indicated his willingness to &#8220;compromise&#8221; and to relocate with the children to the UK after all.  In the core bundle there are records of contemporaneous communication which indicate that by the end of 2021 or early 2022, that was the position.

The order was made in the terms sought by the father that I have already summarised [Supplementary Bundle: B-95]. The High Court in South Africa ordered, amongst other points, for the child to be returned to the father&#8217;s care and for permission to be granted to him to relocate with the children to this jurisdiction.  As I have said, that was described as a rule nisi, which had a return date, on this court&#8217;s understanding, of 15 March 2022.</p>

According to the contemporaneous documentation in the supplementary bundle, the father&#8217;s attorneys had asserted that they had difficulty properly serving the mother with that order. However, what is clear on any view is that the mother, as I have mentioned already, returned to South Africa in the early part of March and it may well have been on 7 March 2022.  On that day, as indicated, she attended at K&#8217;s school at about 8.30am [Supplementary Bundle: B-155; Core Bundle: C-124].</p>

There may well be issues in relation to this particular visit, but it appears to be agreed by the mother that she did attend at the school that day and that the school was disinclined to allow her to remove K. There are also in the documentation issues as to whether the school was informed whether there was an order in place in relation to K. However, as I say, there is no issue about the fact the mother attended at the school. She says so in terms in her statement in these proceedings [Core Bundle: C-142].</p>

She was effectively seeking to return with the children to this jurisdiction as a matter of urgency and was inviting the court to direct that the father to accompany her and the children.

This is the third statement that I mentioned earlier, which was drafted in her own hand and filed.  In that further statement, the mother said that she had spoken to the father&#8217;s brother, Mr F.J, on 9 March 2022 and, as part of that conversation, she says that her brother-in-law confirmed that the father would be making arrangements for the children to leave South Africa.</p>

However, I pause only momentarily in confirming that I am not in any way satisfied that this begins to suggest that this was an indication of acquiescence on his part in relation to the child&#8217;s removal in March 2022.  I am satisfied that, once again, as in relation to the order made on 24 February 2022, that was provision in his favour in relation to the removal of the children rather than any form of provision for the mother. I see no reason to reject the explanation that this was effectively provisional authorisation for him to move the children in the future if he so decides he wants to remove them.</p>
