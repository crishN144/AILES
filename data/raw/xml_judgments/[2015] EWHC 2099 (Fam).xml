The local authority were seeking permission to make Y a ward of court and, either alternatively or in addition, to seek to protect him under the inherent jurisdictional powers of the High Court.  There was a further application that the mother be joined as a respondent to the proceedings as would Y himself.  </span></p>

He has grown up within a family where there has been a passionate commitment to waging Jihad in Syria amongst the male members of the family.  It is a striking feature of the history that two of Y&#8217;s brothers have already died, as the family would no doubt see it being martyred, in that war, as was a close friend of the family.  Y&#8217;s uncle was a detainee in the Guantanamo&#160;Bay&#160;Detention&#160;Centre in Cuba and his incarceration there was the subject of a great deal of media attention, particularly in Brighton where this family are based.</span></p>

In so far as I&#160;have a sense of that relationship at all it strikes me as, at least in part, interdependent.  The local authority brought these proceedings because they were concerned that, in short, Y might wish to follow his brothers to war and perhaps ultimately also to death.</span></p>

The picture that emerges is of a woman who is trying to cope but barely succeeding.  Certainly she is unable to effect any real parental control over her son, Y.  I&#160;have been told that when she is visited, as she is from time to time, by a variety of social workers she lapses into long monologues about her family, and takes that opportunity to vent her grief which has ultimately disabled her.</span></p>

The best that I&#160;could glean was that there was an uncle living in Dubai who forwarded the cash.  I&#160;do not recollect being given a name or address or any details of the transaction.</span></p>

These are reported at [2015] EWHC 869 Fam. In some of those cases I have found it necessary to be critical of some of the professionals involved.   This case, unlike those in that report, was and had plainly been the subject of much anxious consideration amongst the social services.  There have been clear, open and cooperative discussions with the regional Counter Terrorist Unit and particular thought had been given to the legal framework in which the application should be pursued.  </span></p>

In this case that document had been openly referred to and was regarded by all the relevant professionals involved as a helpful reference for evaluating risk.  The local authority, through Mr.&#160;Downs, referred to it in their submissions and so did I&#160;in my judgment.  In the light of the subsequent application in the latter case I&#160;did not permit this short </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">extempore</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> judgment to be posted on BAILII, as is my usual practice.  </span></p>

That application has now been withdrawn and accordingly my earlier judgment of 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;March will now also be placed in the public domain.</span></p>

He says that whilst he cannot really see why the application by the local authority was necessary, he has observed on more than one occasion that the court&#8217;s decision has had very little impact upon him in practical terms.  He does accept that the local authority now hold his passport and in consequence understands that he would need to apply to the court should he plan any trip abroad in the future.  He also understands that this is essentially an investigative and protective jurisdiction where his best interests are the paramount consideration.</span></p>

It may be that on some level he appreciates the need for others to assume some aspect of that role.  In any event he does not instruct his guardian to oppose the wardship Order and, as I&#160;have said, in his somewhat bemused way he yields to it.</span></p>

Where circumstances are unusual the court will consider warding a child within care proceedings to maintain control over decisions relating to children that require these carefully crafted individual solutions.  </span></p>

In those circumstances it must be regarded therefore as a significant risk.</span></p>

Sometimes a small risk of some very serious consequence is an unacceptable risk.  Sometimes by contrast a significant risk of something with really rather minor consequences may be acceptable.  Here it seems to me is the classic case of a high risk of very serious harm.  It is important not to lose sight of the fact that two brothers have already died in this war.</span></p>

Here we are not dealing with a risk arising from an unsuitable human being but there is a clear parallel, for the process of radicalisation that goes on within families committed to this type of belief, or to youngsters vulnerable to those outside the family with such beliefs, is strikingly similar to the process of grooming that one sees in the context of sexual abuse.  Here we are concerned with &#8216;distorted belief&#8217; but it is nonetheless pervasive and challenging to resist.  In these circumstances therefore with a high risk of serious outcome it seems to me that the court is entitled to use the fullest measures at its disposal.  </span></p>

She says that the wardship should be discharged because she will not allow Y to travel, and she asserts that she has made it clear that she has learned, in what her counsel describes as the &#8216;hardest possible way&#8217;, how she needs to ensure that her son will not be able to get hold of his passport or travel documents.  I&#160;regret to say that whilst I&#160;do not question the sincerity of her assertion I&#160;see no evidence at all that she has empowered herself to put down the kind of boundaries that Y needs in this regard or more widely.

She also asserts that she will encourage Y to engage with the contemplated experts and with the process itself.
