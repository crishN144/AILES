	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This should, but probably will not, be the final chapter of this chronic and complex piece of matrimonial litigation. It is the hearing of the application by Janna Kremen (&#8220;W&#8221;) for financial orders under Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> against her former husband Boris Agrest (&#8220;H&#8221;). W was granted leave to make this claim by Mr J. Cohen QC on 12 February 2009. There is also before me an application by Georgi Chesnokov (&#8220;GC&#8221;) for a charging order absolute and a wide-ranging application by Leonid Fishman (&#8220;LF&#8221;) which includes, among other extravagant claims, a request that he be paid $10m in satisfaction of a debt owed to him by H.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 February 2011 the final hearing of W&#8217;s application came before Holman J. He adjourned it and made a number of orders which included the discharge of an outstanding warrant of committal issued against H. He also, clearly and unambiguously, ordered that both H and W personally attend this hearing. Although on 19 October 2011 the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by W against the discharge of the warrant by Holman J, I imposed at W&#8217;s request a stay on its execution, thereby removing any impediment to H&#8217;s attendance. H has nonetheless not attended, claiming that he cannot afford the air fare and hotel costs, which, as will be seen, is a false excuse. On all previous occasions he has sent his McKenzie friend Mr Beck to Court to protect his interest. Strictly speaking it is not proper to allow a McKenzie friend into Court if the party whose friend he is, is absent; after all the whole point of the &#8220;McKenzie friend&#8221; procedure is the provision of quiet assistance to a litigant in person who is actually there arguing his own case.  The same situation presented itself to Holman J in February 2011 and he sent Mr Beck away stating in para 36 of his judgment of 15 February 2011:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">A McKenzie Friend is a person who is permitted to sit beside a litigant-in-person in court in order quietly to assist that person in a range of ways fully described in various authorities, and indeed now very fully in the President's Guidance of 14 October 2008, now reproduced at page 2882 of the 2010 edition of the Family Court Practice (the Red Book). All those authorities and everything in that President's Guidance clearly contemplate that a McKenzie Friend is somebody who has a very important role in relation to a litigant-in-person who is himself personally present in the courtroom. There is absolutely nothing in any authority of which I am aware, and certainly nothing in that President's Guidance, to suggest that a McKenzie Friend is somebody who in some way can come to court without the presence at all of the litigant-in-person, but in some way to appear as a representative or advocate on his behalf. Before that can happen, an application has to be made for a case specific grant of a right of audience under the relevant statutory provisions, and no such application has been made to me, or so far as I am aware, to the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further key question, which is a mixture of fact and exercise of discretion, concerns the treatment to be given by me to a post-nuptial agreement signed by the parties in Israel on 15 May 2001, which was approved by an Israeli Court on 3 July 2001 and which was re-confirmed when an Israeli Court pronounced a divorce  on 13 August 2003. This will require me to consider the judgments of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Granatino v Radmacher</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] AC 534" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] AC 534</ref> but viewed through the lens of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s16(2)</ref>(d) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref>. An added complication is that H now argues that the Israeli Court had no jurisdiction to approve a separation agreement or to pronounce a divorce because he and W were never validly married as he was at the time of the ceremony of marriage in fact already validly married to a Russian lady, and indeed has in 2010 obtained an annulment from a court in Moscow of his marriage to W. As Black LJ stated in her judgment of 24 January 2011  at para 29 &#8220;&#8230;Mr&#160;Agrest's case now seeks to say that the Israeli orders were invalid because he was already married and therefore there was no marriage to provoke a divorce in Israel or a separation agreement&#8230;&#8221;. Of course, this aspect makes no difference to W&#8217;s claims under Part III, as the jurisdiction is equally exercisable after a foreign annulment. As Holman J stated in his judgment of 14 February 2011 &#8220;at the very most the husband&#8217;s very late assertion that the marriage between these parties was a nullity might require only the relatively technical formality of amendment to the wife&#8217;s underlying application under Part III and amendment to the language of the grant of leave to apply&#8221;</p>

They are both Russian and were married in Moscow in 1991. As stated above H now asserts that the marriage was invalid as he was not at that time divorced from his first wife. On 1 June 1991 their son Gennadis was born. He is married, has a baby boy and is a student at University in New York. W believes that his expenses are met by H and by his father-in-law. On 30 March 1997 their son Victor was born. He is 14 and is at Charterhouse. His fees are about &#163;34,000 per annum and are presently paid by W from the ever-diminishing sums held by the court. On 22 March 2004 their son Maxim was born in Canada. It can be seen that W was pregnant with him at the time of the Israeli divorce. Maxim is at a prep school and his fees are &#163;14,000 per annum. W intends that he should follow Victor to Charterhouse. H does not contribute to the school fees or to the maintenance of the younger boys even though he has been ordered to do so. I do not believe he has much in the way of contact with them.</p>

I am not saying that it does not. All I am saying is that the materials I have seen do not properly justify an inferential finding that it does. But Mr Mostyn does not have to go that far.

If a figure needs to be put to it I would draw the inference, and do, that the full extent of the family assets (that is the assets of both the wife and the husband) is very comfortably in excess of &#163;50&#160;million and probably significantly more than that figure. Reference to <span style="font-style:italic">White v White</span> and the size of the wife&#8217;s claim apart there is, I accept, no process of purely mathematical calculation that can be prayed in aid to arrive at or justify such a figure.

I ask myself this question: bearing in mind (i) my findings as to the continuing scale of the husband&#8217;s business activities and (ii) the evidence, summarised in paras&#160;[63]&#8211;[67] above, as to the size of the commissions the husband can be shown to have been capable of earning, is it reasonable or unreasonable to conclude that the husband over a period of some 20 years was able to amass a fortune of this size?

H has produced an unsigned statement from a Mrs Damsky dated 16 March 2008 who states that W approached her in February 2001 to draw up an &#8220;Agreement of Marital Separation&#8221;; and that the parties attended before an Israeli judge on 3 July 2001 who approved it. Further, in 2003 W approached Mrs Damsky again to represent her in a divorce; and that on 13 August 2003 the parties were divorced in Israel where the court again approved the agreement. Mrs Damsky states that she is not a cousin of H&#8217;s but W has stated to me that she is a distant relative. Mrs Damsky did not attend to give oral testimony to me.</p>

Mrs Janna Agrest asked me to represent her, and draw such an agreement, that in a case of their separation, it will guarantee her material situation, and she herself stated me her demands about dividing the mutual property. Mr Boris Agrest agreed to all her demands, mentioned that he does not planning a separation or divorce, and signed the Agreement.&#8221;</p>

W states that in 2005 H used emotional duress to influence her to give a power of attorney to a friend of his who sold the property and kept the proceeds. W in fact lodged a criminal complaint about this in Austria which appears to have got nowhere. H denies this and says that on the sale of the property W received &#8364;530,000. I have no doubt that W&#8217;s evidence is true, and that she received nothing on the sale of the Austrian property.</p>

As explained in the judgment of Mr J Cohen QC and in my judgment of 15 October 2010  at para 25 H did pay to W the $1m but prevailed on her to give it back to him almost immediately, since when the money has disappeared. In his judgment at para 23 Mr J Cohen QC described H&#8217;s stance thus:</p>

He says he cannot pay it back. It has all gone. So the wife finds herself having handed over the property, which is very valuable, and lost virtually every penny of the million dollars that she was due to receive. The husband shrugs his shoulders and says: well, I have lost much more than that over the last year or so. She is bound, he says, by the 2001 Israeli agreement. She made a bad investment when she lent it to me. Too bad. She is stuck with it. That, to me, is at least at first sight a deeply unappealing argument.&#8221;</p>

Mrs Damsky says it was the wife who approached her and the husband went along with the  terms and, of course, the 2001 agreement was approved by the Israeli Court and incorporated into the 2003 divorce. I am not in the least persuaded that the documents were in Hebrew or that the wife did not understand them or the divorce proceedings at the time. I do not believe for one minute that the wife did not know until the spring of 2007 that the parties had been divorced in Israel in 2003.<span style="font-size:14pt"/>&#8221;</p>

There are several bizarre aspects about this. The wife says that she did not know that the marriage had been dissolved and Judge Hughes did not believe her on this. But before the judge there was not the document which appears in my bundle at 2:53, a document which the husband might have claimed privilege about but was happy for me to see, which shows that he consulted solicitors in 2007 about proposed divorce proceedings, and they had trouble finding out where the marriage certificate was, but the note says that he confirmed there is one in the safe. The solicitors were asking subsequently whether he had found out whether there had been proceedings in Israel and he said that he had not yet found out. So it appears that he was uncertain as to whether or not there had been a divorce.  </p>

Indeed, in August 2003 the mother was pregnant with Maxim, although it is not clear that she knew that she was at that time. The purpose of the divorce is completely lost on me. Indeed the husband said to me he did not really know what the purpose of it was either. He thought it was some sort of parlour game that she was playing, while she said that she was unaware of it happening at all. They went together from their jointly occupied home to court and back again and continued as if nothing had ever happened. No steps whatsoever were taken to implement the agreement of May 2001.&#8221;</p>

Other unworthy conduct, such as exploitation of a dominant position to secure an unfair advantage, will reduce or eliminate the weight to be attached to the agreement (ibid). The court may take into account a party&#8217;s emotional state, and what pressures he or she was under to agree, as well as their age and maturity, and whether either or both had been married or been in long-term relationships before (para 72).

By contrast it is less likely to be so where the agreement leaves in the hands of one spouse rather than the other the most part of a fortune which each spouse has played an equal role in their different ways in creating (para 80). If the devotion of one partner to looking after the family and the home has left the other free to accumulate wealth, it is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement that entitles the latter to retain all that he or she has earned (para 81).</p>

I found that GC had not given me truthful evidence and that he was complicit in H&#8217;s machinations (see paras 17, 23 &#8211; 26, 28 &#8211; 32, and 36). Moreover I found that GC would have no difficulty in recovering the Kyrgyzstani bonds from H (see para 39). That finding was challenged in the Court of Appeal and was dismissed by Wall P (see paras 24 &#8211; 26 of his judgment). Indeed, there is no evidence that GC has even asked H for the bonds back or otherwise to indemnify him for his losses. Mr Feehan QC stated that this was because GC did not know where H was but this is obvious nonsense as in August 2011 his solicitors were in detailed email correspondence with H concerning the negotiation of a consent order which provided for the sale of South Lodge.</p>

In his judgment Wall P quotes Sedley LJ as having said of GC&#8217;s purchase of South Lodge &#8220;he bought a pig in a poke&#8221;. His attempts to prevent a reversal of the transaction all failed, and this latest attempt must be dealt with in the same way. In any event I am satisfied that the equity of South Lodge is urgently needed to meet the needs of W and the children. Just as the considerable means of GC were relevant to the exercise of my discretion last time round, so they are this time. In para 13 of my judgment of 3 December 2010 I recorded him as having means of &#163;16.5m.
