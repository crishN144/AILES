The Family Court should adopt the approach of the Criminal Court, namely that a lie is only capable of amounting to corroboration if it is (a) deliberate, (b) relates to a material issue and (c) is motivated by a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth (Re H-C (Children) [2016] EWCA Civ 136, paras 97-100). Where the issue of lies is relevant, the local authority should be asked to identify (i) the deliberate lies upon which they seek to rely, (ii) the significant issues to which they relate and (iii) on what basis it can be determined that the only explanation for the lies is guilt.

In determining what is in a child&#8217;s best welfare interests the court must have regard to each of the factors set out in the welfare checklist in s.1(3). Section 1(5) provides that when a court is considering whether or not to make an order under the Act with respect to a child, it shall not make the order unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all. In public law cases this means that the level of state intervention should be no greater than is necessary in order to secure the child&#8217;s welfare.  </span></p>

Similarly, although the father was heavily involved with a particular cultural organisation, he had never taken the mother to it, despite her isolation in this country.  He justified this because of her deafness and then because of the pandemic shutting down the activities, but there was a gap of many years after the mother&#8217;s operation on her ears until the pandemic struck.

She laughed and smiled which I took to show she was embarrassed.  She said her intention was to hit XX lightly, but then said she did not hit her.  When asked about the mark on XX&#8217;s eye, she said she, &#8220;hold her with her teeth&#8221;.  She accepted this meant bit her.  She said she made this mistake once.

She understood the difference between truth and lies.  Her demeanour was serious.  She appeared to be a bright and inquisitive child who understood she was there to tell, &#8220;the whole story&#8221;.  She was worried about not being able to remember everything she had said before.  The police officer opens her questions by asking about everything that happened on the day, &#8220;that Mummy had hit you with a shoehorn&#8221; &#8211; referencing a previous discussion with XX.  XX then went into a rapid account of being hit by her mother for not cleaning up ice cream.  Her account was spontaneous and detailed.  When she repeated things that were said, she mimicked the emphasis put into her mother&#8217;s words, &#8220;Go to bed now&#8221;.  At several points, she complained that while she had been told to stop playing on her device, her parents had not stopped her sister from doing so.  Her sense of unfairness about this was still obvious in the way she spoke.</span></p>

The question is ambiguous.  It is possible with her answer that XX was expressing a view that it is not right that YY should be hit.

This is a factor that is at odds with the level of complaint that the children have made.  However, I remind myself that there are a number of factors that may cause marks to be caused, the strength of an impact, what was used to hit, where the blow landed and the struck individual&#8217;s propensity to develop a mark.  There is also a question about whether if marks were present, actions were taken in a timely way to be able to observe them &#8211; the child protection medicals state in terms that the passage of time meant that any mark would likely have faded.  The absence of recorded injuries does not mean that nothing happened, however, the absence of recorded injuries when they might have been expected to be seen reduces the likelihood that any allegation relating to them was true.</span></p>

There is a significant inconsistency between what the mother admitted for the caution, what she set out in her written evidence and what she told the court.  In her oral evidence, the mother appeared to want to set this incident apart, as a single episode, a terrible mistake that would never be repeated.  The father&#8217;s evidence was very similar in this regard.  However, I struggled on the mother&#8217;s account to understand how she reached the point where she not only hit her very young child in the face, but also bit her on the arm.  The mother could not explain how she had lost control in such an extreme way and neither parent appeared to have any appreciation of how severe a loss of control that must have been.

This reduced in frequency after the mother received her police caution but nonetheless continued at a lower frequency.  The hits the mother gave the children were not particularly strong, which is something the children have said and goes to explain the absence of recorded injuries for many of the incidents.

The first two foster placements struggled to meet the competing needs of all three children.  The sibling relationships are marked by sibling rivalry and negative interactions are frequent.  Placing the children together in foster care may increase the potential for instability and placement breakdown because of the magnitude of the task of meeting their needs.

They will have regular social work visits, LAC reviews, LAC medicals.  Instead of a typical family life, they will experience corporate parenting from the local authority with all the clumsiness that institutional decision making may bring.  They are likely to have a series of different allocated social workers throughout their childhoods.  They will be exposed to the potential embarrassment and difference of not living with their parents, something that many children in care find difficult.  The children are all relatively young so they will spend many years in the care system.  While some foster placements can be sustained throughout a childhood and into the following years when support is still available, there are many that do not.  Foster placements can break down or be terminated for all manner of reasons and if that happens, the children will have to cope with the disruption and harm that flows from that.  The longer a child is in foster care, the greater the prospect that something like this could occur.  For ZZ, he is very young and would spend very many years in foster care.  As JJ pointed out during his evidence, the outcomes for children who grow up in foster care in terms of academic success, employment, substance misuse, criminality and mental health issues are generally worse than for children who do not.</span></p>

The parents do not appear to appreciate the damaging impact of this on the children.  It is telling that they both locate responsibility for the children&#8217;s behavioural difficulties with XX.  Prior to the proceedings, their view was that XX has some sort of mental problem that causes her to behave badly and that XX has influenced and affected the other children who otherwise would be good.  In his oral evidence the father repeated this explanation.  Neither parent identified any responsibility in their own actions for the serious levels of behavioural difficulties that all three children exhibit.  While the parents assured the court that things would be different now if the children returned to their care, I have no confidence that would be the case.  The only aspect that has changed is that the children have shown some limited levels of improvement in foster care with some aspects of their behavioural issues &#8211; however this has been uneven and I am very aware that they have suffered a lot of disruption in foster care as well, having now been placed with their third set of foster carers and with the sibling group having been separated.</span></p>

There plainly were improvements identified through this work, because the local authority felt sufficiently reassured to step the case down.

However, I accept the guardian&#8217;s evidence that family support work typically includes some of the strategies that are more suitable for people with learning disabilities, such as modelling techniques.  In any event, the work appeared to have been positive because the parents reported it had helped and the local authority was satisfied by the progress made.</span></p>

The assessments of these options were positive.  However, they withdrew as prospective special guardians in October 2021.  Since then, there has been a reduced level of availability to speak to professionals although it did not appear to me that the local authority had particularly pressed to speak to the family members.  Unfortunately, contact with the prospective special guardians had been prioritised over the summer, but after their withdrawal, they have not seen the children again.  I am satisfied that XX and YY are aware of this and feel rejected by their older siblings as a result.</span></p>

There was a strong antipathy towards the local authority, and he was resistant to having social services involved in his or his families&#8217; lives.  Despite his stated intentions, I was left with reservations about whether the support on offer would be sustained for as long as the children needed it.  That view was reinforced when I asked JJ about whether he would continue to see the children if the court decided to make care orders.  Even when pressed quite strongly by the court and after the benefits to the children of maintain contact with the children had been spelled out, he was not able to say that he would do so.</span></p>

The children all need better than good enough parenting.  The ability to provide and maintain consistent boundaries has been given great importance by Dr Maggs for the positive development of all three children.  I am not satisfied that the parents are able to provide this at the current time.

The option of remaining in long-term foster care has many deficits, with the children being separated and apart from their family as well as the potential negative impact of growing up in care.  However, even with those deficits I am satisfied that option does provide a means by which the children can receive the care of sufficient quality to meet their needs.  In my judgment it is the only realistic option available to me that is capable of doing so.  It is a shame that the paternal family members who were positively assessed as prospective special guardians withdrew as that option is not available for the court to consider.</span></p>

I am also persuaded that the local authority&#8217;s initial approach of contact finalising at every 6-8 weeks is more suitable.  In my judgment there is a real advantage to contact remaining flexible so that it can be adjusted in accordance with the children&#8217;s needs. The difference between contact every 6 weeks and every 2 months is quite a lot &#8211; 6 sessions or 8 sessions per year.  In my judgment it would be sensible to set out a plan for contact between the parent and the children built around the school holiday and half term periods, with sessions taking place at both ends of the long summer holiday.  This would mean 7 sessions of contact per year but would take place in circumstances that would be easy for the children to understand and would enable a greater potential for the children to enjoy contact with additional activities in the community rather than be confined to a contact centre.</span></p>

Both JJ and KK, when she attended court at an earlier hearing, impressed me.  It would be a real positive for these children if their adult half-siblings can play a role in their lives.  They would be linked to their culture, their language and their identity. They would have positive role models who could have a beneficial influence on them as they grow through childhood and in adulthood.  They would have a real link with their father sustained through their older siblings which could endure even after he has passed away.  There are many positives that their older siblings can give the children and I hope they will feel able to.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In relation to the proposed assessment, I have real doubts as to whether the court is being asked to approve an assessment, rather than to direct a piece of parenting coaching, which was Dr Huda&#8217;s proposal.  In accordance with s.38(6) of the Children Act 1989 and the case of Re G (Interim care order: Residential Assessment) [2006] 1 FLR 601 HL &#8211; what is directed under s.38(6) must clearly be an examination or assessment of the child, including where appropriate his relationship with his parents, the risk that the parents may present to him and the ways in which those risks may be avoided or managed, all with a view to enabling the court to make the decision which it has to make under the Act with the minimum of delay.  Any services which are provided to the child and his family must be ancillary to that end.  They must not be an end in themselves.  In Re G it was decided that the court has no power to make an order for a s.38(6) assessment if the main purpose is to provide a continuing court of psychotherapy with a view to providing a parent with the opportunity to change sufficiently so as to become a safe and acceptable carer.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In my judgement the proposed &#8220;assessment&#8221; by Dr Ruby falls foul of this same prohibition.  What is sought is treatment &#8211; namely family coaching and parenting work, rather than assessment.  In any event, I am not satisfied that this work is necessary for the court to be able to determine the issues in the case.  While the parents can rightly point to the opportunity having been missed to try another means to support them to meet the children&#8217;s needs, I am not satisfied that the proposed work goes to the heart of the parents&#8217; problem.  The major obstacle to their being able to parent safely these children and meet their needs is their lack of insight and appreciation of the children&#8217;s emotional needs, rather than the absence of parenting skills around setting and maintaining boundaries.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I am mindful also of the impact of delay in these proceedings.  The case has been significantly delayed by the need to assess members of the extended family who were put forward at a late stage and appeared to be credible options until they withdrew.  That has been exacerbated by the pandemic and the lack of court time to hear the case.  The children have been the subject of proceedings for over a year now.  They have a profound need for stability and certainty about their futures.  If the case was adjourned there is no time available for it to be relisted before next June.  That further 6-month delay would be harmful to the children.</span></p>
