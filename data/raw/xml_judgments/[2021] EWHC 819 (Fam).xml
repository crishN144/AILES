	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This is an appeal against findings made against the appellant in the Family Court sitting in Leeds by Recorder Armitage following a four-day hearing which resulted in an order dated 30 October 2020.   Her findings, as recorded in that order, included two occasions on which the appellant had &#8216;aggressively raped&#8217; the respondent whilst she was in bed with their young child.  There were further findings of emotional abuse and threats to remove the child from the respondent&#8217;s care in order to abduct her to Pakistan.  It is against these findings and others that the appellant now appeals, permission to appeal having been granted by Poole J on 14 January 2021. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Permission to appeal was granted because of concerns which flowed from the judgment delivered by the Recorder at the conclusion of the substantive factfinding hearing.  In the context of the substantive appeal, those concerns have been fully ventilated during the course of the submissions which I heard over a full day of argument.  I am grateful to each of Ms Markham QC and Ms Morgan QC for the care which was taken in their forensic analysis of the judge&#8217;s conduct of the original hearing and the reasoning process which underpinned her decisions in relation to the facts.  Neither leading counsel appeared at the original fact-finding hearing but each has presented their respective clients&#8217; cases with a full command of both the written evidence which was before the court below and the voluminous transcripts of the oral evidence which has since been made available.  On behalf of the appellant, Ms Markham QC submits that the judge&#8217;s reasoning process was fundamentally flawed and, for this and other reasons, her findings cannot stand.  Ms Morgan QC, who represents the respondent mother, submits that the findings are reliable when considered in the context of all that is recorded in the judgment.  Ms Mason, who represents the child through her guardian, has adopted a neutral stance in this appeal.  It is agreed that, if the findings are set aside, a rehearing is inevitable. </p>

The parties are both doctors who met at medical school some sixteen years ago.  They married in 2011 but separated the following year at a time when the respondent was pregnant with their first, and only, child.  A was born the following month and has lived with her mother ever since.  Over the course of the ensuing years, and despite their formal separation, there were times when the parties spent time together with A as a family.  The appellant was living abroad for much of this period.  Ms Markham QC submits, with </p>

	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">some force, that the extent, quality and nature of that contact between the parents lay at the heart of the factual dispute which was before the judge at the fact-finding hearing.  Whilst I need say little about the background of the ongoing contact dispute for the purposes of this appeal, it is clear that both parents had made attempts to set up a pattern of arrangements in order that A might establish a relationship with her father.  Those attempts broke down and, in November 2019, the appellant issued a formal application for contact.  It is his case in those proceedings that the respondent has increasingly sought to put distance between him and his daughter.  He maintains that the catalogue of complaints which she has raised in the contact proceedings, including the allegations of rape, are entirely fabricated.  His evidence to the judge was that his former wife was quite capable of lying to the court. He relied on the fact that the allegations against him had not surfaced before he issued his application when CAFCASS became involved at the request of the court in the context of safeguarding checks.  Those allegations, which he maintained to be entirely false, prompted him to issue a further application in which he sought an order that the child should move to live with him.  Before the judge at the fact-finding hearing was a series of counter-allegations which he subsequently made against the respondent, only one of which the judge accepted to be true. </p>

The abuse is used deliberately to undermine the respondent&#8217;s mental health the result of which would put [the child] at risk of emotional harm. &#8230; The respondent cannot trust the applicant not only because of his continued abuse but because this continues against a background of dishonesty.&#8221;  </p>

It is said that her selective approach which involved the omission from an holistic overview of all the evidence some very serious matters (e.g. the allegations of threats to kill, throwing acid in her face) led her into error. </span></p>

It is said that she focussed too much on the respondent&#8217;s evidence and upon parts only of the evidence without taking sufficient care to balance fairly or at all other aspects of the evidence.  In so doing she adopted a &#8216;compartmentalised&#8217; approach. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Ms Markham QC points to a failure on the part of the judge to explore all the documentary evidence which was placed before the court which had the potential to undermine the allegations of rape.  She failed to balance and weigh the unchallenged evidence which the appellant had placed before the court in relation to (i) his aversion to sexual relations with the mother; (ii) the respondent&#8217;s own evidence that he was not a violent man; and (iii) there had been no evidence at all of any previous complaint about his conduct prior to the report which she made to the CAFCASS officer when he launched his formal application for contact.  In particular, Ms Markham QC identifies what appears to be a failure on the part of the judge to include within her judgment a summary of the oral evidence she heard, or an account of her impression of the witnesses as truthful or otherwise, and/or an account of the weight which she had attached to any of these matters. In summary, Ms Markham QC submits that, aside from her specific findings, there is no evidence on the face of the judgment that the judge had weighed the parties&#8217; evidence in order to reach a conclusion that the respondent&#8217;s evidence was to be preferred in the context of the specific allegations of rape.   </p>

Distilled to their essence, she submits on his behalf that her client was deprived of a full and fair hearing on all of the issues and allegations which were being made against him.  She submits that the judge clearly &#8216;took a view&#8217; that the mother was a more reliable witness without explaining from the foot of a careful and detailed analysis of the evidence why she had reached that conclusion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Ms Sarah Morgan QC on behalf of the respondent has put before the court a full and detailed skeleton argument which seeks to address each of these grounds of appeal.  The over-arching thrust of her submissions is that each of the findings made by the judge fell well within the ambit of the discretion entrusted to her. They cannot be considered peverse or inconsistent with any of the evidence she heard.  Her findings were underpinned by the significant advantage of having seen and heard the parties as they were giving oral evidence.  Ms Morgan QC points to the fact that none of three counsel instructed in the case sought further amplification or qualification of the judgment prior to the findings being captured in the order which the judge approved at the conclusion of the hearing.  In the absence of a procedural irregularity or error of law, she invites this court to find that there is no justification for disturbing those findings. </p>

This is crucial in the context of family proceedings and welfare decisions for the child or children at their centre.  The fact-finding process informs those welfare decisions which can have far-reaching, and often life-changing, consequences not only for those children but for their parents and others affected by the intervention of the state, through the court, in family life.  Fundamental rights of both children and their parents are engaged in these cases.  That is why the facts matter and why it is essential that parties to a fact-finding exercise understand clearly the basis upon which a court has reached its decision.  </p>

Essentially, the judicial task is twofold: to enable the parties to understand why they have won or lost; and to provide sufficient detail and analysis to enable an appellate court to decide whether or not the judgment is sustainable.

She sets out her finding in relation to the appellant having made a &#8216;clear and deliberate threat&#8217; to remove the child to Pakistan in April 2015.  That finding was made on the basis of the judge&#8217;s analysis of the content of some heated WhatsApp exchanges between the parties in the early hours of the morning and from the foot of subsequent telephone calls and emails.  Given the evidence available to the judge which went beyond the oral evidence of the parties themselves, it is not difficult to see why she was able to reach that conclusion.  Further emails and WhatsApp communications between the parents to which the judge refers in paragraphs 53 to 60 of her judgment provided the evidential basis for her conclusion and finding that the appellant had threatened the respondent with both the removal of the child and professional embarrassment and that he had used those threats to control and intimidate her.

In the light of those findings she specifically declined to consider other allegations made by the respondent, including the serious allegation that the appellant had threatened to throw acid in her face.  That particular allegation was consigned with several others (such as the allegations about publicly humiliating the respondent by pulling down her clothes in public and offering her dog food, assaulting her in a petrol station and threatening her with a knife held to her throat) to evidential territory into which the judge did not feel it necessary to tread.  In the context of overall credibility and her assessment of these parties as witnesses of the truth, she plainly considered it unnecessary to explore these allegations and/or to consider whether such an assessment might have any impact on the allegations of rape.   </p>

This recital in terms raises two issues.  First, it is not entirely clear from the face of the judgment which of the respondent&#8217;s allegations was intended by the judge to be captured within the generic description of &#8220;physical abuse&#8221;.  A purposive reading of the judgment suggests that the allegation relating to throwing battery acid in the respondent&#8217;s face and threatening her with a knife held to her neck might fall within that description of abuse.  Secondly, and perhaps of greater concern, the reference in the recital to the judge&#8217;s clear view that those allegations could be properly characterised as having &#8220;strength and power&#8221; suggests on any objective view that, in the judge&#8217;s mind, they might be true.  Having earlier in her judgment refused to consider them as relevant to the fact-finding exercise on which she was embarked, the presence of this recital in the order inevitably leaves the parties, their advisers and this court in some doubt as to the extent to which these matters featured in the analysis of credibility which the judge undertook in preferring the account given by the respondent.   </p>

Whilst she deals in paragraphs 104 to 118 with the appellant&#8217;s allegations against the respondent, there is in my judgment no, or no sufficient, analysis of the appellant&#8217;s case that what he was facing as a result of his contact application was a series of escalating and false allegations manufactured by the mother in </p>

That would be to ignore what might in any particular case prove to be a significant element in the evidential landscape.  What is required of a judge is a self-direction that a person can lie for a number of different reasons including shame, humiliation, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear, distress, confusion and emotional pressure.  Lies or dishonesty in the past do not of themselves prove the existence of lies now. Having given himself or herself such a direction, a judge must then reflect in the judgment how that direction has shaped his or her approach to relevant issues of credibility. In cases involving previous dishonesty or inconsistent statements, that is inevitably an essential part of the analysis in relation to the general credibility of the witnesses from whom the court receives evidence.  Where, as here, a judgment lacks clarity in relation to that assessment, it is difficult to determine the extent to which this point was shaping or influencing any internal analysis or thought process conducted by the judge.  It operates in the context of her assessment of credibility of each of these parties.  In relation to the appellant&#8217;s evidence and the fact of his previous conviction for dishonesty, the judge&#8217;s apparent solution was to put it from her mind completely.

Ms Morgan QC properly reminds me that the judgment was delivered &#8216;hot on the heels&#8217; of all the evidence and the written and oral submissions which the judge heard.  There would have been neither the time nor the opportunity for the judge to craft the sort of judgment which addressed all of the many challenges now raised by Ms Markham QC with the benefit of forensic hindsight.   She accepts that there are instances of &#8220;shorthand&#8221; in the judgment.  By way of example, she points to paragraph 36 and the judge&#8217;s abbreviated approach to the law as implicit recognition that this was a case where a <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span> direction was required.  She submits that her failure to refer in the judgment to a specific direction in this context is remedied by the fact that the judge treated the appellant as a man of good character.

That has to be seen against the background of the circumstances in which the alleged rapes occurred.  On both occasions the parties were physically sharing a bed.  There was no issue about that fact and thus the judicial determination was inevitably binary:  it either happened as the respondent recounted or it did not.  Her acceptance of the mother&#8217;s account, delivered as it was with a description in one instance of her head making physical contact with a windowsill, carries with it a rejection of the appellant&#8217;s case that her allegations were fabricated.  She was well aware of the sexual difficulties within the marriage.  The judge&#8217;s conclusion that the sexual relations which the respondent described had nothing to do with sex and intimacy and everything to do with violence and power is relied upon by Ms Morgan QC as evidence of the extent of the analysis which the judge undertook. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is therefore with regret that I have reached the conclusion that her findings cannot stand.  I do not reach that conclusion because she was wrong but because of the manner in which she appears to have reached those conclusions.  In my judgment there is substance in Ms Markham QC&#8217;s challenge to the reasoning which is insufficient to explain how she conducted her assessment of credibility and which matters she did, or did not, weigh in the balance when reaching her conclusions.  In this context, I regard it as a mistake to have included within her approved order the recital about the &#8220;strength and power&#8221; of the allegations which she claims to have ignored in her survey of the evidence.  The inevitable inference to be drawn from that recital is that, despite having elected to make no findings in relation to them, she nevertheless brought them into account to one degree or another and further that she had carried out an evaluation of evidence which she claimed she had ignored in reaching her conclusions.  In the absence of any clear analysis in relation to the means by which she had approached the assessment of credibility, the presence of this recital in her order signals a clear impression that matters which she claims to have left out of account have, on the contrary, informed her conclusions.  I take the view that, in a case where one party is alleging that allegations have been fabricated as part of a course of conduct designed to marginalise a parent from the life of a child of the family, it is incumbent on the fact-finder to explain carefully why that case is rejected.  That did not happen in this case.   The appellant has been left with an impression that his case has not received the careful consideration which it deserved.  Recognising the pressure of time on the judge on the final day allocated to this hearing, I have reached a conclusion that she did fall into error in compartmentalising much of the evidence.  She did not have sufficient regard to how each piece of evidence fell to be considered against the totality of the evidential canvas before the court. </p>
