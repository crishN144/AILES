They are engaged in litigation in England and in India in respect of their son K (born August 2015).  The English limb of the proceedings is the mother&#8217;s application for wardship which was issued on or about the 16 October 2018, and which includes within it application for the summary return of the child from India to England.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The matter came before me at 2pm on 6 February with its two-hour time estimate. I was provided with a bundle of some 640 odd pages together with practice direction documents and position statements or skeletons on behalf of both parties and a number of authorities. The essential reading list helpfully identified about 100 pages of reading although unfortunately the approved transcript of Deputy High Court Judge Gupta QC did not become available until about 4:45pm and prior to that I had access only to a somewhat scrambled note taken by the parties on 23 January 2019. The mother attended in person, she having returned from India in July 2018 with the child remaining in India with her parents. She had been unable to obtain a passport for the child and so was unable to bring him back with her. She was represented by Ms ScottWittenborn, counsel. The father attended the hearing by video link from India, he having returned to India in about June 2018. He was represented by Ms Clare Renton, counsel. Over the course of the afternoon I heard submissions on behalf of each party on the facts and the law. It emerged that there was an issue between the parties as to the availability of an &#8216;Hemain&#8217; anti-suit injunction in relation to proceedings concerning children. The mother argued that if I concluded that the English court should exercise its jurisdiction over the child, and rejected the father&#8217;s application for a stay of the English proceedings that I should in tandem with the exercise of the English jurisdiction injunct the father from further progress in the Indian proceedings, save to the extent that it was necessary to give effect to any English orders relating to the child. The father argued that &#8216;Hemain&#8217; injunctions were not permissible in actions concerning children.  In the circumstances the two-hour time estimate that had been given to the case proved to be wholly inadequate given the volume of reading, the non-compliance with the direction as to an agreed summary of the law and authorities, the range of submissions and the need to consider the law relating to &#8216;Hemain&#8217; injunctions. I therefore was obliged to reserve both my decision and judgment overnight. Further written submissions were made by the parties on the 7 February 2019.  </p>

He kept his options open by renewing his own UK passport. Thus the mother and child became &#8216;stranded&#8217; in India by June 2018. Deputy High Court Judge Gupta QC found that the father&#8217;s actions were premeditated and deliberate. He also concluded that in 2017 the mother and child were kept in India and the father made her agree to certain things before she was allowed to return to the UK.  </p>

The child welfare committee in the town of S (which is where the child lives with his maternal grandparents) received a complaint by the father on 16 October 2018. Subsequently a petition was filed by the father with the Child Welfare Committee on 25 December 2018. In the petition the father makes some very serious allegations in respect of both the mother and the maternal grandparents treating the child abusively and the mother neglecting his welfare. Of course, he does not identify that he stranded the mother and child in India and the inference from the petition is that the mother returned to England of her own volition effectively abandoning the child with her parents. </p>

She currently has an application for a Visa outstanding with the Home Office. Her Indian passport is lodged with the Home Office. The evidence seems to confirm that she could retrieve her passport from the Home Office and travel to India. However her application would then be closed and because her previous Visa expired in October 2018 she would be unable to return to England and would have to make an out of country Visa application, which would require her to remain in India pending its determination. She says that given her employment and her housing she cannot realistically therefore travel to India until her application is determined. She has been led to believe that it should be determined within about six months. Although there was some dispute between Ms Renton and Ms Scott-Wittenborn about the mother&#8217;s immigration situation the position outlined above ultimately did not seem to be disputed. The father&#8217;s English lawyer has some specialisation, I&#8217;m told, in immigration and she did not appear to dissent from the position outlined by Ms ScottWittenborn. </p>

That being so and as in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (abduction: jurisdiction)</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/1101" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 1101" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 1101</ref></span>, <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 1 FLR 1132" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 1 FLR 1132</ref></span> one might argue that a retained jurisdiction under article 10 BIIa (either independently of or in addition to the article 8 jurisdiction Deputy High Court Judge Gupta QC found) was one which is not susceptible to a stay on forum nonconveniens grounds. It might also be argued that an Article 8 BIIA habitual residence jurisdiction is not susceptible to a stay on forum non conveniens grounds; see paragraph 59 of Re H (above). The Court of Appeal declined to determine the &#8216;Owusu-v-Jackson&#8217; arguments and the Supreme Court had suggested in<span style="font-style:italic"> A v A (children: habitual residence) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre intervening)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/60" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 60</ref><span style="font-style:italic">, </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 FLR 111" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 FLR 111</ref><span style="font-style:italic"/>that the point might require a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union. However the case proceeded before Deputy High Court Judge Gupta QC on the basis that the jurisdiction to stay proceedings did exist and I cannot find any suggestion in any earlier order that the existence of the courts ability to stay proceedings was challenged. Given the need to avoid delay in these proceedings and given that the point was not raised on behalf of the mother I do not propose to attempt to address it. As it happens the trend of authority in relation to the &#8216;Owusu-v-Jackson&#8217; points towards the conclusion that the power to stay proceedings on forum non-conveniens grounds continues to exist in respect of countries which fall outside the scheme of BIIa or the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention. See Rayden and Jackson on Relationship Breakdown, Finances and Children, Volume 2 [31.326-328] and the cases cited there. For the purposes of this case therefore I work on the basis that the court retains the ability to stay these proceedings on the basis of forum non conveniens.  </p>

In this way, proper regard is had to the fact that jurisdiction has been founded in England as of right (see the Spiliada case </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] 3 All ER 843" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] 3 All ER 843</ref><span style="font-style:italic"> at 855, </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] AC 460" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] AC 460</ref><span style="font-style:italic"> at 477). At this first stage of the inquiry the court will consider what factors there are which point in the direction of another forum (see the Spiliada case </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] 3 All ER 843" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] 3 All ER 843</ref><span style="font-style:italic"> at 855, </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] AC 460" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] AC 460</ref><span style="font-style:italic"> at 477; Connelly v RTZ Corp plc</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 4 All ER 335" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 4 All ER 335</ref><span style="font-style:italic"> at 344, </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1988] AC 854" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1988">[1988] AC 854</ref><span style="font-style:italic"> at 871). If the court concludes at that stage that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, that is likely to be the end of the matter. But if the court concludes at that stage that there is some other available forum which prima facie is more appropriate for the trial of the action it will ordinarily grant a stay unless the plaintiff can show that there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be granted.

Hence provision is made for stays of second seized proceedings. I see no reason in principle why the ill of concurrent proceedings in England and Wales and another country which is not a party to those international instruments is any less. The risk is of the parties and the children being exposed to the stress and cost of two sets of litigation. In particular there is the risk of conflicting judgments being issued by the two courts which may have profound consequences for the children in terms of their relationship with their parents and their ability to travel between two countries both of which they may have significant connections with including family. Thus if the &#8216;ill&#8217; is the same and if a stay might issue to remedy the ill as between signatories to international instruments I see no reason in principle why the court should be unable to deploy the other tool of an anti-suit injunction where a non-signatory state is involved. However the identification of the ability of the court to grant such an injunction in principle is quite different to the grant of an injunction in practice.  </p>

It seems clear that the High Court in Madras has an ability to stay the operation of orders and it may well have the ability to stay proceedings in India on the basis of forum non conveniens. In the absence of evidence as to Indian law, I approach it on the of the general principle of English law to the effect that foreign law is the same as English law until the contrary be proved: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Mansour v. Mansour </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1989] 1 F.L.R. 418" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">[1989] 1 F.L.R. 418</ref>, CA, at p. 419.  Where it seems probable that a court has its own jurisdiction to stay proceedings, acting in accordance with the principle of comity it seems to me that before granting an antisuit injunction the court would expect the applicant in England to make an application in the other jurisdiction for a stay of those proceedings. </p>

A country such as India has its own jurisdictional criteria, a well-established and respected court system and judiciary and in particular where the court itself has established Custodianship over a child it has rendered its own welfare determination. Thus any step taken in this court which has the effect of inhibiting or restricting the ability of the Indian High Court to determine the welfare of a child in its jurisdiction, even through the vehicle of an injunction directed at a party, would potentially be a significant interference with the judicial process of that country. It seems reasonably clear that, like England, the court acts upon application made by party rather than of its own motion. Thus an injunction restricting a party&#8217;s access to a court indirectly restricts the courts ability to exercise its jurisdiction. </p>

Thus some care would need to be taken in ensuring that any anti-suit injunction in respect of proceedings relating to a child did not place the respondent in a position where he could not engage the local court to deal with an urgent matter which could not be determined by the English court in an effective way. The provisions of Article 20 BIIA and Articles 11 and 12 of the 1996 Hague Convention are of course in part designed to address this sort of issue where both countries are a party. Ultimately if the issue is one of &#8216;securing the ends of justice&#8217; which in a case where the child&#8217;s welfare is at issue the general principles outlined which support the &#8216;securing the ends of justice&#8217; are fortified by the best interests of the child at least as a primary consideration.   </p>

		  <p style="margin-left:1.48in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">Deputy High Court Judge Gupta QC concluded after a thorough review of the evidence that the child remained habitually resident in England and that he remained more integrated in this jurisdiction than in India.  In contrast the Indian court&#8217;s jurisdiction appears to be based on presence which in the hierarchy of jurisdictions undoubtedly indicates a lower level of connection with that country than habitual residence. However the child and the parties have a significant connection with India, both in terms of it being their country of birth, a country with which they are familiar from growing up and being educated there, and a country where they have significant family connections. Both appear to speak fluent English and both the mother and father have chosen to make England their home in recent years albeit still spending some considerable periods of time in India. The choice that the family have made to opt for British citizenship for the father and for the child which I believe is also the aspiration of the mother indicate a significant connection with England and Wales.  In relation to the jurisdictional connection I do not think one can ignore the fact that Deputy High Court Judge Gupta QC found that the father had stranded the mother and child in India by premeditated action on his behalf. He did so because he saw some advantage to himself in adopting that course of action; Deputy High Court Judge Gupta QC found that he had adopted a similar course previously in order to extract concessions from the mother on various matters. A significant part of the philosophy of courts approaching abduction situations is to return the child to the country of habitual residence in order to prevent the abductor or obtaining some jurisdictional advantage by wrongful action. That must also be factored in it seems to me. Thus overall the balance in respect of this aspect seems to fall clearly in favour of the English court exercising jurisdiction based on a combination of the factual matters which give rise to the habitual residence jurisdiction and which amount to a significant connection to this jurisdiction and which in my view outweigh the connection that the parties and the child have to India, in particular having regard to the fact that the child&#8217;s presence and thus the Indian court&#8217;s jurisdiction was secured by wrongful action on the father&#8217;s part. </p>

Although at the present time the Indian court may be better placed to determine matters relating to the child&#8217;s health that would be relatively easily remedied if the child were to return to this jurisdiction for assessment and treatment. It seems that the Indian courts have access to a social work reporting process which may be broadly comparable to the function that Cafcass would undertake in this jurisdiction. The limitation that currently appears to exist is that because the mother cannot travel to India &#8211; the social work report there will be unable to assess her with the child. That is a significant limitation. The limitation on the English assessment is of course that the child remains in India and unless the English and Indian court are able to work together to allow the child to travel to England any Cafcass assessment will be seriously limited. That is a serious limitation at present on the English process. In respect of this component the situation seemed broadly evenly balanced or perhaps marginally in favour of India.  </p>

Any medical evidence is likely to be put before the court in the form of reports rather than live evidence. Thus this court could assess medical evidence from India and England and the Indian court could assess medical evidence from India or England. The significant difference at present is that the mother cannot travel to India without giving up her job and home in England and being restricted to living in India whilst her Visa application is processed. In reality that means she is unable to travel to India to participate in the court process or to give live evidence. That is a very significant disadvantage. With his British passport, the father is at liberty to travel to this country to participate in proceedings here and to be assessed by Cafcass. Clearly this court can hear video link evidence from India; that was demonstrated by the successful operation of the video link in the hearing yesterday. I have no evidence before me as to the availability of similar facilities to enable witnesses in England to give evidence to the Indian court. Documentary records from India or from England will be available to both courts; language does not appear to be a problem either way the child may be less able to express his wishes and feelings to a Cafcass officer. However given his young age and his speech and developmental delay there will be limits on ascertaining his wishes and feelings whether in India or in England.  </p>

The existence of three sets of proceedings started by the father in which a court has jurisdiction to make custody orders seems to me a recipe for complexity and delay. Because of the absence of evidence from the father (albeit the mother could have put it before me also but given the burden lies on the father tactically the onus would be on him) as to how each of those three sets of proceedings interface with the other and how contradictory decisions or parallel processes will be avoided I am left with an abiding and serious concern as to whether the father has chosen to pursue that course because he perceives some tactical advantage in multiple proceedings.

I fully respect the process which the Indian courts have embarked upon and the orders that they have made and anticipate that this court and the Indian court will be able to work collaboratively to reach an appropriate solution for this child.

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">It is in this child&#8217;s welfare interests to determine his future with as little delay as possible. Given that I am able to assess with a fair degree of certainty the timeframe for English proceedings but am unable to determine at all the timeframe for Indian proceedings the balance in this respect favours England. It is also in his welfare interests to have as little disruption to his medical treatment as possible. This would favour India although a high degree of continuity could be achieved if he were to be assessed in England and only returned permanently once the treatment program was in place. It would also be in his welfare interests to be in a country where both of his parents could be present to support him. This would favour England at the present time. Confirming the exercise of the English court&#8217;s jurisdiction will almost inevitably involve some disruption for the child as he would need to return to this country on either a temporary or permanent basis. However as things currently stand that would likely result in him resuming life either with his mother with his mother and father if the father chose to return to the UK also. Thus overall it seems to me that his welfare would tend to favour the English court exercising jurisdiction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I thus conclude for all the reasons set out above taken in combination that the father has not discharged the burden upon him to establish that a stay of the English proceedings is appropriate. On clear balance England is the natural and appropriate forum and India is not clearly the more appropriate forum; albeit that it is not all oneway traffic. Thus the father&#8217;s application for a stay of the English proceedings or their dismissal is refused.<span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"/>As I have reached the conclusion that the jurisdiction ought to be exercised following my forum non-conveniens evaluation I am reinforced in my conclusion that I do not need to address the &#8216;Owusu-v-Jackson&#8217; point in any event. On the facts of this case the outcome of the argument would make no difference. There may well of course be cases where it would make a critical difference. That case will have to await determination on another day </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Having regard to the test for the deployment of a permanent anti-suit injunction outlined above I&#8217;m not satisfied that this case falls into a category where such an injunction could properly be made. I acknowledge that it could be argued that having regard to the issues surrounding the wrongful retention of the child in India that the mother could justifiably submit that she has a right not to be sued in India when that jurisdiction arose only through the wrongful act of the father. However the Indian court&#8217;s jurisdiction is in respect of a child; this is not a commercial matter. Given the possible availability of a stay application in the Indian courts and given the issues of comity which arise when a court exercises a custodianship jurisdiction in respect of a child I do not consider it appropriate in the exercise of my discretion to grant an antisuit injunction. Assuming that a stay application can be made and that some form of judicial liaison can be commenced to enable this court and the Indian court to work cooperatively to solve the riddle of competing applications in our respective courts, it is in my view wholly premature to grant such an injunction. That situation might fall to be reconsidered if no progress can be made and in particular if the father embarked upon a rear-guard action to play the Indian courts to delay the resolution of matters. However we are far from that position as yet. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In respect of interim welfare orders at the present time I&#8217;m not satisfied that it would be in this child&#8217;s welfare to make an order for his summary return to this jurisdiction on a permanent basis. If he is to return on a permanent basis the arrangements for his care and the meeting of his medical needs will need to be in place immediately upon his return. That will need a more concrete care plan in respect of his medical needs which may only be capable of construction after he has been seen by a paediatrician in England. The arrangements for his care having regard to the mother&#8217;s work commitments will also need to be considered. On a provisional basis it seems to me that it would be in his welfare interests to return temporarily to this jurisdiction to enable him to both be reunited with his mother for a short period of time, and possibly also with his father if he will travel to the UK, and for him to be assessed by a paediatrician in order to commence work on the construction of the care plan.  </p>

Thus I will invite the Cafcass High Court team to appoint one of their officers to represent this child&#8217;s interests.  Before I make an order for his temporary return I would value the input of the Guardian in respect of the orders that would best promote this little boy&#8217;s welfare. </p>

I consider the hearing should be after the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of March 2019 in order to enable the Mother to make an application to that court for a stay. </p>
