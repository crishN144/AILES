	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the second judgment in private law proceedings which concern two children, S (a boy, now fourteen; born on [on at date in]  2004) and N (a girl, now twelve; born on [on at date in]  2005), and child arrangement orders (CAO) under the Children Act (CA) 1989 section 8. The court has also been asked, by the children&#8217;s guardian, to consider making a supervision order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>. Their parents are separated and the children live with their mother (C) in England. They are of dual heritage; their mother is British and their father (P) is Swedish. In April 2017 this court handed down a judgment following a fact-finding hearing. It was concluded, on the basis of the findings made, that the two children had suffered significant emotional harm as a result of their mother&#8217;s behaviour. This judgment concerns their welfare, and future orders in respect of the time they are to spend with their parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C&#8217;s claims that S had been physically abused by his grandmother during the summer of 2016 were rejected, as were the claims that N had made well-founded complaints of bullying by her father. In fact, as the court found, both children had been deliberately influenced by their mother who was determined to bring the children&#8217;s contact with P to an end. Indeed, she had succeeded in stopping all contact with P from the end of their summer holiday in 2016 until the hearing before the Spring or Easter holiday in 2017. Both children made complaints about the behaviour of the paternal family, and, at the time of the previous hearing, they were adamant that they did not want to go back to Sweden at all. They appeared to be wholly rejecting their father, their Swedish relations and that half of their own heritage. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both the children were represented by counsel through the guardian at that time, and their guardian, in her written and oral evidence, described visiting the children at home, to introduce herself and explain her role; the guardian&#8217;s own shock and concern about the level of antipathy demonstrated at the suggestion they should resume contact in Sweden was palpable when she gave her oral evidence. Both children had, vehemently, said to their guardian that they did not want to see their father or ever to visit Sweden again. Up until the summer of 2016, the children, with apparent enjoyment, had been spending most of their school holidays in Sweden with their father, paternal grandparents, relations and friends. They also spent weekends with P in England. There had been social services involvement in this case, prior to the hearing in the Spring of 2016, partly as a result of C seeking to use the authorities to bring contact to an end. There had been numerous applications over the preceding past seven years in respect of the two children; some included very serious allegations made by C, most of which have been investigated by the authorities in Sweden and in England which were unsubstantiated. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The findings made in the previous proceedings can be found in my judgment reported under the neutral citation number <span style="font-weight:bold"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2017/23" uk:canonical="[2017] EWFC 23" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWFC 23</ref></span>; and I shall not set them out here again. After the findings were made contact resumed, almost immediately, and the case was referred to the Anna Freud Centre (AFC) for assessment of the children and their (two) families and further assessments were carried out by the local authority. The local authority and the guardian, unsurprisingly concerned about the children&#8217;s apparent alienation from their father, their paternal family and their Swedish heritage, considered that it was likely to be necessary, in their best interests, to move them to live with P in Sweden. The AFC filed its report in September 2017 and recommended the immediate transfer of residence to Sweden. I shall return to their recommendations later. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case could not return to court immediately for hearing, as there was insufficient judicial time available to list any substantial contested application, and the question of whether N should be separately represented had now arisen as it was obvious that she would not agree with the guardian&#8217;s recommendation. The court was, and remains, keenly aware that N, who has always worked hard at school, was due to start her secondary school education in a highly sought after selective school near her home in England: this achievement forms an important part of N&#8217;s self-image and identity and was not to be taken lightly. In any event contact had resumed and continued to take place in accordance with the court order. The children spent the week before the hearing in February 2018 commenced (half-term) in Sweden. In addition, the children have been supported by direct work with their allocated social worker, Ms Clark and a family assistance worker. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As he did before, P applies for the child arrangements order to be changed, and for S and N to live with him in Sweden; it is his case that the children will suffer further harm, caused by their mother, if they are not moved to Sweden to live with him. For the first time, when giving his oral evidence, P advanced a case that the children would be at risk of physical harm (as well as emotional harm) if they were not moved, although no such allegations were made in his written evidence. P again chose to remain unrepresented and appeared in person before me, his mother, G (who had been joined as an intervener in the fact-finding hearing), attended court with him and acted as his McKenzie friend. C is represented (by Ms Kansal on direct access). C opposes P&#8217;s application; it is her case that she has come to a realisation of the harm she has caused the children and will seek and engage with appropriate therapy to ensure that she does not indulge in her damaging and abusive behaviour in respect of the children&#8217;s contact with their father and paternal family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">S remained represented by counsel (Ms Sweeney as before) through his guardian. Although older than his sister, S is on the autistic spectrum and attends a special school, he is not considered to be Gillick competent by his solicitor. S has told his guardian that he does not want to be removed to live with his father in Sweden. N is separately represented through NYAS by counsel (Ms Rensten). N does not want to move to Sweden, but she does want to have contact with her father and to go to Sweden during school holidays, and to spend weekends with P in England during term-time. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority attended court and were represented by counsel (Ms Case). The social worker, and Team Manager, Ms Clark was present through the hearing. By the time of the hearing in February 2018, Ms Clark and the local authority had changed their position: they no longer supported a move to Sweden and sought a Family Assistance order to continue to support the family in England. The guardian, too, in her final analysis no longer recommended that S and N be moved and recommended that the court make a supervision order in favour of the local authority to support the children should they remain with their mother. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As set out in my previous judgment C, now aged 38 is English and she met P now aged 43, when they were both travelling in New Zealand in 2002. They returned to Europe and lived together in Sweden where they married in 2004. The children were born in Sweden, S in 2004 and N at the end of 2005. The marriage was short-lived and by the end of 2006 their relationship had ended. In 2007 C unsuccessfully claimed for damages for assault by P in the Swedish courts. At the end of 2007 there was an order for shared residence and care of the children in the former family home made by the Swedish court. Both parents were seeking a court order that the children live with them; P in Sweden, C in England. An investigation was carried out by the Swedish child welfare authorities who reported to the court; it recommended custody be granted to P. At the time the poor relationship between P and C, which was described as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">virtually non-existent</span>&#8221;, was considered to one of the problems faced by the children; it is a problem for them that continued and has persisted to the present. S&#8217;s learning disability was already apparent and there was a provisional diagnosis of Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November 2007 divorce was granted and the Swedish Court (by a majority decision) awarded custody of the children to their mother with substantial visiting rights to P. C was permitted to move to England with the children where they have lived since; not without difficulty, S and N have visited and stayed with their father in Sweden regularly. P unsuccessfully appealed the decision of the court in Sweden. One of the many problems in this case is an underlying dispute regarding financial provision for the children; C was to pay for the children&#8217;s travel to and from Sweden and P was to cover the costs of his travel in accompanying them. In October 2008 C stopped paying her share of the children&#8217;s travelling costs. In May 2010 P stopped paying any maintenance for the children, as I observed previously, this remains a decision about which he has never given a satisfactory explanation.  Although he does pay for all the children&#8217;s (and his) travel to and from Sweden, and bears the cost of contact in England, the level of financial support he provides for his children does not extend beyond contact. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In June 2011, S was assessed in respect of his educational needs and found to be autistic. S is on the autistic spectrum; he has had a statement of Educational Needs prepared in 2012 and reviewed annually since. Since he moved to secondary education he has attended a special needs school. As I observed in my first judgment, S has a literal approach to life and an especial need to feel safe and secure in his surroundings. N is an intelligent, diligent scholar and a high achiever, as is seen by the place she has gained in a highly sought after local secondary school which she started in September 2017. She is rightly proud of her achievements and is ambitious for her future (she talks about studying medicine), which she sees as being contingent on her remining at her English school. She has a circle of friends in England and extracurricular activities which are important to her. N is, of course, reaching an age when friends and what goes on outside her home is of increasing importance and relevance to her development.  I shall return to the children&#8217;s individual needs in due course; keeping in mind throughout the welfare checklist as set out in s1 of CA. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since April 2017, after a break of some ten months, the children have resumed contact with their father both in Sweden and had monthly weekends staying with him in England. Sadly, C&#8217;s father, from whom she had been estranged died suddenly at the beginning of October 2017. The children had been in contact with their maternal grandfather as he had provided support for P&#8217;s contact to take place in England. C was reconciled with her father before he died. This bereavement was one that was felt by P and his mother as they each had their own friendship and relationship with the children&#8217;s maternal grandfather. This sad event has thrown into greater relief the dysfunctional relationships within C&#8217;s family, which in turn, may be seen to provide some explanation for her behaviour regarding her own children&#8217;s contact with their father. </p>

They stay with P for 4 consecutive weeks from the first day of the summer holidays; for 1 week, each Christmas holiday to alternate Christmas week and New Year; for 1 week, each Easter holiday to alternate Easter; and for each half term for 10 consecutive days. P has to pay the travel costs of all contact. In addition, they have Skype contact, twice a week, each Tuesday and Friday at 18:00 GMT; and telephone contact each Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at 18:00 GMT with the parent with whom they are not staying.</p>

That harm has been caused to the children by their mother, is no longer in dispute, but it also remains clear to the court that the children continue to be detrimentally affected by an inability on the part of both their parents to reach some level of cordiality to enable reasonable communication with each other. Nonetheless, as observed by the social worker Ms Clark, in her oral evidence to me, the contact has resumed and taken place with little input from social services; something that could not have happened without positive action and some communication on the part of P and C. </p>

P, in turn, and on his own admission, is sceptical about the motivation behind her attempts and continues to complain about the content of the emails and says that he is not kept informed. While his scepticism is understandable, given the history of the case, the fact that the emails have been sent and have contained straightforward information about what the children have been doing is a considerable change to the situation that prevailed when this case was last before the court for a full hearing in early 2017. P was able to bring himself to say, however, that the emails he received latterly were acceptable to him, the main difference seemed to be that, unlike the earlier, there was information about what the children were going to do in the following weeks, as well as what they had done. </p>

P complained in the past, and still complains, that while the children enjoy pretty much unrestricted contact by Skype or other video communication with their mother and family in England while they are on holiday in Sweden,  his video contact which takes place twice a week when they are at home in England is stilted and the children do not engage with him to the same extent. His oral evidence was that he although he believed that the children were now able to speak to him unhindered or monitored without their mother or any other family member being present, the children were not interacting with him for very long (about 10 minutes or so) in the way he would like and expect. The fact that S and N now have unimpeded and frequent video contact with their father is another improvement, if not transformation in their contact with him since the fact finding hearing next year. </p>

P lays the blame squarely at the door of C, but, while there is no doubt that she has affected their view of their father, the children are bound to be affected by other matters; they are after all children, and will not always to be as interested in talking to P as he is in talking to them. They are, for example, simply likely have other things they want to get on with and do. It is the experience of those of us sitting in the Family Court that children are easily distracted by other more immediately interesting (to them) things, and that parents often find their children&#8217;s concentration on talking to them disappointing and even hurtful. It is not realistic or reasonable for P to expect the children to ignore what is going on at home and to concentrate exclusively on their video contact with him.  </p>

As before, aside from the considerable concerns raised about the emotional and psychological wellbeing of S and N caused by their mother&#8217;s persistent attempts to alienate them from their father, there is no evidence that there have ever been any concerns raised about any other aspect of either child care or well-being at home in England and none at all about the care of L or J. S and N are physically well looked after and are well settled into their own schools,  their own routines and actively participate in extra-curricular activities outside their home.

As the local authority said in written submissions, supported by the evidence of their social worker, within a matter of weeks, the children went from being distressed and crying at the suggestion of contact with their father to staying with him once more, seemingly without complaint, and with minimal intervention on the part of the local authority. It is inconceivable that this would, or could, have happened without the active support of their mother. Unsurprisingly, contact did not resume &#8220;where it left off&#8221;. The tenor of the children&#8217;s relationship with their Swedish family has, according to P and his mother, altered and is much more strained than it was before. It is fair to say, on the basis of his own evidence, that P finds his relationship with N difficult at times. It is more likely than not that N&#8217;s relationship with P would have altered, whatever happened in the past, as she approaches adolescence. There is a perception expressed by both children, that P has an easier and more active relationship with S. This is something that was already evident before contact was stopped for the period between August 2016 and April or May 2017.</p>

They are, and have been aware, that where they will live in the next years of their childhood is a decision that is to be made, in due course, by the court for most of the time during which contact has been reintroduced. They are also aware that their father wants them to be moved to live in Sweden. Nonetheless, as P has described in his evidence, N has managed to maintain a relaxed enough relationship with him to send WhatsApp messages when she has wanted to change the time of a video call. He also described a recent occasion when he and N went shopping, just the two of them, and how much she and he enjoyed it. </p>

The social worker described her own observations of contact (some of which occurred after the AFC report had been completed) and told the court that she had seen that the children were able to be relaxed in the company of their father and obviously enjoyed being with him. She told me that she was reassured by the fact that N, in particular, was relaxed enough to challenge him and be difficult in the way a child approaching adolescence should be. It is of concern to the court that the AFC has seemingly dismissed this practical and real demonstration of a change in C&#8217;s position regarding contact. All too often in cases where the court encounters intractable hostility on the part of one parent, stretching over a period of years, there is little, if any response to the judgment and no resumption of contact, still less of regular staying contact overseas. </p>

Similarly, Ms Clark (and the local authority) have allocated an unusually substantial amount of time and resources to this private law case. Their intervention has been both timely and proportionate; as the guardian said in her oral evidence, Ms Clark has demonstrated real commitment to the case and to the children. The time she has spent with the children and the work she has carried out directly or in a supervisory capacity up until the hearing allows the court to place some considerable weight on her opinion and assessment of the children and their welfare. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By contrast the two professionals from the AFC had not seen the children for many months prior to the hearing in February 2018 and their report prepared in September 2017. Both gave evidence, and Dr Shahnavaz had the advantage of hearing Ms Henry&#8217;s oral evidence before she gave her own evidence to the court. It was submitted on behalf of the children that the evidence of Ms Henry might have been considered to be &#8220;over dogmatic&#8221; by the court; I agree with that submission. Ms Henry did not waver from the recommendation made by the AFC that the children should be removed from their family, and in particular from their mother at once and placed in Sweden despite their expressed views to the contrary. She also adhered to the recommendation that all future contact with their mother, their immediate family in England was to be supervised for a period of two years.</p>

Her evidence to the court was that there was no research available or evidence on which she could rely as to the long-term effects of a forced removal on children. Thus, while the effects on children who have been alienated from one parent by another are documented and understood, to some extent at least, there is nothing on which to base any assertion that to move children against their expressed will and wishes provides better outcomes. </p>

As has the effects on the children of engineering an almost total break with their maternal and English family. On the face of the recommendations this would lead to a reversal of the alienation, this time sanctioned by the court. The local authority and the guardian, who had initially supported the children&#8217;s removal from their mother&#8217;s care, expressed concern from the outset at the recommendation by the AFC for the drastic reduction in any contact between S and N, their mother, step-father and younger siblings. </p>

When asked about her knowledge and experience of change of residence for children who have been subjected to parental alienation she told me that she had seldom recommended a change of residence and, although it was recommended more often than it had been in the past, neither she nor AFC had ever recommended removal to a placement in a different country before in a case such as this so that this decision was unprecedented. </p>

She agreed with the guardian that the loss to the children of their home, their mother, their siblings, their school and friends and their step-father would be very significant; particularly when the AFC is recommending supervised contact until the children are aged 14 and 16 respectively. Unlike Ms Henry, Dr Shahnavaz acknowledged that during the six months since she had seen the children, their social worker and their guardian had observed an improvement in the children&#8217;s presentation that had taken place in the intervening period. She was able to recognise too that C had experienced the judgment of the court followed by the shock of the AFC&#8217;s recommendations, which may have been sufficient to change her thinking, but said that only time would tell if C was paying lip service to a change in attitude.</p>

The successful intervention of the local authority is an indicator of  compliance in the future, for previously, as I found, C only &#8220;worked with&#8221; social workers in an attempt to recruitment to her cause; which was to stop contact with their father. Dr Shahnavaz agreed that there is no research on the outcome for children removed in this situation. In answer to a question she told me that the &#8220;ideal&#8221; would be for the children to remain living with their mother, provided she had successfully engaged in, and responded to, therapeutic intervention; and provided the court found that there had been a genuine change in the children&#8217;s mother&#8217;s approach to contact and to the need for her (C) to have therapeutic intervention.</p>

In addition to the reservations set out above regarding the content and tenor of the evidence of Ms Henry in particular, the lack of knowledge and experience of the long-term effects of children of this age being moved to live in another country undermined the credibility of the recommendation. Moreover, it would seem that they are recommending that the children&#8217;s relationship with their father is to be given priority and ascendancy over their relationships with their mother, step-father and younger siblings; at least for the next two years. This amounts to a deliberate severing of close ties and any form of normal family relationship and begs any number of questions about the effect of this on the children themselves, what explanation they are to be given and what they are to gain from this experiment (for that is what it is), never mind the effect on their family in England. There seems to be a punitive element, towards C in particular, to the course of action proposed by the AFC. There was no assistance forthcoming from either Ms Henry or Dr Shahnavaz about how the mechanics of two years supervised contact was to be resourced or provided. In law it is a gross interference with the family lives of all six individuals unsupported by cogent evidence.  </p>

C said that she recognised the need for her to change, she gave a coherent explanation for why she recognised that need by explaining that she had come to realise on reading the judgment, the harm which she had done the children, She accepted that she had, indeed, caused them significant emotional harm. C explained to the court that she had then gained further insight when her father became ill and died unexpectedly; she related her own actions to those of her mother who had prevented her from having a relationship with her father, and how, not only she had come to regret the loss of that relationship, she could see the detrimental effect on her own actions regarding her children.

Having listened to, and assessed witness over many years I found C&#8217;s repeated apologies to be the most fulsome I have experienced; she made them directly to P and did not even try to make them to me. It is not easy to apologise in court and to do so several times and without any demurral is something that rarely happens in court, even, perhaps especially, when warranted.

It is her opinion, shared by the guardian,  that the proceedings are inhibiting the children themselves (rather than their mother) from permitting their relationship with their father and paternal grandmother to repair and improve as they are both acutely aware that things that they say and do are reported and that interpretations will be put on their words and actions in court. In other words the children are worried that they will be moved to Sweden and cannot fully relax and enjoy their contact with P and their Swedish family the way they used to. This has been observed by both P and his mother, but unlike their social worker, they lay the blame entirely at C&#8217;s door. The social worker believes that further work and therapeutic intervention is required but that it  must take place outside and away from court proceedings. To this end both she and the guardian have asked the court to make a s91(14) order prohibiting the children&#8217;s parents from returning to court with any further applications without the court&#8217;s prior permission. </p>

This raises questions about his ability to deal with their behaviour on being moved against their will to live with him in Sweden. They would, it is accepted be very distressed, in S case he is also likely to be confused and disoriented at being permanently removed from the settled routine centred around a school which he clearly loves. N will be resentful and angry and will not take at all kindly to being moved from the school she worked so hard to get into. P was unable to contemplate any deleterious effect on N&#8217;s educational process on being moved to an entirely different system of education, possibly in a different medium, even when pressed. Nor did he show any insight into how her resentment and anger may, in turn, affect her ability to access education and reach her potential. His only response was to say that the Swedish education system is excellent. This court has no reason to question that system,  and no-one has sought to do so; but as P failed to recognise that is not the question before this court, the question is whether it is in the best interests of these children to move them with all the repercussions for them individually that such a move will inevitably bring.  </p>

He has been described as brusque in the past; certainly, he is much more down-to-earth and no-nonsense than C in his approach to parenting. His previous insistence that the children should fly unaccompanied did not, in the view of this court, meet with S&#8217;s needs and could not work where parents are so adrift in their approaches. Nonetheless the court was left with the impression of a devoted parent and loving father, whose attitude to parenting offered the children an opportunity to run more freely and to experience the physicality of play to the full.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have little doubt that P&#8217;s parenting style suits S better than it does N, but, again, I was impressed by the steps he has taken to try to improve his relationship with her. P has in the past demonstrated unrealistic expectations and insensitivity regarding the children and their needs such as when he pursued applications for the children and S, in particular, to fly as unaccompanied minors/children. In his oral evidence he, perhaps understandably, emphasised the negative aspects of the children&#8217;s contact with him, which made it difficult for the court to assess the true extent and reason behind any problems during contact; it was clear, from his evidence, but also that of his mother and the social worker, that S and N have been happy and enjoyed contact with him much of the time. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I found P&#8217;s expectations of N&#8217;s behaviour and interaction with family and friends, to be somewhat unrealistic. He complains she spends too much time in her room; she is a twelve year old girl and this is, surely, a perennial complaint from parents of twelve year old girls. It is of concern that he is reading more into normal pre-adolescent behaviour than there is, as it is likely create a problem about and for N that does not, in fact exist. Similarly, P expressed concern about N not keeping up with her Swedish friends, and losing interest in one of them; again this raises a concern that he is has unrealistic expectations of N and her interaction with girls that she was previously friendly with not to mention reading too much into what is a normal situation; girls fall out and fall in with their friends at this age; children grow up and change. None of this is particularly significant on its own but the import of his evidence about N, when taken in its entirety, is indicative of P seeing N as problematic and the more difficult child which would not bode well for P&#8217;s ability to handle the change in her life he seeks to bring about. </p>

In my judgment in 2017 I said, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">[m]uch of P&#8217;s evidence about the children and what he says they had told him which emerged during his oral evidence was absent from his statements. Allowing for the fact that P was not legally represented, this is unsurprising.&#8221; </span>Given that P is now experienced in litigation and that was drawn to his attention in my previous judgment, it was not acceptable for him to raise in oral evidence for the first time allegations that the children are at physical risk from their mother. Not only did he do so he failed to ask C about it when she was giving evidence, he didn&#8217;t raise it with the social worker or the guardian.</p>

Not only was this raised in evidence for the first time P failed to put it to the social worker or the guardian in cross-examination despite claiming in his oral evidence that he had told the guardian and Ms Clark about S having made the allegation to him. P had apparently raised the question of S being &#8220;pushed&#8221; &#8211; but not forced - to write the letter in an email to the social worker; but he did not raise it with the guardian. Had he done so, it is I find most unlikely that he did so and that both professional witnesses did nothing about it when they were told and failed to mention it in their written evidence. </p>

I have no alternative but to find that P lied to the court in his evidence in respect of what he told the guardian or social worker. I cannot find that S told P what he claims he did, as there is no evidence to support his assertion, and it is more likely than not that if S had told P that he had been forced to write the letter by his mother and stepfather P would have raised the matter at the time to advance his case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moreover, as counsel for S points out, P had been in touch with RF (who clearly has an axe to grind when it comes to her sister C) from around October 2017. The letter came about after then and the last sentence in it appears to read <span style="font-style:italic">"I don't know why my auntie is sic pertraying [sic] my mum"</span>. S could only be aware of the views of RF by being exposed to them which could only come about when he was in P&#8217;s care. It is clear to see why P personally would find RF sympathetic company, as she validates his negative views of C, but he shows little or no insight into the effects of her evident distaste for their mother on the children. It is questionable, at the very least, whether it was in the children&#8217;s best interests to be exposed to RF and her views of C. If S, as is likely, told his mother about RF, she might well have seen RF&#8217;s behaviour, and with some justification as RF is her sister, as being a betrayal, coming as it did shortly after the death of her father. S may well be reflecting is mother&#8217;s reaction to RF&#8217;s views.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As was submitted on behalf of the guardian an important factor regarding the contents of S&#8217;s note is to underline again the need for professional support to repair relationships. It also raises questions about P&#8217;s judgment as a parent in exposing the children to further inter-familial conflict. As counsel for S submits on his behalf and  that of the guardian, P is not perfect, nor does the court expect him to be. P&#8217;s commitment to a full relationship with his children cannot be faulted but it would be tragic if that relationship were to be severely undermined, if not permanently damaged, by the children seeing him as the person who took them away from their family and life in England against their wishes. The guardian reiterated that while P says that S wishes to go to Sweden that is not what he has said to his guardian and it is certainly not what N wants to do on a permanent basis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The paternal grandmother (G) gave evidence again. She is clearly saddened and very much hurt by what has happened in the past and is no more inclined or able to trust C than P is; it is understandable that they are both so distrustful of C&#8217;s words. G had been the subject of very hurtful, nasty and unfounded allegations and has missed having significant events in her own and her grandchildren&#8217;s lives properly marked. Nonetheless I found her evidence in respect of the children&#8217;s contact in Sweden helpful and illuminating. She described how N seemed to be unable to enjoy herself and was holding back from doing so; this underlines what the social worker said about the need for the children not to feel they are caught up in unresolved court proceedings. I do not accept that this is all at the behest of C but agree with Ms Clark that some of the children&#8217;s perceived self-restraint is because they know that the father and grandmother want to have them removed to live in Sweden.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">N&#8217;s behaviour, I was told, is at times discourteous and rude but in doing this, N is testing the boundaries which is, in fact, a positive sign as children only do this when they feel secure enough to do so. It is clear too that G and P are struggling to know what to with N at times. Having said that, when taken in the round, G&#8217;s evidence about the children&#8217;s contact was more positive generally than that of P and her description of N&#8217;s continued good relationship with her paternal aunt was a pleasure to hear; as was the description of the children cooking with their grandfather. In fact G related numerous examples of positive and happy times, and while both P and G were obviously concerned about the children&#8217;s ability to let themselves go and be at home, what G told me about what they were actually doing and the children&#8217;s interaction with their family in Sweden disclosed more positives than negatives. I keep in mind too, that both P and G, naturally and understandably, were giving evidence with a view to achieving the children&#8217;s removal to Sweden.  </p>

Both P and G point to Swedish social services as the answer, but while I have no doubt they would be able to access professional help, I consider that their reliance on that support is more than a little na&#239;ve and betrays a lack of insight or understanding about how the children would both feel and the behaviour that they would be faced with and have to conclude that the evidence is that P and his family would struggle to contain N. The resolution for the behaviour of a deeply distressed and angry teenager cannot be simply left to social services however good they are; such a step would inevitably pathologize the child which cannot be said to be in her best interests. Neither P nor G were able to demonstrate any examples or details of the difficulties that are likely to arise with S and N individually other than to say they knew it would be difficult and really hard work. </p>

The court shares the guardian&#8217;s concern; the statement was written in a deeply vindictive tone and included personal criticism of N describing her controlling and purporting to assess N&#8217;s maturity and intellectual ability in derogatory and negative terms. On paper at least, RF was apparently keen to describe herself as gaining ascendancy over N during contact with P; I remind P that N is a child and RF is the adult. Nonetheless she described N&#8217;s relationship with her father in positive terms. The resentment and dysfunctionality within C&#8217;s family was given further illumination. Some allegations that C had physically abused S many years ago were raised for the first time. It made for unedifying reading. </p>

I do not make any findings in respect of the statement except to observe the fact of its existence and its content gave rise to legitimate concerns on the part of the guardian and the local authority as to the suitability of RF to play any role in any future contact arrangements.  Any suggestion that she should do so would require further investigation and assessment by social services, in the first instance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this judgment I have set out the evidence and my analysis of it above. I have the competing interests of the parties in mind but have put the children at the forefront. The children&#8217;s guardian and the local authority have concluded that whatever C actually thinks or feels she has demonstrated that she is likely to be able to put her own feelings to one side and extend to the children the emotional permission to relax into and enjoy an enduring relationship with their father. There is independent evidence that she has already begun to do so based on the children enjoyment of contact and their father&#8217;s company. To move the children would, as the guardian says, result in multiple losses which they would be forced to face, against their wishes. The loss of their mother, their home, their schools and all that goes with them, their friends, the activities and social life and their siblings and step-father. Given that contact, including video-communications, has been fully resumed and aspects of it have actually improved; such as the children&#8217;s being brought to the airport in good time, the cessation of any oversight of Skype or video contact; and the risk of M&#8217;s back-sliding reduced by the supervision of social services, I can find no good reason why on balance it is in the children&#8217;s best interests to move them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children have both expressed their wishes and feelings clearly and repeatedly to independent witnesses. I do not accept P&#8217;s assertion that that they are merely acting as mouthpieces for their mother; neither does the guardian or the social worker. In fact I consider that it is demeaning to these children to suggest that they are incapable of independent thought at their ages and with their individual abilities and qualities.  As Ms Sweeney put it bluntly, the children cannot be dragged to Sweden against their wishes; as she said, if they are how on earth could their distress and consequential behaviour be coped with in the short or medium term? I agreed with the guardian&#8217;s assessment that such a placement would face a high risk of breakdown; and that it would be more likely than not to lead to a decrease in the children's ability to fulfil their potential.  It is P who would be blamed for their loss.  </p>

Contact will continue to be as set out in the court order. N will have to understand and accept that the court considers that her relationship with her father and her Swedish family must be given priority. As she gets older I expect that she will be able to negotiate some changes to the regime if there are special events at school or with her friends which coincide with contact visits; but for the present the time spent with her father and her paternal must come first.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There will be a supervision order as it better fits with the need for the local authority to return the case to court if it is necessary to do so. Furthermore, it emphasises the seriousness of the findings in this case and is proportionate to the level of harm caused to the children in the past by their mother. There is a level of compunction in law that is absent from a FAO which is both necessary and proportionate given all the circumstances of the case. Nonetheless the court does not mean or intend any criticism of the local authority and would like to extend its gratitude and appreciation of the time and resources allocated which are considerably beyond the norm for a private law case. </p>

That underlines the need for a supervision order, placing the onus on the local authority to return that matter to court if C does not maintain and support the children in their relationship with their father. I apply the approach in considering applications under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s91 (14)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> as set out by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 91(14)</ref> Guidelines) (Residence and Religious Heritage)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 573" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 573</ref> and in numerous decisions since which approve and follow that approach. The court must carry out a balancing exercise between the child&#8217;s welfare and the right of unrestricted access of the litigant to the court. The jurisdiction of the court to restrict applications is discretionary and I have weighed in the balance all the circumstances of this in the exercise of that discretion.</p>

The case will remain reserved to me. The evidence of the guardian and social worker, set out above, is that the children need to be free of litigation to be able fully to benefit from the time they spend with their father; and, that to lift that burden from them will assist them to enjoy their time in Sweden and with their Swedish family without feeling that their behaviour is to continue to be subjected to oversight and interpretation.  The way is clear for a swift return to court by the local authority should it be necessary. </p>
