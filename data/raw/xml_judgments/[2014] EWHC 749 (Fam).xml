He was born in Morocco and is a citizen of Morocco and no other state. (He himself is not, therefore, a citizen of the European Union).  However, he has lived for many years in Spain.  He lives in a small village in southern Spain where he is a labourer or handyman, and is of very modest means.</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s own parents, although British, also live in the same village as the father in southern Spain.  The mother and father have one son, N, who was born in Spain in April 2008 and is now almost six.  The father is named on his birth certificate.  N is a British citizen, for I&#160;have seen his British passport.  There was some question raised at the hearing (irrelevant to the outcome of this case) as to whether he is or may be entitled also to Spanish and/or Moroccan citizenship.</span></p>

There is some dispute as to how, immediately after that, N divided his time between his father and his mother, who was then staying with her parents in the same village.  In March 2010 the mother travelled to England to attend a rehabilitation clinic.  J came with her, but not N.  After leaving the clinic, the mother did not return to live in Spain.   She began living in a town in southern England with a man by whom she now has a third child, a daughter, L, who was born in March 2011 and is now aged just three.  The mother no longer lives with the father of L.  She now, therefore, has three children, aged eight, almost six and just three.  They have the same mother but three different fathers and are genetically half siblings to each other.   N&#8217;s father is a Moroccan, living in Spain.  The fathers of J and L are Englishmen living in England.</span></p>

There is some dispute as to how much in the period March 2010 to May 2012 he was actually living with his father or actually living with his grandparents in the same village.  Their homes are very close to each other and it seems clear that his father was very involved in his care and upbringing and he saw his father a great deal.</span></p>

However, he  [viz the lower court judge] felt that the child would be better looked after with his mother in view of his age (he was born in April 2008) and in view of the fact that, since the mother has two other children, he would be living with his siblings, while the father, who is of Moroccan origin, is alone in Spain.&#8221;</span></p>

As he was appealing the order of the court of first instance, the father did not permit N to travel to England to start living with his mother here.   So pending the hearing of the appeal the mother applied to the court of first instance for &#8220;provisional enforcement&#8221; of its order.  The father strongly resisted that, and it is clear from that court&#8217;s later judgment dated 23 April 2012 that the basis of the opposition was that if, pending the hearing of the appeal, the child was allowed to travel to live or stay with his mother in England, it would be &#8220;impossible or extremely difficult  to restore the situation&#8221; in the event of the appeal being successful.</span></p>

Obviously, one cannot deny the person who has received a favourable judgment from seeing it enforced by using the argument that, if said judgment is not confirmed by a higher court, they will disobey the orders of the latter;  especially when there is no precedent that permits us to presume behaviour of such kind plus a public commitment on the part of [the mother] to comply with whatever the provincial court may order, such as the one expressed during the hearing when she was questioned in that respect, and, above all of course, notwithstanding the responsibilities of all kinds which she could incur in the case of non-compliance.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It is crystal clear from that passage that the judge of first instance ordered &#8220;provisional enforcement&#8221; and permitted the child to come to England because in his judgment there was no basis for believing or presuming that the mother would not obey the order of the appeal court if it later ordered, as it did, that the child should live, not with the mother but with the father in Spain.  There were two reasons for that.   First, &#8220;there is no precedent [i.e. previous behaviour by the mother] that permits us to presume behaviour of that kind&#8221;.  It was &#8220;a mere hypothesis&#8221;.  Second, there was &#8220;a public commitment&#8221; by the mother to comply with whatever the appeal court may order.  The mother indeed accepts that during the hearing on 23 April 2012, while being questioned by the public prosecutor and also by the judge himself, she did clearly and expressly personally say that if the appeal was later allowed she would comply with the order of the appeal court.  </span></p>

A transcript (in English) of a short extract of the mother&#8217;s evidence at that hearing clearly reveals that she was warned and accepted that criminal punishment (viz&#160; &#8220;responsibilities&#8221;) could follow if she broke her &#8220;public commitment&#8221;.

In obedience to the then underlying order of the court of first instance as to custody and contact, the mother returned N to Spain for about six weeks&#8217; holiday in July/August 2012.

The child &#8220;shall have his domicile at&#8221; the father&#8217;s address in Spain.

Before the lower court, a view that a child of that age should be looked after by his mother and living with his siblings outweighed living alone with his father.  Before the higher court (of three judges), continuity of care with a parent whose care had &#8220;not been shown at any time to be detrimental&#8221; in an environment in which the child was integrated and supported by other residents prevailed.  The factors appear to have been relatively evenly balanced and, just as in Spain, the decision could probably have gone either way here.</span></p>

But this relatively uneducated and unsophisticated man inevitably reposed confidence in his local lawyer in Spain; and, as so often in cases of this kind, that lawyer tried instead to achieve enforcement by steps taken in Spain.  He made further applications to the local court of first instance which made orders, first on 17 April 2013 and again on 21 May 2013.  These both ordered the mother to comply with the judgment of the appeal court and return the child to the father.  The mother has ignored them, but the significance of them is that they show that the father was doing his very best, if inadequately or ineffectively, to enforce the custody order, as she knew perfectly well.</span></p>

The lawyers appreciated that the father might be able to apply also, or alternatively, for registration and enforcement of the Spanish order under the provisions of Council Regulation EC No.2201/2003 (Brussels II), but before they could do so they would need to wade through a much more lengthy and bureaucratic process to obtain legal aid for the purpose.</span></p>

But if, applying the test in Article 23(a) of the Brussels&#160;II regulation (which is imported also into the enforcement stage by Article 31.2), I&#160;do not recognise or enforce the order, then, realistically, there could not be an order for return under the Hague Convention on the facts and in the circumstances of this case.  </span></p>

Article 16 of the regulation provides that a court shall be deemed to be seised at the time when the document instituting the proceedings is lodged with the court.  Although the precise date when the document instituting the appeal was lodged has not been identified, there is no doubt that it had already been lodged and served upon the mother before the provisional enforcement proceedings in April 2012, since the judgment in those proceedings is firmly predicated upon the existence of the appeal.  The child continued to live seamlessly in Spain until late May 2012 and so he was patently habitually resident in Spain at the time the appeal court was seised.  </span></p>

Miss Jacqueline Renton on behalf of the mother does not argue or suggest that the Spanish appeal court was not validly seised on 20 December 2012, but she submits (i) that the appeal court order of 20 December 2012, or at the latest the subsequent order of the court of first instance of 21 May 2013, represented what she calls a &#8220;jurisdictional break&#8221;;  and (ii) that in any event the Brussels&#160;II regulation accords no priority as between the provisions as to jurisdiction under Chapter II and the provisions as to recognition and enforcement under Chapter III.  She submits, therefore, that this court cannot simply consider recognition and enforcement, but must, before doing so, or at least concurrently, hold a full welfare hearing of the application the mother has now issued for residence.  I&#160;will address each of these submissions in turn, but briefly.</span></p>

I&#160;agree.  The most obvious example is where a court in one state permits a child to be relocated to another state where it may be anticipated that the child will, or at any rate may, become habitually resident.  But I&#160;cannot accept that there was any jurisdictional break in this case.  The provisional enforcement of 23 April 2012, which permitted removal to England, was expressly predicated upon the public commitment that the mother gave, and the proposition that the mother, who had invoked the jurisdiction of the Spanish court, could be relied upon to obey the order of the appeal court upon appeal.   The appeal court order of 20 December 2012 itself expressly required the return of the child to the custody of the father and to the specified domicile in the village in Spain within the jurisdiction of that court.  The order of 21&#160;May 2013 expressly required the mother to comply with the order of 20 December&#160;2012 and return the child to the father&#8217;s home in Spain within the jurisdiction of that court.  None of these orders are &#8220;jurisdictional breaks&#8221;.  They are, rather, successive affirmations of the continuing jurisdiction of the Spanish courts which had been seised when the child was habitually resident there.</span></p>

There are two distinct stages (i) recognition;  and (ii) enforcement.  In relation to each stage, recognition or enforcement is mandatory unless the ground or test for non-recognition or non-enforcement applies.  In the case of both recognition and enforcement there is only one possible ground for non-recognition or non-enforcement in the present case;  namely, that it would be &#8220;manifestly contrary to the public policy&#8221; of this state &#8220;taking into account the best interests of the child&#8221;.  The test is stringent.   The bar is a high one.   The test is public policy not welfare as such, still less the paramountcy of welfare itself.</span></p>

He has a Moroccan/Spanish heritage.   They do not.
