The application currently before the court was brought under Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>&#8217;).  Within these proceedings, I delivered a judgment on 22 August 2023 which is reported at <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2023/141" uk:canonical="[2023] EWFC 141" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWFC 141</ref> (&#8216;the August 2023 judgment&#8217;).  By that judgment, I explained my reasons for setting aside an agreed order for periodical payments for the subject child, A; she is the only child of the Applicant (&#8216;father&#8217;) and the Respondent (&#8216;mother&#8217;) and is now nearly 15 years old.  I directed a half-day hearing to determine again the quantum of periodical payments.  </span></p>

That application was dismissed in October 2012.  The mother then pursued in the Federal Court her applications to set aside all of the Binding Agreements; this was rejected, and her claim that the Binding Agreements should be set aside was dismissed.&#160;</span></p>

Indeed, Mostyn J held that it would be &#8220;fundamentally unjust&#8221; to require the father to pay for private education for A, given that (a) this type of provision was never agreed between the parties, and (b) the father&#8217;s two children from his second marriage are not educated privately.   It will be noted that I too had already effectively precluded the mother from running this argument at [39(ii)(b)] of my August 2023 judgment.  It follows inevitably that I reject the mother&#8217;s further, informal, application (contained in the narrative of her position statement) for me to &#8220;review afresh&#8221; her claim for funding for private schooling; I suspect that the mother included this sum in the hope that it would bolster her &#8216;needs&#8217; claim for A.

Indeed, it appears that there is an overpayment of the year by c.&#163;4,450 which reflects: (a) the payments he has made to the mother for A at the previously agreed (higher) rate, and (b) three erroneous duplicate payments in October, November, and December 2023.  I note that the father is prepared to write off that overpayment, deeming it to be in A&#8217;s best interests that he do so.</span></p>
