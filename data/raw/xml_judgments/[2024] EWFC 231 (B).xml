The compromise was agreed on the basis that there would be no admissions made by either party and the court would make no findings. </p>

The respondent opposed that application. I was informed at the hearing that both parties agreed that in fact there was no, or minimal, overlap between the subject-matter of the criminal proceedings and the FLA proceedings; <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> that it was agreed that publication, if permitted, would not give rise to any risk of prejudice as far as the criminal proceedings were concerned.

The Court held that they were not.

The Court held that this was not the case. The starting point was the importance of the principle of open justice, and the restriction in AJA 1960, s12 was expressly limited.

The Court held that in such proceedings there was no automatic rule, contrary to the position in both Children Act and finanicial remedy (then &#8220;ancillary relief&#8221;) proceedings, that protected information from the proceedings from being published. Whether they were so protected would depend upon the type of proceedings and whether they come within, or part of the information comes within, the ambit of section 12, or whether the administration of justice would otherwise be impeded or prejudiced by publication (per Butler-Sloss P at paragraph 75).</p>

Part IV applications do not necessarily come within section 12 nor is the element of compulsion, thereby triggering an implied undertaking, always present. In my judgment the court must look at the application before it and come to a conclusion whether that application falls within the ambit of section 12 or within the recognised categories of cases, those of children and ancillary relief issues, or whether there are other factors as a result of which, if the proceedings are not treated as secret, there will be prejudice to the administration of justice. Family proceedings are not and should not be seen to be in a separate category from other civil proceedings, other than in recognised classes of cases or in other situations which can be shown manifestly to require permanent confidentiality.&#8221;</p>

The parties did not have children. The Court of Appeal had limited information about the evidence filed, which was not before it. It appeared however that the primary issue for the judge at first instance had been whether the court had power to make an occupation order at all, in circumstances where the appellant, who was the respondent to the application, had argued that the home in question was not a home in which the parties were living together as husband and wife, or a home in which they at any time so lived together or intended so to live together&#8221; (FLA 1996, s36(1) as it was then worded; the words &#8220;lived together as husband and wife&#8221; have since been replaced with the word &#8220;cohabited&#8221;). The appellant&#8217;s argument was successful and the application failed on that basis, with the result that the court did not go on to consider the factors in s36(6).

Applications under FLA 1996 are very common. The applicant may have an entitlement to means-tested public funding but the respondent almost invariably does not, and so these applications are often made and responded to by litigants in person.

Where the application is made without notice the applicant is required to satisfy a high bar and to demonstrate that the risks posed to them by the respondent&#8217;s conduct are such that the interference with the respondent&#8217;s Article 6 rights is justified.

I cannot see how such a process could feasibly be accommodated within the court system, and just as importantly any such requirement would operate as a significant deterrent for applicants, who are often seeking the protection of the court at a time of significant vulnerability. </p>

There has of course been no finding to that effect, but if the respondent is right there is a risk that the applicant may use publicity, or the threat of it, as a means to exert continuing control. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is relevant, in my view, that the context of this application is that the FLA proceedings were compromised without any findings being made by the court. That means that there has been no determination of the parties&#8217; allegations against each other. If there had been, and if the court were satisfied that the applicant&#8217;s complaints of a &#8220;smear campaign&#8221; by the respondent were well-founded, the arguments for publication as a means of correcting misinformation would be stronger. In circumstances where one party wishes to speak publicly and one does not, and where there is no judgment to provide an authoritative account, there is a likelihood that publication by one party of the particular information they choose to put into the public domain will present a one-sided and misleading picture. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I have considered whether the applicant should be permitted to speak anonymously about his experience of these proceedings, in the context of the proposed documentary or otherwise. I am of the view that it would be very difficult, particularly in circumstances where there appears already to be considerable interest within the parties&#8217; community about the breakdown of their marriage, to ensure real anonymity, and therefore that in order to eliminate, or at least reduce, the risk of jigsaw identification there would need to be a careful review of the information which is to be put into the public domain. If that is something which the applicant wishes to do then he should make a fresh application so that these issues can be considered. </p>
