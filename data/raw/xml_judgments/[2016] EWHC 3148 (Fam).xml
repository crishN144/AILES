The application is opposed by the mother, E (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;).  The father&#8217;s application was issued on 22 July 2016, having been signed by the father on 27 May 2016.</p>

The mother further accepts that her removal of L from the jurisdiction of Turkey was wrongful for the purposes of Art 3 of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980 (hereafter &#8216;the Convention&#8217;).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context the mother defends the application on two grounds. The mother&#8217;s primary submission is that there is a grave risk that to return L to the jurisdiction of Turkey would expose her to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place her in an intolerable situation for the purposes of Art 13(b).  The mother also asserts that, following L&#8217;s departure from Turkey, the father subsequently acquiesced in the removal of L from that jurisdiction for the purposes of Art<span style="font-style:italic"/>13(a) of the Convention<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother grounds her defence under Art 13(b) within a contended for situation that was recognised by the Supreme Court both in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">(Abduction: Custody Appeal </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 2 FLR 758" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 2 FLR 758</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">(A Child)(Abduction: Rights of Custody) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 442" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 442</ref>, namely that the mother&#8217;s anxiety with respect to returning to Turkey with L is of such intensity as to be likely, in the event of a return, to destabilise her parenting of L to a point where the L&#8217;s situation would become intolerable.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">(Abduction: Custody Appeal) </span>Baroness Hale observed at [34] that:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.2in">&#8220;Third, the words "physical or psychological harm" are not qualified. However, they do gain colour from the alternative "or otherwise" placed "in an intolerable situation" (emphasis supplied). As was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span>, at para 52, "'Intolerable' is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean 'a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate'". Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: eg, where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">(A Child)(Abduction: Rights of Custody) </span>at [34] Lord Wilson clarified the foregoing passage as follows in light of comments made by the Court of Appeal doubting the validity of the concession recorded in that passage:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.2in">&#8220;In the light of these passages we must make clear the effect of what this court said in <span style="font-style:italic">In re E</span>. The critical question is what will happen if, with the mother, the child is returned. If the court concludes that, on return, the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child, then the child should not be returned. It matters not whether the mother's anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable. The extent to which there will, objectively, be good cause for the mother to be anxious on return will nevertheless be relevant to the court's assessment of the mother's mental state if the child is returned.&#8221;</p>

I have also had the benefit of two statements from the mother, again with extensive exhibits, and a statement from the maternal grandmother.  I have also read the expert report of, and heard oral evidence from Dr Airey (consultant psychiatrist) on the question of the mother&#8217;s mental health and the impact on her mental health if, with the mother, the L were to be returned to Turkey.</p>

That order was made over three months ago on 8 August 2016.  The father has failed to attend this hearing in person, he having indicated to his solicitors that he does not have a visa to enter the United Kingdom.  Further investigation by his counsel at the instigation of the court revealed that the father does not have a visa to enter the country for the purposes of attending this hearing because he simply did not apply for one.  In the circumstances it is clear that, notwithstanding the father having been provided with a copy of Moylan J&#8217;s order making clear his attendance at this hearing was required, the father has made no effort to attend.   </p>

For the reasons I give below I am unable to accept that submission and have proceeded to dispose of this matter at this final hearing.</p>

It is important to note in the context of the question of the impact on the mother&#8217;s mental health of an order returning L to the jurisdiction of Turkey, and the conclusions reached by the expert psychiatrist in that regard, that the mother has some history of mental health issues.

Further, Mr Crosthwaite relies, in relation to the allegation with respect to 4 July 2015, on a photograph taken later that day and exhibited to the father&#8217;s statement.

She reported that she was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;anxious and on edge all the time&#8221;</span>.

A report from the speech and language therapist dated 22 August 2016 confirms significant delay in L&#8217;s language, play and attention levels with significant speech and language delay compared with an average child of her age.  A report from the paediatrician who saw L on 1 September 2016 identifies that her attention skills, play and language development are delayed and are more typical of a child of 12 to 18 months old.  L has difficulty in social communication and interaction. There is a suspicion, but no confirmation, of an autism spectrum disorder.  The paediatrician states that if L witnessed domestic abuse this would have long term implications for her social and emotional development.</p>

In particular, he rejected the proposition that the fact that the mother had remained in contact with the alleged source of her trauma, and had even had direct contact with him, undermined the diagnosis.  In this regard, Dr Airey said that human interaction in the context of domestic abuse is complex and that shame, guilt, the dynamic between the abuser and the victim, a tendency to push trauma to the back of the mind and even a na&#239;ve wish for matters to be &#8216;normal&#8217; will all impact on those interactions, <span style="font-style:italic">especially </span>where parties share a child.

Within this context, and when pressed by Mr Crosthwaite, Dr Airey agreed that were the court to conclude that the mother&#8217;s allegations concerning domestic abuse were false, this would necessarily undermine his diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.  Dr Airey also expressly recognised in his report and in evidence that a psychiatric diagnosis cannot rely on the same type of objective symptoms or test results as other branches of medicine.  However, and again making clear that matters of fact are not for him, Dr Airey stated that drawing on his considerable experience of clinical examination and his considerable experience of the assessment of post-traumatic stress disorder, including experience in identifying cases in which the patient is fabricating the disorder, he considered that her presentation was entirely compatible with the presence of PTSD and that the mother presented with significant symptoms of both anxiety and depression.  In his statement, Dr Airey makes the following comments on this issue:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.2in">&#8220;In making the diagnosis of PTSD, the clinician has to accept that trauma has occurred.  This may be a straightforward step in the clinic, but within contested proceedings, with contested facts, it is not so easy.  I therefore need to look to how the person presents, the nature and credibility of their account of the trauma and how their presentation (both signs and symptoms) maps against the accepted diagnostic criteria.  PTSD is also a little unusual amongst psychiatric diagnoses, as there may be considerable secondary gain for the person, e.g. monetary gain or the influencing of a decision within proceedings.  For this reason, I approach everyone with PTSD with initial degree of scepticism.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.2in">It also needs to be acknowledged that the symptoms of PTSD can overlap with &#8216;normal&#8217; human reaction to trauma, i.e. to blend into a non-clinical state.  Further, it is not difficult to &#8216;Google&#8217; the term PTSD and quickly learn what the condition is, and what to say, to try and deceive or influence the doctor.  In this case, I would have to say that [the mother] did not raise the diagnosis of PTSD, but I did.  Also, she did not present as having rehearsed her answers.  Overall, I am convinced that [the mother] has PTSD as a diagnosable condition.&#8221;</p>

In a useful analogy drawn to illustrate this point, Dr Airey stated that if one were seeking treat a soldier suffering from PTSD as the result of having been involved in an IED explosion in Afghanistan, one would not commence that treatment by returning the soldier to Afghanistan.  Further, Dr Airey stated that no treatment would be effective until the uncertainty caused by these proceedings had come to an end and that if the proceedings were concluded by an order for return then, once again, the position would be that the very act of return would cause a great deterioration in the mother&#8217;s mental health.  Within this context, Dr Airey was unable to identify any protective measures that could be put in place to mitigate the impact on the mother&#8217;s mental health of her being compelled to return to Turkey with L.</p>

In this regard, Mr Crosthwaite relies on the fact that the mother has continued to have contact with the father both indirectly and directly as evidence of the mother&#8217;s fabrication.  Further, as I have already stated, Mr Crosthwaite relies on the photograph taken on 4 July 2015 as lending the lie to the mother&#8217;s accusations concerning the early hours of that morning.  Mr Crosthwaite submits that if the mother is able to exaggerate in this respect then she is able to mislead the court and Dr Airey.  Within this context, Mr Crosthwaite submits for the court to properly consider whether Art 13(b) is made out by reference to an objectively verifiable level of domestic violence, the court has to be satisfied as to the precise nature and level of that domestic abuse and that the only means of doing so is hold a full fact finding hearing.</p>

Within this context, Mr Anderson submits on behalf of the mother that, save for possibly one occasion in November 2015, the father &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">expressly acquiesced</span>&#8221; to L remaining in this jurisdiction following her removal from the jurisdiction of Turkey.  In this regard, Mr Anderson relies primarily on the content of the WhatsApp messages and the father&#8217;s attendance in England for contact, which he submits are consistent with the mother&#8217;s evidence that the father was content for L to remain in England.  Mr Anderson submits that the father&#8217;s words and actions are entirely consistent with a parent having come to terms with the situation and not seeking a return of the child.  Within this context, Mr Anderson submits that by January 2016 the father had, as a matter of fact, acquiesced to L remaining in the jurisdiction of England and Wales.</p>

Mr Anderson submits that, whatever the father&#8217;s actual intention, what the father said and did led the mother to believe that he was not seeking the return of L to the jurisdiction of Turkey.   Accordingly, Mr Anderson argues on the mother&#8217;s behalf that even if he did not intend L to remain in England, he communicated the opposite to the mother by his words and behaviour.  Mr Anderson also observes as an aside that the father&#8217;s failure to apply for a visa in order to attend this hearing of his application for a return order is consistent with the narrative he has been providing to the mother since November 2015. </p>

His short submission is that this concession on the part of the mother demonstrates that father did not acquiesce, and cannot be taken to have done so, in circumstances where he was making clear to the mother, on her own evidence, that an application under the Hague Convention would be made if she did not accede to his demands in respect of L.  </p>

In so far as the father did not explicitly press the mother to return to Turkey and concentrated on the question of the parents&#8217; relationship and contact, Mr Crosthwaite submits that this is all of a piece with the father&#8217;s approach to securing a return of L through a reconciliation with the mother.  In this regard, Mr Crosthwaite relies on the fact that merely seeking to compromise matters by permitting the abducting parent to remain in the country to which he or she has taken the children provided that the wronged parent is satisfied as to other matters and issues between them has not been regarded as acquiescence for the purposes of the 1980 Hague Convention (see <span style="font-style:italic">P v P (Abduction: Acquiescence)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 835" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 835</ref>).

Mr Turner submits that there is a sensible and pragmatic solution. Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk. The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country. This is where arrangements for international co-operation between liaison judges are so helpful. <span style="font-style:italic">Without such protective measures, the court may have no option but to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues</span>.&#8221;</p>

In fact, however, the careful study by Charles J of the witness statements, and in particular of about 300 text messages and emails passing between the parents from January until June 2011, which were attached to them, revealed that a number of important allegations made by the mother against the father were admitted or at least, in light of what he had said in the texts and emails, could not, as his counsel had conceded, realistically be denied.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question of the allegations made by the mother of sexual violence by the father is more difficult.   Within the context of the foregoing matters it is plainly open to the court to accept that in circumstances where the mother is demonstrably telling the truth about a significant degree of verbal and physical violence over an extended period of time, she is also telling the truth about sexual violence.  I do however accept that there appears to be some limited evidence of incidents of exaggeration on the part of the mother, the most significant of which concerns the photograph taken on 4 July 2015.  Whilst one must be cautious in respect of a single moment caught in time, the photograph does appear incongruous when viewed against the mother&#8217;s assertion that, only hours earlier, she had endured what <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;was the most horrifying night of my entire life and I cannot explain the fear that I felt that I would not survive&#8221;</span>.   Within this context, I note further that during the WhatsApp messages there is an absence of assertion by the mother of sexual violence, nor is there any admission by the father in respect of the same. I have taken this evidence into account in considering what conclusions can properly be drawn from the documentary evidence available to the court.  Within this context, I have found myself unable to reach a definitive conclusion on the question of the allegations of sexual violence on the evidence currently available.</p>

A parent who is the victim of domestic violence will, where the parties share a child or children, be under some pressure to maintain contact with the abusive parent for the benefit of a child.  The fact that a parent does so in that context is not it seems to me, without more, evidence that any allegations they may make are untrue or exaggerated. </p>

I make clear that in reaching this conclusion I have <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> taken account of Dr Airey&#8217;s diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder when concluding that the mother suffered domestic abuse, as there is a clear risk of circular reasoning if the court were to adopt that course.  However, as I set out below, my conclusions as to the existence of an objectively verifiable history of domestic violence perpetrated by the father are plainly relevant to the credibility of that diagnosis when the court comes to consider the impact on the mother&#8217;s mental health of a return to Turkey.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the question of the impact on the mother of returning to Turkey with L, I accept the expert evidence of Dr Airey that the mother suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Having interviewed and examined the mother, Dr Airey considered that her clinical presentation was genuine and that, deploying his considerable experience of clinical examination and his considerable experience of the assessment of post-traumatic stress disorder, including experience in identifying cases in which the patient is fabricating the disorder, what he was seeing in the mother was post-traumatic stress disorder rather than malingering to gain an advantage in ongoing proceedings.  He considered that the mother presented with significant symptoms of both anxiety and depression and that her presentation was entirely compatible with the presence of PTSD. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have already noted, Dr Airey was careful to recognise throughout his report and his oral evidence that matters of fact are for the court and that should the court conclude that the mother had fabricated her account of domestic abuse he would have to revisit his conclusions.  However, as set out above, I am satisfied that the mother did experience domestic violence at the hands of the father in Turkey in the manner I have set out.  I accept that had the court not been in a position to come to the conclusions set out in the foregoing paragraphs regarding the history of this matter, the handling of Dr Airey&#8217;s diagnosis would have presented some forensic difficulties within the context of court proceedings.   Whilst assuming the truth of allegations of domestic violence for the purposes of evaluating the efficacy of protective measures in the manner approved in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span> presents little difficulty, assuming the truth of such allegations for the purposes of evaluating the weight to be attached to an expert report would be fraught with difficulty.  However, in this case, and <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> turning to evaluate the credibility of the expert evidence, the court has been in a position to reach certain factual conclusions on the evidence available to the court.  Whilst, as I have already stated, I was careful not to take into account Dr Airey&#8217;s diagnosis in reaching my conclusions as to the history of this matter, I am satisfied that those conclusions are capable of reinforcing and do reinforce the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder made by Dr Airey.</p>

I accept Dr Airey&#8217;s evidence that this has a significant impact on her mental health and that her belief system taken in the context of her diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder means that returning to Turkey with L will cause her mental health to deteriorate significantly.  Having considered the evidence before the court, I see no reason to doubt Dr Airey&#8217;s conclusion that the mother will not come to believe that it will be safe for her to return to Turkey.  These conclusions are reinforced by evidence that indicates the mother has regularly spoken of her fears to a variety of professionals since her return to this jurisdiction well ahead of the issue of proceedings and well ahead of seeing Dr Airey and has spoken of them to the father in the context of the objective, verifiable reality of her time with him.  </p>

The father does not advance himself as the primary carer for L, even as an alternative to the mother returning with L.  In the circumstances, L would be fully exposed to the adverse impact on the mother&#8217;s mental health of returning to the jurisdiction of Turkey and would experience first-hand the likely significant deterioration in the mother&#8217;s mental health consequent thereon.  I am satisfied that this would be more emotionally harmful for L than for other children of her age given her very particular needs as evidenced by the paediatric and speech and language therapy evidence before the court.   L has very specific needs in terms of her emotional development and in the development of her language and communication skills.  In my judgment, those identified needs would make it even more difficult for L to manage emotionally in the care of a mother whose own emotional equilibrium had been very significantly disrupted by a return to Turkey.  This difficulty would be exacerbated by the fact that the consequences of that situation for L would have to be addressed in what is now, for her, an unfamiliar environment.  </p>

In these circumstances, it is not necessary for me to go on to consider the question of mother's subjective perception. </p>

Within this context, it is apparent that the mother was aware that the father&#8217;s position in respect of proceedings for the summary return of L was expressed regularly to be contingent on her continuing to facilitate contact.  Within this context, it would have been difficult for the court to conclude that the father acquiesced to L remaining in the jurisdiction, or that the mother believed that this was the case such that it would have been unjust to order a return, having regard to the need to demonstrate a clear and unambiguous position in this regard.
