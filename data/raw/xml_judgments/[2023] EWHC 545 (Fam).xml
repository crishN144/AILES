The paternal grandparents had enjoyed frequent and regular staying contact with T, but difficulties arose in the relationship between the paternal grandparents and the mother in 2018/2019.  The paternal grandparents made an application to the court for a child arrangements order to spend time with T.  On 12 November 2019, the court made an order in their favour, which provided for T to stay with them overnight every second weekend and an overnight stay in the intervening week, plus holiday staying contact.</p>

Accordingly, on 7 April 2022, the father made an application to this court for the return of T to this country pursuant to Articles 11(6) to 11(8) of Brussels II Revised.</p>

On 13 April 2022, the Estonia court ordered that T should have weekly video contact with her father for between 30 minutes to one hour&#8217;s duration with a third person present.  The order records that this person should preferably be the mother.  No video contact took place.</p>

The various judges dealing with the case have met with T on at least three occasions, most recently on 8 December 2022.  The court order in Estonia of 7 September 2022 repeated the previous order for video contact between T and her father and provided that from the fourth month after this order the father would, in addition, have monthly contact with T for three hours on a Friday, nine hours on a Saturday and eight hours on a Sunday.  The order permitted the mother to attend these contact visits.  No video contacts and no visiting contact took place.</p>

Ms Odze was clear that one must understand the toll on the child of the tensions and the long-running litigation and must take that on board.  One had to, she said, work with T rather than against her.  She accepted that T was only 11, but observed that she is 16, going on 25; she is very confident.</p>

She agreed that the father was impulsive and frustrated and is not child focused in that he does not stop and think about T&#8217;s wishes and feelings.  Reassuring T that neither the father nor the paternal grandparents sought to remove her from her mother&#8217;s case was, said Ms Odze, an important first step forward which needed to be taken.  She was concerned, however, that the father would not be able to restrain himself because he wants to tell his side of the story which contains nothing positive about the mother.  In answer to a question put on behalf of the mother, Ms Odze reiterated that she did not consider that a return to this country was conducive to T&#8217;s welfare; she would resent it and it would only make matters worse.  She endorsed the latest approach by the Estonia courts, who recognised that the mother had not done enough to support contact.  She considered that positive engagement with counselling and/or therapy would be beneficial.</p>

However, I note that when speaking to Ms Odze the father had said that the mother had taken T from him, so it was only fair that he would now take T from the mother.  For much of his evidence, the father was focussed on his rights and his needs with little or no reference to T&#8217;s needs and welfare best interest.  If the court ordered T to be returned to this country, he would seek to move from Spain to live in this country.  He was less than clear, however, about how long it would take for him to obtain a visa to come and live here or where he would live and how he would support himself and T.  When challenged on these issues by counsel for the mother, he then suggested that T could come and live with him in Spain.  The father was asked if he had anything good to say about the mother.

The mother also accepted that when she took T to Estonia she was not supportive of her having contact with her father or with the paternal grandparents.  The mother now accepted, she said, that it was not in T&#8217;s interest not to have a relationship with the father or with the paternal grandparents.  She now realised, she repeated, that she had not tried hard enough to promote T&#8217;s relationships with her paternal family.

In saying he would tell T the truth as he saw it or that it was a viable or secondary option for him to live in Spain with T, the father did not evince him having any regard to the harm such actions would cause T, nor to him having any regard to the welfare best interests of T as opposed to what he considered to be his best interests.  I found, like Ms Odze, that the father is an impulsive man who is focused on his needs to the exclusion of his daughter&#8217;s needs.  In many ways, I have considerable sympathy for the position of the paternal grandparents.  They fear they have lost their close relationship with T, to whom they are devoted.  Their distress is so great, however, that they now exhibit total antipathy towards the mother.  If T were to be exposed to these negative feelings about her mother, which I fear would be inevitable, it would cause her great distress and emotional harm.  There is little doubt that T&#8217;s negative views about the father and the paternal grandparents stems solely, or at least in very large measure, from the influence and actions of the mother.</p>

The Estonian courts have already refused to effect a summary return of T to this country.  Given (i) the length of time T has now been living in Estonia and (ii) the extensive welfare proceedings which have been brought before the Estonia courts for two years and (iii) the consistently expressed wishes and feelings of T in those proceedings, what are the prospects of the Estonian courts given effect to a return order made by this court?  In my judgment, the prospects are so low that they are minimal.  Even so, how long would contested proceedings take to reach a final conclusion and at what cost to T&#8217;s wellbeing?  In my view, they would take far too long and would be at the expense of a substantial and potentially irreparable toll on T&#8217;s wellbeing.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In any event, I am wholly satisfied on the basis of Ms Odze&#8217; evidence, which I unreservedly accept, and the totality of the evidence before me that it would be wholly contrary to the welfare best interests of T for this court to order her return to this jurisdiction.  She is happy and settled in her new life in Estonia and she desperately wishes to remain living in her mother&#8217;s care.  If she was returned here against her will, it would greatly worsen the prospects of repairing her relationship with her father and with her paternal grandparents.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">None of the foregoing undermines or calls into question the importance for T&#8217;s immediate and long-term welfare of restoring a positive relationship between her and her father and her and her paternal grandparents.  If that cannot be done by agreement between the adults which, as matters stand, is highly unlikely, the Estonian courts are, it appears to me, exceedingly well-placed to make welfare decisions about T&#8217;s future.  There are ongoing proceedings dealing with the father&#8217;s applications.  I am in no doubt the father could assist his parents in making their own applications to the Estonian court to spend time with T.  There is no doubt, from the orders made last year and this year by the Harju County Court, that in making decisions about T, her welfare best interests are first and foremost and her wishes and feelings are accorded proper respect.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issues of T&#8217;s residence and her contact with her father are before the courts of Estonia.  She has her own lawyers to represent her in those proceedings and she has met with the judges dealing with her case.  The father is engaged with those proceedings.  I am in no doubt that welfare decisions about T are now best made by the court in Estonia rather than this court.  If the paternal grandparents wish to seek orders in respect of contact with T, they are well-able to make an application to the Estonian court.  Given that T&#8217;s is undoubtedly now habitually resident in Estonia and will not be returning to live in this country and the Estonia courts are seized of her welfare, what is the benefit of any proceedings or applications being progressed in this court?  The answer is, plainly, &#8220;none&#8221;.</p>

I will dismiss his application made at the hearing on 7 April 2022 for her to be returned to this country pursuant to Articles 11(6) and 11(8) of Brussels II Revised.  I will discharge the child arrangements order made on 12 November 2019 in favour of the paternal grandparents and I will dismiss their application of 18 June 2020 for enforcement of that order.</p>

I will not make such an order when the application was made after the mother had wrongfully retained the child in Estonia.  In my judgment, it would be quite wrong for this court to make an order which would, in effect, endorse the wrongful retention.  Furthermore, had I heard that application closer in time to when it was made, I would undoubtedly have refused it.  As it is, we are now almost 2 years on and T has plainly become settled in her life in Estonia.</p>
