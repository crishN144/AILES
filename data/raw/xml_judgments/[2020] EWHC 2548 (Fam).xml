During a hearing conducted remotely, the judge heard evidence from the parents and from the Cafcass officer on 30 and 31 March and heard oral submissions from counsel on the morning of 6 April 2020. Following delivery of judgment, the judge granted the mother permission to remove but doubted whether it would happen any time soon and made it a pre-condition that she should register a mirror order in the Hong Kong family court. He proceeded to announce some decisions in respect of child arrangements but left it to the parties to agree the form of draft order. He also refused the father&#8217;s application for permission to appeal but granted an extension of time to apply to this court. In the event, the parties were unable to agree the terms of the draft so, with the agreement of the judge, rival draft orders and written submissions were emailed to the judge on 28 April 2020. The judge provided an approved order and a note setting out his decisions and brief reasons for them on 29 April 2020. This was after the judge&#8217;s retirement from the Bench. </p>

With respect to ground C (contract prior to removal), the judge had subsequently retired and, given the limited significance of that ground, I considered that a direction he should provide reasons was disproportionate. Contact prior to removal was a matter which would fall to be considered either at the conclusion of the appeal or at any rehearing of the mother&#8217;s application if the court so ordered. Finally, I stayed the judge&#8217;s order permitting relocation pending the outcome of the appeal. </p>

Unfortunately, work pressures meant that it appeared unlikely that I could hear the appeal on those dates. Via my clerk, I canvassed an alternative listing in the weeks commencing either 24 or 31 August 2020 only to be informed that the mother had arranged for the children to start school in Hong Kong on 27 August 2020. To accommodate these arrangements, I agreed to hear submissions on 5 August and, in advance of the hearing, to read the material in my own personal time. I did so and gave a decision without a judgment on 5 August 2020. This is my reserved judgment. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Hames QC also made an application to adduce fresh evidence which was not before the judge. That evidence addressed the political situation in Hong Kong, it being a part of the father&#8217;s case that unrest and political instability rendered Hong Kong an unsuitable place for the children&#8217;s relocation. The evidence he sought to adduce was (i) a report deposited in Parliament on 11 June 2020 which analysed a number of incidents in Hong Kong, all of which had been reported in the press at the time they took place; (ii) a statement to Parliament made by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on 20 July 2020 which concerned the attitude of the United Kingdom Government to recent events in Hong Kong; and (iii) an article by the Prime Minister published in the Times on 3 June 2020 concerning the United Kingdom&#8217;s ties of friendship and history with Hong Kong. Additionally, extracts from the United Kingdom Government&#8217;s website as to travel to Hong Kong during the Covid-19 pandemic and an extract from the website of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region concerning travel into Hong Kong were also provided. The father submitted that the travel guidance was unclear as to whether the mother and the children would be required to quarantine in a hotel on entry to Hong Kong or if his ability to travel to Hong Kong to see the children might be impaired by reason of quarantine restrictions.  </p>

She provided evidence in rebuttal showing that, as Chinese citizens born in Hong Kong, she and the father would be allowed entry to Hong Kong as would the children irrespective of Covid-19 restrictions for other nationalities. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I had no difficulty in refusing the father&#8217;s application. The travel guidance was largely irrelevant given the material produced by the mother. The father&#8217;s evidence to the judge had dealt in detail with the political situation in Hong Kong, specifically addressing his fear that Hong Kong would become just another city in China without the freedoms previously guaranteed in that territory. Though the material identified above was published after the hearing, it was general in tone and thus difficult to see its practical relevance to the issues in this case. Had it demonstrated, for example, that there would be significant difficulties for the father in being able to travel to Hong Kong to see his children or that they could less readily travel to the United Kingdom to see him, that material might more readily have been admitted as being important though not decisive in the decision making.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Hames QC filed a skeleton argument in support of the appeal. Much of that argument focussed on ground B, namely the judge&#8217;s erroneous approach to the law pertaining to permanent relocation abroad. The essence of his submissions was that the judge had failed to conduct any comparative evaluation of the parents&#8217; options for the children. Though his judgment identified the various factors in the welfare checklist, it failed to analyse why the mother&#8217;s option was better for the children than the father&#8217;s option. Additionally, despite stating the law was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;clear&#8221;</span> in paragraph 51 of the judgment, Mr Hames QC was critical of the judge&#8217;s failure to make reference to the need for a proportionality assessment which considered the Article 8 rights of the children and both their parents. He suggested that the judge had approached his task in the wrong way by adopting a linear analysis which favoured the mother&#8217;s application.  </p>

It had been taken following long acquaintance with the case and having heard the oral evidence of the parties. It was further in accordance with the recommendation of the Cafcass officer. The judge&#8217;s analysis of the welfare checklist was thorough, based on findings he was entitled to make. Moreover, he was not required to carry out a separate free-standing proportionality assessment of the children&#8217;s welfare. The judgment, read as a whole, was imbued with an appreciation of proportionality which the judge did not need to spell out. </p>

The recrafting of s 8 orders from residence and contact into child arrangements orders has, inter alia, the benefit of emphasising, absent adverse circumstances and welfare conclusions, the equality of parental responsibility that each parent has. Parents are to be expected to exercise their autonomy and to respect the autonomy of their children by entering into arrangements that plan for their children&#8217;s long-term welfare by providing for a meaningful relationship between each adult and each child.

That is neither a new approach nor is it an option. A welfare analysis is a requirement in any decision about a child&#8217;s upbringing. The sophistication of that analysis will depend on the facts of the case. Each realistic option for the welfare of the child should be validly considered on its own internal merits (ie an analysis of the welfare factors relating to each option should be undertaken). That prevents one option (often in a relocation case the proposals from the absent or &#8216;left-behind parent&#8217;) from being side-lined in a linear analysis. Not only is it necessary to consider both parents&#8217; proposals on their own merits and by reference to what the child has to say but it is also necessary to consider the options side by side in a comparative evaluation. A proposal that may have some but no particular merit on its own may still be better that the only other alternative which is worse.&#8221; </span></heading>

Those rights are those of both the child and the parents to maintain personal relations and direct contact unless that is contrary to the child&#8217;s interests. The child&#8217;s Article 8 rights will take priority over the parents, but that should not cause the court to overlook the Article 8 rights of the parents.

The first 50 paragraphs set out the background to the proceedings and also encompassed a variety of findings made by the judge. He found that the mother did not wish to relocate to the UK and that, by early 2019, the mother&#8217;s desire to return to Hong Kong had strengthened. He also found the father had behaved insensitively towards the mother when she was unwell and that he was a man of inflexible and strongly held opinions who found it hard to see why others might oppose his point of view. The judgment went on to rehearse the history of the proceedings and the positions of the parties at the relocation hearing. </p>

The father however wanted the children to remain in the UK and to spend more time with him than they did presently. In the event of the mother&#8217;s application to remove the children being dismissed, the mother made it very clear she would not return to Hong Kong alone but would stay with the children in the UK.  </p>

He noted that the children had rightly not been asked for their views and that both knew Hong Kong as they had been there for holidays. He was satisfied that the children looked primarily to their mother everyday care and comfort but loved their father and enjoyed the time with him. With respect to the children&#8217;s physical needs, the judge accepted that both parents could look after these but that the mother was more experienced in doing so. He noted that the mother was somewhat overprotective but was more attuned to the needs of children whereas the father did not take sufficient note of medical problems. He considered that the mother was the better parent to deal with the children&#8217;s emotional needs and criticised the father putting pressure on X and being somewhat controlling. He declined to make findings as to the educational systems either in the UK or in Hong Kong and accepted that there would be some disruption to the children from moving school. He considered that the mother was capable of sorting that out but made no reference to the father&#8217;s role in the children&#8217;s future education. </p>

He observed that it did not seem to him that separate consideration of the Human Rights Act added anything very much to the father&#8217;s case though he bore this in mind. He noted that the entire family were familiar with Hong Kong and that contact would be easier for the father there because of that fact and because he had the means and the ability to travel there.  </p>

He was satisfied that the mother was the more capable parent, but the children needed to continue close association with their father whom they loved. He noted that the mother agreed to the implementation of a mirror order in Hong Kong though it was unclear how long this would take to organise.  </p>

He noted that the father&#8217;s role would continue after relocation though it would be a different in nature. The judge was satisfied the practical consequences of moving were not decisive. However, he was satisfied that the mother would be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;devastated&#8221;</span> if her application were refused. He noted that the father was unhappy because he felt that the ideal life he had set up for his wife and children had come to an end because of the mother&#8217;s actions and he strongly resented that turn of events.

He concluded by saying that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the parties had very little connection with [location where the family lived] and the mother never wanted to be there, and I do not think the disruption would be that great&#8221;</span>.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Though the judge recognised in paragraph 75 of his judgment that he should undertake a holistic evaluation, unfortunately he did not undertake an analysis of the welfare factors relating to each of the options for the care of these two children which were before him. Nowhere in the judgment was there reference to or analysis of the other realistic option available to the court, namely the children remaining in the UK with both parents resident here. That was surprising given that the court was also seised of an application by the father for shared care of the children. The judge made a glancing reference to that application at the very end of his judgment, having already determined in the mother&#8217;s favour that the children should move with her to Hong Kong. The only additional reference to a possible outcome other than that contended for by the mother was the judge&#8217;s finding that the mother would be devastated if she had to remain in the UK. There was no comparative evaluation sideby-side of the realistic options for the children&#8217;s care.  Though Mr Hepher sought to persuade me that the judge&#8217;s analysis of the matters contained in the welfare checklist constituted such a comparative evaluation, I was unconvinced because, in the absence of clarity that the judge was indeed evaluating each of those options, it was hard to discern this in his analysis of the welfare checklist. Though McFarlane LJ expressed some caution about the use of a balance sheet in case such as this (see paragraph 52 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re F</span>), the judge&#8217;s findings might have been more securely grounded had he, in addition, adopted the approach of Ms Warren, the Cafcass officer, whose report contained an analysis of the positive and negatives of each option before the court.  </p>

While the judge made a series of findings on various aspects of the case, it was difficult to discern from the judgment as a whole exactly why he found the mother&#8217;s proposals for the children, including their time with the father who would remain living in the UK, were better than the father&#8217;s proposals which would enable the children to have both parents living in one jurisdiction (the mother having made clear that if denied permission she would remain in the UK). Thus, for example, the judge&#8217;s findings that the mother was better at meeting the children&#8217;s emotional needs and at dealing with medical issues needed to be weighed against each of the two options available &#8211; relocating to Hong Kong or remaining here with both parents. Neither finding pointed decisively towards the mother&#8217;s option being better for the children. Without undertaking the explicit evaluation of the findings made in relation to the welfare checklist and other matters against the options put forward by each parent, the judge&#8217;s reasoning for his decision was profoundly flawed.</p>

The judge&#8217;s finding in paragraph 71 that the father&#8217;s role would continue post-relocation, albeit in a different fashion, was an inadequate treatment of the relationship from the perspective of these two very young children.

The only reference to Convention rights in the judgment was in paragraph 63 where the judge considered the likely effect on the children of a change in their circumstances. He acknowledged that the father would see much less of the children and that Mr Hames QC put this at the heart of his case. The judge went on to state that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it does not seem to me that separate consideration of the Human Rights Act adds anything very much to the argument, although of course I bear it in mind&#8221;</span>. The remainder of the judgment was silent as to the Convention Rights of each parent and of the children and contained no explicit reference to a proportionality assessment. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I have thought very carefully whether it is possible to read into the judge&#8217;s analysis of the welfare checklist in paragraphs 54-74 the sort of proportionality assessment identified by Ryder J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re F</span> (paragraph 32), namely an acknowledgment that one option was better than the other and that the preferred option represented a proportionate interference in the Article 8 European Convention rights of the children and the parents involved. With every respect to the judge, I do not see how that can be possible in circumstances where there was no evaluation in the judgment of the realistic options for the children, with an analysis of the welfare factors relating to each option. </p>

I do not regard that as a valid criticism since the judge was clear he took those factors into account additional to those in the welfare checklist and because those matters might illuminate what should be done [paragraph 54]. It was clear that he was not relying solely on the factors identified by Thorpe LJ in paragraph 40 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Payne v</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Payne</span>.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Hames QC was also critical of a variety of the findings made by the judge and indeed of what he described as the judge&#8217;s failure to analyse the political situation in Hong Kong. I have already indicated that I have adopted a very cautious approach to the judge&#8217;s findings of fact and I am not persuaded that I should go behind these as Mr Hames QC, in part, invited me to. I also do not consider that the judge&#8217;s approach to the situation in Hong Kong can be validly criticised. He made clear he had not received expert evidence on that issue and doubted that such evidence could have properly founded any conclusions about the political future of Hong Kong. I have already commented that, should expert evidence have been permitted in this case, evidence about the situation in Hong Kong more specifically focussed on the practicalities of family life would be required.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Standing back and looking at the substance of the judge&#8217;s decision in the light of the above analysis, I have asked myself whether my doubts about it are sufficient to warrant allowing the father&#8217;s appeal. Much of what the judge had to say about the father suggested that he was less attuned to the children&#8217;s needs than the mother was. However, the absence of a child-focussed, proportionate and holistic evaluation of each parent&#8217;s option for the care of these two children means that it is difficult to see how the judge&#8217;s various findings might be deployed in such an evaluation, undertaken without all the advantages accruing to the judge at first instance. I simply do not know whether undertaking that exercise would result in exactly the same conclusion as that reached by the judge. Regretfully I cannot be confident that it would, given the judge&#8217;s treatment of matters of fundamental importance to the children. Having undertaken that cross-check, I allow the father&#8217;s appeal.</p>
