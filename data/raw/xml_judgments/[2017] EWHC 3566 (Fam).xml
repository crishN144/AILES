	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns Z, a little girl now six and a half, whose mother is the Applicant (M) and father is the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent (F).  Her parents are separated and Z lives with her mother in South East England.  She is of dual heritage: her mother&#8217;s background and heritage is white English Christian and her father&#8217;s background and heritage is black African Muslim, from the Fulah community in Guinea, West Africa.  There have been proceedings in respect of the arrangements for this child since December 2013; indeed, for most of her life, beginning when she was only two and three quarters.  The case was originally issued by M, who made an application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> (FLA), in the Family Court at Bromley where, in May 2014, it was heard by District Judge Brooks who made findings of domestic abuse against F, as a result of which an occupation order was made in favour of M, who remained living in what had been the family home with Z.  Z has always lived with her mother. </p>

Central to the applications before me is the risk of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) which was first raised in the proceedings in 2014; reference in the Cafcass analysis dated 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2014.  F wants to take Z to Guinea to visit his family so that she can see where he comes from, this he says, is important because Z should be able to have direct experience of the cultural and ethnic background which is half of her heritage.  M resists his application and had already applied for a prohibited steps order (PSO) order forbidding him from taking Z to Guinea because of the very high prevalence of FGM in that country (around 96% according to the UN&#8217;s analysis and the expert evidence) and the likelihood that F&#8217;s family will want to have Z &#8220;cut&#8221; or mutilated as a female child of the family.  Z&#8217;s Guardian supports there being restrictions on overseas travel with her father in place until Z reaches the age of sixteen.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Z&#8217;s mother, M, was born in South East England on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 1974, she was 43 at the time this judgment was written.  Z&#8217;s father F was born on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 1978 in Conakry, Guinea, he is 39.  In 2004 F came to the UK as a student.  Z&#8217;s parents met in 2006 through an online introduction website, and in May 2007 the parties married in Conakry, Guinea.  I have been told that F&#8217;s father and mother did not attend the wedding. There is some dispute about the reason for this, M says that it was because F&#8217;s father did not approve of the marriage, he, in turn says that was not the case but that his father could not return to the capital from the family&#8217;s village for the wedding. F did not have a coherent or credible reason for the absence of his father as he later told me in evidence that his father lived in Conakry most of the time, while his mother lived in the family village. F apparently accepted that his mother did not approve of the marriage and he did not explain the reasons why his father absented himself when he himself lived in Conakry.  It remains unclear why F&#8217;s father would not attend the wedding of his son, a son who, according to his own evidence has stepped into his late father&#8217;s place and is now &#8220;head of the family&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M returned to the UK shortly after the marriage took place.  On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March 2011 their only child Z was born in England.  According to M the marriage soon became marred by domestic abuse and controlling and coercive behaviour on the part of F, which became worse and more frequent after she became pregnant with Z.  It was M&#8217;s evidence that when Z was only two months old F said that H should have her ears pierced in keeping with the cultural norms in Guinea.  M refused to allow it and was so worried for the baby so that she would not allow F to take Z out unaccompanied.  She became increasingly concerned by his behaviour and did not feel that she or Z were safe.  The parties separated in late 2013 at which time, on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2013 M issued an application in the County Court (as it then was) for a residence order under s8 Children Act (CA) 1989; as amended by the Children and Families Act (CFA) 2014.  The case came before the court on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014 when M applied for injunctive relief and PSO and non-molestation orders were made by the district judge.</p>

Directions were given, which included an order that the parties file Scott Schedules in respect of the allegations of domestic abuse. On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2014 a fact-finding hearing concluded and as a result of the findings made, an occupation order was granted excluding F from the family home, along with a non-molestation injunction which was to remain in force until 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015. </p>

The issue of FGM was raised specifically by M as were her concerns about Z travelling to Guinea more generally, in respect of poor sanitation and tropical and infectious diseases such as malaria.  F told the Cafcass officer that he did not <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;advocate [FGM] for females.&#8221;</span> The report recommended that F undertake a Domestic Violence Perpetrator Programme (DVPP) despite the fact that F <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;denies the findings that were made against him, showing no remorse or insight into the impact this has had on his daughter [Z] and [M]&#8221;</span>, as most such programmes require that the perpetrator accepts that domestic abuse has taken place.</p>

On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2014 following a hearing before the district judge a child arrangements order was made providing that Z was to live wither mother and that her mother was to be permitted to take Z out of the jurisdiction for up to 14 days holiday at a time without F&#8217;s consent. Z was to spend time with F alternative weekly patterns of between 5pm to 7pm on a Tuesday and 8am to 7pm on a Sunday and between 5pm to 7pm on a Tuesday and between Friday at 5pm and Sunday at 6pm.  A further hearing took place on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2015 at which a further child arrangements order provided that Z live with her mother, who was permitted to take her out of the jurisdiction for up to 30 days without F&#8217;s consent.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An interim DVIP report was filed on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2015 which reported, amongst other matters, that F <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;is invested in presenting himself as a victim of the situation&#8230;He has been observed to project his sense of injustice on to [Z], stating that [Z] is suffering, when in fact, it is he who feels wronged, disrespected or disregarded by his ex-partner&#8217;s actions.&#8221;</span>  On 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2015 the final DVIP report was filed.  While F had admitted pushing M against a wall or the floor of 6 to 10 occasions and having &#8220;hurt her sexually&#8221; on 3 to 5 occasions he did not consider this to be violence; it was reported that F <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;continued to take this attitude &#8211; despite the material covered in the programme &#8211; that this did not constitute violence.  All of the facilitators who worked with [F] noted how he brought even unrelated matters back to the issue of finances, effectively portraying himself as a victim.&#8221; </span> He remained unable to accept accountability for his abuse and violence as having been brought about by his own behaviour.  The report concluded that in respect of any decisions regarding future contact arrangements between F and Z should take <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;serious account of the difficulty [F] has in separating out his interests from those of [Z], and the potential for ongoing emotional abuse and financially controlling behaviour, given that these will carry negative consequences for [Z&#8217;s] emotional and physical wellbeing.&#8221;</span></p>

It recommended that M contact her local Women&#8217;s Safety officer or GP for additional support.  A referral was made to Bromley Social Services because of safeguarding concerns and that F should provide undertakings in event of travel to Guinea.  On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015 the court directed that there should be an All Ports Warning on basis of abduction risk and risk of FGM pending social services investigation.  Bromley Social Services were invited to prepare a Section 47 assessment which was to address (i) risk of FGM; (ii) any risk of abduction risk; (iii) any other safeguarding issues; (iv) and the identification of any support services.  The time Z was to spend with F was reduced to every third weekend between 3pm on Friday until Monday when she would be returned to school; however contact continued every Tuesday and Sunday although this was not in the order, in addition to which there would be direct phone/Skype contact every Sunday at 9am. A PSO prohibited F obtaining passports for Z. </p>

A Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) assessment filed on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016; dated 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016, it set out concerns about Z&#8217;s presentation.  Z had been referred to CAMHS by the DVIP because of concerns about the impact on her of witnessing domestic abuse and the continuing conflict between her parents.  She was considered to be over-compliant and affected by the levels of animus and distrust between her parents.  The effects on Z which had been observed by her teachers included those of a child nervous or overly anxious about making mistakes who cannot recover easily if something goes wrong.  She was considered to be child who hid her vulnerabilities and anxieties while having more tantrums at home with her mother (where she probably felt safest).  She regularly suffers night-time enuresis, has long standing constipation and reports having nightmares.  Although Z was discharged because it was felt that the work needed to be done with the parents in the first instance, it was reported that the impact on Z of the continuing conflict could not be overestimated. </p>

It is would seem that there are no direct flights to Guinea-Conakry from the UK in any event.

Whether that is by the court making PSOs under the Children Act (CA) 1989 or by making FGMPOs a matter which I have been asked to consider and do so below.  There is an additional dispute as to detail of the child arrangements order, specifically the extent of time that Z should spend with her father. Z will continue to live with her mother and has always done so. As can be seen in paragraph 10 above Z has been detrimentally affected by anxiety caused by her parents&#8217; relationship and her loyalties are torn as both her parents must seem to be, to Z, the victim of the other. As I have already mentioned in paragraph 8 above, it is the opinion of the author of the DVIP report that F continued to present himself as the victim of abuse (when he was, in fact, the abuser) and that there remains a potential continuing emotionally abusive behaviour.</p>

If Z were to be subjected to such mutilation the effects, both physical and psychological, would remain with her for the rest of her life.

There is no doubt, given the F's animus in respect of M and M&#8217;s distrust of F, which is largely, if not entirely, as a result of his behaviour towards her that an order is needed.  F&#8217;s insistence that contact should take place every other weekend is an example of his own needs taking precedence over Z&#8217;s, and his lack of insight both as to the demands he places on his child and her need for autonomy and room to grow socially and become emotionally independent.  I accept the Guardian&#8217;s assessment that weekend visits once every three weeks strikes the right balance in Z&#8217;s best interests. Z is to continue to see F every Tuesday for a tea-time visit, but, as the Guardian observed as she grows she will start to have more demands and commitments on her time; it is for this reason that I include a proviso that Z is to be able to keep her own social and scholastic commitments should they occasionally fall on a Tuesday. </p>

The provision for half terms allows Z to spend some additional time with F when it falls on &#8220;his&#8221; weekend without disrupting the pattern of contact each 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> weekend.  The order will not provide additional arrangements in relation to Z&#8217;s birthday; that both parents will be able to celebrate with Z, in their own way, when they spend time with her, either on her birthday or very near to it.

The fact that F simply could not, or would not see this underscore the finding made by the professionals who have worked with him (such as on the DVIP course) that he is unable to separate Z&#8217;s needs from his own; in short, he is not able to put her needs first.</p>

Where that all that may not amount to sufficient evidence to put an FGMPO in place; but is not.  There is no objective evidence that supports F&#8217;s assertions that his family do not practice and disapprove of FGM.  There is no independent or other evidence that his sisters have not been mutilated themselves.  There is no evidence to support F assertions about his father&#8217;s standing and role in his community prior to his death and the family&#8217;s position generally and specifically within the Fulah either in their own locale or within the larger Peul society in Guinea.  When looked within the context of the expert evidence of the almost universal practice of FGM in Guinea the risk to Z of FGM when in Guinea remains high; and was assessed as such by her guardian.</p>

F explicitly recognised that there was a risk of FGM to Z in Guinea by presenting a case that his family posed no such risk; indeed he did not seek to deny the fact that FGM is practised in Guinea.  Nonetheless he sought to play down the extent of FGM in Guinea as a whole, and his claim that his family do not either carry out or condone the practice of FGM was not supported by any independent evidence. On the evidence before me including the independent expert evidence (which I shall set out below) his claim about his family&#8217;s rejection of FGM, is a stance so unusual in Guinea that the contrary is likely to be true on the balance of probabilities.</p>

Even if he has changed his mind his suggestion as someone with high status in the family (about which I have no evidence other than his words) that would be sufficient to protect Z and ensure her safety betrayed a lack of insight and understanding about the prevalence of FGM in Guinea as explained by Dr Schroven, the expert witness. It is equally likely, if not more likely that someone of standing in the community may feel under a greater obligation to adhere to cultural norms to maintain his status.</p>

It is not often that the court has the opportunity to hear from an expert who has carried out research over 14 months in the country which the court is concerned.  Dr Schroven has lived and worked in Guinea and adjacent countries in West Africa and her first-hand knowledge is extensive and difficult to gainsay.  She is a Social Anthropologist who works at the internationally renowned Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Halle-Saale, Germany and is an expert on Guinea in general and on ethnic relations in particular.  Her opinion on Z&#8217;s case is based on her scientific research and field research in Guinea and sub-Saharan West Africa. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Schroven told this court that recent publicity campaigns against FGM, such as the poster campaign which took place in 2016 after the Ebola outbreak should not mask the larger trend which is that girls undergo FGM at an earlier age in more discrete settings, including in public health clinics.  Part of the so-called medicalisation of FGM the mutilation by health professionals takes place under more sterile and less (medically) hazardous circumstances.  The current research indicates that the vast majority of men and women of all age groups in Guinea agree that FGM should continue to be practiced. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">While Z&#8217;s dual heritage may afford her some protection, as Dr Schroven explained Guinean there is a large level of tolerance and acceptance between religions, nationality and ethnic group, it also adds another variable to a complex situation.  The risk of FGM rises with age, within the Peul the age bracket for most FGM to take place is 5 &#8211; 9 years (at almost 60%); the figures point to Z being in the age group that under goes the most FGM in Guinea.  As Dr Schroven pointed out Z&#8217;s dual heritage may offer some protection but it also adds to the complexity of her particular situation; added to which is the paucity or almost total lack of protective measures that could be put in place through the judicial system.  FGM would be considered a family matter and not a matter for the police; a dispute (between F and the elders in his family for example) would be settled by mediation authorities of religion, village or local or family elders.  As most people believe FGM should continue this system would provide little or no protection for Z.</p>

Despite the fact that F had himself accepted that the general prevalence of FGM was high in Guinea, K did not.  K said the practice of FGM had ceased outside of her family and that she said that many of her friends had not been mutilated although some had; this is in direct conflict with the independent expert evidence.  It is, of course, very intrusive to provide evidence that mutilation has not occurred but the fact that K did not provide any such evidence means that her assertion she has not been &#8220;cut&#8221; is unsupported.  Moreover she told the court that F had never even discussed the idea of being examined with her.  F had a considerable amount of time to arrange for independent medical evidence, and was aware that such evidence has been presented in other cases before the courts.  It was he who raised the evidence of his sisters in the first instance and during the months that followed he was still represented.  The only reason that his sisters&#8217; evidence was to be introduced was as proof that FGM had not occurred in his immediate family thus reducing any risk to Z.</p>

Then on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2017 he (F) told the court through his counsel that he no longer sought to call his sisters to give evidence by video link but he did seek to rely on their statements.  He was told that would limit the evidentiary weight of what his sisters statements and if he changed his mind about the video link that he must inform the Court.  On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2017 F did indeed changed his mind and emailed all parties to say so.  Only K gave evidence; I do not attach any weight to the statement of his other sister other than that I accept she wishes to support her brother in his application, but she does not even live in Guinea.  Of K&#8217;s evidence regarding the fact that she had not undergone FGM, there is no conclusive evidence before the court and I am unable to reach a conclusion that it has not on the balance of probabilities, and I am unable to rely her evidence as proof that the family are, exceptionally, opposed to FGM. </p>

Perhaps in an effort to be even handed and by concentrating on the immediate perceptions of this still young child the Guardian laid the blame for the animosity between the parents at the feet both M and F.  It is antipathetic to the need to recognise the long-term effects of domestic abuse and controlling and coercive behaviour to use terms and language that overlooks the effects on the victim of abuse and the child or children.  Thus saying, as the Guardian did in her report that both parents need to do better, is inappropriate in cases of domestic abuse. It is difficult for M to come to terms with having been abused and &#8220;deal&#8221; with it effectively without being able to move on and away from the relationship itself, something she cannot do while F remains in her life because of Z. Moreover F is still angry with M, and, at times abusive. He is certainly unsympathetic and unapologetic so that it is difficult to see, objectively, how M can disentangle her feelings of distrust and vulnerability from the need to communicate with F in an constructive way about Z, particularly when he has shown no inclination to himself.</p>

The long-term effects of domestic abuse on children is well known, as is the fact that it can, and often does, affects their ability to enter into healthy relationships throughout their lives.  No child should be totally shielded from knowledge that domestic abuse has occurred, or who the perpetrator was, because they need to know to be able to develop their own understanding and self-awareness of what are appropriate and healthy relationships as children and into adulthood. They need to learn and be told in an age appropriate way that the bullying or emotionally coercive behaviour of a parent is inappropriate and unacceptable, whether that behaviour is aimed at the other parent or the child. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is some evidence before the court that F has blamed M for matters out with her control and letting Z know that he blames her mother.  The fact that Z could not visit her grandmother in Guinea before she died was because of a court order put in place to protect her and was not her mother&#8217;s fault; she needs to know that and why she was being protected and from what, and be told about it sooner rather than later so she can develop the ability to protect herself.  The time has come for Z should be provided with sufficient information to start learning how to protect herself in the future; from FGM should she travel to Guinea as a young person or young woman and from abusive, coercive and controlling behaviour as she enters relationships of her own. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having set out the evidence and the conclusions reached by this court in respect of the evidence I now apply the relevant legal principles, but before I do so it should be recorded in this Judgment that it is understood that Z has a loving relationship with her father and enjoys spending time with him.  This can be seen from what the child herself told her Guardian (and is included in the Guardian&#8217;s report).  There is no dispute about Z continuing to spend time with her father in the UK and she will continue to do so.  Nor is there any reason why her extended paternal family cannot visit the UK and meet her here.  While it is self-evidently in any child&#8217;s interests that her parents communicate and are able to work together there is little point in hoping that by saying so this will be the case.  M needs support in dealing with F assertively and to overcome her distrust by learning how to deal with him; but, the behaviour of F is at the root of this problem and unless and until he learns the lessons he should have learned from the DVIP and treats M with courtesy and respect they cannot &#8220;work together.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The central issue in this case regarding the protection of Z is centred on FGM thus a FGMPO is the appropriate order to make in this case as it is tailored to protect against the risk of FGM.  There is no suggestion that F would seek to have FGM carried out in the UK; the risk arises if Z is taken abroad.  As all travel to Guinea takes place through a third country and there are no direct flights to Conakry from the UK the order made by the court will to extend to travel within Europe and elsewhere.  The independent expert evidence before the court is that prevalence of FGM in Guinea is ubiquitously high and the acceptance as is the approval of its continued practice so that it is more likely than not that FGM would be carried out on any girl in Guinea who is of Guinean parentage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As there is no objective or independent evidence before the court about the paternal family so that it is difficult to assess what F&#8217;s position is either within his own family or within the wider extended family. There is no evidence as the extent to which FGM has occurred within his immediate and wider family or as to the views in respect of the practice of FGM in his family as a whole, including other relatives of status and standing, within his immediate family, or the wider extended family or within the context of the wider community. I have had to rely on the most objective evidence before the court, namely the expert evidence, and have to conclude from that expert evidence that regarding the practice of FGM the pressure or influence of other members of F&#8217;s wider family, including influential elders or leaders within the Fulah, is more likely than not to be brought to bear on F if Z accompanied him to Guinea. Based on the evidence of the widespread practice of FGM in Guinea it is more likely than not that that the pressure on F would be to have Z mutilated.</p>

While I am limited in my ability to assess these or other matters because of the lack of evidence before me brought by F, the evidence is that, in Guinea, FGM continues to be omnipresent and is approved of by the vast majority of the population.  The risks to Z must be very significant and the consequences so profound that the balance clearly falls on the side of protection.</p>

Against that I must balance the risk to her of FGM and the life-long effects that she would suffer physical, emotional and social.  It must be kept in mind that F has chosen to emigrate to the UK and that this is now his home where he lives and works.  He intends to remain here and so Z is the child of an immigrant who is living in his adopted country rather than a child who has two home countries.  In any case her ability to have relationship, and spend time, with F is not compromised or reduced. </p>

It is intended that the restriction on F&#8217;s freedom to travel will apply only when when Z is with him.
