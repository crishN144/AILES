At the start of the hearing, I reviewed the scope of the fact finding hearing with the parties and determined that, apart from the allegations said to have taken place at the end of November 2016 and those revealed by the ABE interview of X, no allegation prior to 2020 would be determined by the court. The ruling I gave is to be considered alongside this judgment. Because the police disclosed X&#8217;s ABE interview late, and because of the sensitivity of it, the rest of the morning of the first day of the hearing was taken up with the parties and the court viewing that interview for the first time. The impact of that was that the hearing was part heard at the end of 16 May 2023, the evidence being complete, and so I heard submissions on the afternoon of 18 May 2023 and agreed to produce a written judgment to avoid further delay.&#8217;</span></p>

He was not alone in so doing, as the judge in the ABC appeal also failed to produce her own schedule of findings (though one was later produced by counsel at her invitation and attached to her order). Paragraph 29 of PD12J requires a schedule of findings to be attached to the court order following a fact-finding determination.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Arial;color:#000000"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;color:#000000">In my view, it is desirable that, with the definitions of domestic abuse contained in PD12J firmly in mind when doing so, a judge produces her/his own schedule of findings, either incorporated into the body of a judgment or appended to its conclusion. That course avoids any lack of clarity about the detail of what the judge found, and any schedule can then be incorporated in or appended to the court&#8217;s order. I make this suggestion fully conscious of the pressures on the family judiciary engaged in what can often be a relentless train of successive fact-finding determinations, but it is not intended to make the task of judgment writing more difficult. On the contrary, I hope it represents good practice which may help to illuminate a judge&#8217;s evaluation of the evidence and to inform their ultimate findings.</span></p>

In fact, to the contrary, the law is clear, it is not sufficient for a party to draw attention to an alleged deficiency in a Judgment by way of an application for permission to appeal. It is incumbent on the party to point out the deficiency and to request clarification or a supplementary judgement on the issue (Re A (Child Abuse) [2008] 1 FLR 1423, CA. The Court of Appeal is losing patience with the failure of practitioners to follow this procedure before seeking permission to appeal.
