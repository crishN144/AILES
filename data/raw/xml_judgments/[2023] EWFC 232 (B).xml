His manner in the course of his cross-examination was calm and courteous throughout. Similarly, his submissions were calm and considered, and they focused on the legal and evidential issues before the Court. I am indebted to him for his assistance which I am satisfied enabled the father to have a fair hearing. I struggle to see how his case could have been better or more effectively put. I am similarly grateful to Mr Hughes and to Ms Bell-Paris, both of whom put their cases ably and were models of professionalism.</span></p>

This was that he seemed to be contending that the Courts generally ought to be taking a more liberal approach to the issue of granting rights of audience to McKenzie Friends. I indicated at the outset that it did not seem to me appropriate that I should comment on the issue of whether such rights should be granted more often, or on a more liberal basis, than has been the case. The general approach to be taken is a matter for others. I have confined myself to the issue of whether such rights should be granted in this particular case, and I have not strayed beyond that. All advocates respected that view. I wish to make it clear that the decision I made was intensely tied to the particular circumstances of this case. There is nothing of more general application in my decision.</span></p>

The possibility of a McKenzie Friend acting as an advocate is not referred to in PD12J and, as has already been noted, the guidance on McKenzie Friends advises that, generally, courts should be slow to afford rights of audience. For my part, in terms of the spectrum of tasks that may be undertaken by an advocate, cross examination of a witness in the circumstances upon which this judgment is focussed must be at the top end in terms of sensitivity and importance; it is a forensic process which requires both skill and experience of a high order. Whilst it will be a matter for individual judges in particular cases to determine an application by a McKenzie Friend for rights of audience in order to cross examine in these circumstances, I anticipate that it will be extremely rare for such an application to be granted.&#8221;</span></p>

He could not ask the questions himself, and indeed he fell within the scope of the statutory provisions which forbid someone in his position from so doing. That left the unattractive option of the questions being asked by Counsel for the children or by me. I appreciated the concerns raised by Counsel for the children about her undertaking the role, and I shared her view that this was to be avoided if at all possible. Although permissible for me to ask the questions, that too was an unattractive option since it would inevitably place me in an invidious position with a real risk that, by the time I had finished, either or both parents would be anxious that I had favoured one or other of them. I would not, of course, have undertaken the task in anything other than an even handed way, but I could readily see the risk that there might be a perception of bias. Sometimes, of course, the circumstances are such that the Court cannot avoid being placed in such a position, but it is never desirable, and it is best avoided where possible. There was also the possibility of adjourning the case to see whether a Qualified Legal Representative could be found. That was not a satisfactory option because of the delay it would have caused to the detriment of all, most importantly the children, and because of the uncertainty that it would achieve the desired result since an appropriate person might still not be available.</span></p>

The witness who appears over-confident and emphatic may be lying, but may be telling the truth whilst being anxious that the truth will not be believed.

The problem is that, in focusing on the specifics of the alleged incidents, the Court may risk losing sight of the broader patterns of behaviour that underpin them.

He observed that &#8220;what matters in a fact-finding hearing are the findings of fact&#8221;. [paragraph 67]. The Family court should be concerned to determine how the parties behaved and what they did with respect to each other and their children, rather than whether that behaviour does, or does not, come within the strict definition of &#8216;rape&#8217;, &#8216;murder&#8217;, &#8216;manslaughter&#8217; or other serious crimes. Behaviour which falls short of establishing &#8216;rape&#8217;, for example, may nevertheless be profoundly abusive and should certainly not be ignored or met with a finding akin to &#8216;not guilty&#8217; in the family context. For example, in the context of the Family Court considering whether there has been a pattern of abusive behaviour, the border line as between &#8216;consent&#8217; and &#8216;submission&#8217; may be less significant than it would be in the criminal trial of an allegation of rape or sexual assault. </span></p>

Although the medical professionals ultimately preferred the diagnosis of complex PTSD, it was clear that the diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder had been considered. Whilst I was mindful of the diagnoses, the same observation that I have made about the father applies to the mother: nothing in her evidence suggested to me, as a lay person in medical terms, disordered or irrational thinking.</span></p>

I note that there were in any event, some concerns about the reliability of his evidence since he sought to amend his written evidence in his evidence to me about the date when the events described in his statement happened. He said that he did so after conferring with his brother. He denied that they had conferred on any matters beyond the date.

Rather, it was consistent with the general pattern of behaviour that emerges from the evidence in which the mother oscillated between recognising that her experiences were highly abusive, and seeking to minimise and excuse that behaviour, and of her pattern of wanting to end the relationship, but also wanting to sustain it. Similarly, her reluctance to pursue criminal charges forms part of the same pattern.</span></p>

It is a statement of the obvious to say that &#8220;rape&#8221; is a highly charged word since to rape someone is a serious criminal offence, and to be known as a rapist is something which would attract a high level of social opprobrium. The horror of rape lies in the way in which it takes the sexual act which, at its best, is about enabling a profound physical and emotional intimacy, and changes it into an act of physical and emotional violation in which the person to whom it is done is treated as an object by the perpetrator. It is not difficult to see why most people would recoil from associating that word with a consensual sexual relationship with their partner. The fact that the father chose to describe a place in which he had sex with the mother as the &#8220;rape corner&#8221; says much of his attitude towards her, and towards their relationship.</span></p>

That is not the only example, but it is the most shocking. Amongst other things, he was largely unaware of any matters relating to her health, and he knew little or nothing about her work life.

He said it said in the course of a social event when there was discussion about their sex lives, and that he saw telling them this as a joke. The mother was clear that she did not see this as a joke. Maybe the father did see it in that way. It does not particularly matter whether he did or not. It was a matter of him saying something to the neighbours that any reasonable person would have appreciated would be likely to cause the mother to feel embarrassed and humiliated, and either intending to cause her to feel that, or being oblivious to how she was likely to feel. Either way, it displays the same lack of respect for her as a person. Again, that mindset is consistent with his attitude towards having sex with her.</span></p>

At worst, her refusals simply added to his sexual pleasure.</span></p>

Whilst he was holding a shovel, he took a step forward with the shovel towards Child A and raised the shovel at her to scare her, causing her to cry. He thought this was funny.</span></p>

He told her that she had ruined his birthday weekend and he was going to make her feel, how she had made him feel and make her understand what it is like to be alone.

I agree with that so far as the initial argument was concerned. Had that been all there was to the incident, I would see it as no more than that. Indeed, I would be bound to point out that, on their own accounts, neither party behaved particularly well. The mother was clearly angry and intemperate when she snatched away the tray of cakes.

He denied that he did so. She gave a clear and, in my judgment, credible account that he did. Not only was the account internally consistent, but it was also consistent with what the father himself accepted of his own character, that he was prone to aggressive and unthinking behaviour in moments of anger. The element of the mother&#8217;s account which was significantly challenged in evidence was the location of the incident with emphasis being placed on the seeming inconsistency between the reference to the kitchen and the conservatory door. That was satisfactorily explained by the mother in terms of the layout of the house. </span></p>

There was no direct evidence beyond the parties&#8217; own of what was said. There was, however, indirect supporting evidence that the father had a propensity to send cruel and unthinking messages when angry. The most striking example of this was a text message sent by the father to the mother which is screenshot at page G54. The message was sent in the aftermath of the breakup. In it, he denigrated her in highly abusive language, and blamed her for both the familial abuse she experienced as a child, and for the abusive behaviour of her former partner. The father accepted that he sent the message, and that he should not have done so. I was struck that, even when pressed, he struggled to empathise with the impact that it would have had on mother. In that context, I have to say that the behaviour alleged here seems notably similar. It adds verisimilitude to the mother&#8217;s account which I accept.</span></p>

He began pulling the mother&#8217;s hair to the point it hurt her neck whilst his penis was inside her. She told him to stop because he was hurting her. He did let go of her hair but carried on penetrating her until he had finished despite her pleas for him to stop.

He said that he sent the photograph as a form of &#8220;showing off&#8221;, although he was unable to say what he was showing off about. He explained that he had been talking to his friend, and he said that he told him that he was going home to have sex. Pausing again, I note with concern that he accepted that he told his friend that he was going home to have sex. That, in itself, says much about his view of sex and consent since implicit in that statement was the unspoken assumption that, if he wanted sex, sex would happen. It did not, it seems, even occur to him to consider whether the mother wanted to have sex at that time.</span></p>

He made a concrete statement that he was going home to have sex. He then took one or more pictures to prove to his friend that he meant what he said, and he sent it for that purpose. He was indeed &#8220;showing off&#8221;. I do not find that he did so to humiliate or embarrass the mother as Mr Hughes submitted. In my view, it was worse than that. He did not think about her at all. She was merely an object to him, a thing not a person, whom he used to boast to a friend about his own sexual machismo. Whether she consented, how she felt, what impact it would have on her, were all matters of complete indifference to him.</span></p>

It was clear, consistent and credible. Two factors supported it. The first is that the father accepted that the police threatened to arrest him for breach of the peace. The fact that the police were called, threatened him with arrest, and sent the children home with the mother makes little sense in the context of his account, but is entirely understandable in the context of the mother&#8217;s. Secondly, the comment that she should be back in hospital fits in with the broader context that this was very shortly after she had been discharged from hospital after a period being treated for her mental health. I find the allegation is made out. </span></p>
