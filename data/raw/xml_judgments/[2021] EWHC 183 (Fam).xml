E&#8217;s father is N, represented by Ms Helen Wilkinson of counsel.  These proceedings for a care order and an order authorising the deprivation of E&#8217;s liberty under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court are brought by the local authority, represented by Ms Julia Cheetham of Queen&#8217;s Counsel and Mr Liam Kelly of counsel.   </p>

However, in circumstances where that way forward involves the court approving the order sought in the context of an at present unregulated placement, it is necessary for the court to give a short judgment explaining why it has determined that making such an order is in E&#8217;s best interests. </p>

The local authority contends that the relationship of the mother and father has been volatile and that violent arguments and physical assaults have occurred in the family home in presence of the children, which has resulted in the police attending the family home.  </p>

The MHA resulted in two clinicians completing medical recommendations in support of the detention of E under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>, although at this time there were no Tier 4 Psychiatric beds available.  However, it is important to note that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> process in respect of E was a two stage process.  The second part of the process involved an Approved Mental Health Practitioner (hereafter AMHP), whose role is to consider whether a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> admission is appropriate based on a balancing of all of the circumstances of the case not limited to the medical recommendation of the MHA pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.13</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref> and to make the application for admission if appropriate, and a representative of the proposed Tier 4 provider.  In E&#8217;s case the AMHP declined to apply for the admission of E, considering that secure accommodation under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> was more appropriate in light of the risks presented by E.  In the circumstances, the criteria for admission under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref> were not met. An outreach worker from the relevant CAMHS service was also of this view and a Tier 4 Access Assessment was also completed accordingly.  In light of the outcome of that assessment, no Tier 4 bed search was triggered. This completed the assessment process under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.   </p>

The solicitors for the Trust have now helpfully confirmed that that the intervention of a second AMHP on 14 January 2021 was in error, that error having been caused when the original AMHP incorrectly marked the outcome of the 13 January 2021 assessment on the relevant form, leading to the second AMHP misunderstanding the position.  </p>

In the circumstances, HHJ Duggan renewed the order authorising the deprivation of E&#8217;s liberty in hospital until 22 January 2021, directed that the NHS Clinical Commissioning Group provide a statement to clarify the position with respect to Tier 4 provision and the decision making with respect to E in that regard and listed the matter for a further hearing on 22 January 2021.   </p>

In the circumstances, HHJ Duggan varied his direction so as to allow for the statement dealing with these matters to be provided by the NHS Trust.  In circumstances where that statement had not been provided as at the hearing before him on 22 January 2021, and given the then ongoing lack of clarity in the decision reached under the mental health legislation, HHJ Duggan reallocated the matter to me and listed it for a directions hearing before this court on 25 January 2021 with a representative of the NHS Trust directed to attend. </p>

Ofsted has confirmed that whilst it will require formal confirmation of this position from the planning authority before registration can be confirmed, in the interim the registration process is able to proceed and that once a complete application has been received it will be expedited.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Finally, I am compelled to note that this is yet<span style="font-style:italic"> another</span> case in which the court is once again faced with approving an unregulated placement by reason of a lack of any other option consequent on the continuing paucity of regulated provision for children in this jurisdiction.  I set out the ever growing list of such cases, and the difficulties they cause for the vulnerable children who are the subjects of them, in detail in <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire CC v G (Unavailability of Secure Accommodation) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2020/2828" uk:canonical="[2020] EWHC 2828 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWHC 2828 (Fam)</ref>.

The need for these resource issues to be addressed for the benefit of the highly vulnerable children with which the courts are concerned in these difficult and troubling cases remains as grimly pressing as ever it was. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In this, as in many other cases of this type that continue to come before me and my brother and sister judges in the Family Division, I have decided I have no option but to grant the relief sought by the local authority and to authorise the deprivation of E&#8217;s liberty in the unregulated placement identified by the local authority.

In my judgment, the restrictions that I have summarised above will mean that E is subject to continuous supervision and control within the placement and is not free to leave the same.  I am further satisfied that E is unable to consent to the deprivation of her liberty. </p>

As I have noted in other cases, that best interests decision can only be based on the narrowest of welfare considerations in circumstances where the court is presented with a fait accompli by reason of their being only one alternative to the continued restriction of E&#8217;s liberty on an NHS hospital ward.  Those welfare considerations are as follows. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">First, it is plain that E&#8217;s continued presence on a hospital ward is unsustainable.  Whilst the unregulated placement proposed by the local authority has acknowledged limitations with respect to being properly equipped and sufficiently experienced to deal with E&#8217;s behavioural needs, an NHS hospital ward is plainly not equipped to do so.  Within this context, the support for the identified placement that the local authority intends to put in place ahead of the completion of the Ofsted registration process, as I detail below, can far more easily be applied to that placement than it can in the context of a busy NHS ward.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Second, whilst the court must acknowledge that the placement is unregulated, and therefore sub-optimal both <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> and from the perspective of being able to meet fully E&#8217;s identified welfare needs, an application has been made by the placement provider to Ofsted for registration. Within this context, in accordance with the President&#8217;s Guidance, this court will retain a degree of oversight with respect to the progress of the placement, pending confirmation of registration.  More fundamentally, the unregulated placement identified by the local authority is the<span style="font-style:italic"> only</span> alternative available to leaving E placed inappropriately on an NHS ward.  The Local Authority has searched extensively for placements and this is the only placement identified able and willing to take E having regard to her history. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within the foregoing context, it is important to emphasise that an application for registration in accordance with the President&#8217;s Guidance is not a universal panacea for the difficulties presented in cases of this nature by the nationwide shortage of regulated placements.  Whilst registration will result in an unregulated placement becoming subject to the demands of the relevant regulatory regime, it will not automatically turn a placement that is not equipped to meet fully a child&#8217;s needs into one that is.  In many cases registration, whilst bringing a placement within the regulatory regime, will simply result in the conversion of a unregulated placement that is sub-optimal in terms of meeting fully the child&#8217;s identified welfare needs into a regulated placement that is a sub-optimal means of meeting fully the child&#8217;s welfare needs. Within this context, the process set out in the President&#8217;s Guidance does not  represent a substitute for the proper provision of regulated placements fully equipped to, and experienced in meeting the acute, varied and complex needs of the cohort of vulnerable children in which E sadly finds herself now a member.  </p>
