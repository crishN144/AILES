	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 24 May 2012 Deputy District Judge Parsons made property adjustment orders by consent in respect of three properties in Carmarthen. On 7 October 2013, by consent, he rearranged certain aspects of his orders but without altering their underlying proprietary or economic effect. I shall refer to these orders as the substantive orders. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The substantive orders were not implemented for wearily familiar reasons. There were disputes, among other things, about the sale process and about the selling agents. This led to implementation litigation. In June 2016 the wife (as I shall call her) appealed an implementation order. It came before Judge Sharpe. He granted permission to appeal. He may well have granted permission to appeal the 2012 and 2013 substantive orders as well. As the order of 1 June 2016 is not available no-one can tell me what was the scope of the grant of permission to appeal. If it was against the 2012 and 2013 orders then it must be regarded as being of doubtful legitimacy given that it was years out of time and that neither party had previously sought to appeal them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Judge Sharpe had the case before him on 18 August and 4 September 2017. He resolved to deal with the case anew. In his judgment, issued on 12 December 2017 he clearly explained that he was not exercising appeal powers in order to do so. Rather, as the substantive orders remained executory, and given that they were &#8220;at the very edge, if not already beyond, any effective period of implementation in [their] terms&#8221; he considered that he could discharge the substantive orders and replace them with a new order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The new order was made on 4 October 2017, two months before the judgment emerged (for reasons which do not need to be explained). The order explicitly replaces the 2012 and 2013 orders. It was amended on 20 October 2017 to correct an error and to clarify an ambiguity. However, on 22 September 2017, that is before the order of 4 October 2017, the husband (as I will call him) had been made bankrupt.</p>

Parliament was very careful to keep these powers tightly confined. Ignoring some very rare outliers, the only capital award that could be varied was a lump sum payable by instalments. An order for sale under section 24A could be varied but not the underlying capital award to which it attached.  The power to vary an order for sale is a real power which can be invoked to keep a party out of his money for an appreciable period: see <span style="font-style:italic">Birch v Birch</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2017/53" uk:canonical="[2017] UKSC 53" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] UKSC 53</ref> at paras 14, 15, 27 and 29<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, it is an iron rule that aside from a lump sum payable by instalments, and aside from a set aside on traditional grounds as discussed below, a capital award cannot be varied, or, a fortiori, discharged, by a court of first instance.  That an order has, in the usual way, a &#8220;liberty to apply&#8221; clause certainly does not entitle a court to rewrite non-variable capital awards and to make different ones. Equally, the fact that a dismissal clause does not take effect until there has been full compliance with certain transfers and payments plainly does not entitle a court to replace an executory order with a new one. The judge referred to the decision of <span style="font-style:italic">Thwaite v Thwaite</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1982] Fam 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">[1982] Fam 1</ref>.

It was deliberately made, with full knowledge, with the full agreement of the solicitors on both sides. It cannot be set aside. But, even though the order cannot be set aside, there is still a question whether it should be enforced. The court has always a control over interlocutory orders. It may, in its discretion, vary or alter them even though made originally by consent.&#8221;</p>

Trigell Ltd </span>provide scant support for a loophole to the prohibition of the discharge of a non-variable final capital order. Both cases concerned the court&#8217;s power to &#8220;control&#8221; interlocutory orders. The first case involved an undertaking where there was full power to discharge it anyway. In the second case the court refused to discharge the earlier interlocutory order requiring answers to interrogatories. Therefore, I think that any application under the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Thwaite</span> should be approached extremely cautiously and conservatively.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;An undertaking is a solemn promise which a litigant volunteers to the court. A court has no power to impose any variation of the terms of a voluntary promise. A litigant who wishes to cease to be bound by her (or his) undertaking should apply for &#8220;release&#8221; from it (or &#8220;discharge&#8221; of it); and often she will accompany her application for release with an offer of a further undertaking in different terms. The court may decide to accept the further undertaking and, in the light of it, to grant the application for release. Equally the court may indicate that it will grant the application for release only on condition that she is willing to give a further undertaking or one in terms different from those of a further undertaking currently on offer. In either event the court&#8217;s power is only to grant or refuse the application for release; and, although exercise of its power may result in something which looks like a variation of an undertaking, it is the product of a different process of reasoning.&#8221;</p>

Judge Sharpe replaced the share of 70% with one of 20%. Instead of making a direct replacement could Judge Sharpe have said to the wife: I will, pursuant to <span style="font-style:italic">Thwaite</span>, decline to enforce your obligation to pay the husband 70% of the equity in the Haulfryn property provided that you agree to pay him 20% instead? In my judgment that would be quite unacceptable. It would amount to a blatant circumvention of the statutory prohibition on variation. </p>

After years of controversy about the correct procedure for invoking these grounds (did it require a fresh action? did it require an appeal?) the matter has been resolved finally by the introduction of the new rule 9.9A and PD9A para 13, with effect from 3 October 2016. This provides that <span style="color:#000000">an application to set aside all or part of a financial remedy order or judgment must be made to the first instance court, to be initiated by an application made within the existing proceedings in accordance with the Part 18 procedure.

If an error of the court is alleged, an application for permission to appeal under Part 30 should be considered. The grounds on which a financial remedy order may be set aside are and will remain a matter for decisions by judges. The grounds include (i) fraud; (ii) material non-disclosure; (iii) certain limited types of mistake; (iv) a subsequent event, unforeseen and unforeseeable at the time the order was made, which invalidates the basis on which the order was made.&#8221; </p>

As Mr French correctly points out, at the time they were made the husband was bankrupt. At the moment of the making of the bankruptcy order all of the husband&#8217;s property vested in the trustee in bankruptcy. Therefore, when Judge Sharpe made his orders the husband in fact did not have &#163;46,500 worth of property capable of being taken from him and given to the wife.  </p>

Of this &#163;46,810 has been distributed to the wife; &#163;11,778 is held to satisfy a charging order in respect of a debt of the husband in favour of MNBA; and &#163;35,128 is held pending my decision, but under the orders is payable to the wife.

After costs of sale it has the net value of some &#163;92,150. Under the orders the husband receives 70% of this value but must give credit for the &#163;11,778 MNBA debt effectively paid on his behalf by the wife and a debt charged on the property of &#163;3,300 in favour of the Child Support Agency. Thus, the husband (or, rather, his trustee in bankruptcy) will receive under this subparagraph: &#163;92,150 x 70% - &#163;11,778 - &#163;3,300 = &#163;49,427. The wife will receive: &#163;92,150 - &#163;3,300 - &#163;49,427 = &#163;39,423. The total of these two sums is &#163;88,850 which equates correctly to the net proceeds of sale after deduction of costs of sale and the CSA charge. </p>

In addition, the intervener has tabulated further debts of the husband of &#163;41,162. When the costs of the bankruptcy are taken into account it can be seen that it is most unlikely that the husband will receive any surplus from the &#163;49,427.</p>

On 8 March 2018 her solicitors wrote to the wife setting out their argument as to why the order made by Judge Sharpe was void. It would have been possible for the wife to have agreed, thereby avoiding the costs subsequently incurred. In my judgment, the wife should pay these costs. I assess them in the sum of &#163;10,000 (inclusive of VAT) and they are also to be paid from the retained sum of &#163;35,128 referred to in para 18(i) above.
