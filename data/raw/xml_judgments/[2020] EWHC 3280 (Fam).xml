The local authority remains represented by Ms Louise Boardman of counsel. As at the previous two hearings, the local contends at this hearing that G is in urgent need of a secure placement.  As has been her position at previous hearings, the Children&#8217;s Guardian remains opposed to that course of action, favouring a regulated non-secure placement where therapeutic input can be provided to meet G&#8217;s welfare needs.  However, as at previous hearings, it remains the case that no such placements of either type are available for G anywhere in the United Kingdom.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The sub-optimal nature of this situation is now further compounded by a marked deterioration in G&#8217;s behaviour.  In my last judgment I noted that G had remained relatively settled in her placement but that there had been some worrying signs that this period of calm was fragile and would be temporary.  Those portents proved correct.  As </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">I detail below, G&#8217;s behaviour has become much harder to regulate and manage.  Ms Boardman informed the court that there is now a very real risk that the placement, which is not designed to meet and address the highly complex needs that G has, will reach crisis point, resulting in a further unplanned move for G to another temporary emergency placement which, likewise, will not be designed to meet and address the highly complex needs of G.  The cycle will start again. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In these circumstances, at this hearing the local authority not only once again finds itself compelled to advance an unregulated placement as being the <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> option available to safeguard G&#8217;s welfare but compelled to advance a placement that all parties acknowledge is increasingly struggling to contain G. Within this context, the <span style="font-style:italic">fait accompli</span> presented to the court, and that I described in my initial judgment, is now rendered in even starker relief. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As I also noted in my previous judgments, whilst G remains in an unregulated placement outside the statutory regime laid down by Parliament under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, it is necessary for the court to monitor closely the extent to which the unregulated placement continues to be in G&#8217;s best interests.  That is the task that falls to the court again today.  It is a task that also, of course, adds to the total of some &#163;17,000 of public funds already spent without appropriate result for G.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">observed previously, this is the cost of placing the High Court in what is, essentially, a regulatory role by reason of the acute shortage of clinical provision for placement of children and adolescents requiring assessment and treatment for mental health issues within a restrictive clinical environment, of secure placements and of regulated nonsecure placements. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The background is as set out in my first judgment in this matter.  Whilst, again, it is not necessary to repeat it in detail here, it is important to deal in some detail with the efforts that have been made to locate a placement for G, and the with the extent to which G&#8217;s behaviour has deteriorated, since this matter was last before the court.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Since 18 November 2020 the local authority has continued its search of a placement for G.  As at 25 November 2020 there were eight projected available beds in the secure estate in England and Wales for a total of twenty-six live referrals.  There were no vacancies in Scotland, one secure placement in Scotland also confirming that, in addition to having no current vacancies, it would be unable to meet G&#8217;s needs.  With respect to regulated non-secure placements, once again no suitable placement has been identified for G.  Within the foregoing context, what is now coming into sharper focus is that the situation for G is consequent upon not only the acute shortage of secure and regulated non-secure placements <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>, but also because of the even greater shortage of the subset of such placements that equipped to cope with children with the multifaceted and highly complex needs demonstrated by G.  Thus, even those very limited number of secure or regulated non-secure placements that have opened up over the course of the past 14 days have declined to offer a place to G on the grounds that they consider the risk to be too high to be able to provide their services to her.  On behalf of the local authority, Ms Boardman referred during this hearing to the social worker&#8217;s experience of certain children in G&#8217;s position becoming &#8220;known&#8221; within the system, with such children facing repeated refusals with respect to placements that become available given the sheer extent and complexity of their needs.  Such is becoming the experience for G. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At this hearing Ms Boardman was able to identify only one placement that has indicated that it is willing to <span style="font-style:italic">consider</span> G, contending that it is equipped to meet her complex needs. Investigations in respect of that placement continue. However, the unit in question is one that specialises in children with learning disabilities. In addition to no confirmation regarding the position in respect of that placement being available in time for this hearing, and more fundamentally, G does not have a learning disability.  The local authority is also now, as a last resort, exploring the viability of purchasing a building in which to set up a bespoke placement for G, although planning in this regard for what will be a very expensive option is in its very early stages. </p>

As I observed in my first judgment, whilst the local authority contends that this is an appropriate case for a secure accommodation order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the Children&#8217;s Guardian contends that a non-secure regulated placement would best meet G&#8217;s needs, there is also a cogent argument that what is in fact missing for G is a restrictive <span style="font-style:italic">clinical</span> environment short of detention and treatment under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having regard to the information I have summarised above with respect to the ongoing placement finding process, an even more difficult and complex picture is emerging as to why these difficulties pertain for G.  With respect to secure accommodation and nonsecure regulated placements, it is clear that, for G, the acute shortage of such placements <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> is further exacerbated by the nature and extent of her needs, with the limited number of secure placements that are available being reluctant to take G given the scope and complexity of those needs.  In addition, and as I have previously noted, there is inadequate provision in this jurisdiction for children with G&#8217;s complex needs who do not meet the criteria for detention and treatment under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> but nonetheless require assessment and treatment for mental health issues within a restrictive clinical environment.  Thus, G is placed in a<span style="font-style:italic"> triple</span> bind by the acute shortage of secure and regulated non-secure placements <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>, by the fact that her multifaceted and highly complex behavioural and welfare needs exclude her from consideration by those small number of such placements that are available and by the fact that those multifaceted and complex needs to do not bring her within the ambit of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.

By reason of the acute shortage of placements, the price of G&#8217;s safety from self-harm or, worse, suicide must be paid by an acceptance of a placement that is not designed to meet her welfare needs and, beyond the implementation of basic measures to keep her safe, cannot meet her welfare needs holistically assessed.  To put it another way, the acute shortage of secure and regulated non-secure placements risks moving the test applied by the court further from welfare and closer to necessity, bleeding from the best interests principle all but the starkest considerations of safety, rendering it barren of the other factors that ordinarily comprise the considered welfare analysis that is so essential to maintaining the integrity of the best interests principle. </p>

Human society benefits from the addition of the child as a member of that society, but the child <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> society will also suffer if society then fails to safeguard and promote the welfare of that child where the parents have proved, by reason of circumstance or inclination, unable to do so.  G&#8217;s welfare is the court&#8217;s paramount consideration.

This is an imperative course not only in order to maintain dutiful fidelity to the principle that G&#8217;s best interests are paramount, but also in order to ensure that society endures and develops for the benefit of each and all of its members,<span style="font-style:italic"> including</span> G. At present, society, our society, is failing in that course with respect to G.  As recognised by Sir James Munby in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (A Child)(No.3)</span>, that failure is, and can only ever be, a selfdefeating mark of shame for us all.   </p>
