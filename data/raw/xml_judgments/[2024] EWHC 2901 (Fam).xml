I did have a full position statement from Ms Papazian at the beginning of the case.  I did receive before submissions a typed account of a video WhatsApp with the children conducted by Daisy Veitch on the 7 November.  That account contained some apparent expressions of a desire on the children&#8217;s part to come back to this country, and memory of their life here.  I do not put much weight on that given the ages of the children and the fact that they had been with their mother.  Following Ms Papazian&#8217; submission, the weight that I put on that interview was how easy the children are in the care of their mother, and how comfortable she was as their primary carer.</span></p>

She submitted it on the 1 July and it is issued on the 18 July.  That was granted by Mrs Justice Gwynneth Knowles on the 2 August 2024.  The judge requests that anyone who is not in the jurisdiction and who is in a position to do so co-operates in securing the immediate return of the children and also makes orders for the father to handover to the mother the ID cards, residence cards and passports of her and the children.  That is with a view to the mother bringing the children back to this jurisdiction.  Gwynneth Knowles J makes a further order on the 12 August 2024.  Mr Goodwin KC sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge on the 12 September makes a further order requesting the return of the children and orders anyone within the jurisdiction to co-operate in securing the return of the children.

They had been to two different nurseries near their home in the Midlands.  They were registered with GPs.  The mother had pressurised the father into making an application for E to attend primary school near their home in the Midlands which would have started in September 2024.  They had leave to permanently remain here and the relevant card records that their presence was for settlement.  Further, the father had made an application for them to become citizens.</span></p>

Here there is no doubt that the primary carer was the mother, and she was habitually resident here, integrating herself into this country, first in London and then in the Midlands.  She was making friends in each area and making health provision for her and the children and making education provision for the children.</span></p>

The mother denied that, saying, that she was told she would be living in England when she married.  The mother did give evidence that the father would travel for work.  And that the parties did spend time in Pakistan.  The father&#8217;s travel for work was part of the reason that the Guardian considers the mother the primary carer.  The trips to Pakistan were entirely consistent with a family who have close family abroad, and the ban on international travel during Covid.  The time in Pakistan had no impact on habitual residence.</span></p>

I consider that I should however inform my approach to the terms of the convention by referring to the terms of the 1980 Hague Convention which talks about &#8216;rights of custody&#8217; rather than custody orders.
