	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the fourth judgment that I have given in this case.  The two full earlier judgments given on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, 2004, and 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April, 2005 are both public documents, and I do not intend to repeat their contents here beyond what is necessary to explain my decision today.  Although the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of Mr and Mrs W, they referred the case back to me as it appeared to them that there may have been changes in CW&#8217;s condition significant enough to warrant re-consideration by the Court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course, the condition of a child of this age is rarely static for long.  It will either improve or deteriorate and hence my order of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April had a review built into it.  However, a detailed reconsideration of the medical evidence was advanced at the behest of the Court of Appeal.  Experts previously instructed were consulted again, CW was further examined and new reports were submitted.  The court was also greatly assisted by the written and oral evidence of Dr &#8216;K&#8217;, CW&#8217;s new and current treating paediatrician.</p>

I remind myself too, that on this occasion there was a high degree of agreement in the medical evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the words of her consultant paediatrician Dr &#8216;K&#8217; &#8220;This is a highly unusual case for a large number of reasons, not least of which is that CW has defied all the previous case studies and predictions by staying alive.&#8221;  Much, however, remains the same.  Although she has experienced some growth, she remains, in all respects, below the 0.4 Centile.  She still has significantly damaged kidney function.  She has some of the attainments of a baby of 2-3 months old.  She has gross, irreversible brain damage.  She still has the gravest chronic lung disease; indeed it was described by two very experienced experts as the worst each had ever seen in a living child.</p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All that said, however, there is, in relative terms, real progress to report.  There has been some, albeit, very limited progress in her neurological functioning.  There has been some slight growth and some weight gain.  Most importantly there has been discernible progress in the condition of her lungs.  Her requirement for oxygen has fallen to the point where she no longer need stay permanently in her headbox, but can be sustained by oxygen delivered through nasal cannulae.  This has the practical effect that she may leave the ward and even briefly the hospital building.  Dr &#8216;K&#8217; now takes the view that she has a real prospect of surviving the forthcoming winter.  Against that must be balanced the unanimous professional view that she continues to have a very severely impaired life expectancy.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr W told me that they are working towards CW&#8217;s discharge home next March.  Apart from her survival without further deterioration until then, her return home is dependent on two matters:  first, the putting in place of an inevitably complex care package; and secondly, CW&#8217;s dependency on oxygen being reduced from the present 40% - 50% to at least a stable 30%, so that she does not require her headbox.  That is an aim to which all are committed, and an outcome that all (including the court) would be delighted to see come about.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be apparent then, that although CW&#8217;s improvement may be slight, it is nevertheless significant.  The question is as to what implications, if any, this improvement has for her future treatment.  The answer on a day-to-day basis is probably very little, except in the event of deterioration.  It is on how that is to be managed that much professional attention has been focussed.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There has been very significant development on the issue of ventilation.  Dr &#8216;K&#8217;, supported by the expert evidence, can now see circumstances in which he would be prepared to ventilate CW in the event of respiratory distress.  He put it this way:   &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;..I feel that we have crossed an invisible line whereby I can say to the Court that there are now circumstances where, given the wishes of her parents and given the chances of a successful outcome, it would be justifiable for CW to be ventilated.&#8221;  It is equally apparent, from his evidence, that it is not in all circumstances that ventilation would be right.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr &#8216;K&#8217; postulates three sets of circumstances in which the question of ventilation might arise.  First, there might be a catastrophic event, such as cardiac arrest, or respiratory collapse consequent on a virulent infection.  Of that he says, &#8220;In these circumstances I still feel that it would be wholly inappropriate to ventilate CW.&#8221;  Mr and Mrs W agree with that at least in respect of cardiac arrest.  The second scenario is of a gradual deterioration in her lung function so that it slips back to where it was in October last year.  Dr &#8216;K&#8217; adds, &#8220;However, it would be far more serious because her condition would have been on a downward and unstoppable trajectory.&#8221;  Ventilation in those circumstances would be futile and thus wrong.  There is, however, an intermediate third position, where there is an infection or other decline that may be thought reversible, described as &#8220;a reasonable or realistic chance&#8221; that we could bring her back to her present condition (or at least to a tolerable condition) as in March 2005.  In these circumstances ventilation may well be justified.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, Dr &#8216;K&#8217; then went on, (and was once again supported in this by the expert evidence), to make it crystal clear both that it was quite impossible to define in advance the circumstances in which ventilation would be justified, and also that it would be quite wrong to prescribe a pre-determined length of time for which it would be right to ventilate.  Everything would have to depend on the clinical picture at the time that the ventilation decision was required.  His evidence was wholly unambiguous on both points and I have no doubt that he was right on both points.  That being the case, I must now turn to the question of the Declarations.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The purpose of Declaratory relief in this class of case was considered by the Court of Appeal in R &#8211;v- PORTSMOUTH HOSPITALS NHS TRUST exp GLASS (1999) 2FLR 905 (CA) and has been helpfully summarised by the  Court of Appeal in this case: (2005) EWCA civ 1181.  At Paragraph 112 of the judgment of the Court, Wall LJ says this: </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">In the overwhelming majority of cases in which the inherent jurisdiction of the court over children or incompetent adults is invoked, the &#8220;best interests&#8221; decision by the court determines the issue once and for all. The extreme example, of course, is the patient in a permanent vegetative state (PVS).  A decision that it is lawful to terminate the administration of food and water to a patient in a PVS state, once implemented, is self-evidently determinative.  Similarly, a declaration that it is lawful to treat a child in a particular way &#8211; for example by being given a blood transfusion or undergoing a particular operation contrary to the wishes of the child&#8217;s parents &#8211; has no ongoing legal, as opposed to medical consequence.  In such cases, the declaration binds once and for all.  Similar considerations apply to an order that an incompetent adult be sterilized, or that an incompetent female patient should undergo a termination of pregnancy.</span></p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is plain that that is no longer this case.  It cannot be said that there is a clear medical issue to decide either as to whether to ventilate or, if once started, whether to stop it.  All depends on the developing clinical picture.  It is not even possible to do, as has been done in this case, to make declarations based on clearly anticipated facts, for that position can no longer be sustained by the medical evidence.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was a suggestion that the court should make a partial Declaration limited to authorising the refusal of ventilation in the event that CW suffered a cardiac arrest.  In my judgment there are three compelling objections to that course:  first, all the medical evidence concurs in saying that a cardiac arrest is a remote contingency as a primary cause of collapse; secondly, the parents have made it very clear that in those circumstances they would not seek ventilation; and thirdly such a Declaration would be heard by those involved to speak from silence as well as from substance, or in other words it would be understood to required ventilation in all other circumstances save cardiac arrest.  Although it would be wrong, I can see only too readily in this case that it would be so misunderstood.  In my view the court must focus on the true purpose for which a Declaration is sought in this case.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In fact, what the Trust now seeks is something quite new.  They seek a Declaration which, (however actually phrased), has the effect in the event of irreconcilable disagreement of giving the doctor the last word.  That would, I think, be a novel development.  That does not mean to say that it should not be done, but it does mean that the court should scrutinise the application with particular care.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The difficulty was succinctly put by Dr &#8216;K&#8217;.  On the one hand he recognised that the presence of the Declaration impaired his professional relationship with the parents.

Fractures can be, and usually are, however, very painful.  The parents objected to the medical advice to treat the pain with morphine and an out-of-hours emergency telephone application had to be made to me for permission so to treat.  Eventually the parents agreed to the treatment, although there were continuing disputes as to dosage, and, as I observed in the April judgement, the child, perhaps co-incidentally, began to make good progress thereafter.  Taken on its own, of course, this incident would be viewed as one of those legitimate disagreements between doctor and family that would ordinarily be resolved by discussion.  In this case, however, it has to be seen in the context of everything else.</p>

Fairness requires me to say that there is also another side to the picture.  Mr and Mrs W have been unswerving in their devotion to CW since she was born.  They must have their full share of the credit for the fact that CW has survived and has made the developments that she has.  Just as no-one could seriously blame parents who were overwhelmed by CW&#8217;s condition so no-one could fail to admire the commitment that these parents have given.  They are parties to, and probably the main instigator of, plans for CW to come home, and, as I have said, no-one would be more pleased than I were that to happen.  The criticisms that inevitably have had to be made of their conduct must always  be seen in the context of their single-minded commitment to CW, the inevitable stress occasioned by the care of a very sick child, and their underlying appreciation of and desire to support the exemplary care that this child has received from the hospital staff.</p>

I have to say that I cannot at present conceive of any circumstances in which this would be other than an abuse of power as directly or indirectly requiring the practitioner to act contrary to the fundamental duty which he owes to his patient. This, subject to obtaining any necessary consent, is to treat the patient in accordance with his own best clinical judgment, notwithstanding that other practitioners who are not called upon to treat the patient may have formed a quite different judgment or that he court, acting on expert evidence, may disagree with him</span>.  Mr Wolfe, on behalf of the parents, accepted that no doctor could be required so to act.  It will therefore be readily apparent why it is that Dr &#8216;K&#8217;s&#8217; perceptions of what he would have to do, if there were no court order, does not represent the law.</p>

He must arrive at a conclusion about what is in his patient&#8217;s best interests.

Secondly it does not offer the clear protection to staff that a Declaration might. Thirdly, it does not remove the prospect of litigation for, especially in the event of gradual as against catastrophic decline, the Trust might feel obligated to return to Court   Against this, however, must be set the fact that even with a Declaration, such as is sought by the Trust, it would not be possible to prevent the parents referring any dispute back to the Court.

The Guardian did not feel able to support the continuation of the Declarations because the medical evidence could not prescribe in advance the circumstances in which  ventilation should be attempted or refused and was strongly opposed to any time limits on any attempted ventilation.

A Declaration is intended to resolve a dispute and usually to provide, once and for all, the course of treatment to be pursued.   Exceptionally, (and they held that this case fell into that category), a Declaration could be used to resolve a future dispute, which could both be clearly identified and reasonably anticipated.  What a Declaration cannot be used for is to require the court, in effect, to oversee the treatment plan and its execution.  All that said, one has to recognise the (happily) wholly exceptional circumstances of this case, and the peculiar difficulties that beset the treating team and are likely to continue to trouble them for as long as they have the care of CW.  It is not right that society should impose duties on it members, and then withhold the means by which in any individual case those duties are to be carried out.</p>
