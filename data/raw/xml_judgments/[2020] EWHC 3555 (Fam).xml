On 6 September 2019 each party issued a petition for divorce. Mrs Crowther made her application for financial remedies against Mr Crowther on 18 September 2019. On 17 December she made an urgent ex parte application for a freezing injunction against Mr Crowther and the Second to Sixth Respondents, &#8220;the Castle parties&#8221;.  </p>

She said that there was evidence that Mr Crowther, together with the Second Respondent Mr Knight, were conspiring to defraud her by reducing Mr Crowther&#8217;s apparent financial position by transferring assets away from Mr Crowther and by various devices involving ending contracts with companies controlled by Mr Crowther and moving those contracts to new companies. She argued that unless a freezing order was granted, the assets of the marriage would be taken offshore and would effectively be impossible for Mrs Crowther to access in any matrimonial finance award.  </p>

On 24 February the Castle parties issued proceedings in the Admiralty Division asserting legal and beneficial ownership of four of the vessels and related relief. They also asserted that companies controlled by Mr and Mrs Crowther owed Mr Knight approximately &#163;5 million. It is not necessary to set out the precise figures, not least because sums have varied considerably through the litigation. The important point for these purposes is that the Castle parties were alleging that the Crowthers, whether directly or through various companies, owed them a very large sum of money.  </p>

In essence, he said that the Crowthers&#8217; business was in considerable financial difficulty in 2012 and a deal had been struck by which ownership was transferred to companies controlled by him as a way of restructuring the Crowthers&#8217; finances. He asserted this was an entirely bona fide and arms length agreement and he and Mr Crowther denied that the purpose of the agreement was to evade tax in the UK.

Mrs Crowther promptly appealed to the Court of Appeal and a stay was granted. The appeal was heard on 9 June, the Castle parties being represented by leading counsel but Mr Crowther representing himself. The appeal was allowed on the grounds that the hearing before Holman J had not been fair and the Court of Appeal determined to reinstate the freezing order. </p>

She acknowledged that "on paper it looks like Castle Ship Management have owned their ships since 2012&#8221;, but said that this was not the reality and was only done to "reduce our tax liabilities", the reality being that "100% of the shareholding in Castle Ship Management Ltd is held on trust for us". Although she did not put it anything like so bluntly, what her evidence came to is that her husband conspired with Mr Knight to conceal from HMRC that ultimately the vessels were beneficially owned by the Crowthers; that this was done in order to evade tax; and that what Mr Knight gained from this arrangement was a relatively modest annual fee. Mr Charles Howard QC for Mrs Crowther confirmed in argument before us that Mrs Crowther's case is indeed that this was unlawful tax evasion as distinct from legitimate tax avoidance, albeit that her case will be that despite being a partner in the business and responsible for financial matters, and despite having attended the November 2012 meeting, she was not a participant in unlawful activity. </span></p>

The first is that the arrangement reached was, as Mr Knight and Mr Crowther say, a commercial agreement to transfer both legal and beneficial title to the vessel owning companies to CSM in exchange for CSM taking responsibility for paying off the loan notes, combined with a bareboat charter to AMA which would enable it to continue in business and to earn a profit on sub-charters of the vessels. The suggested rationale for this arrangement was that the Crowthers were in default of their loan commitments due to cashflow difficulties and faced the vessels being taken over by Castle acting on behalf of their creditors. The second possibility is that it was a criminal conspiracy between Mr Knight and Mr Crowther, but also involving Mrs Crowther who attended at least one of the relevant meetings, to evade tax properly due on the Crowthers' earnings. </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.24in"><span style="font-style:italic">The first of these possibilities has the support of some contemporary documents, by which I mean not only the agreements concluded themselves but also surrounding documents such as the letters and emails which say on their face that the Crowthers' business was unable to meet loan payments due to "cashflow issues" and that they were faced with a real prospect of losing control of the vessels in any event. If that was so, it would not be a commercially implausible arrangement to make, albeit that it has what I would regard as some unusual features, such as the hire provisions to which I have referred. </span></p>

Cogent evidence would be required to make good such a serious allegation at trial.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In her Counterclaim she repeated the Defence and she sought declarations as to sham, conspiracy and fraud against Mr Crowther and the Castle parties. Mrs Crowther filed a large number of witness statements that set out her case that Mr Crowther and Mr Knight had entered into a conspiracy, initially to defraud HMRC of tax revenue and then to defraud her in relation to the matrimonial proceedings. Mr Crowther and the Castle parties filed various documents strenuously denying these allegations. In preparation for the trial there was a very extensive disclosure exercise in which thousands of documents were disclosed and there were a number of applications to the court relating to alleged failures to disclose relevant material, and by Mr and Mrs Crowther for funds to be released from the proceeds of sale of the Former Matrimonial Home in order to fund legal costs. I am told that in total Mrs Crowther has spent something in the region of &#163;900,000 in legal fees.  </p>

On 2 November she filed a further document particularising the claim. At this point her claim somewhat shifted to alleging that Mr Crowther was the sole beneficial owner of the ships rather than both of them holding the beneficial ownership. The Castle parties continued to argue that her case had not been properly particularised and indeed appealed my order (unsuccessfully) to the Court of Appeal.  </p>

I set out in the Postscript to this judgment why I have referred to the sums in the Tomlin Order.  The Castle parties are to pay Mrs Crowther the sum of &#163;750,000 in instalments and release her from &#163;5,632,639 unpaid charter income and over &#163;1million of other alleged loans; she is to discontinue all claims against them on a no admissions basis, and there is to be no order for costs.

As I will refer to below, Mr Marshall QC, who appeared for Mrs Crowther, in his Skeleton Argument appeared to suggest that some part of the allegations could remain against Mr Crowther. However, in oral argument he quickly accepted that all claims of beneficial interest against Mr Crowther would also have to be discontinued, as would any allegations of sham, fraud or conspiracy. There was no dispute that this should be recorded in recitals to the order, quite apart from in this judgment. </p>

If he succeeds he can expect to recover his costs, but if he fails or abandons the claim at whatever stage in the process, it is normally unjust to make the defendant bear the costs of proceedings which were forced upon him and which the claimant is unable or unwilling to carry through to judgment.&#8221; </span></p>

Courts regard it as improper, and can react very adversely, where speculative claims in fraud are bandied about by a party to litigation without a solid foundation in the evidence. A party risks the loss of its fund of goodwill and confidence on the part of the court if it makes an allegation of fraud which the court regards as unjustified, and this may affect the court's reaction to other parts of its case. Moreover, as Birss J observed in Property Alliance Group v Royal Bank of Scotland <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2015/3272" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 3272 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 3272 (Ch)</ref> at [40], allegations of fraud "can cause a major increase in the cost, complexity and temperature of an action."

A defendant who establishes that the claim is without foundation, and so vindicates himself, is normally entitled to the costs of the action.

Although there was in his Skeleton Argument some attempt by Mr Marshall to keep a part of the allegations alive against Mr Crowther, he quickly accepted in Court that that was untenable and the discontinuance of the preliminary issues had to apply to Mr Crowther as well as the Castle parties and that he could not continue to allege fraud and conspiracy against Mr Crowther. </p>

FPR r.28.3 does not apply because, as is accepted by Mrs Crowther, the trial of the preliminary issue is not financial remedy proceedings for the purpose of the Rules, and therefore costs would normally follow the event. Under CPR r.38.6, the presumption is that the party who discontinues is liable for costs, but that Rule does not apply because it is not referred to in FPR r.28.2.  </p>

Whatever arrangements were made between Mr Knight and the Crowthers in 2012, and allegations those arrangements were a sham, will no longer be the subject of the Court&#8217;s consideration in the financial remedy proceedings. I therefore cannot see that the disclosure in that regard remains relevant to the proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Marshall argues that I should defer costs to the end of the proceedings because at that stage I, or any other judge who hears the financial remedy proceedings, will have a full overview of the case. In my view that is the wrong approach. The preliminary issues were deliberately &#8220;hived off&#8221; to be dealt with separately. They are a discrete issue about discrete assets from the rest of the case, which concerns more conventional assets such as the FMH, various cars and chattels. It is therefore appropriate to deal with those costs now. </p>

Again, I do not accept this point. In fact, the preliminary issue concerned separate assets and a separate dispute, namely that involving the Castle parties. Costs draughtsman are very used, where there is a partial order for costs, to differentiating parts of the litigation and I do not consider there to be any particular complexities in doing so here.  </p>

In my view, that is to confuse an in-principle costs decision, relating to a part of the litigation, from an application for summary assessment or indeed an order for a specific sum. It will be for the costs process hereafter to fix what sums are referable to the preliminary issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Marshall argues that financial remedies litigation is different from other litigation because the judge has to be concerned with the fair distribution of matrimonial assets. In my view, that is to try to create an exceptionalism for financial remedies litigation which does not and should not exist. The basic principles of proper litigation conduct should apply, and be enforced, in the financial remedies jurisdiction as in any other. It should not be allowed to develop into a discrete world where normal principles of disclosure, pleading and discontinuance no longer apply. If a party chooses to plead fraud, and then withdraws that allegation at the eleventh hour, then s/he must expect to pay for the consequences of those decisions. The principle that fraud should only be pleaded with considerable reticence, and if the allegation is then withdrawn then the alleging party should pay costs on an indemnity basis, in my view applies as much in financial remedies as in any other area of law.  </p>

There is no reason why that principle should not apply here. Therefore, Mrs Crowther should pay Mr Crowther&#8217;s costs of, and occasioned by, the preliminary issues on an indemnity basis.  </p>

There is equally no prospect of a successful appeal given that the costs are occasioned by a settlement. There is likely to be a long delay to detailed assessment given that there are on-going financial remedy proceedings. I also consider it appropriate, given the way Mrs Crowther has conducted the litigation in respect to the preliminary issues as set out above, that Mr Crowther should be able to recover this part of his costs at this stage. I will therefore order a payment on account in the sum of &#163;80,000.  </p>

However, when it comes to the actual reasons for confidentiality Mr Temmink raised two short issues. The first is the reputational damage to R2 from the allegations that have been made by Mrs Crowther. The second is that the &#8220;settlement sum is commercially sensitive&#8221;. He says that the parties (R2 and Mrs Crowther) deliberately put the terms in a separate confidential document. He then goes on &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">that information is commercially sensitive and, where the Crowthers appear to have funded their lifestyles by borrowing from others without repaying them; and by failing to pay tax, confidentiality in the settlement may also be important to the Applicant.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Neither Mr nor Mrs Crowther have argued in their responses to the draft judgment that the settlement sum should not be set out in the judgment. On Mr Temmink&#8217;s first point, the further publicity arises not from the naming of the sum, but rather from the fact of a further judgment. That was inevitable once Mr Crowther was not a party to the settlement and pursued his costs before me. On the second point, Mr Temmink does not explain why the sum of &#163;750,000 is commercially sensitive. There are no commercial competitors who could have any possible interest and there are no other transactions which it could affect. The facts of this case are unusual and cannot possibly have any relevance to future agreements.  It may be that the tax authorities are interested in the sum, but that cannot be a reason not to refer to it in an open judgment.  </p>
