Almaz is Ethiopian and it is accepted that Almaz and Yakub had a sexual relationship while Yakub was working at a school in Addis Ababa.  It is Yakub&#8217;s case that the relationship terminated in November 1984. Almaz says that it came to an end in April 1985 when she informed Yakub that she was pregnant by him and declined to have a termination.</p>

However, it is vital to emphasise that the DNA tests only provide one part of the picture.  The probability of paternity depends also on other evidence relevant to the case.  I have to examine carefully the events of 1984-1985 as well as what happened between the parties after Mikias&#8217;s birth.  To use the words of the SJE&#8217;s reply to questions prepared by Yakub:</p>

In doing so it is material to mention that the calendar primarily used in Ethiopia is the Amharic calendar.  This calendar has 13 months and has what I was variously told a 7-8 years difference from the Gregorian calendar.  The parties accepted that I should approach dates in this case with a degree of caution and not put excessive reliance upon them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The circumstances of Almaz and Yakub meeting in 1984 are hotly in dispute between them.  Yakub&#8217;s case is that he and his two house mates, IM and AH, were out at a bar when Yakub was, to put it colloquially, picked up by Almaz.  Yakub says that against his better judgement he entered into a sexual relationship with Almaz, implicitly at her instigation.  Almaz&#8217;s case is very different.  She said that she heard that there was a cleaning job going in the building where Yakub lived and she went along to try to obtain it.  She says that she met Yakub and was offered the job and thereafter worked as his cleaner and maid.  She was just 20 years old at the time and needed an additional job to her work in a caf&#233; to try and make ends meet.</p>

When asked how the language barrier was dealt with, as Almaz spoke Amharic and Yakub spoke English, she said that they muddled through and that Yakub would give her a shopping list in English of what he wanted purchased and she would take it to the market where English speaking traders would provide her with the items.  </p>

Almaz says that there was no other man in her life at the time and that it was only in about March/April that she began to suspect that she was pregnant.  She says that she took a test which revealed that she was around 2-3 months pregnant.  She told her uncle who was upset and he pushed her into telling Yakub.  She says that Yakub told her to abort the child and that when she refused, her relationship with Yakub broke down.  As a result of the awkwardness she resigned her employment.</p>

Yakub did leave the country during summer 1985, travelled to India for a holiday, and then made his way back to England.  He says that he had no idea that Almaz was pregnant until sometime later after the birth when he received in England a letter from IM informing him that Almaz was alleging that he was the father of Mikias.</p>

She said that if it was not provided she would go to the British Embassy.  The principal of the school, now deceased, said that he would see what he could do and he later informed Almaz that IM, a fellow teacher at the school, had contacted Yakub and received a reply that Yakub would support Mikias by paying a monthly sum towards the keep of Mikias and his mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Yakub accepts that for the next 5 years he paid a monthly sum to Mikias.  Yakub&#8217;s explanation, which I found curious, was that he was dammed if he did and dammed if he did not.  If he did not pay, people would accuse him of refusing to accept that he was the father, whilst if he did pay they would come to the same conclusion.  The payments were made for 5 years, which he says was the requirement of a father under Ethiopian law, and then ended with him providing Almaz with the funds to buy a sewing machine. On his own case, Yakub never said that he was not the father at this time.</p>

She kept in touch with Mikias who was later transferred to a church orphanage in Addis Ababa.  During a visit to the church she met Father CB.  She explained to him that she wanted Mikias to meet his father.  CB was familiar with the school in which Yakub had taught as he had chaplaincy duties there. He knew of Yakub and had been told by IM that Yakub had made the payments described.  He was able to find Yakub and on his return to England CB contacted Yakub and told him that Mikias wanted to know his extended family and he arranged to meet and to speak with Yakub.</p>

He also acknowledged that he had sent money to Almaz to help support Mikias.  CB says that he persuaded Yakub that he should have a DNA test and that was duly carried out by the Forensic Science Service Paternity Analysis Unit based in West Yorkshire.  </p>

The Unit uses the technique of DNA profiling in which a pattern of bands specific to an individual is revealed.  The report says that this technique routinely targets 10 areas on the DNA molecule, but that in this case further testing had also been carried out.  </p>

In all of the DNA tests carried out, with the exception of one test, the paternal bands present in the profile of Mikias are present in the profile of Yakub.  This is a result, the tester says, that would be expected if Yakub was the natural father.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Much of the focus has been on the one mismatch in the bands which was not present in the profile of either parent.  One possible explanation for this result is that a harmless rare genetic event called a mutation has taken place which has the effect of altering a DNA band that is passed from parent to child.  This can result in the child in having a band which is not present in either of the parents&#8217; profile.  In this case the results would be consistent with the mutation in the paternal band in the child.  </p>

This translates to a probability of paternity of 99.86%.  This statistical evaluation does not account for a close male relative of Yakub being the natural father but Yakub has ruled this out.  The conclusion is described as providing &#8220;moderately strong evidence to support the assertion that Yakub is the natural father of Mikias&#8221;.</p>
