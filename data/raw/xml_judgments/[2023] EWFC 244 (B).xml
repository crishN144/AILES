Mr N&#8217;s solicitors came off the court record immediately prior to the court hearing today. Mr N told me that he is unable to afford any representation and therefore he now appears in person.</p>

The mortgages combined amount to &#163;47,000 or thereabouts. For the purposes of today the property, which has three bedrooms, has a value of &#163;280,000 and net equity of &#163;224,500. This equates to about &#163;112,000 each on an equal sharing basis.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The cynical side of me shows no surprise that the relationship between Mr N and SS has survived given the lavish sums Mr N has expanded on both SS and members of her family.

I have considered the medical report dated 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of March 2023 which summarises several health issues. The medical report suggests that a house move would adversely impact Mrs N&#8217;s  mental health but is entirely silent as to her earning capacity and whether she is able to carry on working in her current role until retirement.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This has in part been caused by Mr N failing to adequately answer questionnaires, failing to give timely or adequate disclosure, and failing to provide his open proposals within 21 days of the financial dispute resolution hearing as required by the rules until this morning. This in turn has made it impossible to settle the matter hence Mrs N&#8217;s application for costs since September which I will return to later in this judgement.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are a number of significant features about this case. Mr N readily admitted to having received &#163;468,000 from his father&#8217;s estate in early 2020 together with an additional &#163;30,000 for a painting.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This inheritance is of course not a matrimonial asset which is readily conceded by Ms Ellis.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Instead, Mr N has engaged in an extraordinary generous and reckless spending spree. It is his case that all the money has gone. He readily admitted to lavishing it on SS and her family, holidays, a car and even a hot tub. It was put to Mr N in cross examination that this equates to expenditure of about &#163;16,000 per month over a 2 &#189; year period. Mr N readily accepted that this expenditure had been both wanton and reckless.</p>

Notwithstanding his lack of disclosure, I am not prepared to draw adverse inferences that money has been hidden away. I accept Mr N&#8217;s sworn evidence that there is no money left. I find him to be an honest witness.</p>

It is on this basis, that Mrs N argues that Mr N should now clear the mortgage.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Ordinarily, the starting point for a marriage of 23 years where there is one grown-up child should be a 50-50 division of the assets. Both parties on the face of it have identical housing need. Mrs N is arguably over housed in a three-bed property with an additional box room and that property would have been sold to enable the parties to go their separate ways.</p>

Should Mr N have to go further and clear the mortgage as sought by Mrs N as well as clear outstanding costs of circa &#163;19,000 Mrs. N has incurred since September last?</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Case law has been comprehensively covered in Ms Ellis&#8217;s position statement on behalf of Mrs N. In addition, practice direction 28A makes it clear that a party who fails to negotiate reasonably prior to any hearing can expect a cost penalty. Mr N failed to set out his open position within 21 days of the financial dispute resolution hearing or at all until this morning, He failed to provide a S.25 statement despite the previous order. He has largely failed to engage. He says his solicitors have not requested this information from him but that is a matter between him and his solicitors. I find that this has hampered settlement.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am not however going to order Mr N to pay the full &#163;19,000 sought. As a general observation I find that the costs of &#163;69,000 are very high notwithstanding the additional work caused by Mr N&#8217;s non-cooperation. Instead, I propose to order Mr N to pay the sum of &#163;10,000 towards these costs. I have already accepted and made a finding that Mr N does not have this sort of money at present and so these costs will have to be paid monthly I suggest at a rate of &#163;350 per month which means the debt will be cleared in just over two years.</p>

She has managed to maintain the monthly payments which I understand to be currently about &#163;660 per month since separation and she will have to continue to do so until the end of the mortgage term.</p>
