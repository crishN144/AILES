The application is founded on the European Convention of Human Rights (EHCR), given effect by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref>). Consequently it is outside the scheme set out by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>).</p>

The Applicant&#8217;s submit the WT form signed by AB is identical to the one signed in the <span style="font-style:italic">Jennings</span> case where the court determined it was not sufficiently clear and therefore did not give Ms Choya sufficient opportunity to provide consent in writing to use of the embryos with a surrogate. The relevant form was revised by the HFEA following the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Jennings.</span> In addition the Applicant says, like in <span style="font-style:italic">Jennings</span>, there is no ambiguity regarding AB&#8217;s engagement in fertility treatment with the aim of achieving the birth of a child with her husband and no doubt she would have wished that process to continue after her death. This is different than the factual situation faced by Sir Andrew McFarlane in <span style="font-style:italic">G v Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2024/2453" uk:canonical="[2024] EWHC 2453 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2024">[2024] EWHC 2453 (Fam)</ref> where the general approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Jennings</span> was approved.</p>

There is a difference in treatment between men and women who sign consent forms due to the difference in wording as women are deprived of the opportunity of consenting to the posthumous use by their male partners of their jointly created embryos. As a consequence, any male surviving partner is treated differently to any female surviving partner from a heterosexual relationship. The difference in treatment, which arises from omissions in the WT consent form, is not objectively justifiable.</span></p>

The burden is on the state to establish this within the proportionality framework of (i) is the legislative objective sufficiently important to justify limiting a fundamental right? (ii) are the measures that have been designed to meet it rationally connected to it? (iii) are they no more than is necessary to accomplish it? and (iv) do they strike a fair balance between the rights of the individual and the interests of the community? The key to this latter assessment is the proportionality between the effects of legislative measures on countervailing rights or interests and the objective that is achieved. </span></p>

(ii) The evidence is that AB would have wanted EF to be able to use the embryo this way on her death. Consequently the need for consent is not being undermined, rather it is being supported and would support the principle of the embryos being used in accordance with the wishes of both gamete providers which promotes the legislative objective.

The domestic courts have upheld the strictness of the scheme. Judicial interpretation of it's clear terms has been limited in England and Wales to the case of&#160;R(M)&#160;where the Court of Appeal clarified that, for effective consent, an individual need only be given 'such relevant information as is proper' (in the words of Sch 3) rather than 'all' relevant information, and that what information was 'proper' might change with the circumstances and over time. The scheme itself has, for over three decades, been operated by clinics, the HFEA and, where required, by the courts by strict application of its clear requirements. Any judicial determinations which have held that circumstances outside the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref> scheme are lawful have not been made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> but under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref> by applying the ECHR.</span></p>

There is a clear danger of conflating these two separate categories and reading across judicial decisions which have been taken outside the scheme as if they were taken as part of the statutory regime. The list of points drawn from the authorities by Ms Fottrell (set out at paragraph 38) demonstrates the danger of conflating, or failing to acknowledge, these two distinct routes to treatment. Insofar as, in previous reported cases, courts have taken the specific courses adumbrated in the five points in that list they have done so outside the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref> scheme and have done so in the circumstances of a particular individual whose Art 8 rights have, on the facts of a specific case, been engaged to the extent that the court has used its power under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref> to read down, or otherwise relax, the strict provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>, Sch 3. There is a danger in constructing such lists if it is suggested that they represent a general and accepted extension of the court's jurisdiction for all cases, when they are no more than examples of specific approaches that a court has been prepared to take when evaluating and then, if justified, acting upon the need to avoid a breach of an individual's rights under the ECHR in that case.</span></p>

Insofar as the term 'evidential rule' may suggest that these provisions are anything other than strict and essential requirements of the statutory scheme, such a suggestion is not sustainable. Further, it would be an error to read Theis J's reference to the 'rule' being 'not inviolable' as holding that it is open to a clinic, the HFEA or a court&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">within the statutory scheme</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;to waive the requirement for effective consent that complies with the specific terms of Sch 3. The key parts of the judgment in&#160;Jennings&#160;read as a whole demonstrate that Theis J did not make her decision within the statutory scheme by demoting the status of the Sch 3 requirements to that of rules which may be waived in any case. As her judgment shows, Theis J determined Mr Jennings' application by holding that his ECHR Art 8 rights had been significantly interfered with and that the court was required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref> to read down the relevant provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>, Sch 3 in order to dispense with the requirement for written and signed consent. It is in that sense, namely that the statutory provisions will be vulnerable to being read down where it is necessary for the court to do so under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref>, that the Sch 3 requirements were 'not inviolable' in&#160;Jennings; the 'circumstances' which 'require[d] the court to intervene' were those which made it necessary for the court to act under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3(1)</ref>.</span></p>

The Clinic&#8217;s standard operating procedures on taking consent prior to a procedure or treatment did not address surrogacy at all save for a reference to different options being set out in the form. Also, the HFEA relevant patient information leaflet at the time under the section entitled &#8216;what happens if one of us dies&#8217; makes no reference to surrogacy or the posthumous use of a jointly created embryo by the man.</span></p>

I reject the submission made by Ms Watson that this course is not open on an individual basis as the alleged interference arises from a general legislative measure with the consequence that that the approach to be taken to the assessment of proportionality should be at a general level. Similar arguments were raised in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Jennings </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">(see for example [66, 67, 68 and 72]).

There is no evidence to support any floodgate submissions, there have been relatively few cases that raise these issues and on the rare occasions when they do there can be recourse to the court.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In my judgment, there is no dispute that the requirement that consent be in writing pursues a legitimate aim, the issue is whether that aim is sufficiently weighty to justify the very significant interference with EF&#8217;s Art 8 rights, making due allowance for the margin of appreciation. The requirement of consent is the cornerstone of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref> which reflects the importance of personal autonomy and giving effect to an individual&#8217;s wishes. The evidence establishes that AB would have wanted EF to be able to use the embryo with a surrogate in the event of her death, which seeks to support rather than undermine the importance of consent and personal autonomy which, in turn, promotes the fundamental objective of the legislative scheme. AB was unable to record her consent to this treatment as she was not given the opportunity to do so through no fault of her own. The insistence on written consent would, in the particular circumstances of this case defeat rather than promote this objective of the legislative scheme. In circumstances where the interference with EF&#8217;s Art 8 rights would be significant, final and lifelong there are no countervailing factors to justify the interference as, in the circumstances, permitting the application would not undermine a fundamental objective of the statutory scheme. I accept Ms Richards&#8217; submission that </span><span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;to fail to respect compelling evidence of a donor&#8217;s wish, in circumstances where she was not given an opportunity to record that wish in writing as a result of (a) the lack of clarity in the HFEA&#8217;s pro forma forms and (b) the failure of the [Clinic] to provide her with relevant information, would constitute a disproportionate interference with [EF&#8217;s] rights under Article 8&#8217;.</span></p>
