The husband had been warned by Peel J, as recorded in the order of 2 March 2023, that should he fail to attend this hearing then orders may be made in his absence.

She has anticipated the conclusion of these proceedings for many months. She has spent considerable sums in costs. I must also, under the overriding objective, take into account the resources of the court that would be wasted by an ineffective hearing and the impact on other cases of seeking to set aside more time for this case.</span></p>

He has not prosecuted or withdrawn his own Form A. He finds himself in wholesale breach of directions previously given and has not filed any evidence at all as set out in more detail below. He is currently barred from cross examining the Wife in person by virtue of his failure to comply with the order of Peel J made on 2 March 2023. He did not attend the committal hearing on 2 March 2023 when findings were made against him (with sentencing adjourned). Accordingly, his failure to attend this hearing stands alongside his non-compliance with directions more generally within these proceedings.</span></p>

The Wife has already paid Firm X &#163;267,000 on account of the Husband&#8217;s costs. Mr Glaser suggests that the court should be cautious about accepting these figures. So far as Firm X is concerned, the combined figure would mean they have charged almost &#163;600,000 in circumstances where they had not filed a single court document on behalf of the Husband (beyond his Form A), at least in respect of the financial remedy proceedings. Firm Y were, Mr Glaser says, notified at an early stage of their involvement of a potential conflict, something they should have been aware of in any event from a simple conflict check. Mr Glaser argues that it is difficult to see how they could have generated fees at anywhere near this level in these circumstances. </span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;In my judgment, in the ordinary course of events, where there is a valid prenuptial agreement, the terms of which amount to the wife having contracted out of a division of the assets based on sharing, a court is likely to regard fairness as demanding that she receives a settlement that is limited to that which provides for her needs. But whilst such an outcome may be considered to be more likely than not, that does not prescribe the outcome in every case. Even where there is an effective prenuptial agreement, the court remains under an obligation to take into account all the factors found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>, together with a proper consideration of all the circumstances, the first consideration being the welfare of any children. Such an approach may, albeit unusually, lead the court in its search for a fair outcome, to make an order which, contrary to the terms of an agreement, provides a settlement for the wife in excess of her needs. It should also be recognised that even in a case where the court considers a needs-based approach to be fair, the court will as in KA v MA, retain a degree of latitude when it comes to deciding on the level of generosity or frugality which should appropriately be brought to the assessment of those needs.&#8221;</span></p>

This factor should not however be allowed to dominate the picture as there will be many children, particularly children dealt with under Schedule 1, who will not have experienced a standard of living within a functioning relationship either because the liaison between the parents was very brief, or because the child was born after the relationship had come to an end: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">J v C (Child: Financial Provision) </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">at [156].

In my view the costs incurred appear to be surprising in the context of the Husband&#8217;s minimal involvement in these proceedings. They are not reflected in any documents filed or his representation at any hearings within the financial remedy proceedings. The only hearing at which the Husband was represented, the hearing on 14 October 2022, that representation was by way of public access instruction. It is difficult to understand how, therefore, Firm X could have incurred costs of &#163;600,000 on behalf of the Husband (of which &#163;280,000 has been paid and &#163;320,000 is outstanding).

The Wife&#8217;s evidence was that the family expenditure became inflated as the marriage fell into difficulties. It is also obvious that a significant level of cost was spent maintaining properties that the Husband will not have responsibility for, funding security and staff, and other expenditure that would not form reasonable expenditure by the Husband living without the Wife. They also include sums for the benefit of the parties&#8217; son (e.g. education costs) that the Wife has agreed to meet separately.

He should have the resources to enable him to rehouse at that time at a reasonable level. He will not therefore be in a predicament of real need. </span></p>

This means that &#8216;kitting out&#8217; represents an ongoing obligation rather than a one-off. It requires the Wife to fund not only the structural maintenance of the property but also maintenance of the interior, furnishings and fittings to a reasonable standard. Were I to be wrong about that interpretation, then I would set aside an additional housing fund to meet those costs.</span></p>

Although expressly provided outside the terms of the agreement, the Wife has paid those sums voluntarily. This represents some acknowledgment that there must inevitably be a period of adjustment for the Husband following the breakdown of the parties&#8217; relationship until such time as he is able to adjust to the termination of his financial dependence without undue hardship (within the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref>A <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>). </span></p>

My assessment is that the Husband should be able to develop his career so as to achieve financial independence within a 6 year period, so by the time their son reaches secondary school age. Financial independence (separate from the question of child maintenance) should be achieved when he achieves a net income of or close to &#163;100,000. In my judgment, the broad figure required to enable the Husband to develop his career to a sufficient extent to be able to adjust without undue hardship is just over &#163;60,000 per year over a 6 year period. I capitalise this to reach the sum of &#163;350,000. </span></p>

This is a point I have considered but it is impossible to chart the progress of the Husband&#8217;s career any more precisely than I have. There is also the impact of inflation which at its present level significantly reduces the value of any wage increases. Projecting future income increases and when and how they are likely to occur is always a broad brush task, but particularly so in this case. In the light of the extensive wealth of the Wife and the high standard of living of the parties this point is effectively de minimis and I disregard it. </span></p>
