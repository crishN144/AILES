In the case of the mother, there is the additional feature that, because of her agoraphobia, she would have found it impossible to travel to London, or, indeed, to any court room, to attend the hearing. For those reasons, the family have participated by video link, and the four medical witnesses gave their evidence by video link. That does not detract, however, from this hearing being an ordinary hearing in open court, open to the public who could, indeed, have watched all the evidence on the large video screen in the court room if they wished to do so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.03in">The mother is now aged 21. The best estimate of her gestational EDD is around the first week of June, today being 13 May 2021.  The mother had certain behavioural problems as a child and young person which it is not necessary to elaborate.  From the age of about 17, she has clearly suffered from severe agoraphobia. During the last several years, she has only left her home at all on a very small handful of occasions. When she does do so, she experiences overwhelming sensations of anxiety, shortness of breath, dizziness and palpitations. As a result, she does not work, travel, or socialise or shop (except online), or engage in any leisure activities outside her small flat. </p>

Further, in the opinion of Dr Glover, the mother has short-term memory problems which limit her capacity to manage and process complex, multifaceted information. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.03in">For these reasons, Dr Glover and the consultant perinatal psychiatrist for the applicant trusts both agree, as do I, that the mother lacks capacity to make decisions about whether her baby should be born at home or in hospital.  Put simply, she is so overwhelmed by her agoraphobia that she is unable to weigh and process relevant considerations and unable to make any sort of decision about it.  I am, accordingly, quite satisfied - and the Official Solicitor on her behalf now agrees - that the mother lacks capacity to make decisions about the location of the delivery of her baby, and also lacks litigation capacity in relation to that issue, and I will so declare. </p>

The Court of Protection is, accordingly, both entitled and required to make the necessary decisions for her, applying a test of her best interests.  As the mother dearly wishes to give birth to a healthy baby, undamaged by the process of birth, the safety and wellbeing of the expected baby, as well as her own safety and wellbeing, are relevant to the consideration of the mother&#8217;s own best interests. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.03in">At the outset of that consideration of her best interests, I wish to make crystal clear that this case is <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> about the advantages or disadvantages of hospital birth or home birth, or vice- versa, upon which capacitous women may have different views and about which a capacitous expectant mother normally has autonomous and complete freedom of choice.  But in this country that choice is normally made in the knowledge that if, during a home birth, a medical emergency arises which may imperil the wellbeing or even the life of the mother or the baby, the mother can be fairly rapidly transferred to a hospital if required.  The nub of this case is the potential difficulty of transferring this particular mother to hospital if a medical emergency arose, but she was so overcome by her agoraphobia that she would not go. That, of course, could potentially occur at any time of day or night, or during a weekend, when far fewer resources might be available than if the mother is taken to hospital, not in labour, in a planned way so as to give birth there. </p>

But, on the basis of a very recent home scan (less reliable than a hospital scan) carried out this week, on 10 May 2021,  it is believed that the baby is entirely normally developed and on about the 50<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile, with an EDD, as I have said, of around the first week in June.  The mother is physically healthy, and currently there are no specific indicators that she may not have an uneventful, spontaneous labour and vaginal delivery. When I use the word &#8220;uneventful&#8221;, I do not in any way underestimate the physical and psychological demands and pain of a first birth upon a young mother, but there is no case specific indication that any particular medical emergency will arise in this case.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.03in">However, although child birth is the most natural of human events, it is not risk free. There are statistics which indicate that, in about 45 per cent of cases in which a young, healthy, primigravida mother embarks on a  home birth, she will be transferred to hospital before the birth occurs.  Of that 45 per cent, about one quarter are for urgent medical emergencies.  The remainder are for important but less urgent reasons, such as a failure to progress, pain relief, or repairing tears.  On that basis, about 10 per cent of all such home births require an urgent transfer to hospital for serious medical emergencies, threatening the mother and/or the baby.  Professor James Walker, the consultant obstetrician instructed as an expert witness by the Official Solicitor, considered that what he called &#8220;urgent blue light ambulance transfers&#8221; occur during about one to two per cent of home births. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.03in">There is an overall statistic that about one in 200 hospital births tragically result in a stillborn or otherwise seriously damaged baby.  In cases which start as home births, that figure doubles to about one in 100. The difference between the two figures is largely, if not wholly, attributable to delays in effecting a transfer from the home to the hospital.  In the present case, the medical witnesses do not in any way predict that there will be any emergency; but, on the basis of those known statistics, they must, appropriately and responsibly, anticipate the possibility that there may be. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.03in">A recent case in the Court of Protection, in which MacDonald J handed down an after-theevent judgment on 5 March 2021, vividly illustrates the dilemma which may (I stress, may) arise: <span style="font-style:italic">East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust v.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.92in;margin-right:0.03in">Caesarean section.  But, like the mother in the present case, that mother suffered from acute agoraphobia and was refusing to go.  In this emergency, an application was made to MacDonald J, the hearing of which is reported to have lasted from about 10 p.m. until shortly before midnight. At the end of it, the judge made an order declaring and authorising that the mother could, in her best interests, be transported to hospital using reasonable and proportionate force if necessary.  A postscript to the published judgment, which, as I have said, was delivered three days after the event, describes that, in the event, the labour had begun to progress quickly after the hearing, and the baby was in fact delivered at home before the arrangements authorised by the court could be implemented. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.03in">It is, of course, possible to draw conflicting messages from that case and judgment.  It could be said to illustrate that, even when doctors consider that there is an acute emergency, it may yet pass and the birth may take place at home without (apparently) long-term damage.  It could be said to illustrate the capacity in some situations for a hospital to obtain an urgent hearing and an order, even in the middle of the night, when an emergency has actually arisen.  But the hearing will have taken time to set up, and itself lasted nearly two hours, far too long if there had been what Professor Walker described as &#8220;a blue light ambulance emergency&#8221;. </p>

In my view, therefore, it was entirely justifiable and appropriate that the hospital trusts in the present case have made the present application. Amongst other advantages, it has enabled a thorough and informed investigation to take place, as well as a fair and transparent hearing, lasting many hours, in which to test out the issues and the </p>

Based on the mother&#8217;s known agoraphobia and her almost total refusal ever to leave her home, they correctly and justifiably anticipate that at that time she may refuse to leave her home or to be transported to hospital with, potentially, very grave consequences for herself and/or her baby.  The expert psychiatrist, Dr Glover, expressed at paragraph 6, under the heading &#8220;Opinion&#8221;, in his report dated 11 May 2021 a &#8220;suspicion&#8221; that, should serious harm be a possibility during labour at home, &#8220;the mother&#8217;s ability to cooperate and grudgingly accept hospital transfer would be significantly enhanced&#8221;, but he added that &#8220;her co-operation or acquiescence could not however be guaranteed.&#8221;   </p>

But this, too, is speculative, and is expressed in paragraph 6 of the note of the joint (online) meeting between the obstetricians on 11 May 2021 as no more than what &#8220;he would suspect&#8221;.   </p>

The mother&#8217;s partner, who is the father of the baby, would also prefer, if it can be achieved, a hospital birth, as does the grandmother, who has herself given birth to five children, all in hospital. The considered views and preferences of the partner and the grandmother are relevant, both as falling within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(7)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> and, importantly, because they are the family support network for the mother.  She wishes them both to be present at the birth, or, if only one is permitted to be, then her mother to be there.  If any question does arise, whether in an emergency or in a pre-planned way, of transporting the mother to hospital, then the partner and the grandmother (who lives nearby) will be very key people in the process. They will be giving maximum encouragement, help and support to the mother to overcome her agoraphobia, because they themselves do each consider that she should travel to hospital and give birth there. </p>

The mother does have the capacity to make an informed choice between those methods, and unless there is a significant medical contraindication, the hospital will respect and be guided by her choice on the day. Similarly, if she elects a Caesarean section, she has the capacity to make an informed choice between a local or a general anaesthetic.  Currently, she has clearly said that, if she is to have a Caesarean, she would prefer a general anaesthetic and to wake up when it is all over.  But, of course, she has the right and capacity to change her mind about that until the last moment. </p>

That may be administered orally or by intramuscular injection. She does not like needles, but she accepts the need for injections and is not, as such, resistant to them.  Indeed, moments before I commenced this judgment, she told me that the visiting midwife had just taken blood samples from her with no problem. All forms of reasonable encouragement and persuasion can be used, as can light physical guidance, such as the midwife or nurse taking her by the arm to assist and encourage her into the vehicle.  </p>

In the latter eventuality, should it arise, the Official Solicitor has, herself, agreed and accepted that force and restraint could, if it became necessary, be used.  But she submits that, short of an actual current emergency, it is not justifiable or proportionate to use force or restraint for a pre-planned admission, however desirable such an admission might otherwise be.   </p>

Both psychiatrists have agreed that, if force is used, that may (this again is speculative) have a damaging psychological effect on this already agoraphobic person.  It may entrench her agoraphobia.  It may damage or impair her bonding with her baby. It may give her long-term flashbacks. It may compromise her attitude to future pregnancies, or her dealings with persons in authority.  On behalf of the Official Solicitor, Ms Sophia Roper submits that these are known risks from the use of force or restraint which outweigh the more speculative and statistical risks, if the mother goes into labour at home but may then require an urgent transfer to hospital.  </p>

The hospital trusts make clear that in no circumstances would so-called mechanical restraint be used.  There would be no handcuffs and  no straps or belts, apart from a necessary normal maternity safety belt in the vehicle.

The risk may be low, but that which is at risk could not be potentially more grave. The mother is very, very clear that she does not want that to happen. </p>

She contacted the hospital and travelled there with the support of her partner and mother and the community midwife. While still at home, she received 2mg of Lorazepam orally. Although initially resistant, she was guided by staff and her family into the ambulance and no restraint was required or used. A few hours later she was safely delivered of a healthy baby boy with a good birth weight. She returned home with the baby within the next day or two. </p>
