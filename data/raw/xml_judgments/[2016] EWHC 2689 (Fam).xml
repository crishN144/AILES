As between Stockton on Tees Borough Council ('the Local Authority') and the father ('the father') and the Children's Guardian, Sue Hyland, there is really no live issue.  They are agreed that pursuant to the Local Authority's Care Plan, the father will cooperate and engage conscientiously with the Local Authority over the next three or four months in the hope, that following closely identified work on parenting, he will be able to resume caring for the children.  </span></p>

She would ideally like to children to be in her care, although she realises that for reasons I will mention, she cannot realistically put herself forward at this stage as their carer.  She strongly disagrees that the children should ever have been placed in the father's care, as they were before November 2015, and she opposes them being placed in his care by the Local Authority under a care order.  She feels that if they cannot be with her, they should remain in foster care during their childhood.  She highlights in her statement and through Mr Burdon, her counsel, the more unsatisfactory aspects of the father's parenting and she particularly relies on the precipitating event in November 2015, when she asserts that the father lost his temper and lashed out at the third of the four children, causing him physical injuries.  </span></p>

These referrals, which were not always found to be justified, involved the children repeatedly suffering from head lice, W having very bad eczema, the children having a number of minor injuries, probably from poor supervision by the father, including in particular that on 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> November 2015, Y had a large scratch on his back thought to have been from fighting with Z; and lastly suggestions that the children were in not very clean clothing and were hungry.

Nonetheless, the children continued in the care of the father supported there by the Local Authority.  </span></p>

First, about mid-afternoon, he says that he accidentally slapped Y whilst the boys were playing and whilst he was trying to knock a Duplo brick out of Y's hand because he thought Y was about to throw it a Z.  The second event which occurred, according to the father, was that Y fell down the stairs at or after 5pm.  It is a curiosity that, when speaking of that fall down the stairs, that two of the children have dated it as happening the following morning.  I say this is 'a curiosity' and that has to be what it must remain, for it has not been possible to explore who is right about the date and, indeed, what the significance of the inconsistency might be.  From the father's point of view, he says that the children are not reliable on dates and have simply got the date wrong.  He is adamant that this fall was on the Sunday afternoon and not the Monday morning.  </span></p>

He concluded that the injury to the left of Y's face was an impact injury from an open hand and he gave the opinion that it was non-accidental.  He has since stated that it was 'a significant blow to the side of the head and Y was lucky not to sustain an intracranial injury', that is a brain injury.  As regards the bruise to the top of Y's head, Dr A gave the opinion that this was consistent with a fall and was probably an accidental injury.  As regards the injury to the Y's right inner thigh, Dr A originally was of the view that this was a hand print injury and non-accidental.  However, having been asked to consider the father's recent statement (in which the father speaks of a gripping of Y's thigh in fun and in play) Dr A gave the opinion that this could have been the mechanism which caused the injury.  He felt that if the father is telling the truth then he would describe that injury as an 'excessive accidental injury'; but if the court felt that Y was telling the truth (and Y has said that the father slapped him on the thigh), then Dr A's opinion would unchanged that this was non-accidental.  </span></p>

The Threshold Statement sets out various deficits in the father's parenting of the type which I have already mentioned: head lice, eczema, inadequate supervision, numerous minor injuries to the children, and generally the father struggling to manage particularly the boys' behaviour.  But more especially, paragraph 1 of the threshold asserts that the injuries to Y (and particularly the injuries to the left hand side of Y's face), had been caused by the father.  The father had to respond to that assertion and in so doing he said that he accepted Y had the various marks noted by Dr K but went on:</span></p>

If, on the other hand, the court was not satisfied that the injuries to Y were non accidental injuries (and therefore that those injuries are to be treated as accidental injuries), then the plans were for rehabilitation to the father following a package of work which the Local Authority intended do with him or cause him to do with other agencies.  </span></p>

The Children's Guardian supports that approach.  On the face of it, that might have meant that there was no need for any fact finding in this case, because if there were to be a care order (as seems inevitable), then nothing would turn on precisely what caused the injuries to Y, whether the cause was a genuine accident or some form of loss of temper, or something else.  </span></p>

It was, in effect, common ground that the other injuries did not merit investigation - in other words, that it would not be proportionate to investigate them - in particular given Dr A's view that, in principle, it may have been rough play (excessively rough play) which caused Y's thigh marks.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">So Mr Burdon puts the case in this way: that following those two lying and deceitful occasions when the father had denied being the cause of the injuries to Y's face he, the father, suddenly comes up five months later following Dr A's report, with the alternative explanation of having accidentally struck Y around the face whilst trying to stop Y throwing a brick.  Mr Burdon submits that this raises, in his expression, 'an index of suspicion'.  I accept that submission, namely that the father's failure to come forward sooner with what he now says happened raises very real suspicions about what happened.  It is right to say also that W has spoken of the father's anger and of his smashing things.  She and X have spoken of his flicking them, which he admits, although this was clearly in a completely different league from that which triggered these proceedings.  Y also told the authorities that the father had smacked him.  However, when weighing up what the children have said, it has to be noted that W attends at a school with a special provision unit and that Y has been referred to the CAMHS.  The mother herself agrees that she finds Y's behaviour challenging and it is for that reason that he is separated from his siblings in foster care.  There have been no ABE (Achieving Best Evidence) interviews with the children, perhaps because it was felt disproportionate.  It is clear to me that I cannot place pivotal reliance within the fact finding process on disputed things which the children have said.  </span></p>

He also explained what had happened from the witness box, when answering questions from Mr Mather.  He told me that he and the boys were playing with these Duplo bricks, which are bricks larger than Lego.  Y was kneeling, Z was sitting and he (the father) was crouching behind Z facing Y.  He told me that the two boys are very competitive and that if Y does not get what he wants, he is quite likely to lash out and throw a tantrum.  The father told me that these Duplo bricks are about six inches long and one and a half inches deep, made of hard plastic.  At one point during the game, the father told me that Y picked up one of the bricks left handedly and held it at the side of his head.  He demonstrated this and it would be exactly what a person would do if he was about to throw something.  He said that his reaction was to hit the brick out of Y's hand by way of 'a swipe' (his word).  He demonstrated this, swinging his right arm right across the front of his body from right to left.  However he said that just at that moment, Y moved his hand and his, the father's hand, hit Y's face open handedly on the left hand side of Y's head.  Y started to cry and the father cuddled him, reassuring him that it was an accident.  This crying lasted for up to five minutes.  </span></p>

Asked by Mr Mather why he had not told the truth earlier, the father told me that he had been too ashamed.  He said he felt horrible and disgusted with himself for what he had done.  It was Dr A's report which caused him to come forward with what he now says happened.  He said that he was frightened of being judged by other people and thought the professionals would regard him as a bad parent such that he might lose the children.  In answer to Mr Burdon, the father accepted that this was on any view 'a gross overuse of force', but he said that it was just a split second thing and that in hindsight, he must have used more force than he intended.  He accepted that there was a pinkening or slight reddening of Y's face immediately afterwards which he noticed when cuddling him.  Therefore, in answer to further questions from Mr Burdon, he accepted that he realised that the marks on the left hand side of Y's face had been caused by him (the father).  Following on from that, the father accepted in answer to Mr Burdon that he knew that what he was telling the police about the fall down stairs having been the explanation for the injuries, was untrue.</span></p>

That evidence comes from an assessment of the father completed on an unspecified date in February 2016 by [a senior family worker and a family worker].  They attended at the family home on occasions of the father's contact to the children on four occasions, twice in the morning between 7am and 9am and twice in the afternoon between 3pm and 6pm.  Mr Burdon says that this only amounts to a snapshot when the father was being closely watched and that it is not representative of how he would cope if he was on his own with the children all the time.  W at one point said words to the effect:  "Dad doesn't hit us, he just flicks our head with his fingers if we're naughty.  It only hurts for a second", being something I have already mentioned and being something which the father accepted in his evidence, saying that he sometimes did this if the children were naughty and sometimes as part of a game with them.  </span></p>

If that were to be case, then the court and the social workers and the Children's Guardian would still be nowhere near knowing the truth of what actually happened to this youngish boy and I would need some persuasion that rehabilitation should still be the care plan.  However, having seen and heard the father, and in spite of his lies and the false explanation of a fall, I have concluded that his eventual explanation is not a wholly invented one.  The father, as it seemed to me, had the demeanour in the witness box of one who was recounting facts of which he had been a part.  Further to that, he did make concessions against his own interests, for example, that the brick was only a light one and that Y cried for as long as five minutes.  I acknowledge that as in all things, I may be wrong in my conclusion and that this is necessarily a fallible process, but I do no find that the father has wholly invented what he now says happened as a cover for something else much more serious.  So, I find that there was some sort of incident with Y brandishing a brick in the terms broadly as the father has described and as he says he recalls it.  </span></p>

There is a range of possibilities from a loss of temper, or a wish to punish Y who may have been misbehaving, down to a benign intent of saving Z from perhaps being struck.  I would reject any suggestion having seen he father, and considering all the background as I have laid it out, that he wanted purposely to harm or hurt Y and I do not think that that has been put forward.  Nor do I consider that this was something in the nature of harsh punishment.  </span></p>

What the father was intending to do (as I am satisfied having seen and heard him) was, for want of a better word, to 'disarm' Y so as to stop him throwing the brick at Z, or hitting Z with it.  The way he did this was as he now accepts completely inappropriate and inept and actually, because of the force used, very dangerous.  Even if he had dislodged the brick, it would have hurt Y's hand or arm and there must have been a risk of his striking Z in the process.  There were many other better ways, as the father now recognises, whereby he could have restrained Y's arm and found some way of defusing the situation.  However, I accept that the father's reaction was a split second one even though it was a gross over reaction to what was happening.  It was in the words of Lord Justice Ryder 'an injury caused by an element of wrong involving recklessness'.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">One of the recommendations of the PAMS report was for a teaching course for the mother around independent living skills, which would teach her the skills and knowledge required to meet the children's basic needs on a daily basis and to parent them effectively.  I mention this because Mr Burdon's cross examination of social worker Miss L was on the basis that at the end of the summer 2016, there might be the possibility of what I will call a 'straight choice' as between the two parents.  In my judgment, it would be rather unkind to leave the mother thinking that that would be the situation.  The assessments of her show that she would have very real difficulties parenting these children.  She did not succeed following assessments in retaining V and she herself has had the insight to realise that for her to manage all four children in contact, even for the limited periods of time involved, has proved too difficult for her.  Nothing in relation to children is ever set in stone and everything is always reviewable; but I do urge the mother not to hold out major hopes that there is a real possibility of her being able to resume the care of the children in the foreseeable future.  I think it is right that I should say this in the hope of helping her come to terms with it.  </span></p>
