	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This judgment is given at the conclusion of a fact-finding hearing within wardship proceedings that commenced in May 2016. A finding of fact hearing was originally conducted before Keehan J in July 2018. The outcome of that process was the subject of appeal and, on 1 February 2019, the appeal was allowed with the result that all of the findings made by Keehan J were set aside and there was a direction for the matter to be reheard. I have now conducted that rehearing over the course of 9 days in July 2019. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The children&#8217;s parents [&#8216;the father&#8217; and &#8216;the mother&#8217;], who originate from Pakistan, were married in Pakistan in March 2001. It was an arranged marriage and the couple did not previously know each other. By that time the father was living in England. Pending receipt of a visa to enter the UK, the mother moved to live with the paternal family in Pakistan. In May 2002 the mother entered the UK and moved to the paternal family home in Rotherham. By that time, she was some months pregnant with her first child, A. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The overall context of these proceedings is that the mother has not seen any of the four children since February 2016 when they travelled with F from Pakistan to England. Her application before the court therefore seeks orders designed to reestablish contact, at least with the younger three children, and for her to be rehabilitated into their lives as their mother. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In relation to the factual dispute, in short, the entire history of life in this small family unit is in issue. The narrative given by the mother and that given by the father could not be more diametrically opposed; they disagree on almost every point that is raised. Whilst it is agreed that some specific events occurred on particular dates or at particular stages, for example trips to Pakistan or the children staying with various relatives, the accounts given of what took place on each of these occasions are wholly disputed. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Against that background, it is necessary for the court to avoid being drawn into determining every single disputed issue going back over more than 18 years. All parties agreed upon the need for a proportionate approach to the fact-finding exercise, with a firm eye being kept upon what might, or might not, be relevant to determining the ultimate welfare issues in the case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I do not propose to take time at this stage of this judgment in setting out a detailed chronology before turning to the evidence. Rather, I will deal with each of the key factual issues in turn as they arise in chronological order. It is therefore only necessary to identify the three overarching factual disputes, to which each of the more specific disputed events relates. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The first overarching issue is whether or not the mother, regularly, and, at times, two of her sisters, acted in a cruel and abusive manner towards the children. The children say that this was so. Latterly they complained about these matters to their father and he now believes them, although he saw no evidence of this himself at the time. The children&#8217;s account may be supported by a 9 second video clip taken by a paternal uncle in January 2007, the existence of which is said only to have been disclosed to the father in December 2017. The mother and the aunts firmly deny that any abusive behaviour occurred. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The second overarching issue is the manner in which the mother was treated by the paternal family throughout the marriage. On the mother&#8217;s account, her life was entirely controlled and dominated by the father and his family, particularly his mother. She describes being miserable and feeling wholly subordinated by the paternal family at all times.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In May 2012 the parents and the children went to Pakistan. Thereafter, on the mother&#8217;s account, she was excluded from the family home and from the life of the children. She claims to have had to live in a woman&#8217;s refuge for a period of 3 &#189; years. Her contact with the children was limited to visits to them at their school. In all other respects she says that she was prevented by the father and his family from having any relationship with her children. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The father&#8217;s account is wholly different. Whilst he agrees that the mother left the paternal family home in Pakistan, where the children were living, he says that this was an entirely voluntary act by the mother who simply abandoned the children and walked out of their lives. The children also give the same account of the mother&#8217;s absence from their lives. Their belief that she abandoned them is a source of immense anger to them and has led them to speak to her and about her in recent times in the most negative of terms. </p>

	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Arising out of this second overarching issue is the third, namely the assertion made by the mother that she went to Pakistan in May 2012 immediately following the death of her mother, so that the family could attend the funeral or other family gatherings following that sad event. She believed that she, the father and the children would all return to England after a month in Pakistan. She asserts that from that time the father kept her passport with the result that she could not return to England. Her immigration status was founded upon having &#8216;indefinite leave to remain&#8217; [&#8216;ILR&#8217;] which she acquired in 2003. ILR expires if the holder is out of the UK for more than 2 years. Thus, the mother&#8217;s ILR expired in May 2014.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Although the mother was able to obtain a fresh Pakistani passport for herself in July 2014, without current ILR she was unable to follow the children back to England when the father brought them here in February 2016. It is the mother&#8217;s case that she was therefore &#8216;stranded&#8217; in Pakistan and geographically separated from the children by the father&#8217;s deliberate actions.  </p>

As virtually every relevant asserted fact is challenged head-on by either the father or the mother, it has been necessary to set out their respective accounts, and those of the other witnesses in more detail than might normally be required. I have, however, also given a very full account of the evidence because I hope that either now or in due time each of the children will read the judgment and see the detailed account that it contains.  </p>

Yet, there is no other account of her assaulting the children other than the two occasions described by AH. The father, on the contrary, describes a happy home with the only problem being that A and W would be difficult and confront their mother if she required them to do something that they did not want to do, but he does not describe any occasion when she slapped or hit them throughout the years that they lived together. In short what is shown in the film, does not fit with what he says was the case. </p>

AH has given wholly inaccurate, yet firm, testimony at the earlier hearing as to the circumstances of the filming. As a result of my finding as to the overall motivation of the father and his family in excluding the mother from 2012 onwards, and his overall credibility, I am unable to put any reliance upon his and AH&#8217;s assertion that the voice is that of the mother.  </p>

She watched it immediately after she had been told of its existence. She watched it in the unfamiliar circumstances of her QC&#8217;s chambers in London on the eve before she was to give evidence in this court. She was, I was told, very upset by the experience and could not face seeing the film a second time. She has no recollection of any incident such as the one shown in the film; and this is the case despite now having seen it. Despite my acceptance that A does indeed believe that the film shows her mother, I am not, for the reasons that I have given, able to place sufficient weight on her belief in circumstances where so much else relating to this film and its setting simply does not fit. </p>

There must be a high degree of certainty that there was indeed an occasion when the mother claimed to have deliberately taken something toxic and this led the father to take her to hospital. Whether it was or was not rat poison is of limited importance, given the agreement between both parents that she claimed that it was &#8216;rat poison&#8217;. This incident is at odds with the father&#8217;s overall case that there were no problems in the marriage or in the wider family living in Rotherham during these years. For a mother of a young child to claim to have taken poison and for her husband to take this claim sufficiently seriously to take her to hospital is a strong indication that all was not well with her mental and emotional health at this time. </p>

The mother&#8217;s account of being wholly under the control of the father&#8217;s family gained significant support from RA&#8217;s description of the family dynamics to the effect that it was for the elders in his family to determine where the mother should be and that it was none of the business of anyone else. </p>

The visit occurred during Ramadan and he accepted that he had stayed and he had broken the fast with KB&#8217;s family. It was put to the father that B was asked if she wanted to go with him or stay and she said &#8216;stay&#8217;. His reply was that &#8216;nothing like this was discussed&#8217;.

The difficulties arise from the lack of documents, the language barrier and the poor video link. Whilst she is not a witness on whom a great deal of weight could be placed because of these factors, it is difficult to understand her involvement in the case if her evidence is not basically sound. The fact that she travelled all the way from Mirpur to Faisalabad [a distance of 290 km] to see the mother in the paternal home requires an explanation. Given her involvement in making that visit the prospect that she continued to be involved has some basis or context. It is also difficult to understand why she would put herself through the process of giving evidence in these proceedings, for the second time, if her account were not basically sound. She plainly did not welcome being a witness.  </p>

He continued to work 6 days per week with the father, yet, he says, neither he nor the father ever mentioned the topic of the children&#8217;s removal from the home. I find it impossible to accept that this is the truth. </p>

Once again, AH was unsatisfactory on this topic. In addition to being very guarded, he too changed his evidence from not being fully aware of any phone call, then not being able to recall if he was present, to finally giving a detailed account of W being cut off. </p>
