The child has not seen the Father since 11 June 2022 after the Mother unilaterally stopped contact, informing the Father of the same on 14 June 2022.  The Father had applied to the court, via a Form C100 filed on 1 June and issued on 7 June, for regular contact.  That application was listed for FHDRA at Slough Family Court on 8 August 2022.</span></p>

He ordered interim supervised contact and that the Mother should serve medical records relating to her mental health on the Father&#8217;s solicitors.  Mother appealed both those orders which were stayed by the High Court pending appeal, effectively ruling out supervised contact until the substantive fact-finding hearing.  On 13 June the fact-find was adjourned yet again due to lack of judicial availability and re-fixed for 8 August.  On 6 July the hearing was further adjourned to 9 October, as a result of application by the Mother, made and determined without notice to the Father, due to Mother&#8217;s counsel&#8217;s unavailability. </span></p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The Mother is represented by Dr Charlotte Proudman.  She seeks findings against the Father set out in her Schedule of Allegations, which Schedule is set out at p9 - 13 of the Bundle, together with Father&#8217;s responses.  The Schedule is more of a narrative, with Mother alleging under seven broad heads of abuse that she suffered coercion and control at the hands of the Father throughout their relationship, which comprised emotional, psychological and economic abuse.  There is one alleged specific incident of physical abuse of the Mother and one allegation of physical abuse of the child.  Under the heading &#8216;emotional and verbal abuse&#8217; Mother avers that the Father colluded with his family to criticise her weight and to subject her to racist abuse and pressure to convert to Islam.  Mother&#8217;s most serious assertions fall under the headline &#8216;Gaslighting&#8217;.  She avers that long before their child&#8217;s birth the Father manipulated her perception of reality such as she began to question her sanity, and that he then manipulated her into accepting a false diagnosis of psychosis and paranoia from a psychiatrist Dr H sometime in 2009.  Mother avers that the Father achieved the diagnosis through lying to the psychiatrist and says that once the Father had maliciously secured a false diagnosis of mental illness, he then used this to control her within the relationship, particularly after the child&#8217;s birth in 2013 and from 2019 when the relationship was struggling.  The Mother says that from 2019 - 2022 he would frequently threaten to use her documented but false mental health history to assert that she is an unfit Mother and to remove the child from Mother&#8217;s care.  Finally, she alleges post-separation economic and emotional abuse, and characterises the Father&#8217;s application for contact as part of a pattern in which he seeks on-going control over her.</span></p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The Father is represented by Hannah Markham KC.  He denies the Mother&#8217;s allegations.  He makes no cross-allegations and does not seek any findings against the Mother, but would rebut both the Mother&#8217;s specific allegations of physical, emotional, psychological and financial abuse and the over-arching allegation that he was coercive and controlling throughout the relationship or subsequently.  He says that his wife took against his family early on, with the antipathy increasing after the child&#8217;s birth and that he was caught in the cross-fire, trying to please his parents while supporting his wife.  He says that in the result neither the child nor the Mother have seen any of his family since 2018.  He denies racism and says that in fact it was the Mother who on occasion abused him racially, having settled upon a general contempt for Muslims as a result of falling out with his family.  With regard to the alleged &#8216;gaslighting&#8217; the Father refutes that he either sought or caused a diagnosis in his wife of psychosis, paranoia or any other mental illness.  He says that she told him that she had suffered intermittently with poor mental health before they met, and says that far from manipulating and using Mother&#8217;s mental illness against her, he tried at all times to support her through various mental health crises.  He says that he has never threatened to remove the child from the Mother&#8217;s care - on the basis of her mental health or otherwise &#8211; and, as the marital relationship was breaking down, has only ever sought reasonable contact, and to safeguard the child.</span></p>

Where there has been the odd heated exchange between counsel, that has reflected their focus and determination to protect their respective clients and promote their positions. When the court has the benefit, as I have, of highly competent advocacy on each side, the issues as they relate to the evidence are illuminated as the hearing progresses, and the task of determining those issues becomes more straightforward.  While the legal framework has been relatively uncontroversial, what was clear from the written and oral submissions in closing that I heard just before lunch, is that at the end of this fact-finding exercise the parties remain as polarised as at the beginning; the issues are therefore stark. I am grateful for the assistance of the advocates on the evidence; ultimately the assessment of the respective reliability of the witnesses and the proper inferences to be drawn from the evidence as a whole are for me to determine.</span></p>

It does not follow that just because a witness has given an inconsistent account it means that his or her evidence is untrue or unreliable.  Memory is affected in different ways.  Some people do remember things more clearly over time, others have difficulty in recalling events accurately.  For some, the passage of time may play tricks on or distort memories.  Although they disagree about the cause, both parties agree that during the latter part of their marriage and perhaps subsequently, the Mother has exhibited signs of trauma.  Whatever the cause, trauma has a well-established and increasingly well-understood effect on memory.  The repetition of stressful incidents has the potential to impair memory such that an individual subject to such repeated incidents may struggle both to take in and later to recall or particularise the details.  I must make careful assessment of this factor when drawing inferences from the evidence and reaching my conclusions about the facts.</span></p>

It is common experience that abusive relationships may last for a long time and that victims of abuse may struggle to remove themselves from such a situation. It is the experience of the courts that people who are in an abusive relationship may struggle to extricate themselves from it for a whole range of reasons including fear, shame, lack of resources, family responsibilities, cultural or societal concerns and/or their own conflicting emotions towards their abuser.  Further, their capacity to react to events may be compromised or blunted by their past experience or their mental or physical health. Where the abuse is not physical but psychological, emotional and/or financial, those subject to it may not even recognise themselves as victims of abuse, particularly where the behaviours develop over time.

Because the Mother has failed to abide the Orders of DJs King and Henson and is currently appealing the Order of HHJ Tolson KC this court cannot even discern with any certainty when these allegedly false diagnoses were made nor what they were.

He was able to consider his own behaviour where he had become embroiled in acrimonious and toxic exchanges with his wife, and accept that he had not always behaved as he would have liked to.  Unlike the Mother I felt that he was always trying to answer the questions he was asked, and truthfully.  I found him an impressive witness.  Notwithstanding the acrimony of the divorce, the severity of the allegations against him and the fact that he has not seen his child for nearly 18 months, he was able to reflect, and to sublimate his own needs in favour of those of his child. His answer to Dr Proudman&#8217;s question about the worry jar is indicative of that reflection and indicated to me that he has placed the child&#8217;s welfare ahead of his own, is well aware of the emotional damage caused through the acrimony between the parents and is at a loss as to how to protect the child.  I also infer from both his oral evidence and from his refusal in these proceedings to seek findings against the Mother that his focus is solely on the child; he wishes the Mother no ill-will; this is a man who just wants to first safe-guard and then spend time with his only child.</span></p>

My clear conclusion is that there was no gaslighting, no pattern of coercive or controlling behaviour on the part of the Father throughout the relationship; rather the Father found himself in a very difficult position and did all he could to support his wife through what must have been a very difficult number of years for both of them.

I do so shortly.  The Mother characterises the Father&#8217;s application for contact as him using her mental health against her to remove the child.  This is her consistent position through witness statements, pleadings and again in her evidence.  It is unfounded.  Apart from the word of the Mother, which for the reasons set out above I am reluctant to accept without supporting evidence, there is nothing in the papers before me that suggests that the Father has ever threatened to remove the child from the Mother&#8217;s care.  All of his emails to the Mother from November 2021 to the point that he issued proceedings concern his pleas for reasonable contact &#8211; that&#8217;s to say contact of more than two hours, not any form of &#8216;lives with&#8217; arrangement or Order.  Far from using her mental health against her, the Father told Social Services that while he had concerns about the Mother&#8217;s mental health and how that might impact on his contact with the child, he was not saying that she was not a safe carer.  He told me that once Social Services were involved he was happy to leave matters to their professional assessment.  He did.</span></p>

Further, unlike Social Services and other professionals involved in the child&#8217;s care, he had lived through his wife&#8217;s previously unstable and erratic behaviour, and was also trying to manage her sustained hostility towards him.</span></p>

That she had joint control over that single income stream is evidenced by her arranging the repayment and deciding to add interest by way of thank you.  Despite pleadings to the contrary, while the sole breadwinner during most the relationship was the Father, his income and bonuses were paid into a joint account that the Mother had full access to.  After the Father had left the family home the Mother took half of the money from the joint savings account and half from the joint current account &#8211; totalling around &#163;30,000.  She was eventually forced to concede that the Father had not complained about that, and had never stopped her access to money.

The Father said in evidence that he wished he had not responded by email to the Mother at all, but simply referred her email to his solicitor.  He said that he took the email as a deliberate taunt, but pointed out he was recovering from a serious neurological event and consequent brain surgery.  I can well see why he felt taunted and abused by Mother&#8217;s email, and I am surprised that his response to her is cited as evidence of his abuse.

Understandably and predictability, this Father with his Palestinian heritage saw this as a provocative and as a further deliberate rejection of his culture.

This is a vigilant Mother.  She researches, checks and rechecks any new activity, nanny, educational or therapeutic setting into which she enrols her child.  She is an educated woman with a family military background and has lived with a Palestinian Muslim for 15 years or more,  In that context and in the context of the family dynamic at the time, I find it highly unlikely that she did not do a basic internet search on Krav Maga on receipt of the flyer &#8211; if indeed she was genuinely unaware that it is a martial art well known to be the foundation of Israeli army training.  Furthermore, unlike other martial arts its aim is not to subdue an opponent, rather to kill him, or otherwise to do as much damage as possible as swiftly as possible.

Krav Maga is seemingly an odd choice for this Mother and this child.  In this specific evidential context it seems to me to be part of a pattern whereby the Mother seeks to exclude the Father and his culture wholly from the child&#8217;s life, and then to subtly or not so subtly emphasise that she is the one in control.  She is at once interfering with the time the child spends with the Father and at the same time proposing that she and the child sign up to a martial art and ethos that could not be more offensive to a displaced Palestinian.</span></p>

A phrase stated by the Father during his cross-examination as to his thoughts about the Mother had particular resonance with me, having seen the Mother give evidence and in the context of all the material before me: the Father said that in the Mother&#8217;s mind you are either with her or against her.  If you are with her you have to be with her 100%; you cannot question her.  He said this thoughtfully, and contextualised it by saying he felt that this was due to ill-health rather than malice.  It seems to me on the evidence that I have heard that the Mother determined that the Father was &#8216;against her&#8217; when he met up with his family on a visit to the UK in late October 2021 as evidenced within the text message thread at p830 &#8211; 846 spanning 6 Oct to 29 Oct: the clear abuser in this exchange over a number of days is the Mother.  The Father&#8217;s responses are proportionate, self-reflective and kind.  Ultimately he did not take the child to visit the grandparents since the Mother put so much emotional pressure on him not to that he felt that he could not.   As the marriage became increasingly acrimonious, she has sought to maintain control by isolating the Father from their child &#8211; and therefore isolating their child from the Father.</span></p>

Yes, the Father recorded the indirect contact when it started; he told me that this was because he felt he needed to safeguard himself from any false allegations from the Mother pertaining to indirect contact in light of the false allegations she consistently made about his conduct in, and the child&#8217;s reaction to, direct contact.  I can see why he felt it necessary to take this step.  The Father was possibly misguided, but this was safeguarding, not abuse.</span></p>

On 23 June 2022 Social Services determined that level 3 support was now required [p440] &#8211; an upgrade from level 2 which would enable social workers to speak again with the child.  Had this occurred the court would now have the benefit of hearing the child&#8217;s current views from an independent source.  The Father had been asking for this and was delighted to be informed this was the local authority view.  As an aside, I have yet to come across a perpetrator of domestic abuse who has so welcomed and actively sought Social Services investigation.</span></p>

At best this shows a failure to prioritise the child&#8217;s welfare over her work; at worst it demonstrates a determination to prevent the child&#8217;s voice being heard in these proceedings other than through the filter of the Mother.   If the Mother really had had undocumented telephone calls with the head of Social Services about the child&#8217;s allegations of abuse at the hands of her Father, then she would be welcoming increased support and investigation, not frustrating it.</span></p>

It may be relevant to the child&#8217;s welfare that the Mother has chosen to hide what seems to be a long-standing history on and off of mental illness, even when seeking to rely on the same to establish gaslighting at the hands of the Father.  It would also seem from the evidence of Mother&#8217;s interactions with third parties over many years that if she is not mentally unwell she may benefit from an anger management programme and or assessment in respect of possible personality disorder.</span></p>
