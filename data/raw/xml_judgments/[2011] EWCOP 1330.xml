	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The principal issue which I have had to determine in these proceedings is whether the circumstances in which a man who lacks capacity (whom I shall refer to as &#8220;P&#8221;) amount to a deprivation of liberty. This is, of course, a matter which commonly arises in cases under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. In this case, however, the court process has been seriously impeded by misconduct on the part of employees of the local authority. As a result, there are two further issues to be decided &#8211; first, whether the other parties to the proceedings should be awarded costs against the authority and, secondly, whether the court should authorise the publication of the name of the authority.</p>

There is, so far as I am aware, no requirement for counsel to prepare such a document under the rules, but it seems to me that in future all counsel should prepare such a document for a contested hearing, at least in the High Court.  As I have observed elsewhere in the context of proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, such a chronology is of very great assistance to the court.   In the event, I have taken this summary of  background from the papers that were filed in these proceedings, relying in particular on the summary of the history set out in the report prepared by Miss Dawn Whitaker, an independent social worker who was instructed to advise the court in circumstances that I shall relate below.</p>

He was born with cerebral palsy and Down&#8217;s Syndrome and has a history of cerebral vascular accidents.  He presents with significant physical and learning disabilities.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P lived with his mother (&#8220;M&#8221;) from birth until 2009.  A care package was provided by the local authority for a brief period in 2000, but this was quickly discontinued by M.  However, P has for many years attended a local day service on five days a week and in addition received respite care for a total of about eight weeks a year.  In December 2008, M&#8217;s health began to deteriorate and the package of respite care was increased.  M&#8217;s health continued to deteriorate to the point where the local authority concluded that she was no longer able to care for her son.  In May 2009, therefore, P was taken into emergency respite care.  On 18 June 2009, a best interests meeting (to which the family were invited but did not attend) unanimously concluded that it would be in P&#8217;s best interests to reside in a care setting.  On the following day, the local authority filed an application in the Court of Protection under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  On the same day, a District Judge sitting at the Archway Tower court gave directions in those proceedings.  After a number of other interim direction orders, the matter came before His Honour Judge Allweis in Manchester on 4 September.  On that occasion, the learned judge declared &#8220;on an interim basis&#8221; that </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November 2009, P moved to live at another establishment, which I shall call &#8220;Z House&#8221;, where he has remained to this day.  The independent social worker, Ms Whitaker describes Z House as &#8220;a large and spacious single-level bungalow&#8221; in which &#8220;the facilities generally are modern and cosy with a pleasant atmosphere.&#8221;  P has his own room that has been personalised to his needs and access to two nearby adapted bathrooms.  Z House can accommodate up to four residents at any time.  The normal staffing ratio during the day amounts to two staff for all four residents.  In addition, however, P receives additional one-to-one close personal supervision during the daytime.  P continues to attend the day centre five days a week, leaving Z House at 9.30 in the morning and returning at 5.00 in the evening.  Until recently, P did not receive one-to-one supervision at the day centre but, following increased concerns about managing risk, that level of supervision has recently been introduced.  At night, there is one &#8220;waking&#8221; member of staff available at Z House during the night, shared across two adjacent properties.  The scheme operates a duty officer system whereby senior support workers are available to give advice to in-house support workers.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence clearly demonstrates that the standard of care P has received at Z House has been generally good.  As a result of his disability, he needs a high level of care.  He can move for short distances without support, but in order to mobilise further he requires the use of a wheelchair.  His difficulty in mobilising means that he is at risk of falling, particularly in situations where he may find it difficult to maintain his balance.  He requires prompting and assistance with all activities of daily living, including mobility, nutrition, eating, personal hygiene and continence.  He has no teeth and therefore requires a soft food diet.  A speech and language therapist has recently diagnosed a problem with his swallowing reflex which, coupled with his absence of teeth, presents a risk of choking.  Regular bathing is essential for P not only as a means to ensure personal hygiene but also as a method by which to obtain and improve his skin integrity as he has long term chronic dermatological problems.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although P has no expressive speech, he makes sounds which people who know him well are able to understand.  Care staff told Miss Whitaker that P is able to follow simple speech and conversation and to respond to straightforward questions either by making sounds or through gesture.  Miss Whitaker stresses that it is essential that a specialist communication profile for P is developed as part of his support plan, based on continued speech and language therapy assessment.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Continence management has been a longstanding and significant problem for P.  Miss Whitaker describes how this received an inconsistent approach prior to his being received into the care of the local authority.  It seems that, whilst living at the family home, he did not wear any continence pads.  M&#8217;s practice was to allow him to be naked in the home environment, despite his double incontinence.   P has a long history of pulling at his continence pads and as a result they become shredded and torn. Of greater concern is the fact that P has developed a habit of putting the pieces of padding in his mouth and on occasions ingesting them.  On occasions this has included the faecal contents of the pads.  In addition to the obvious hygiene risk involved, there is, in P&#8217;s case, the added danger of choking.  </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This aspect of P&#8217;s behaviour has caused particular difficulty to those entrusted with his care.  A variety of techniques have been identified to tackle the problem, including monitoring his behaviour in order to ascertain the risk factors; structured toileting arrangements throughout the day to reduce the need to use pads; positive reinforcement strategies to promote improved behaviour; the use of specialist underwear; continence advice; and verbal redirection techniques.  In addition, inevitably, care staff have sometimes had to resort to physical intervention.  On occasions, P has &#8220;stored&#8221; pieces of incontinence pad and faeces in the roof of his mouth.  In order to remove this material, two members of staff have had to use what is known as a &#8220;finger sweep&#8221; method, which I understand to involve inserting a finger into his mouth to check for and remove any such material.  According to Miss Whitaker, &#8220;the two-to-one staffing is necessary for one person to open P&#8217;s fist to hold and clean his hand to prevent him smearing it over himself or others, while the other person takes action to remove and refresh his pad and clothes.&#8221;  Miss Whitaker goes on to describe how P will attempt to fight against staff during these interventions.  She also states: &#8220;despite implementation of the preventative strategies described, and use of close proximity one-to-one staffing, it is evident that P continues to pull at his continence pads and succeeds in tearing bits off, and accessing its contents, resulting in his putting it in his mouth and ingesting it&#8221;.  </p>

	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Recently, as described by Miss Whitaker, the staff at Z House have adopted a new approach, involving P wearing an all in one body suit sewn up at the front, to prevent his hands touching his groin area, the only access being via a zip at the back.   To date, this had proved a successful way of managing his behaviour, although it is clear that there remains a risk that he will manage to revert to his behaviour at some point. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P has a long history of challenging behaviour.  On occasions, he appears uncooperative by, for instance, sitting on the floor and refusing to move.  He also, on occasions, strips off his clothes and throws things.  The records of Z House and the day centre contain numerous examples of these types of behaviour.  In addition, P has a habit of self-harming by scratching at his neck, chest and arm, and occasional smearing faeces.  On occasions, he has assaulted others by pulling, pinching, grabbing and scratching.  Again, there are many examples of this behaviour on the records of Z House and the day centre.  P&#8217;s challenging behaviour has been a long standing aspect of his life.  As long ago as 1995, it was suggested that this behaviour was a method of communication.  It is a principal reason for the close one-to one supervision which is provided for him at all waking times.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the evidence suggests that P&#8217;s care and treatment at Z House has generally been of a high quality, there have been concerns about the management of some of his more extreme behaviours.  The Official Solicitor, who had been appointed to act as his litigation friend in these proceedings, became concerned that more restrictive measures would sometimes be needed to deal with such behaviours, and that those measures would necessarily involve a significant element of physical intervention and restraint which might amount to a deprivation of his liberty within the meaning of article 5 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  The local authority, however, took a different view, contending that the level of physical intervention involved amounted merely to a restriction on, rather than a deprivation of, liberty.  As a result of this dispute, the proceedings were transferred to be heard by a judge of the High Court and listed before me in Manchester in July 2010.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was originally envisaged that the hearing would consist of legal argument based on contested written evidence filed by the local authority.  Shortly before the hearing, however, the advocates were alerted to the fact that the evidence filed by the local authority did not give a full picture of the degree of physical intervention that appeared to be involved in caring for P.  In particular, there was no mention in the evidence of two specific incidents that had occurred in April and July 2010, of which one had required P to be taken to hospital.  </p>

The court was therefore asked to extend the interim order and declaration that it was in P&#8217;s best interests to reside at Z House.  Prior to making that order, the court received brief oral evidence from one witness, A, a senior support worker at Z House.  The focus of the questioning was directed at the issue of physical intervention.  A described in more detail steps taken by staff to prevent P putting incontinence pads in his mouth.  She described how the staff adopted measures of diverting P as a first step and only resorted to physical intervention, or restraint, as a last resort.  Asked by me how often it was necessary to take physical action to restrain P for one reason or another, A responded &#8220;probably a couple of times over the course of a month&#8221;.  She described in more detail an incident which had occurred in April 2010 when P, unbeknown to staff members, had ingested a piece of incontinence pad and as a result his airway had become obstructed leading to his attendance at hospital.  </p>

There appears to have been a great deal of confusion in this case on all sides regarding the issue of restraint.  Such confusion seems to have stemmed from the use of language regarding that issue: In particular, whether the local authority has &#8220;no restraint policy&#8221; or whether it has &#8220;a no restraint policy&#8221;.  As you know the use of proportionate restraint is lawful under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> in respect of someone lacking capacity and the common law permits the emergency use of restraint in respect of those with capacity.  The local authority&#8217;s policy entitled &#8220;Guidance to Staff on Violence in the Work Place&#8221; was published on 8 October 2002.  This sets out preventative measures and procedures to be followed when staff are faced with potentially violent situations.  These include situations where the violence is imminent as well as the situations defined in an individual&#8217;s risk assessments and intervention plans. Appendix 2 to the  policy is the &#8220;Guidance on the use of restricted physical interventions&#8221; published by the Department of Health and Department for Education and Skills in September 2002 which defines the full range of restrictive physical interventions and gives guidance on their use.  The policy is not specific to the setting of supported living.&#8221;</p>

She based that recommendation upon consideration of what she described as &#8220;a well-documented body of evidence &#8211; one that demonstrates how, notwithstanding the significant amount of restrictive practice outlined within this report, P continues to present a significant risk of harm to himself and others.&#8221;  Her recommendations included specific proposals concerning the use of physical restraint and other restrictive measures.  She endorsed the use of an all-in-one body suit which had been introduced after her instruction, but warned that the suit might not be suitable in all circumstances, particularly warm weather, and that use of physical intervention was &#8220;highly likely&#8221; when P was not using the body suit.  </p>

Miss Whitaker attended to give evidence.  Cross-examined by Mr Allen on behalf of the local authority, she said that it was still early days to say if the body suit was an effective way of managing the risk arising from P&#8217;s behaviour with his continence pads.  She remained concerned about how suitable it would be in hot weather bearing in mind P&#8217;s chronic skin condition.  Miss Whitaker reiterated the concerns that, whereas there was little if any evidence from the documents that P was receiving physical intervention, it was quite clear from talking to people on the ground that this was happening.  Particular concern arose when P put his soiled fingers in his mouth.   Miss Whitaker described in evidence how, if this happened, one person wearing protective clothing opened his mouth and carried out a two-finger sweep across the roof of his mouth to remove the contents.  It was suggested to her that this amounted to first aid.  Miss Whitaker retorted that, whilst this might be how the general public might regard it, in her view, and in the view of those working in the sector, it would be recognised as physical restraint.  </p>

In addition, she expressed the view that the local authority needed to commission an accredited training programme for those working with P for physical intervention so as to give staff real confidence in managing the problem as opposed to merely responding to situations as and when they arose.  She assessed that the training needed to be practical rather than theoretical.  She expressed the view that it was not fair to P for this not to be set out expressly in the care plan bearing in mind that, if he choked on a pad, it could be life-threatening.  Miss Whitaker also told the court that, in her opinion, recordkeeping at Z House was &#8220;generally poor&#8221;.  There had been some improvement but it was still not satisfactory.  In addition, she thought there needed to be more regular discussion about P&#8217;s case at staff handovers.

It was clear, however, that it would not be possible to complete this process during the hearing, and I therefore reluctantly agreed to adjourn the matter for a further period of two months for this process to be completed.  I made an order extending the existing declarations as to capacity and that it was lawful for P to continue to reside at Z House.  I gave further directions for the adjourned hearing, including a direction that a full copy of the disciplinary investigation report concerning A and the other employees should be served on the respondents in a form that was unredacted, save for detail of the employees&#8217; employment history and disciplinary records and any legal advice given to the local authority.</p>

By the time of the hearing before me on 4 April, many of the outstanding issues had been resolved, but, as set out in the position statement filed by Mr Joseph O&#8217;Brien on behalf of M, there were three matters outstanding of some importance.  Eventually, however, all of those issues were also resolved by further amendment of the care plan, with some assistance from the court.  In particular, the part of the plan dealing with behaviour intervention was substantially re-amended to deal with the problems that might arise if P has accessed his continence pad and as a result has either parts of the padding and/or faeces in his hands.  The final version of the plan reads as follows:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Using protective clothing, one staff member is to hold P&#8217;s hand and ask him to open his hand.  If P is uncooperative, one member of staff must open his fist, remove the contents and clean his hand, to prevent him from throwing, smearing or ingesting it.  The second member of staff should ask, coax and direct in assisting P to change his pads/clothing and freshen up.  In the highly unlikely circumstance that P does not cooperate, depending on the circumstances, the members of staff will have to decide whether this needs to be done (a) in a location where the incident has arisen or (b) in another location.  If it is decided that another location will be preferable (such as a bathroom or lavatory) the member of staff will have to establish whether P is willing to go to that location, and if not, whether restraint should be used to achieve that end.  The decision whether a change of location is required, and, if so, whether restraint is necessary to achieve it should be taken having regard to (a) the risk of harm to P (b) the risk of harm to others, including members of staff, and (c) P&#8217;s dignity and personal autonomy.&#8221;</p>

In the statement, H acknowledges that &#8220;it is clear that staff did not have guidance about the use of restraint.  At the last hearing the local authority indicated it would consider the introduction of an explicit physical intervention policy.  A new policy has now been drafted and will be presented at the Departmental Management Team for ratification on 28 March.&#8221;  The draft policy entitled &#8220;Supporting People with Challenging Behaviour including Physical Intervention Policy Standards&#8221; is appended to H&#8217;s statement.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Sadly, this case has had a detrimental impact on those working at Z House as support staff seem to think that physical restraint is somehow &#8220;a bad thing&#8221; that should be avoided.  This in part is due to a confusion of language between the Court and care staff. They perceive physical intervention as an action to prevent someone from hurting themselves or others as part of the wider care and support plan.  The Court seems to me to define it more broadly as any hands on care.  The staff have all been trained in personal care routines in safeguarding, and moving and handling training, and I would want to reassure the Court that despite staff having a heightened sense of anxiety they continue to meet P&#8217;s needs in a professional and respectful manner.  One of the key lessons learnt is that the local authority needs to ensure that those working with incapacitated adults presented with challenging behaviour are reassured that a proportion of restraint is perfectly lawful. The legal terms &#8220;deprivation of liberty&#8221; and &#8220;restraint&#8221; unfortunately invoke negative connotations in lay minds when they are intended to promote a person&#8217;s best interests&#8230; I want the court, however,  to be reassured that all staff working with such service users will receive training in the new&#8230; policy.  To this end, the council has agreed to employ an appropriate external trainer to provide practical training in the new policy.&#8221;</p>

Specific issues are managed, as in P&#8217;s case via the risk assessment process.  Whilst full risk assessments and action plans will remain important, the clear gap re a lack of guidance to staff re physical intervention will now be closed through the new policy.&#8221;</p>

In view of the history and complexities of this case, however, it is acknowledged by all parties and accepted by the Court that, whatever decision I reach on the issue of deprivation versus restriction of liberty (as to which, see below) it is right that there should be a further review by way of oral hearing conducted by the court later this year.  At that hearing, the court will determine, inter alia, the frequency of future Court reviews.  </p>

I have considered all the authorities cited with some care, but do not think it necessary to refer to them further.  Clearly, all these cases turn on their own facts.

Mr Allen draws on this comparison in support of his contention that the court must follow the principle &#8220;he who asserts must prove&#8221;.  Specifically, he submits that &#8220;as it is the other parties (i.e. the Official Solicitor, on behalf of P, and M) who assert that Article 5 was engaged, it is for them to prove that the circumstances amount to a deprivation, rather than a restriction on liberty&#8221;.  He goes on to argue that the requisite standard of proof is the balance of probabilities, and that &#8220;the more serious allegation or its consequences if proven, be stronger must be the evidence to satisfy the balance of probabilities&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This argument is robustly rejected by Mr O&#8217;Brien on behalf of M, supported by Mr Burrows on behalf of the Official Solicitor.  Mr O&#8217;Brien describes Mr Allen&#8217;s submission on this point as &#8220;misconceived&#8221;.  He argues that the Court of Protection is exercising a protective jurisdiction in relation to incapable adults and submits that, whilst rebutting the presumption of capacity must be on the balance of probability, no such burden or standard is provided for in relation to best interests decisions.  The question of best interests is primarily an enquiry by the courts, weighing into the balance various factors.  No party is under a burden of proof; rather the court, after investigating best interests, decides that issue on a balance of probability.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I unhesitatingly accept Mr O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s submission on this point and reject Mr Allen&#8217;s contention.  The processes of the Court of Protection are essentially inquisitorial rather than adversarial.  In other words, the ambit of the litigation is determined, not by the parties, but by the court, because the function of the court is not to determine in a disinterested way a dispute brought to it by the parties, but rather, to engage in a process of assessing whether an adult is lacking in capacity, and if so, making decisions about his welfare that are in his best interests.  It may be that one party or another asserts a fact which, if in dispute, must be proved, to the requisite standards of the balance of probabilities, but the question of whether or not the circumstances as a whole amount to a deprivation of liberty is not one which falls to be determined by application of a burden or standard of proof.   </p>

In my judgment, it is almost inevitable that, even after he has been supplied with a bodysuit, P will on occasions gain access to his pads and seek to ingest pieces of padding and faeces in a manner that will call for urgent and firm intervention. Those actions will be in his best interests and therefore justifiable, but they will, as a matter of concrete fact and legal principle, involve a deprivation of his liberty. The reason for attaching that label to those actions is not to stigmatise either P or his hard-working and dedicated carers, but so that all involved with his care recognise the implications of what is happening. </p>

That requires a regular reassessment of his circumstances, to see if there are alternative strategies that can be adopted that meet his needs without involving actions that would limit the impact on his liberty. The bodysuit is one example of such a strategy. Another example would be an intensive programme of education trying to teach and encourage P not to behave in ways that require restraint. </p>

The rules about costs must be applied fairly to all litigants, regardless of who they are.  In this case, all the costs of litigation will be borne by the public purse.  The Legal Services Commission is an equally hard-pressed public agency and the Commission &#8211; and the taxpayers who fund it &#8211; are entitled to look to the Court to apply the costs rules impartially and ensure that there is a level playing field.  Gone are the days when it is appropriate for a court to dismiss applications for costs on the basis that it all comes out of the same pot.  Such an approach would undermine confidence in the courts and distort public administration and accountability &#8230;. Of course, it is right that the Court should follow the general rule where appropriate.  Parties should be free to bring personal welfare issues to the Court of Protection without fear of a costs sanction.  Local authorities and others who carry out their work professionally have no reason to fear that a costs order will be made.  The submission that local authorities will be discouraged from making applications to the Court of Protection if a costs order is made in this case is a thoroughly bad argument.  The opposite is, in fact, the truth.  It is only local authorities who break the law, or who are guilty of misconduct that falls within the meaning of rule 159, that have reason to fear a costs order.  Local authorities who do their job properly and abide by the law have nothing to fear.  In particular, the Court of Protection recognises that professional work in this very difficult field often involves very difficult judgments and decisions.  The Court is not going to impose a costs burden on a local authority simply because hindsight demonstrates that it got those judgments wrong.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, Mr. Burrows submits that the local authority should be ordered to pay a large part of the costs of this action as a result of its conduct. He contends that the local authority has &#8220;systematically failed to be candid with the Official Solicitor and the Court in relation to the critical issue of restraint&#8221;. He rightly points out that one of its employees misled the Court under oath. In addition, he points to the fact that the local authority resisted the joint instruction of an independent social worker on the grounds that such an instruction was unnecessary, yet, once the Court had allowed the instruction of Miss Whittaker, who subsequently provided a comprehensive report, the authority eventually adopted her recommendations in their entirety, although only after a series of court hearings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of M, Mr. O&#8217;Brien reiterated those points. He further submitted that the hearing on 29th July was due to be the final hearing of the issue as to whether P&#8217;s circumstances amounted to a deprivation of liberty. In the event, that hearing could not go ahead because of the local authority&#8217;s failure to disclose relevant documents. In his written submissions, he went on to contend that &#8220;the events subsequent to that hearing, where records were destroyed and new records compiled, were unquestionably an attempt to prevent proper scrutiny of the care plan &#8230; and an attempt to blunt the role of the Court, the Official Solicitor and [M] in that process&#8221;. In oral submissions, Mr. O&#8217;Brien put it even higher, submitting that it was &#8220;almost impossible to imagine a case of more serious misconduct&#8221; and that the tampering with the records was &#8220;unquestionably an act intended to pervert the course of justice&#8221;. The discovery of the tampering of the records led to extra costs being incurred in the investigation of the chain of events. Endorsing Mr. Burrows&#8217; arguments about the local authority&#8217;s attitude to the instruction of Miss Whittaker, Mr. O&#8217;Brien portrayed the local authority as having to be &#8220;dragged kicking and screaming&#8221; to a position where it eventually accepted her recommendations, and incorporated them in the final care plan. </p>

He resisted the application that the local authority should bear any other part of the Respondents&#8217; costs. He submitted that the local authority ensured due process by initiating these proceedings and that it was always sensible for the complex care package to be authorised by the \court. He acknowledged that the local authority realised that there was more work to be done with regard to the policy concerning the use of restraint, but pointed to H&#8217;s recent statement as evidence that this issue was being tackled. In all the circumstances, he submitted that the local authority&#8217;s conduct was not such as to warrant a costs order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, this is a case where the Court is required to depart from the general rule about costs in proceedings concerning personal welfare, having regard to the conduct and role of the local authority in this case. Whilst I do not, with respect to Mr. O&#8217;Brien, agree that it is &#8220;almost impossible to imagine a case of more serious misconduct&#8221;, I do accept that the misconduct of the local authority&#8217;s employees in tampering with the records was serious. The local authority&#8217;s failure to disclose some relevant documents, followed by the attempt to interfere with those records, unquestionably lengthened the proceedings. I accept Mr. Allen&#8217;s point that a hearing would have been required to enable the Court to scrutinise the care plan, and consider whether the circumstances amounted to a deprivation of liberty. Although the Respondents have &#8220;won&#8221; on the latter issue, I do not consider it right that costs should follow that event. The issue of deprivation of liberty is a complex issue. The local authority&#8217;s decision to contest that issue was not, in my judgment, unreasonable, in particular having regard to the decision of Parker J at first instance in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re MIG and MEG </span>(supra). But overall the proceedings were rendered significantly more complex, time-consuming and costly as a result of the actions of the local authority and its employees. It is impossible to put a precise value on the extra costs incurred, since one can never know exactly how the case would have proceeded but for the local authority&#8217;s misconduct, but I am satisfied that a substantial proportion of the overall costs of the proceedings are attributable to that misconduct and its consequences.</p>

Accordingly the reality is that, provided good reason appears, the court will then assess all the relevant considerations and make a balanced, fact-specific judgment whether the specific authorisation should be granted. In other words, before the court makes an order under [rule 91], a two stage process is required; the first involves deciding whether there is "good reason" to make an order under rule &#8230; 91(2) &#8230; ; if there is, then the second stage is to decide whether the requisite balancing exercise justifies the making of the order.&#8221;</p>

It is further agreed that, when making an order authorising publication, the Court should, pursuant to rule 91(2)(a), impose restrictions on the publication of the identity of P or M.

He concludes that &#8220;it is the authority&#8217;s position that, due to the details which have been disclosed in the judgment as presently drafted either being unique to P or characteristic of a very small number of male service users in the [local] area, there is a significant risk that members of the public who see P in the community could identify him. This is a concern for the authority, because of the very sensitive and personal nature of P&#8217;s described behaviour &#8230;. The authority has a duty to P and his family, in particular his mother &#8230; to maintain his right to privacy and confidentiality &#8230;. In addition, there is also a risk that staff who have previously supported P &#8230;. and are no longer in the employment of the authority may know that the judgment related to P, given the amount of detail contained in the document, and the authority has no control over any actions they may take in relation to making that information public.&#8221;</p>

(2) The naming of the local authority in itself is not a matter that affects P&#8217;s best interests, provided his anonymity is preserved. (3) Consequently, the Official Solicitor is neutral on the issue - he neither applies for the local authority to be named, but neither does he object. He adds, however that it is unlikely that members of the general public casually observing P in the street will conclude that he is the person mentioned in this judgment. It is possible that some members of the public who have read the judgment may observe that P has some of the features of the person described in the judgment, but it will not be readily apparent whether or not he has all the features so described. </p>
