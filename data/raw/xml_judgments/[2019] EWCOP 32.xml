	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0in">This is an extempore judgment.  Over four days in June 2018, Cohen J heard several applications concerning CDM, a 64-year-old lady, concerning her capacity to make decisions about her residence and care.  It is necessary to read that judgment reported at [2018] EWCOP EWHC 1668, before this.  At the conclusion of the hearing, Cohen J, having heard evidence from Dr Series, a social worker and CDM herself, concluded inter alia that:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0in">As part of Cohen J&#8217;s order and continuing case management, he gave permission to the parties to instruct a jointly-instructed second expert to report on the triggers which could cause CDM to lack capacity to make decisions about her diabetes management, i.e. as to when and why her capacity would fluctuate.  As a result, Dr Alison Beck, consultant clinical forensic psychologist, was instructed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0in">The Official Solicitor sought to have the decision made by Cohen J reviewed by the Court of Appeal on a number of grounds.  Essentially, however, permission was only given on one, concerning the finding of fluctuating capacity.  That is to say, about the interpretation and management of her fluctuating capacity, because there might be an argument that the evidence possibly was deficient in those circumstances. </p>

It being remitted back for primary determination, since the Court considered that the very issue of CDM&#8217;s capacity to make decisions about the management of her diabetic care was not before them on an evidential basis judicially considered.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0in">CDM is a 64-year-old woman with a personality disorder with components of different types.  Dr Beck, to whom I have already referred, concludes that CDM has an emotionally unstable paranoid histrionic and dependant personality disorder.  CDM also suffers from a number of physical health conditions, including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and unstable diabetes, which has led for instance to her having a below-the-knee amputation.   </p>

Insulin is administered, I think, twice a day by the district nurse team, but CDM has a history of declining insulin, or claiming she had already had it; generally, she is compliant in the administration of the insulin, but not compliant in relation to other forms of medication.  The management of her healthcare has, certainly more recently, been increasingly very difficult. </p>

Since 1986 she has lived in a bungalow on a secure tenancy, she lived there with her husband who also was severely disabled before his death in 2014.  It is obvious that CDM was devoted to her husband.  The fact that she has spent upwards of 30 years in a home with her husband is one of the reasons why it has such importance to her, reasons which are easy to understand, and why she wishes to return to live there now. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0in">The couple had no children but did have a number of animals including three small dogs and a cat, who remain of central importance to CDM.  Those issues, about the animals, have been crucial to CDM&#8217;s well-being, indeed her very existence, and that has finally been reflected in the care provided, whilst one of the dogs cannot live with her (because its given to ante social behaviour), two do.  The cat, I think, is at the moment in a cattery, because it cannot live with the other dogs in the home. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0in">It appears that following the death of CDM&#8217;s husband in 2014, a package of care was provided to CDM in her own home.  Including the twice daily administration of insulin to which I have referred.  However, the home conditions have deteriorated markedly, CDM is now described as living in squalid conditions, as well as failing to comply with the management of her diabetes.   </p>

Most of those admissions appear to be related to her diabetes, although one is in relation to a fall.  CDM is obviously an individual with strong views.  She may have different ideas about her hygiene to many, but not such as to previously cause a major issue in this case, or in her care.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0in">CDM has been described as not just difficult but, on occasions, oppositional and downright awkward.  She does not readily take to professional advice, preferring to manage her disabilities and her diabetes in the way that she had done over the years.  That is to say, her own way.  That has put her in conflict with professionals, but results in her also making, what others may consider to be, unwise decisions.  That has been the picture now for many years.  Such a pattern will be familiar to many healthcare professionals doing their very best on a daily basis for people who need attention and care.  The professionals involved in CDM&#8217;s care know her, know her well, and they have each done their very best to provide optimal care for her. </p>

At the best interests meeting held on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of September 2017, it was determined that it was in CDM&#8217;s best interests to be discharged from hospital into residential care and not to return to her own home, despite her strongly expressed wish to do so.  She was therefore discharged to a dementia nursing home.  CDM objected in the strongest possible terms.  And so the Court of Protection proceedings were instigated. </p>

Her ketone levels were high; her blood sugar was unrecordably high, and the carers were understandably worried, and stumped with what to do.  An ambulance had been called the previous day but had not taken her to hospital because of the assessment of her &#8220;capacity&#8221;; overnight CDM had notably deteriorated and looked extremely unwell. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0in">There were inevitably so many mixed messages and confusions.  The care staff at the home had been advised that they should not be calling the ambulance service, if she refused to go to hospital, despite the fact that she did seem worried about it.  She was then in fact taken to hospital, where she was treated but remained on the ward for some considerable time.  It was concluded that she should not return to the care home as it was no longer safe for her to do so.  Therefore, she has been medically fit for discharge for some time, but there is no agreement as to the place of her discharge.</p>

So, in the context of diabetes, for example, if you ate something, it was in the context of what you had eaten before, and what you were likely to eat in the future, and in that exampled context, CDM simply did not understand, at any level, that some foods might lower her blood glucose levels, and further, she did not understand the information, or weigh it in relation to those foods or factors that might increase it. </p>

So that for the notion of specific decision-making, there were so many elements, all of which fluctuated over time and were or might be related, and where each was a multi-factorial.

At one level CDM understands what the issues may be, but at every other level did not.

CDM might be angry and shouting.  She might be agitated.  She might be abusive and rude.  She might make statements which were not objectively verifiable.  She might acquiesce to something and then change her mind.  She might issue paranoid statements or say very unusual things.  But equally, a real probability is that even when she does not appear emotionally dysregulated, that does not mean that she is not emotionally dysregulated.  Effectively, it is quite impossible to tell at what stage and to what extent she was emotionally dysregulated, and in what way it would be possible to take that into account.   </p>

Whereas the submissions made on behalf of the Official Solicitor may have a beguilingly logical attraction, in my view it is simply not open, nor necessary to be to drawn into the many wider examples or parallels which were suggested.  For example, when somebody is treated for cancer.  Each treatment has to be looked at in its own individual context as opposed to a global context.  CDM is unique, her position is self-evidently unique, to her. </p>

No two people self-evidently are ever the same, their condition the same condition, or the circumstances the same.  The elements in relation to CDM&#8217;s own particular conditions are unique to her. CDM has diabetes which is not unique to her, being shared with many other millions of people in the United Kingdom, but as an individual the factors are unique.   </p>
