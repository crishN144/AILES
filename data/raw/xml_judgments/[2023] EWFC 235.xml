On 6 October 2023, DJ Sterlini sitting at the County Court at Clerkenwell and Shoreditch, ordered the Husband to give the Wife possession of Flat 5A on or before 20 October 2023, and gave judgment in the sum of &#163;1.1 million (the &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold">DJ Sterlini order</span>&#8217;).

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Notwithstanding the concession made by his predecessor, Mr Ken Collins, Counsel now instructed for the Husband, submitted that the order for the Lump Sum in the present case fell within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/26/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref>(dd), and thus the court had a statutory jurisdiction to vary it. I consider that argument to be plainly wrong. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/26/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref>(dd) was introduced by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/26" uk:canonical="1995 c. 26" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Pensions Act 1995</ref>, and amended by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/30" uk:canonical="2008 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Pensions Act 2008</ref>. It does not apply to all lump sums, but only to those lump sums which include provision in respect of pension rights or pension compensation rights under one of the three identified sections of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>. Contrary to Mr Collins&#8217; submission, I do not agree that the language &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">which includes provision&#8230;</span>&#8221; is intended merely to provide examples illustrating the breadth of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/26/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref>(dd); on the contrary, I regard the language as limiting, restricting the application of that section to those lump sum order which make such provision. To hold otherwise, and to find, as Mr Collins argues, that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/26/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref>(dd) applies to all lump sum orders, would be inconsistent with both the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Hamilton v Hamilton</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/12" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 12" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 12</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] Fam 292" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] Fam 292</ref> at [39], and with the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Birch v Birch</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2017/53" uk:canonical="[2017] UKSC 53" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] UKSC 53</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] 1 WLR 2959" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] 1 WLR 2959</ref> at [26].</p>

A delay of two years is not &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">slight</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">modest</span>&#8221;. To grant such a delay so undermines the principle of finality, that it does go to the heart of the Roberts J order &#8211; irrespective of whether or not the Wife is receiving periodical payments in the meantime, and irrespective of whether or not the Wife has any immediate need for the unpaid Lump Sum. The Lump Sum is not the last of the payments due under the Roberts J order (there remains, for example, ongoing payments for the benefit of the child of the marriage, until she completes full-time tertiary education), but nonetheless the Variation Application, if successful, would significantly hinder the Wife&#8217;s ability to put the dispute behind her, both financially and emotionally.</p>

At the risk of over-simplifying the Husband&#8217;s argument, he is hoping to extend the date for payment of the Lump Sum, so that he can contend in the County Court that the debt secured by the mortgage is not yet due. He says that, as a matter of contractual interpretation, the obligation under the mortgage to pay &#163;1.1 million is to be construed as an obligation to pay the Lump Sum on the date in the Roberts J order &#8211; such that, if the date for payment in the Roberts J order were extended, the obligation under the mortgage would be extended to like extent. I express no view whatsoever on the merits of such an argument, which is a matter for the County Court where the possession proceedings are being heard. But I do not consider that it is improper for the Husband to seek an extension of time to pay the Lump Sum in the hope of enabling such an argument to be run.</p>

The Husband is (or, was until 2020) a Name at Lloyd&#8217;s and, as explained in two letters from his Members&#8217; Agent, one of the syndicates of which he is a member has been unable to close its year of account, due to potential exposure to COVID claims subject to court proceedings. Until the syndicate in question can close its 2020 year of account &#8211; which will at earliest be June 2024, but may be later &#8211; the Husband cannot withdraw the sums held there, which are currently worth approximately &#163;1.06 million, a little less than the Lump Sum.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, the Husband has known since December 2018 that his obligation to pay the Lump Sum would fall due in June 2023. Since then, the Husband has, as he explains in his evidence, taken commercial risks, including lending significant sums (in excess of the amount of the Lump Sum) to companies of which he is the 100% shareholder pursuant to loan agreements of July 2020, May 2021 and June 2021. In submissions, it was argued that this was not &#8216;new&#8217; money, just an agreement not to call in existing loans, but that too seems to me to be a decision involving commercial risk. It was also argued that the Husband was bound to risk this money, in order to meet his obligations under the Roberts J order, but I do not accept that submission: this was a choice the Husband made, preferring to take the risk over other options available to him (including, indeed, marketing Flat 5A for sale). Further, although the Husband&#8217;s evidence is that he ceased underwriting in 2020 &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">in readiness to be able to have funds released to be able to make payment</span>&#8221; to the Wife, the Husband took a commercial risk in not ceasing underwriting earlier: it is not unknown for Lloyd&#8217;s syndicates to make losses, or for underwriting years to remain open for longer than the expected three years, and if, as he says, the Husband decided to cease underwriting in 2020 so as to release funds to pay the Lump Sum, he necessarily took a risk that such losses or delays would occur in the present case.</p>

I disagree: under the Roberts J order, by consent, the Lump Sum was secured by a mortgage, and the parties, who both had the benefit of legal advice, would have understood the implications of this. In any event, Mr Collins also submits that if Flat 5A were to be sold then &#8211; after payment of the Lump Sum and other commercial debts charged on the property, plus litigation costs, interest, and costs of sale &#8211; the Husband would be left with a housing fund of around &#163;2.5 million. While that would no doubt leave the Husband in a property which is less desirable than Flat 5A, that is not the same as homelessness and is, as I have observed, the consequence of his own commercial decisions.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Husband argues that the Wife does not need the money, and so would not be prejudiced by an extension of time. However, in circumstances where the Husband will not himself be left impecunious, that seems to me to be beside the point. A lack of finality, at some ongoing legal and emotional cost, constitutes prejudice, whether or not the Wife has an immediate need for the money that is due to her. I also consider it relevant this regard that the ongoing uncertainty visited on the Wife would not even have the silver lining that June 2025 would certainly be the end of the matter. The reason the Husband is unable to withdraw money from his Lloyd&#8217;s account is precisely because the money there may be needed to meet claims. So, when the year of account does close, there may be less &#8211; perhaps, significantly less &#8211; available to pay the Lump Sum than there is now.</p>

At the hearing this morning, the Husband made an open offer to pay &#163;1.1 million to the Wife in February 2024, in full and final settlement, but I do not consider that this offer (which was refused) assists his application: if anything, it begs the question why the Husband did not take steps sooner to engage with his obligations under the Roberts J order.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">In May 2023, the Civil Justice Council published a report on costs, which considered (among other matters) the question of guideline hourly rates. It recorded that the majority of the respondents took the view that guideline hourly rates had a useful role as a starting point for both summary and detailed assessment, and in indicating to the market generally the rates that would be considered reasonable by the courts. Commercial Court judges considered that the use of these rates also send a helpful message to court users that expenditure must be proportionate. There was no real appetite among respondents to abandon guideline hourly rates. On 1 December 2023, it was announced that the Master of the Rolls has accepted the recommendations of the Civil Justice Council, and revised hourly rates, uplifted for inflation, will apply from 1 January 2024.</p>

It seems to me that, strictly speaking, the guideline rates do not apply in the Family Court: the &#8216;Guide to the Summary Assessment of Costs&#8217; is promulgated by the Master of the Rolls, and does not form part of those Civil Procedure Rules which, by FPR 28.2, apply to family proceedings, nor part of the Practice Directions supplementing those rules.
