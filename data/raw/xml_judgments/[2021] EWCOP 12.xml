	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">On 8 January 2021, at his request and in advance of this hearing, I had a remote meeting by way of judicial visit with ZK, along with his solicitor, carers from the sign-language provider (SLP) and his intermediary, Ms De La Croix. ZK is not deaf but he is unable to understand aural language. He is certainly not unable to express his feelings. With the benefits of learning a non-aural language, ZK has developed a curiosity and inquisitiveness which is matched by his appetite to communicate with others including, on that occasion, me. He seemed to me to derive great pleasure from communicating and to enjoy the company of those who were with him.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">ZK&#8217;s communication was, on the face of it, hard work for him. It consists of a combination of methods: he signed (using British Sign Language- BSL); he used a pen on paper to write messages- he is literate. He occasionally referred to the screen of his mobile phone, where he would display a relevant image. All of this was relayed to me by his intermediary and a signer. When I met him I wondered how frustrating it must be to have to go through all that just to communicate. On  reflection, however, I realise that for someone who for many years, before he was introduced to sign-language, was unable to communicate very effectively at all, this process is intensely liberating.  </p>

This view was shared by everyone who knows ZK and has known him for some time, except his family. In evidence given by HM, ZK&#8217;s nephew, he was unable to see the improvement in his uncle&#8217;s ability to communicate, his engagement with others or his happiness. I do not think HM was being wilfully blind or churlish in what he said. I am quite sure that he and the rest of ZK&#8217;s core family genuinely believe him to be unchanging, entirely incapable of anything but the most basic communication, and that he will remain the same in the future. </p>

He did not wish his mother or family to have notice of his move. The Local Authority conducted a best interests meeting on 11 September 2020, having assessed ZK as lacking the capacity to make the decision. The decision was to move him out. In his evidence, HM described the shock and sadness it caused to the family when, on the day of the &#8220;removal&#8221;,  ZK just did not return from his community activities. I can understand that, and I can also see how that has caused ill-feeling towards the local authority and SLP, and its personification, the Managing Director, (MD).  </p>

There is clear evidence that ZK wanted to move from his mother&#8217;s house and into a supported arrangement of some sort. He was assessed as being incapable of making that decision and a best interests decision was made. Consultation with, and notification to, the family would have been ideal as well as compliant with the provisions (and philosophy) of the MCA. However, there were good reasons why that could not and did not happen in this case. </p>

I would add that the issue of capacity, which is not simple in this case, is to be considered by a jointly instructed expert and the Court will determine the matter at a future hearing. There have been a number of declarations of incapacity on the various decisionmaking areas on the present evidence. Although capacity is a foundational matter which goes to the heart of the jurisdiction of this Court, I have not been asked to consider the issue at this stage pending the report of the joint expert. That is the right approach in this case. I proceed on the basis that the statutory presumption of capacity is displaced by the present evidence and that I have the jurisdiction to make best interests declarations on ZK&#8217;s behalf, subject to the provisions of the MCA. The issue of capacity will be considered again once the expert reports. Capacity is a subject in this case that requires serious consideration and scrutiny in view of ZK&#8217;s progress. </p>

The rest of the day is what is described as &#8220;background&#8221; care, i.e. there is always someone present to assist ZK if he needs it. He is able to enjoy activities in the community, engaging with other people who are able to communicate using BSL. In the home, he also benefits from immersion in BSL, which has enabled him to develop skills around the house. ZK is particularly talented with his use of information technology, and he enjoys this immensely. When I spoke to him his major complaint about Placement 1 was that its WiFi was not working, although I understand it has subsequently been fixed. </p>

There is a contact schedule in place that is designed to ensure that family contact is not used inappropriately in order to pressurise ZK into making choices he does not wish to make. For instance, it was not denied that on occasions the family had sent him footage of his mother crying- the narrative being that she cries persistently since he left and he ought to return. Another alleged example was the day before the hearing, when it was claimed that, during contact, disparaging remarks had been made against an uncle who has kept in touch with ZK but who appears not be in favour with the mainstream of the family.   </p>

The family&#8217;s position suffers from being unclear, not well thought through, and lacking in the specifics needed for a care plan. That criticism is not intended to be damning. The family are ordinary people wanting to do what they think is best for their relative. The Court would not expect their expression of love and care to be couched in the language of social work. However, on a number of occasions prior to the hearing, opportunity was given for HM to engage with social care professionals with a view to creating a robust and workable care plan. He expressed the wish not to be subject to a carer&#8217;s assessment. Up until the hearing, the position was that SLP should not be involved in ZK&#8217;s care and certainly not in the family home. That later changed to them being involved in his care outside the home, but only if the MD was not involved in his care at all. Finally, I think, the position was that input in the home would be accepted if it was in accordance with ZK&#8217;s own wishes. </p>

On other occasions, outlined in the evidence, he has said to those caring for him that he wishes to stay independent at Placement 1, moving on to Placement 2 when possible. He has been very consistent in that latter view throughout the many attendances upon him by his Solicitor. He was also clear in his view when I spoke to him on 8 January 2021.

As I have already said, I simply do not accept that ZK was unlawfully removed from his family. An assessment was made of his capacity to make that decision and he was found to be lacking. The Local Authority, with statutory responsibility for ZK&#8217;s social care then had to decide what was in his best interests. ZK&#8217;s clearly expressed wishes and feelings were given considerable weight alongside the other factors outlined in the evidence. They then had to decide whether and if so, how they would put into effect what they decided was in his best interests- namely, to leave his mother&#8217;s home. In the circumstances as I see them, from the evidence, their actions were entirely in keeping with the MCA. There was </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">Where Ms Jackson is right is where she identifies the removal as being the cause of a lack of trust on the part of the family towards the statutory body and SLP. However, the law here is clear. Where a decision has to be made about care arrangements for a person who is unable to make a choice for himself, that decision must be made in <span style="font-weight:bold">his</span> best interests. It is plain to me that, objectively viewed, ZK benefits hugely from his engagement with SLP. It is also clear to me that he enjoys that engagement. It would be a significant blow to him if he were suddenly spending considerably less time with the carers and support workers than he presently does. This is not just about recreation or even learning a language. To ZK it is obvious that BSL is the way in which he has been able to engage with and participate in the world. His inquisitiveness, humour and the way he behaves underline the sheer excitement he derives from the world. That should come as no surprise since that was promptly removed from him by his disorder when he was a young child, the MD drew the analogy with a 3-yearold, learning about the world and endlessly asking &#8220;why? why? why?&#8221; to every new puzzle that experience brings. That seems to me to be an accurate and useful comparison. </p>

Mr Justice Hedley considered how Article 8 of the European Convention was relevant to the interpretation of the role of the Court of Protection when making best interests decisions about residence. A person is entitled to family life unless the deprivation of family life can be justified under Article 8(2). In that case, the person at the centre wanted to go home. Hedley, J. thought the starting point in that case was &#8220;why should [P] not go home?&#8221; As I read the judgment, what Hedley, J was doing was to formulate the question he had to answer in that case, on its facts, in a simple and straightforward way. In this case, the situation is very different. ZK has been enabled to leave his family home, at his own request in order to have a more independent life, and he expresses clear wishes to remain where he is. To formulate the question as Ms Jackson suggests serves no practical purpose. To regard it as a legal presumption in this case would be entirely wrong. With regard to Article 8 of the convention, ZK has a right not an obligation to have a family life.  </p>
