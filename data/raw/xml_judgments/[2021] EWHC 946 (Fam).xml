K&#8217;s father, AC (&#8220;the father&#8221;), has applied for an order for K&#8217;s immediate return to the USA under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The father, a USA national, lives in the USA and is a police officer. K currently lives with his mother, NC (&#8220;the mother&#8221;), in the north-east of England. The mother is a British national, and works for a software company. K is a dual national of both the USA and the UK.  </p>

K was consequently born in England, and his birth was registered there.

The mother says they returned in February 2018, when K was nearly 14 months old. The father says they first returned when K was nine months old, but that the mother then took K back to England when he was 18 months old and remained there until after his second birthday. I have not found it necessary to resolve this dispute. In any event, the parties resumed living together in the USA with K at some point between late 2017 and early 2019.  </p>

On that occasion the agreement was approved by the court, as, no doubt, was the mother&#8217;s application for a divorce. On 18 February 2020, the order reflecting those decisions (&#8220;the USA order&#8221;) was issued. This granted the mother the absolute divorce she had sought.

However, the quarantine obligations put in place because of Covid19 meant that it was impossible for K to spend a full six-week period with the father, as it would have resulted in K missing the start of his first year at school in September 2020 while he was in quarantine following his return to England. (K was due to start at primary school in April 2020, but as a result of the school closures during the pandemic he in fact started there in September 2020.) The mother therefore suggested that K should spend a two-week period in the USA, but that was not acceptable to the father.  </p>

He alleged that the mother had violated the USA order, and sought full custody of K. The mother responded to those petitions on 24 November 2020 and a settlement conference took place in State A on 11 February 2021. The proceedings in State A are ongoing. I asked the father to explain to me what was the jurisdictional foundation for the proceedings in State A given that, as I shall explain below, by October 2020, K was habitually resident in England and Wales, and had been for a long time. The father was not able to answer my question. </p>

Habitual residence of a child is not fixed but may change according to the circumstances of the parent or other principal carer with whom the child lives and who is lawfully exercising rights of custody. It may change within months or even weeks: see <span style="font-style:italic;color:#333335">In re F.

When her mother came to England and was allowed to bring G with her, G's habitual residence changed to that of her mother and consequently she became habitually resident in this jurisdiction before the potential breach of access rights was known. If G were in the future to be wrongfully removed from England an application to the contracting state to which she was taken would be to return her to England as the state in which she was habitually resident before the wrongful removal. Canada would not be the country to which she would be returned. Equally on an application in respect of rights of access the relevant jurisdiction under Article 4 is the English court and not the Canadian court. The effect of the order of Judge Nevins is to transfer the primary control by a court over the child from Ontario to England and to put the English court in the driving seat.&#8221; </p>

The concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he loses his old one. Simple analogies are best: consider a seesaw. As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up will probably come the child's roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it.&#8221; And at [46]: </p>

Its origination in the nation&#8217;s highest court indicates strongly that it should be used by me in my analysis.  In the motion of a see-saw there is a moment when the point of equilibrium is passed. The motion of the see-saw can be fast or slow. The speed of the players depends on the length of the seesaw, the mass at each end, and the upward propulsive force. But whatever the speed, the point of equilibrium will be passed.

It is sufficient for me to find as a fact that it changed well before Easter 2020. This was a planned, agreed, relocation from the USA to England. When the mother and K left on 27 January 2020 they severed all their links with the USA leaving in place only those necessary to give effect to the spending-time provisions in favour of the father in the agreement. They returned to this country, where arrangements had been put in place for their long-term permanent residence. Applying Lord Wilson&#8217;s criteria in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>at [46], it is my judgment that the detailed pre-planning, including the obtaining of all consents required by the law for a permanent relocation, indicates that the requisite degree of integration in England was reached very quickly, and well before Easter 2020.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">It seems to me that the father&#8217;s true complaint is that he is being denied what the Convention refers to as rights of access. Article 21 of the Convention requires state parties to facilitate the enjoyment of that right. It is an administrative obligation to afford a domestic remedy, which in this jurisdiction would be the right to have heard an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re G </span>at 229 per Hoffmann LJ. However, and crucially, while the Convention recognises rights of access, it offers no return remedy for a breach of those rights: <span style="font-style:italic">Abbott v Abbott </span> 560 US 1 (2010), per Kennedy J at 5.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The hearing before me was conducted remotely using Microsoft Teams, and the father was able to participate from the USA. He chose to represent himself, having fired the solicitors and counsel granted to him free of charge on non-means-tested legal aid. In my discussion with him I offered to treat his application under the Convention as having been made pursuant to Article 21 to secure effective rights of access. I explained, however, that this could not entail a return order but would instead be treated as a domestic application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> which would be heard, in the normal way, in the Central Family Court. The father showed no interest in this process. It was therefore not pursued further. </p>
