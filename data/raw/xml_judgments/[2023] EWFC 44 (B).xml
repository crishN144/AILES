However, the starting point should always focus on the evidence of the key participants, here the parents. Extraneous evidence can then be brought into consideration in the light of their evidence. The Court is essentially looking at internal consistency of the evidence and also the extent to which the evidence is consistent with other known facts or evidence. It is within this context that the Court will reflect on the inherent probability of what is being said to have happened. The Court will consider the manner in which the party gave evidence but will apply caution bearing in mind that a fact find hearing is not intended to be a &#8216;beauty contest&#8217; and there is the potential for an honest witness to give evidence in a hesitant or problematic manner whereas a dishonest witness may give fluid but dishonest evidence.</span></p>

I have received statements from the parties and disclosure from CAFCASS, the school and Children services. I have some police disclosure and significant medical disclosure with respect to the initial attendance at hospital in November 2021.

In the course of her upset the child is said to have been asked what was wrong and pointed at her father before pointing at the door and saying &#8216;monster&#8217;. The mother then reported the child going to the father and being cuddled with the father allegedly saying, &#8216;sorry baby&#8217;. The father entirely disputed this account. It is agreed there was no explicit allegations made on that day. As to the &#8216;monster&#8217; suggestion the father did give some evidence as to the mother talking about there being a spirit in the hallway.</span></p>

The mother describes the child being needy and clingy over those days and avoiding the toilet on 17 November 2021. The mother reports the father calling on 17 November 2021 and asking if the child was &#8216;OK&#8217; on two occasions. This was said to be unusual behaviour on his part.

She checked the child and noticed an abrasion on her vulva/labia like a carpet burn. She also noticed some blood in the area. She asked how this happened and if she had fallen whereupon the child said, &#8216;daddy did it&#8217;. The child confirmed this when further asked. Following a discussion with a friend over the phone the mother took the child to hospital. The father was unaware of this process. As I understood the mother&#8217;s evidence the child did not give a report beyond her father having &#8216;done it&#8217;.</span></p>

On that occasion the child had reported that her father &#8216;did it&#8217; but then denied this was the case and said she had fallen. This was not reported to the police/hospital/social services in the initial process as the mother felt she was not being believed and so &#8216;shut down&#8217;. In addition, the mother told me, for the first time, that she regularly carried out &#8216;spot checks&#8217; when she was examined the child&#8217;s body for injuries. I was somewhat surprised by this, and the inference was that the mother was checking to guard against physical and perhaps sexual abuse.

In her written evidence the mother disputes the social workers report of the mother confirming the child had - whilst in the bath - reported her father had &#8216;touched her noonie&#8217;. This is the word it is agreed the child uses to refer to her vulva area. Instead, the mother relates a hospital report which appears to suggest the child told the staff at the hospital about this. My understanding of the mother&#8217;s evidence is of no detail being told to her as to what &#8216;daddy did&#8217;. However, this appears to conflict with the medical history taken [</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">D194</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">] in which the mother is reported as saying the child repeatedly said &#8216;he put his fingers&#8217;.

In fact, the identity of the individual is redacted but taking all the documents together it seems clear this is the father. It appears she was asked if an object was used, and she denied this.

Such abuse by its very nature is likely to occur when the individual is on their own with the child or if in company with liked minded individuals. It is improbable that such actions would take place in plain sight of other individuals who would be likely to object or take action to prevent the behaviour.</span></p>

The risk would be of her crying or making a declaration stating what the father had done.

Equally I was concerned as to her disproportionate response to the father not being an &#8216;active parent&#8217; (a point which he does not accept) by attempting to cut him out from communication with the nursery. I was left with the sense there was an underlying level of negativity towards him on the part of the mother prior to any allegations being made.</span></p>

The mother argues in asking whether the child was &#8216;ok&#8217; twice this signals his understanding that he had done something to her. However, and as I pointed out to the mother it is far more likely that the father asked a second time because the mother did not in fact give an answer as to how the child was feeling following her dental appointment. In her first reply she only indicated the procedure had gone okay. But even then the mother could not see there was a different and logical way to read the communications. This does suggest she is willing to see the least favourable interpretation for the father even when this requires her to stretch interpretation to breaking point.</span></p>

The evidence of random checks on her daughter required a justification which was not given. Of course, all parents will be mindful of their children suffering harm, but I found it difficult to understand why it was that the mother was actively behaving in this way without evidence of actual injuries. It is difficult to understand what the child might have made of this process, how it was presented to her or how it might have caused her to subsequently act or speak. I note subsequent reporting to the school of injuries suffered and blamed on third party children. My reading of the school notes is that they felt these concerns were not justified. The impression is of an overly anxious parent. The danger is that this anxiety may be transferred to the child (whether intended or not) and may have the potential to skew reporting.</span></p>

I did not find the mother&#8217;s evidence as to &#8216;shutting down&#8217; easy to accept. In reality she was taking her daughter to hospital to investigate concerns. In the initial stages I can see no basis for forming the view her concerns were not being taken seriously. I cannot understand why at that time she did not mention the earlier marks in October 2021. They were proximate in time and plainly relevant to any complaint. To a lesser extent I do not understand why the other matters raised with the CAFCASS Officer months later were not discussed given the heart of the complaint was a concern and uncertainty as to what the father had done. I could see the force in the suggestion made to the mother that the case has developed in line with the case management of the proceedings with the Court determining there is limited evidence only for the mother to make further reports. There is an active question as to whether the mother has developed the allegations to support her case.</span></p>

		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In the case of the father, I have the difficulty that almost of the mother&#8217;s reporting is entirely denied as happening. As such there are no subtle conflicts on which I can carry out a forensic analysis. I was a little cautious in accepting his evidence of a complete denial of all the complaints. Objectively a number of the points raised by the mother might have been adequately explained whilst broadly accepting the mother&#8217;s case. In the case of the documentary, it seemed to me entirely possible that the father might have promoted the mother watching the same without this suggesting improper motive on his behalf. This was a documentary on a mainstream provider, and I can assume it was appropriate. It would not be wrong for a parent to suggest to another parent that they might want to watch the same. There is no suggestion the father pressed the point when the mother chose not to view the programme. Yet the father entirely denied the same. In the case of the toilet contact again it is entirely plausible that a young female child might follow a male parent into a toilet and be curious as to the anatomical differences between her father and herself/her mother. It is very easy to imagine a child innocently grabbing at the father or attempting to touch him. The child would have no sense of particular privacy associated with her father&#8217;s intimate parts. Yet again the father denied the same. For my part there was very little in this allegation (if accepted) that could really have led to a negative finding against the father. My worry was that the father might be denying such matters out of a fear that others might see it as being supportive of the more serious allegations made against him. I could make a similar point as to the &#8216;hello sexy&#8217; observation. Generally, the father gave evidence in what appeared to be a genuine manner. But I am wary as to whether he has to an extent shaped his evidence in the way I describe above. Of course, this might be indicative of an attempt to protect himself rather than to hide the truth of himself as abuser.</span></p>

At best it seems to me if established they might provide a limited level of support for the more serious allegation. Of course, a parent who is sexualising a young child may have a sexual motive. However, albeit denied it is possible for parents to choose language poorly and such words may not be indicative of sexualisation. It is noteworthy these words were said to be used openly and in the presence of the mother. Further it seems they did not continue for any material period of time even if proven. In the case of the toilet incident the child followed the father to the toilet, and it is alleged touched at the father rather than the other way around. There is no evidence of encouragement on his part, and he told the mother what had happened when asked. This does not give a sense of a secret act carried out in an abusive manner in the absence of the mother. As to the documentary it is quite difficult to draw anything meaningful beyond pure speculation even if established.</span></p>

On their own they do not tell a sufficiently clear story on which to build a case. For my part this position appears clear and compelling. The Court is more than familiar with certain injuries to this part of the body which may be suggestive or strongly suggestive of improper touching /penetration. However here the marks may be readily associated with a range of possibilities short of abuse.</span></p>

Another is that in cleaning after toileting a little too much force or effort was used, again leading to irritation of the skin surface. In this regard I note the evidence of the child being able to self-toilet on occasions. A third possibility might relate to sensitivity to detergents with consequential scratching/rubbing and abrasion. All of the above may lead to innocent rubbing and abrasion.</span></p>

I have to question to what extent this process may have left her more likely to identify her father on the second occasion and stick to this whether or not it was true. On the evidence it is far from clear the child could at any point see the marks in question (they are obviously somewhat obscured by their relative positioning on the child&#8217;s body), and I am left to wonder as to the possibility of the child associating the questions in November with the questioning in October. Might she have been referring back to the earlier occasion and referencing the cause then as being the cause in November. All of this is highly relevant but has now been lost in the mists of time given the manner in which it all came to light. I have heard no evidence or accounts or meetings in October or the potential for an innocent explanation relating to that time period.</span></p>

I reach this conclusion in the light of the medical documents which point to the mother as the source of the information. It is common sense and logical that the mother would have enquired what &#8216;daddy did&#8217; if she was told &#8216;daddy did it&#8217; and that if so this would be part of the history given to the hospital. For obvious reasons the likely first history would be taken from the mother rather than the child.

In my assessment the possible likely reasons would be because the mother understands what happened during this period was such as to undermine the allegation (which she believes in) or more worryingly because she understands the information has been exaggerated on her part and is unwilling to accept the same. Otherwise, it would be the simplest thing to have agreed that the child told her this and she told the hospital. Of course, it may seem to appear more credible if coming firstly from the child to a professional.</span></p>

I have also borne in mind my assessment of the mother being overly sensitive to risks (see the random checks). I have been left with the real concern that the child is directly responding to what she perceives as the mother&#8217;s fears rather than any particular desire on her part to inform the mother as to what is happening or not happening. At face value the child has become close to fixated on updating the mother as to a lack of inappropriate touching. This may be because she is aware the mother is worried. Support for this comes from the professional reporting which indicates the child is inappropriately aware of the mother&#8217;s feelings. It may be to ensure contact (which is observed as being positive) continues despite the mother&#8217;s worries. In this regard the child would be seeking to confirm there is nothing for mother to worry about. Of course, it is entirely possible the mother has simply made enquiries of the child and simply reported the response. Of course, if this is the case then the child will have internalised a sense of risk around the father, and this will have likely coloured her responses.</span></p>

Given the nature of the allegation and the dating to Autumn 2021 I am most doubtful the child would be so repetitively repeating this point unless there was some outside input. I am not satisfied these reports in fact support the material allegation. Furthermore, my concerns are such that I consider they undermine any weight that can be placed upon the child&#8217;s communications with both the CAFCASS Officer and the social worker in September 2022. There are very good reasons why there are firm rules around obtaining evidence from children. A common concern is that a child&#8217;s account may be deliberately or inadvertently contaminated by interaction with a third party discussing the same. This is why an early account is sought. Delay will often undermine the probative value of the account. In this case I consider it highly likely there has been ongoing conversation on this topic during the period in question. </span></p>

I consider it likely her questioning at this point was far more focused, likely leading and from the perspective of believing the worst. In my assessment a confirmatory response from the child would have been readily identified and adopted by the mother however ambiguous it was. I consider by the time the mother attended hospital with the child there was an understood narrative in place which was that the marks were caused by &#8216;daddy&#8217; and in some way he had &#8216;touched the child with his finger&#8217;. I have reached the conclusion the limited response of the child at hospital simply parroted this account.

She additionally viewed the father negatively in general terms. On balance I accept some level of marking was seen in both October and November. I am reluctant to form a clear assessment of the October marking on the evidence I have but will accept there was some reddening. I accept the mother questioned the child and I doubt this was unusual. I am doubtful the child would have had a clear understanding of what she was being asked to talk about and her mixed answer which may have included reference to the father was not reliable information for my purposes. However, whilst it did not cause the mother to act (and this is good evidence as to the limited probative value of the marks) it entered her consciousness. In November the child was effectively placed in a position where it was both natural and likely she would return to her father as cause in similar circumstances. She knows her mother has a negative attitude to him, and he was an easy person to latch onto and particularly so given the previous occasion. I consider thereafter the whole matter has effectively &#8216;snow balled&#8217; led by the mother&#8217;s worries rather than the reality of events. I consider the child was likely led by her mother and supplied an answer that fitted with the questions. This was then reported to the hospital and noted by them </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">but</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> only confirmed by the child when again led either by the doctor (November 2021) or the social worker (in September 2022). Post-hospital the mother closed her eyes to other potentials such as UTI but a narrative of abuse was fixed and the child&#8217;s repeated observations both fed and justified the narrative.</span></p>

My assessment in this regard will of course now be shaped by her response to this judgment. Having now had the case fully examined I expect her to work with these findings. If she nonetheless continues to hold to her narrative then an issue may arise as to whether she has other motives.</span></p>
