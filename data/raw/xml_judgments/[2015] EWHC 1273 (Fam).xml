He Started working as Finance Director for a group of companies called the TS Group (&#8220;TS&#8221;) in 1993.  TS is a private family company owned by or on behalf of the M family.  In 1993 EM was running the company.  He was succeeded as Managing Director by his son PM, on a gradual basis between 2002 and 2007.  The company is involved in property development.  One of its more significant investments was in Europe, called Z Centre. </p>

On 26th March 2010 the Husband received a joint interest in 192 shares held by PM in a company.  This was under a Joint Ownership Equity scheme (&#8220;JOE&#8221;).  It appears that EM had previously promised a number of employees involved in the European project, but not including the Husband, that when TS's interests in that project was realised they would benefit.  The Husband persuaded PM that he should also be rewarded in some way.  This led to him receiving the joint interest to which I have just referred. </p>

The company overdraft has been guaranteed by the Husband up to &#163;35,000.  As at 20th November 2014 the overdraft stood at &#163;35,500.

The Wife alleges that this was a tactical step designed to prejudice her in subsequent divorce proceedings.  The allegation clearly first requires the Husband to have anticipated that the parties would separate in 2012 but, more importantly, it would also require the Wife to have been prejudiced by this  step.  I fail to see how the Wife sustained any significant prejudice as a result of the salary sacrifice.  The Husband's total gross income directly and through XPS remained approximately &#163;445,000, even after the salary sacrifice.  The sacrifice was also only for one year.</p>

I refer to this in order to make plain that I have taken these differences into account when assessing the evidence and reaching my conclusions as to the reliability of the witnesses.</p>

The points relied on by her do not support the conclusion that the Husband's redundancy was not genuine.  Rather, they reflect her suspicion and distrust.  They do not begin to support a conclusion that TS and the Husband contrived to create a fictitious redundancy.  This would have required TS to pay in excess of &#163;600,000 for no reason.  Why would TS pay this sum if the Husband was not being made redundant?  The Wife's case has no answer to this simple question.  Further, the Husband has been employed by another employer full-time, at a substantial salary, since May 2013.</p>

The letter raises a wide range of questions including seeking copies of minutes and other documents.  It is a letter which appears designed, in part, to seek to establish whether a fair procedure was followed as though this was an employment case.  It also refers to the "apparent" (I emphasise) "termination of your client's employment", seemingly ignoring the clear terms of the letter from TS as quoted above.  It also seeks an undertaking that redundancy monies be held by solicitors until resolution of financial matters.  No specific justification for this latter request is advanced.</p>

It is a summary of the terms of the proposed settlement in respect of the Husband's redundancy.  They include converting his existing loan, in excess of &#163;1 million, into an interest-free loan which will be repayable when the Husband's shares in ABC 2011 are realised.  Importantly in my view, given that this document emanates from TS, it is asserted that the shares have &#8220;minimal value&#8221;, which mirrors what was said in the letter dated 13th September 2012.  The reference to minimal value is in the context of TS being entitled to exercise their right to buy the shares, "But we are prepared to extend those terms to 5 years from now."</p>

If the Husband's redundancy was not genuine the Husband, PM and RT would have been engaged in a broad-ranging conspiracy from at least September 2012.  They would have had to agree to present a false case to the Wife and subsequently to the court.  The conspiracy would have encompassed the preparation of false documents including the letter of 13th September 2012, the summary and schedule and the document headed "Proposed Terms of [the husband&#8217;s] Exit."  They would have had to have been false because they were predicated on the Husband being made redundant, when it is the Wife's case that this was a false presentation and that he was, in fact, not being made redundant.</p>

For example, that the Husband asserts that the loan was initially subject to interest while the ABC 2011 accounts (for the year ended 31st December 2011) refer to that part of the loan which had by then been provided, namely &#163;783,000, as being interest free. </p>

Does the evidence establish that at some point since February 2012 TS has agreed to waive this loan?  In my judgment none of the points advanced by the Wife support such a conclusion.  I can again see no reason why TS, through PM and RT, would lie about this.  Nor why, if there was an agreement to waive this loan, this would not have formed part of the Husband's redundancy agreement.  To repeat, I can see no reason why TS would lie, for example, in the letter dated 15th May 2013 which sets out the outstanding loan balances.  Accordingly, I find that the Husband owes TS &#163;1.072 million.  I have added the sums of &#163;53,000 and &#163;10,000 as I also accept that they are loans which are repayable.</p>

This is, in my view, an assertion without substance.  As to the latter (the T loan), the Wife alleges that the Husband &#8220;denuded the finances&#8221; by repaying RT and assigning the loan to TS.  This is an illogical assertion as he could not have done both.  In respect of the T loan, the Wife sought to raise questions about it, again based on the lack of documents.  It was suggested that this was not a commercial arms length arrangement.</p>

The evidence demonstrates, and it is indeed accepted, that she lent XPS &#163;300,000.  There was clearly some talk at some point about Mrs. T being given preference shares but it is equally clear that this never happened.  There is no evidence to suggest that this was not a debt which remained repayable.</p>

The schedules produced by the Husband demonstrate the potential liquidity problems facing XPS in 2013.  Paying off the swap agreement with the sum of &#163;425,000 significantly addressed these problems.  The Wife has questioned why TS would have lent XPS &#163;425,000 at this time when they were already owed a significant sum by the Husband.  The simple answer is that this is, yet again, an example of PM being a very decent person.  As he explained in his evidence he wanted to help the Husband and the Wife.  He had known them for a long time and the Husband had done a great job for the M family.  He did not want to see them get into financial difficulties. The Husband had asked him for help and he agreed to lend him the money to help them out.</p>

A brief answer from the Husband's solicitors led to Hewlett Swanson asserting that, if XPS could not pay its debts, being the sums due to the Wife, it must be insolvent.

The assertion that XPS might be insolvent was also, clearly, not in the interests of the family.  This was followed up with a request for the appointment of an insolvency practitioner to advise the Board.</p>

The Husband was clearly a good leaver.  He could, therefore, have been required to offer his shares for sale to PM.  This did not happen.  The Husband explained in his evidence that he sought to delay the date on which his shares were acquired by PM because of the impact of the swap contracts.  The value of the swaps had moved from &#163;31 million to &#163;60 million between December 2010 and December 2011.</p>

Given the value of the properties held by the group, the Husband's shares would then have been valued at &#163;31 million (by reference to the definitions in the 2011 agreement and absent there being any separate Cap agreement).  Further, absent any undisclosed side agreement, it is difficult to see, on the Wife's case, how PM would benefit from delay as it would seem likely the properties would only increase in value from 2011.</p>

As with the good leaver provisions (and the changes made to them), it is difficult to see this, on the Wife's case, as other than a puzzling step on the part of PM.  By further postponing his right to purchase the shares, surely he was simply increasing their likely value.  On the Husband's case, he was seeking to postpone the date to give more time for the value of the swap contracts to improve.  Against this background, the issue of how the date of 30th September 2017 came to be agreed, an issue explored during the course of the hearing, is an insignificant detail.  It is the effect of any postponement which is important.</p>

He clearly did not pay them the attention they deserved and they do not contain what the Husband and PM agreed.  Indeed, I would adopt Mrs Howe&#8217;s description of &#8220;nonsense&#8221; and PM&#8217;s word of &#8220;ludicrous&#8221; to describe the consequences of applying the terms of these agreements.

As a result of an order I made at the pre-trial hearing, the accountants prepared a schedule setting out their respective cases for the value of the Husband&#8217;s shares based on net asset values.  This was further explored in oral evidence.  Given my conclusions as to the Wife&#8217;s alternative case and given this evidence, I consider it sufficient to determine that the value is no more than &#163;1.7 million.

An asking price is not a proper foundation for the determination of value, absent evidence as to whether it might be achieved.  In fact, the evidence is that no offer has been made at all, let alone at that price.  Further, I would reject her contention that there should be any adjustment in respect of preference share dividends.  In my judgment the full amount should be deducted.  The fact that an adjustment has been made in the accounts does not mean that the full amount is not due, if the resources are available.

In order for this to be correct both RT and, critically, PM would have had to have been actively involved in a conspiracy from at least September 2012.  A conspiracy to assert that the Husband had been made redundant when he had not.  A conspiracy to assert that the Husband's shares were worth less than they are.  A conspiracy secretly to have agreed with the Husband that in some way he would be paid further sums by TS and/or PM at some point in the future when these proceedings were concluded.</p>

Either this is what TS believed or it was a false assertion to assist the Husband in advancing a false case.  It is not suggested, as it could not be on the Wife's case, that this was a tactical assertion on the part of TS to seek to deprive the Husband of his proper entitlement.

The conspiracy would have had to have commenced at about the date the parties separated and certainly no later than the Husband's false redundancy.  It would have been inept because the changes made to the 2011 shareholders agreement in the second agreement (in 2012) did not include any changes to the clauses dealing with valuation.  The Husband's shares continued to be valued by reference to the properties' open market values or total proceeds received on a sale.  As at 31st December 2012 the properties were valued at &#163;277 million giving a value for the Husband's shares, based on the definition of Market Value, of &#163;36 million.  The failure to amend these provisions would have been a surprising oversight if the conspiracy was intended to give a false presentation of the value of the Husband's shares.</p>

Indeed, it could be said that false cases often unravel for this very reason.  However, the ineptness would also include the deliberate failure to disclose the existence of a side agreement as referred to by Mrs Howe in her evidence.  Absent any such side agreement, placing a cap or ceiling on the value of the Husband's shares, they would be valued at &#163;36 million.  The conspiracy requires the existence of such an agreement and, as such, it would manifestly have been in PM's interest to have disclosed it and/or to have incorporated its terms into the amended agreement in December 2012.</p>

	      <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>It will be apparent from my judgment that it was not reasonable for the Wife to pursue her allegations of a conspiracy or collusion to present a false case involving TS, PM and RT.  She raised, pursued and contested this core part of her case in a way which I have described as being speculative and unfounded.  I have acknowledged that, for a period, the Wife was entitled to rely on Mrs Howe's first report but only for a limited period because the concerns raised by Mrs Howe were in my view answered decisively by RT and PM.</p>

It is, I regret to say, one of the more extreme cases in my experience as a family lawyer over the last 35 years.  Having come to that conclusion, it would be perverse if I did not make <span style="font-style:italic">an</span> award of costs in the Husband's favour.  He seeks the sum of &#163;150,000.  I will deal with this when determining my award, along with the other adjustments referred to above.</p>

This would leave the Wife with &#163;700,000 and the Husband with &#163;1.5 million, excluding pensions.  Despite the Wife's conduct, I consider that this would effect too great a disparity.  </p>

This will require the Wife to receive a balancing lump sum payment after she receives the net proceeds of sale of the former matrimonial home and the Spanish property.</p>

The Wife's income currently totals &#163;13,000.  As referred to above, it is not clear what the effect on Child Tax Credits would be of her earning an income of &#163;5,000.</p>

This will enable both parties to meet their respective needs within the available resources.  In respect of the award for the wife, this will be for 6 months, to give the Wife time to utilise her earning capacity.  It will then reduce by &#163;5,000.</p>

	      <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The final issue I need to address is the duration of the Wife's maintenance.  The Wife under my award will have approximately &#163;400,000 in excess of her housing needs (of &#163;500,000) and a pension fund of just under &#163;400,000.  In due course these resources will be sufficient to enable her to adjust to the determination of maintenance without undue hardship.  The term proposed by the Husband is when he reaches the age of 60 in 2021.  I consider that inadequate and I will provide for the wife&#8217;s maintenance to determine in 2024.  Given the duration of the term, I propose also to make a Section 28(1A) bar which means that there will be no power to extend that term.</p>
