R has been told of the hearing, but does not wish to participate.  She is represented through the Official Solicitor by Mr David Lawson of counsel. The applicant Trust is represented by Mr Vikram Sachdeva of King&#8217;s Counsel.</p>

The Trust further submits that, in circumstances where clinical observations suggest progressive placental dysfunction, if R&#8217;s baby remains <span style="font-style:italic">in utero</span> to term there is a significant risk that the baby will die or suffer brain damage and that it is in R&#8217;s best interests for an elective Caesarean to be performed in order to avoid the risk of R having to deliver a dead or severely damaged child and the adverse psychological impact consequent thereon.  The application comes before this court in the urgent applications list having been issued on Thursday 12 December 2022.  On 14 December 2022 I made a transparency order in the standard terms.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case is unusual in that R has not expressed an objection to giving birth by way of Caesarean section.  However, the medical team caring for R are concerned that there is a risk that she may ultimately refuse the Caesarean in the same way as she has intermittently refused foetal monitoring, resulting in her physical and/or mental heath being compromised through damage to, or the death of her baby.  The evidence in respect of the prior question of R&#8217;s capacity is, likewise, not straightforward.  Although the most recent assessments provide clear evidence of incapacity there has been one capacity assessment, completed on 10 November 2022, that found R had capacity with respect to decisions concerning delivery of her unborn child.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">R was born on 20 March 1990 and is now aged 32 years old. At present, R is a serving prisoner, following a conviction for an unspecified offence of violence.  It is thought that R also has a conviction for being drunk and disorderly.  She is a failed asylum seeker.  R&#8217;s mother, JM, resides in this jurisdiction but R has strenuously objected to contact being made with her mother and those wishes have been complied with.  Neither the Trust nor the Official Solicitor sought to revisit this decision pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 4(7)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  During earlier involvement with medical services in 2011 with respect to the birth of her first child, R appears to have provided her mother&#8217;s details as next of kin.  The documents in the bundle suggest that R may have been violent towards her mother, resulting in the police being called.  Cardiff City Council, in whose area R resided for a time, has confirmed that it had no adult social services involvement with R. There have been consistent reports that R has been street homeless and further information from Cardiff City Council states that the mother has on occasion been located at the property of a registered sex offender.  Beyond these sparse matters, very little else is known about the R&#8217;s wider social circumstances.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has two other children, both of whom were removed from her care prior to 2017, one to adoption and one to placement with her mother under a Special Guardianship Order.  The medical records available in relation to R suggest that her first pregnancy in 2011 was unplanned and that R was unsure about keeping the baby.  At that time, R appeared to be staying with an Aunt.  The medical records available with respect to her pregnancy in 2011 do not suggest a concern on the part of doctors with regard to R&#8217;s capacity as it related to mode of delivery.  The records further evidence R discussing analgesia and electing an epidural after discussion of options for analgesia. R&#8217;s first child was delivered normally following labour.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">R&#8217;s pregnancy in 2017 appears to have been reported to doctors as a &#8220;late booking&#8221; and is described in the medical notes as &#8220;unexpected&#8221;.  R is recorded as wishing to undergo a termination but not being certain how to go about that.  The notes recording that fact, dated 30 March 2017, also record a concern about R&#8217;s &#8220;affect&#8221; and potential mental health difficulties.  On 10 April 2017, the medical records noted that R &#8220;Seems to have substantial MH disorder&#8221; and recorded a need to &#8220;discuss foster / adoption at this stage.&#8221; Later in the notes for this pregnancy it is recorded that at this point R&#8217;s first child was in the care of her mother and the unborn child was due to be made the subject of a Child Protection Plan on birth.  R did not this time give her mother as next of kin.  She was recorded as declining consent to peri-natal mental health treatment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of May 2017, R was noted as still needing a mental health referral, following a number of failed appointments.  An entry for 24 May 2017 records that R had at that point consented to a psychiatric review.  Whilst it would appear that R&#8217;s mental health was worse in 2017 than in 2011, the medical notes that are available with respect to her 2017 pregnancy do not record concerns regarding R&#8217;s capacity to make decisions with respect to mode of delivery. On 30 March 2017, R&#8217;s notes record that R &#8220;has capacity&#8221; although it is not clear precisely to which decision or decisions that conclusion relates.  There was at that time a further recommendation for a referral to the Perinatal Mental Health Team.  During the course of her labour with the second child, R is recorded as having at points refused cardiotocography (CTG) to monitor foetal heartbeat.  The second child was delivered normally following labour.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to her current pregnancy, little is known about the circumstances in which R became pregnant.  The prison has raised concerns as to the possibility of the pregnancy resulting from sexual exploitation and there is some suggestion in the papers that R has been involved in prostitution.  However, there is no cogent evidence against which to evaluate these assertions.  On 11 July 2022, R was asked by a Clinical Practitioner in prison whether she wished to continue with her pregnancy.  The Clinical Practitioner recorded a concern that R may not understand her decision in this regard.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">R was admitted to hospital on 4 November 2022 with a growth restricted baby but with normal liquor volume and dopplers.  It was not felt that the baby&#8217;s condition was at that point so concerning as to necessitate delivery for presumed foetal compromise, but R was administered steroids in preparation for a potential pre-term delivery.  Whilst an in-patient on the ward R was the subject of regular scans and CTG to monitor foetal heartbeat, which R co-operated with approximately fifty percent of the time.  The scans indicated continued foetal growth restriction and low liquor levels, supporting a diagnosis of placental insufficiency.  During her oral evidence, Dr Jobson described the growth restriction as &#8220;undeniable&#8221;. R was not proactively monitoring her baby, nor communicating whether the baby was moving.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">R&#8217;s psychiatric presentation has variously been described as &#8220;perplexing&#8221;, &#8220;unusual&#8221; and &#8220;baffling&#8221;.  As I have noted, whilst pregnant with her second child, the medical notes suggest that R was labouring under significant mental health difficulties.  With respect to the remainder of R&#8217;s psychiatric history, it would appear that she was detained under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> at least twice in 2018.  The information from Cardiff City Council records that R was invited for a screening assessment to ascertain whether she had a learning disability when aged 28, but failed to attend appointments on 18 April 2018 and 8 May 2018.  However, the prison records indicate that in November 2018 a &#8220;risk assessment&#8221; was completed that indicated R did not meet the criteria for the Learning Disability team to work with her.  The documents before the court also relate that when R&#8217;s mother was involved in 2018, she suggested R had coped well at school and presented differently in early years, there being a dramatic change in R&#8217;s ability and presentation in her later teenage years. </p>

At that time, it would appear that R was prescribed with Aripiprazole, an anti-psychotic.  This was recorded as not changing R&#8217;s presentation and so was discontinued.  Previous IQ tests have resulted in R demonstrating a full scale IQ of between 58 and 61.  </p>

The clinicians responsible for R&#8217;s care in prison did not consider that she presented with an acute mental illness and postulated that her presentation was, rather, due to cognitive impairment or was neurodevelopmental in nature.  Within this context, they considered that R presented as having a learning difficulty.  The prison regarded R&#8217;s presentation as unusual and felt that her lack of engagement made it harder to reach a view on the genesis and nature of her difficulties: </p>

There are times when [R] has become brittle and inexplicably irritable in her manner and this appears to be when being asked about certain things, or spending too much time with her.&#8221;</p>

At times she has denied being pregnant and we have queried whether she fully understands and is aware of the pregnancy, however it is very difficult to ascertain a firm view of this due to her lack of engagement with us&#8230; In view of [R] not engaging with any discussion about the pregnancy / unborn and seeming very disconnected, inconsistent engagement with the midwife and not self-reporting anything about the pregnancy (even when asked directly), our feeling is that [R] does not have capacity to make informed decisions around the well-being of herself and her baby. However, making a judgement on her capacity is obviously decision and time focused.&#8221;</p>

That capacity assessment concluded that R lacked capacity to make decisions in relation to her pregnancy and, in the event that one was required due to foetal compromise, in relation to delivery by way of Caesarean section.  At this point, the growth trajectory of the baby caused clinicians to consider there was an increasing risk of foetal compromise.  At a Best Interests Meeting on 8 November the treating clinicians considered that R should be provided with support by the Learning Disability Team to assist her in decision making with respect to mode of delivery.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 November 2022, a further capacity assessment undertaken by Dr Q reached a different conclusion with respect to R&#8217;s capacity to make decisions in relation to her pregnancy and, if necessary, a Caesarean section. Dr Q&#8217;s original capacity assessment is recorded in the briefest of terms.  It is not at all clear from that document what relevant information was conveyed and which questions Dr Q asked and which were posed by R.  The assessment gives few details as to the basis it was considered the functional test under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> was not made out, with no formulation with regard to the diagnostic test under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.  In his original report, Dr Q concluded that R had the &#8220;capacity to understand&#8221; that she is pregnant, that her baby needs monitoring and that, if the baby became unwell, she would need a Caesarean section. As noted by the Official Solicitor, the formulation &#8220;capacity to understand&#8221; used in Dr Q&#8217;s original report is not, as an overall conclusion, readily amenable to interrogation by reference to the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.</p>

The analysis contained in that email is retrospective in nature and provided only after clarification was requested.  Dr Q relates that information concerning Caesarean section was conveyed to R using easy to read leaflets R was noted by Dr Q to be able to state, in relation to a Caesarean section, there would be &#8220;a line in her tummy&#8221; and it would cause pain.  When asked what would &#8220;come out of her tummy&#8221; the mother replied, &#8220;well, a new born baby of course&#8221;.  Dr Q further considered that the mother could answer &#8220;complex maths questions around money&#8221; and noted she used the words epidural and Caesarean even though simpler words had been used to convey those concepts to her.  Within this context, Dr Q set out the following, as I have noted retrospective, conclusions in his email, which conclusion he states was also reached by the Learning Disability Liaison Nurse who accompanied him when assessing R:</p>

She also asked if this procedure will be done by professionals and at the hospital.  She was able to understand and retain information.

By comparison to her own capacity assessment undertaken on 12 December 2022, Dr Zacharia told the court that she was simply unable to recognise the presentation of R described in the assessment of Dr Q, so far was it from her own experience and those of her treating team.  In addition, Dr Zacharia also queried whether Dr Q was entitled to sign the assessment off as a Consultant Psychiatrist in circumstances where would not appear to have a completion certificate and is not a member of the Royal College.  The email of 13 December 2022 is signed by Dr Q simply as a &#8220;locum consultant&#8221;.

Dr O&#8217;Brien concluded that R lacked capacity to make decisions concerning whether to undergo a Caesarean section. The Caesarean procedure was discussed with R with the aid of photographs and visual aids.  R was not able to retain or repeat the information conveyed during the conversation with Dr O&#8217;Brien via speech, written communication or by way of reference to the pictures.  R did not think that cutting open her stomach would cause her pain and was not able to identify what would come out of her &#8220;tummy&#8221;.  At the end of the exchange, R could not recall any aspect of what had been discussed and explained with the aid of visual prompts.  Dr O&#8217;Brien concluded that R was not able to understand the information given to her, retain the information in her mind or weigh the information as part of a decision making process about what she would want to happen.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;[11] There is no clear evidence that [R] has a severe or enduring mental health illness that impairs her capacity. However, after many assessments with multiple teams, it is felt that the most likely factors contributing to her ability to make a decision about her pregnancy would be neurodevelopmental cognitive impairment and past trauma. In terms of past trauma, we are not clear of all of [R]&#8217;s history but I understand she is a refugee. She is vulnerable and been in vulnerable positions. The circumstances of her pregnancy are also unknown. [R] appears to be detached from the situation and it is likely that the previous traumas [R] has suffered, and previous pregnancies experienced with babies taken away might contribute to her lack of engagement, detachment and ultimately capacity. There is no clear test to demonstrate this is what is impairing her capacity but in the absence of any mental health illness, I have come to the same conclusion as the prison mental health team, that [R] is possibly remaining detached from the situation at present, which amounts to cognitive impairment at the material time.&#8221;  </p>

I have discussed this with her Prison Consultant Psychiatrist and her previous LD psychologist in Swansea during an MDT and we all came to the same conclusion.&#8221;  </p>

Dr Zacharia further conceded that this introduced significant diagnostic uncertainty and prevents a <span style="font-style:italic">formal</span> diagnosis of learning disability.  However, Dr Zacharia maintained her view that, on the <span style="font-style:italic">totality</span> of the information available about R, the presence of a mild learning disability is the correct formulation in respect of R, which mild learning disability constitutes an impairment of the mind.  Dr Zacharia further considered that trauma is likely also affecting R&#8217;s functioning and plays a part in the disengagement and dissociation that she demonstrates.</p>

With respect to the question of best interests, Dr Jobson was clear in her evidence that she now considers that <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> a Caesarean section is consistent with recommended safe obstetric practice in this case.  Dr Jobson points to the NICE guidelines recommending Caesarean section to all women with foetal growth restriction and confirmed foetal compromise (see NICE guidance NG207 1.2.23).  In this context, Dr Jobson noted that R has had continual deterioration in growth of her baby from 28 weeks and that her abdominal circumference now well below the 5th centile, indicating a growth restricted, oligohydramniotic pregnancy.</p>

As to risks that attach to an elective Caesarean section, the risks attached to the anaesthetic are at the same level for any pregnant woman, there will be discomfort from the wound for up to six weeks, a risk of bleeding at a slightly higher level of risk than that of a vaginal birth and a risk of further surgery, including hysterectomy, to control bleeding.  In addition, there is a risk of infection, of thromboembolism, a tear in the uterus in future pregnancies and death (1 in 12,000 compared to 1 in 10,000 for vaginal birth).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to awaiting a spontaneous birth, the benefits are a reduction (but not negation) of risks associated with anaesthetic and surgery and in the potential complications for future pregnancies.  The risks in this case of awaiting spontaneous delivery are perineal injury and of still birth or brain injury to the baby and the associated traumatic impact on R in having to deliver a deceased foetus.  In such circumstances there is a greater risk of inter-uterine infection if birth of the deceased foetus is delayed.  There is also an increased risk of the need for an emergency Caesarean section, which itself caries an increased level of risk in relation to that procedure.  In the context of her growth restricted, oligohydramniotic pregnancy Dr Jobson considers R to be at a much high risk of an emergency Caesarean section than other women were she to go into labour, either by induction or spontaneously.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, with respect to the option of induced labour, Dr Jobson relates that the benefits are control over the timing of R&#8217;s delivery with the associated ability to prepare her, less chance of brain damage to the foetus and of stillbirth, though at a higher risk than for an elective Caesarean section.  There is also a reduced risk of the difficulties associated with the anaesthesia and surgery associated with a Caesarean section.  Once again, there is also an increased risk of the need for an emergency Caesarean section, to which risk R is particularly susceptible in light of her growth-restricted, oligohydramniotic pregnancy. Having also been present at this assessment, in oral evidence Dr Jobson told the court that, with respect to the option of moving to a Caesarean section after labour had commenced and if required in an emergency, she considered it extremely unlikely that R would be able to make a capacitous decision about undergoing a Caesarean section in such circumstances.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;There is no evidence that surgery (Caesarean Section (CS)) is better for [R&#8217;s] physical health. A vaginal delivery is "safer" for her physically as the indication for CS is for foetal wellbeing, not maternal complications. A CS in this case is in [R&#8217;s] best interests because otherwise she may have to deliver a dead baby which would surely impact her mental health. Delivery of a stillborn baby can also be more difficult - lack of foetal tone requires a greater degree of maternal effort in the 2nd stage of labour (pushing stage), increasing the chance of requiring forceps for delivery. If the baby were healthy, we would be recommending a term vaginal delivery, an induction would be considered for her mental health only if it was felt control over timing of delivery was beneficial to her.&#8221;</p>

Dr Jobson reiterated that this would be an extremely traumatic experience for R and a situation that would be &#8220;very bad for her&#8221;.  Dr Jobson considered that in this context, whilst a vaginal birth is the result of the best interests analysis if looked at from a purely physical perspective, having regard to both R&#8217;s physical and emotional wellbeing, given the appreciable risk of the baby dying before labour occurs spontaneously or is induced and the consequent need for R to deliver a dead child, an elective Caesarean section is in R&#8217;s best interests.  </p>

The Supreme Court held that in order to determine whether a person lacks capacity in relation to &#8220;a matter&#8221; for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 2(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, the court must first identify the correct formulation of &#8220;the matter&#8221; in respect of which it is required to evaluate whether P is unable to make a decision. Once the correct formulation of &#8220;the matter&#8221; has been arrived at, it is then that the court moves to identify the &#8220;information relevant to the decision&#8221; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.  That latter task falls, as recognised by Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re DD</span>, to be undertaken on the specific facts of the case. Once the information relevant to the decision has been identified, the question for the court is whether P is unable to make a decision in relation to the matter and, if so, whether that inability is because of an impairment of, or a disturbance, in the functioning of the mind or brain.  </p>

On behalf of the Official Solicitor, and citing the decision of Williams J in <span style="font-style:italic">NHS Trust v JP </span>[2019] COPLR 298 at [25], in his Skeleton Argument Mr Lawson argued that, in identifying the impairment of the functioning of the mind or brain under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref>, the court <span style="font-style:italic">must identify</span> the underlying condition.  During his oral submissions, Mr Lawson moderated his position on behalf of the Official Solicitor somewhat and did not seek to contend that a formal diagnosis is required for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.

All that Williams J is saying in that paragraph is that the evidence concerning the question of an impairment in the functioning of the mind or brain must come from a suitably qualified witness, Williams J having been faced in <span style="font-style:italic">NHS Trust v JP</span> with evidence concerning a learning disability being given by a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist.</p>

Within this context, the Supreme Court noted that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref> constitutes the single test for capacity, albeit that the test falls to be interpreted by applying the more detailed provisions around it in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 2</ref> and 3 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.

In this context, the question of whether any inability of R to make a decision in relation to the matter in issue is <span style="font-style:italic">because of</span> an impairment of, or a disturbance in, the functioning of the mind or brain is a question of fact for the <span style="font-style:italic">court</span> to answer based on the evidence before it.  In this context, the wording of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref> itself does not require a formal diagnosis before the court can be satisfied that whether any inability of R to make a decision in relation to the matter in issue is because of an impairment of, or a disturbance, in the functioning of the mind or brain.  The words &#8220;impairment of, or a disturbance in&#8221; are not further defined elsewhere in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  In these circumstances, there is no basis for interpreting the statutory language as requiring the words &#8220;impairment of, or disturbance in&#8221; to be tied to a specific diagnosis.  Indeed, it would be undesirable to do so.  To introduce such a requirement would constrain the application of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> to an undesirable degree, having regard to the complexity of the mind and brain, to the range of factors that may act to impair their functioning and, most importantly, to the intricacies of the causal nexus between a lack of ability to take a decision and the impairment in question.  In <span style="font-style:italic">PC v City of York Council</span> McFarlane LJ (as he then was) cautioned against using <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref> as a means &#8220;simply to collect the mental health element&#8221; of the test for capacity and thereby risk a loss or prominence of the requirement of a causative nexus created by the words &#8220;because of&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref>.  Reading <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref> as requiring a formal diagnosis would in my judgment significantly increase that risk.</p>

However, I am satisfied that the court is not precluded from reaching a conclusion on that question in the absence of a formal diagnosis or, to address Mr Lawson&#8217;s original proposition, in the absence of the court being able to formulate precisely the underlying condition or conditions.  The question for the court remains whether, on the evidence available to it, the inability to make a decision in relation to the matter is because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain. </p>

It might well have been possible to be more precise if TM had been able to cooperate with the MRI scan. It is a misunderstanding of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> to read it as requiring the identification of a precise causal link when there are various, entirely viable causes. Insistence on identifying the precise pathology as necessary to establish the causal link is misconceived. Such an approach strikes me as inconsistent with the philosophy of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>.

In his Skeleton Argument on behalf of the Official Solicitor Mr Lawson formulated the matter for decision in considerably wider terms, namely &#8220;whether to carry her baby to the point of natural childbirth or to have the baby delivered earlier and, if so, whether to do so by induction or Caesarean section.&#8221;  In this context, in his Skeleton Argument on behalf of the Official Solicitor Mr Lawson complained that the clinicians had not put to R what he contended were all of the options.  However, on the evidence available to the court from Dr Jobson it is clear that only an elective Caesarean section would now be consistent with recommended safe obstetric practice having regard to R&#8217;s condition, the NICE guidelines recommending Caesarean section to all women with foetal growth restriction and confirmed foetal compromise (see NICE guidance NG207 1.2.23).  </p>

This does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> mean that the option of carrying the baby to term followed by labour either induced or natural is irrelevant.  But in light of the fact that R&#8217;s treating team can now offer for decision only one clinically safe course, it is relevant as information to be retained, understood, weighed or used when deciding the matter, rather than as part of the proper formulation of the matter to be decided.</p>

In addition, decisions are always taken in a context, with the concomitant potential for a myriad of other factors, beyond the core elements of the decision, to influence the decision being taken.  This has the potential to make the task of creating a definitive account of the information relevant to a particular decision a challenging one. This difficulty can be addressed however, by acknowledging that in order to demonstrate capacity, a person is not required or expected to consider every last piece of information in order to make a decision about the matter, but rather to have the broad, general understanding of the kind that is expected from the population at large (see <span style="font-style:italic">Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust v JB</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/342" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 342" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 342 (COP)</ref> at [25]).

Namely, why do you want to do a Caesarean section, what are the alternatives, what will happen when it is done, is it safe for me, is it safe for my unborn child, how long will I take to recover and what will happen if I decide not to do it.

R&#8217;s unborn child has no separate legal identity until he or she is born.

But that legal position does not prevent the impact on the unborn child of taking or not taking a decision being information relevant to the matter requiring decision.  Indeed, I consider it a safe assumption that one of the foremost pieces of information a pregnant woman would consider relevant in deciding whether to undergo any medical procedure during pregnancy is that of the potential impact on her unborn child.  On the evidence of Dr Jobson, in this case R has shown some preference for having a live, healthy baby, as inferred from her showing occasional interest in the baby by asking for scan photos, wanting baby clothes and speaking about going to see the baby from time to time.</p>

I agree with those sentiments.  Given the number of capacity assessments that are required to be carried out on a daily basis in multiple arenas, it would obviously be too onerous to require a highly detailed analysis in the document in which the capacity decision is recorded.  However, a careful and succinct account of the formulation of the matter to be decided and the formulation of the relevant information in respect of that matter, together with a careful and concise account of how the relevant information was conveyed and with what result, would seem to me to be the minimum that is required. </p>

It is also apparent from the account of the conversation between R and the representative of the Official Solicitor later on 12 December 2022 that R had virtually no recollection of the earlier information conveyed by her clinicians regarding the Caesarean section, albeit R did ask a question about the stitching of her wound.  During this exchange occasion, R denied ever having been in labour, even though she had been twice in the past (during the capacity assessment with respect to CTG on 30 November 2022, R had even denied being pregnant).  Dr Nickell encountered similar difficulties when seeking to discuss with R anaesthesia for the purposes of a Caesarean section. R did not appear to understand the simple explanation of spinal anaesthesia and was unable to repeat back any details to Dr Nickell. Likewise, in relation to general anaesthesia, R did not appear to understand the initial explanation and could not repeat back to Dr Nickell any details of the process of general anaesthesia.  </p>

R has a full scale IQ of between 58 and 61.  The evidence before the court, from both the mental health team and Dr Zacharia is that R&#8217;s functioning is also adversely affected by past trauma, comprising the removal of her children following her past pregnancies, apparent family conflict with her mother and her history of homelessness and possible involvement in prostitution.  Dr Zacharia considered that this may be leading R also to dissociate from her current situation to avoid further trauma. From the sparse history that is available, including medical notes from R&#8217;s previous two pregnancies, R appears also to have suffered from what were described as significant mental health difficulties at least as early as 2017.  In those records, there is reference to referrals being made in relation to assessment for learning disability, albeit it would appear those referrals did not lead to a diagnosis of such or intervention.  </p>

However, Dr Zacharia considers that having regard to the evidence that is available, her assessments of R and the multidisciplinary discussions that have taken place in respect of R&#8217;s presentation, that on the balance of probabilities R has a learning disability.  That evidence was not the subject of challenge.  Dr Zacharia further considers that this that amounts to an impairment that disables R from being able to make a decision about whether or not her baby should be delivered pre-term by elective Caesarean section, by preventing her from retaining information long enough to use and weigh it to make a decision.  Dr Zacharia also considered that, in circumstances where is an element of dissociation due to past trauma, R may also be at times choosing not to retain the information. In circumstances where a formal diagnosis is not required for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> for the reasons I have explained, I am satisfied that Dr Zacharia&#8217;s evidence demonstrates that R&#8217;s inability to decide whether or not her baby should be delivered pre-term by elective Caesarean section is because of an impairment to the functioning of her mind or brain.</p>

However, two further capacity assessments have been concluded since that date in relation to the matter in issue, on 7 December 2022 and 12 December 2022, which are more proximate in time to the decision of the court and conclude that R lacks capacity (and which are consistent with the capacity assessment undertaken on 7 November 2022 that came to the same conclusion).  In addition, it is not clear from the contemporaneous record of the capacity assessment undertaken on 10 November 2022 that the correct test was considered, the assessment referring to &#8220;capacity to understand&#8221;.

Whilst in this case natural birth is not without risk (there being in particular a greater risk of intrauterine infection if the baby died and birth of the deceased foetus were to be delayed and an increased risk of the need for an emergency Caesarean section in the context of the oligohydramniotic pregnancy) the evidence before the court is that it cannot be said that an elective Caesarean is better for R&#8217;s physical health than a natural birth.  Further, a natural birth would itself avoid the risks attached to anaesthesia, discomfort from the wound, a risk of bleeding at a slightly higher level than that of a vaginal birth and a risk of further surgery, including hysterectomy. Notwithstanding this position however, I am satisfied that an elective Caesarean section is in R&#8217;s best interests.</p>

A vaginal delivery is "safer" for her physically as the indication for CS is for foetal wellbeing, not maternal complications. A CS in this case is in [R&#8217;s] best interests because otherwise she may have to deliver a dead baby which would surely impact her mental health. Delivery of a stillborn baby can also be more difficult - lack of foetal tone requires a greater degree of maternal effort in the 2nd stage of labour (pushing stage), increasing the chance of requiring forceps for delivery. If the baby were healthy, we would be recommending a term vaginal delivery, an induction would be considered for her mental health only if it was felt control over timing of delivery was beneficial to her.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;[63] The caselaw has emphasised the right of a capacitous woman, in these circumstances, to behave in a way which many might regard as unreasonable or "morally repugnant", to use Butler-Sloss LJ's phrase. This includes the right to jeopardise the life and welfare of her foetus. When the Court has the responsibility for taking the decision, I do not consider it has the same latitude. It should not sanction that which it objectively considers to be contrary to P's best interests. The statute prohibits this by its specific insistence on 'reasonable belief' as to where P's best interests truly lie. It is important that respect for P's autonomy remains in focus but it will rarely be the case, in my judgement, that P's best interests will be promoted by permitting the death of, or brain injury to, an otherwise viable and healthy foetus. In this case it may be that R's instincts and intuitive understanding of her own body (which it must be emphasised were entirely correct) led to her strenuous insistence on a natural birth. Notwithstanding the paucity of information available, I note that there is nothing at all to suggest that R was motivated by anything other than an honest belief that this was best for both her and her baby. It is to be distinguished, for example, from those circumstances where intervention is resisted on religious or ethical grounds. In the circumstances therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that R would wish for a safe birth and a healthy baby.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, evidence is clear that mother has suffered a continual deterioration in foetal growth from 28 weeks with an abdominal circumference now well below the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile, reduced liquor volume from 32 weeks and unknown foetal movements.  The obstetric evidence is that, in the context of a natural birth, there is a significant risk that the unborn child will die or suffer severe brain damage.  Were this risk to manifest to its maximum extent, the mother would be required to deliver a dead child. Whilst in her conversation with the representative of the Official Solicitor, R did at one point state when asked about the baby &#8220;no, even if it is dead it has nothing to do with me&#8221;, as I have recounted there is also evidence that R wishes to give birth to a live, healthy child, inferred from her showing occasional interest in the baby, such as asking for scan photos and wanting baby clothes, and speaking about going to see the baby.  The same may be inferred from the fact that, whilst I am satisfied that she does not have capacity to consent, R has not objected to date to an elective Caesarean. In any event, the court cannot ignore the fact that being required to give birth a dead child is an obviously traumatic experience, one that must count as among the most traumatic that a person may be required to endure.  Dr Jobson&#8217;s evidence is that the traumatic nature of such an event risks being further increased in R&#8217;s by the need to utilise forceps to in order to deliver the dead child.  </p>

This is particularly so when the evidence of Dr Zacharia regarding the impact of trauma past on R is recalled. In the context of Dr Jobson&#8217;s concerns regarding the impact of R of having to deliver a dead child, Dr Zacharia pointed out R has lost her previous two children to the care of others. As I have noted Dr Zacharia considers that trauma to be an element of R&#8217;s current lack of capacity.  The assessment of best interests is a holistic exercise in which the court must examine R&#8217;s welfare in the widest sense, not just medical but social and psychological.  In the circumstances, whilst satisfied that a natural birth is the end result of a best interests analysis narrowly focused on R&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">physical</span> health and safety, when both R&#8217;s physical <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> psychological welfare a accounted for a different result emerges. Given what I am satisfied is the would be the extremely traumatic experience for R of having to give birth to a dead child should the appreciable risk of the baby dying before natural or induced labour can occur become manifest, I am satisfied on balance that an elective Caesarean section is in R&#8217;s best interests.</p>
