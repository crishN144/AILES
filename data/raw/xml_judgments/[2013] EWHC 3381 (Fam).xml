After the separation the family&#8217;s plans to travel together were shelved, but the mother changed the flight tickets to an earlier date without telling the father.  She brought A to this country on 12 June 2013.  They are staying with the mother&#8217;s father.  A&#8217;s father, who remains in X, seeks her return under the Hague Convention. </p>

The mother complains that the father is a poor provider.  The father&#8217;s case is not that he is unwilling to pay but that the mother should pay her share.  They each give very different accounts of the history; save that their relationship has plainly been one of considerable conflict.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother describes the father as an emotional bully; both forceful and controlling.  She says that he was angry, moody and aggressive but does not complain of physical violence.   She asserts that the father forced her and A to live in poverty and that she functioned as a one parent family with A.   She says that the father abandoned any interest in A as at the date of separation and had shown scant interest in her before.  She asserts that A has written to her father and he has not replied.  Her statement is unremittingly critical and ranges over a number of asserted faults and misbehaviours of the father.  She asserts that A &#8220;hates&#8221; her father and that A begged her to take her to England; only after they arrived did she decide that they should stay.  She says that she did not believe that she required the father&#8217;s consent and that A does not want to be returned to live with her father.  The father has not in fact suggested this. She says that she could not manage financially if they returned but her main emphasis is on A&#8217;s asserted antipathy to returning.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father asserts that he has played a major part in caring for A in the past. He says that there were money troubles including as a result of the mother&#8217;s failed restaurant business. He says that an emotional email which he wrote on separation has been misconstrued, and that his lack of contact with A at that stage (which he asserts that he regrets) was dictated by circumstances.  He takes the view that she has been forced to take sides, and enlisted in support of the mother&#8217;s desire to leave X.   The father has produced a short, child focussed letter written by him to A dated 4 July 2013 in which he said that both parents loved her, that money was short but that he would pay for her upbringing and schooling, and that there were other issues which would need to be explained in due course but were not decisions which she currently needs to make.  He has also produced email correspondence with A, which I accept demonstrates a normal relationship and communication with mutual affection. He expresses pleasure in her exam results and she asks him to get information from her school.  He refers to her returning to X and she does not demur. There is no hint of estrangement between them, until she suddenly stopped replying on 1 August 2013, the day that the location order was obtained and served.  He points out that subsequent emails from him have been read in the early hours of the morning and he suggests that this is because A has to do so in secret because she does not want her mother to know.  He emphasises that she elected to retake her exams so as to be able to return to school.  This involved him making arrangements with a college in London by arrangement with her school.  He points to many inconsistencies in A&#8217;s presentation, and says that much of what she asserts is just not accurate. </p>

I am clear that what A said must reflect quite a high level of adult influence.  Furthermore her reasons for not wanting to return, although expressed emotionally and strongly, were flimsy and at times lacking in any apparent foundation in reality.  They have all the flavour of casting around for criticism, and of an undigested repetition of things that have been discussed.  I found A to be intellectually mature when discussing matters unrelated to this case: school work, her interests and so on.  But her reasons for not wanting to return were repeated like a mantra, and she continued to assert that she did not want to return to her father or his family, when I made it clear that this was not the issue: she said &#8220;Going back to X automatically means going back to him, no way you won't run into him&#8221;.</p>

There were lighter moments when we were able to laugh together, and I discussed subjects unrelated to these proceedings, such as her interests. A said that I thought that she did not understand the law but she did.  Ms Bartley told me in evidence that A had been different when she saw me: more rigid, just as tearful, but not so spontaneous.  She told me that her account had not been as detailed: there were few specifics.  But I have looked carefully at Ms Bartley&#8217;s report. There were few specifics in Ms Bartley&#8217;s account of the first longer interview in her report: and in her oral evidence she was no more specific.  The kinds of things which A told me were very similar to what she told Ms Bartley. </p>

She knows about habitual residence: the mother&#8217;s original case was that she was entitled to change A&#8217;s habitual residence because the father did not have or was not exercising rights of custody. </p>

Ms Bartley accepted A&#8217;s account that she had insisted on seeing it and her mother had felt unable to resist.  I am far from sure that A was the driving force.  If she was, then she has been inappropriately empowered.  A also told Ms Bartley that her mother had discussed with her whether she had made the right decision and whether they should go back to X (and I note that this is not the mother&#8217;s case).  This I think shows considerable ambivalence and questioning in her own mind about who has made the decision and whether it is the right one.  A has demonstrated that she is inappropriately empowered elsewhere in what she has said to Ms Bartley and to me: such as &#8220;I have the right to decide&#8221;.  Also she has been allowed to believe or to present that she was the driving force in the move: which I do not accept. The offence which she has taken about her father refusing to take her opinion seriously when he suggested that she does not yet have to make up her mind about university indicates a distortion of perception, and very probably one which derives from discussion with others. </p>

But her school in X describes her as well integrated and reports no concerns about bullying. The school report significantly undermines any conclusion that she was an outcast, or not popular at school. A told me that the school was &#8220;OK&#8221;, but she did not want to back there, because she preferred her new school.  But A is not in a position to assess what things will be like for her in her south London school. She may feel that she has different interests from others there too.  Children can be very cruel about others who are perceived to be different, and on the basis of physical appearance, and girls in particular can be superficial and frivolous.   Mother&#8217;s financial position is not secure here either: she may continue to feel left out. </p>

The fact that she took the exams for her school in X, without which she could not return there, is very telling.   This must have taken some effort and she told me that she had to go to the library to access information.  Her emailed replies to her father show a keen interest in knowing about her results, and she did not protest at all about the idea of returning to her school.  She continues to receive and read his emails (and justifies this on the basis that she "has no choice": not objectively the case) and she reads his emails in the middle of the night.  The correspondence itself shows a wholly different relationship between father and daughter than is presented by the mother: who still maintains that A &#8220;hates&#8221; her father and that the father has no interest in her.</p>

I do not think that it is in fact that deep down.  But she has allied herself with her mother.   She cannot express positive or even ambivalent feelings about her father in that environment. Her maternal grandfather may also be an influence: Ms Bartley has not spoken to him. She will not be able to have a relationship with her father whilst in England.  It is highly significant that she stopped replying to his emails once this process commenced.  A showed her ambivalence also by suggesting that her father should come to see her in England, where he visits his older daughters from his previous marriage.  She then retreated from this once she realised the inconsistency about what she had said about not wanting to see him at all. </p>
