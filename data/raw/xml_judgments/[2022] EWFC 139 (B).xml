The respondent is TF&#8217;s former partner, DL and the application concerns their children E aged nine and P aged three. The parents represented themselves at this final hearing. The children were joined as parties by order of 21 June 2021, Mr David Faulkner was appointed as the children&#8217;s guardian, he instructed Nina Skilton of the Smith Partnership who in turn for this final hearing instructed David Payne of counsel.</span></p>

As such there was no order to enforce and indeed in any event P was not born at the date of that hearing. It was agreed and ordered that the application would proceed by way of an application to vary the order of 4 December 2015 or more properly in my estimation an application for a Child Arrangement Order with respect of both children.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">TF regards himself as a litigator focused on furthering human rights and relentlessly pursuing justice in the face of a corrupt court system. The view of the higher courts is that his litigation is ill-judged and frequently abusive in tone. The view of the Single Joint Expert psychiatrist in this matter is that TF has a delusional disorder which exhibits itself in an obsession with litigation. The key issues in this case include determining which of these perspectives is accurate and then applying those findings to the welfare of the children with particular regard to Practice Direction 12J, the Welfare Checklist as set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the presumption of parental involvement and the risk analysis set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sections 1</ref>(2A) and 6 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.

On 4 December 2015 HHJ Thomas determined that the parents could organise how and when TF could see his child between themselves. As such I determined revisiting events between the parties prior to December 2015 was not relevant to my enquiry. I further determined it was not appropriate for me to seek to revisit the findings of other judges in other courts. If any party was aggrieved with the findings of others, they should pursue that in the relevant court and when all avenues of appeal were exhausted those findings become legal fact. The parents represented themselves and I further indicated that I would not hear evidence on matters the parents did not have direct knowledge of where no effort had been made to adduce that evidence in accordance with the rules governing hearsay.</span></p>

He confirmed TF was pleasant and co-operative throughout the assessment. Dr Rafiq confirmed that TF had capacity to litigate. He had experienced childhood trauma in that his father was killed in a workplace accident when he was six but he was not told the truth about the death. He attended two different Universities but did not complete either course. One course was Law. He believed he had been kidnapped by X Police and that incident and their subsequent &#8216;harassment&#8217; ruined his education. He had not worked since 2016 and spent a lot of his time fighting legal proceedings. He stated he had been arrested at court for threats to kill a judge. He indicated that due to the judge acting in a treasonous manner he was legally entitled to stab him in the neck. He has six (now seven) children with five (now six) different partners. He indicated he had not been violent towards any of his partners but had been the recipient of violence. He accepted that he had been diagnosed with a delusional disorder but believed it was an incorrect diagnosis. He had been detained in mental health institutions in March 2016 and October 2017. He was prescribed depot anti-psychotic medication but has ceased taking it because of its side effects.</span></p>

A letter from his clinic dated 24 April 2020 repeated the diagnosis of a delusional disorder. At that point it was reported he was stable and able to function meeting his own basic needs, signs of relapse would be an increase in delusional ideation which would impact on his functioning for example a preoccupation with legal services, making unfounded allegations that might lead him into coming into contact with the emergency services. Other signs of decline might include increased reliance on hypnotics or cannabis, poor sleep, poor appetite and self-neglect.</span></p>

She again denied meeting TF in April of this year, she was absolutely clear about this. She was again confronted with evidence she had met up and she then accepted she had. It matters not why they met up but the meeting was preceded by sexualised texting from TF. What matters is her untruthfulness about this to the court and to the Guardian.

She exhibited a CRB check which appeared not to show it which would support that contention. The family were known to X Local Authority and concerns were raised in 2018 when DL denied previous local authority involvement, presumable in the context of ante natal care for P which was not true.
