V was introduced to ELO&#8217;s sister, A. The MWASD met to approve A as a carer for V under a delegated fostering arrangement, which is confirmed in the letter dated 4 July 2016 from the Director of Child Development MWASD. V was introduced to her two grandmothers and, in keeping with Nigerian tradition, each grandmother named her. At the end of March 2013, the Applicants returned to the UK and began making enquiries as to how V could enter the UK to live with them. They initially contacted PACT for a home study report to be undertaken, they were advised this was going to cost between &#163;6 - 8,000, which they state they were unaware of. As a result they needed to save to fund the report, and were unable to afford to return to Nigeria until 2014. </span></p>

She said that in her role as the Probation Officer and Appropriate investigating officer, she was satisfied, having considered all the evidence, that the Applicants were eligible to adopt a child in Anambra State and made a recommendation to the Court on the basis of the evidence available.

The basis for his asylum claim was that he had a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria due to his political opinion. CLO was granted indefinite leave to remain on 5 December 2002 on the basis that he had spent four years in the UK as a refugee. His refugee status would have prevented the use of his Nigerian passport, and travel to Nigeria. He was granted a refugee travel document which permitted him to travel to all countries except Nigeria. He was granted British Citizenship on 3 November 2011, in his application form he confirmed that in the preceding 5 years he had spent only 49 days outside the UK (In Ghana, Cameroon and Germany), no time in Nigeria and that he was planning to have the UK as his main home if naturalised. Since then he has only visited Nigeria on four occasions.

They have retained a family home in Nigeria and have plans to build another home there, they have financially supported their family there and, in the case of CLO, did not historically make arrangements for his family to join him here. They have each actively retained their close family, social and cultural ties and attachments to Nigeria. They are an integral part of the Nigeria diaspora here and actively retain their Nigerian customs and heritage here, through the way they live and their social and religious contacts.

Mr Badejo concludes that it is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;seriously arguable that the obligatory provisions in section 134 can be waived if the court considers such waiver to be in the child&#8217;s best interest&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> As V had been living with the applicant&#8217;s family for 12 months, such waiver is explicable and in Mr Badejo&#8217;s opinion </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;lawful&#8217;. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The Applicants were not legal represented.

Ms Cronin submits the court made its decision apprised of all that information. The court is entitled to have regard to the fact that Anambra States recognition that the adoptive child&#8217;s required care and home could be with the extended family reflects their family customs. Ms Cronin recognises that Anambra&#8217;s approach to adoption may differ in some respects from that here, but comity calls for recognition of their adoption order. She submits the order has been made by the constituted court, and has not been appealed or revoked. The court had before it all the relevant evidence, was guided by the MWASD official with responsibility for the adoptive child and the decision is stated to be in the best interests of the child. It is, she submits, a matter for the Anambra Court to insist upon compliance with section 134, or to waive certain of its requirements.</span></p>

She submits there is no contemporaneous evidence to support the assertion that the Nigerian court waived the mandatory requirements. In particular, she places reliance on no reference to this on the face of the court order; the affidavit from Mr E does not refer to the Applicants living in the UK or that V was cared for by the wider family; the home visit report referring to the Applicants&#8217; home town as being in Nigeria. In her submission reliance can&#8217;t be placed on Mrs O&#8217;s letter written over 3 years after the adoption hearing without it being clear what her source of information was.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I have carefully considered the information that is available to the court. There is no suggestion the Applicants sought to hide the fact that they were living in the UK at the relevant time or that V was placed with A, with the consent of the MWASD. Their residence in the UK was clear in their initial letter to MWASD, their UK address was on the front of the home study report and the adoption order refers to the Applicants being able to travel and reside outside Nigeria with V. So there is no suggestion that they have sought to mislead the court or that this information was not before the court when it made the adoption order. The same applies regarding the placement of V in the care of A, as part of the extended family. The Applicants set out this was with the knowledge and approval of the MWASD, which is confirmed by Mrs O. The Applicants describe how the MWASD were involved in the process from the start, which is supported by the documents and ELO&#8217;s account of her involvement with Mr E, his knowledge of the circumstances and the court hearing was not challenged. Mr Badejo made clear in his written report and his oral evidence he relied on the letter from Mrs O dated 20 July, he did not have similar information available to him in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re V (ibid)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> so there is no inconsistency in his opinion (as was suggested by Ms van Overdijk) as he had different information available to him. The letter dated 20 July sets out the basis upon which the requirements could be waived. I reject the suggestion by Ms van Overdijk that, in effect, no reliance can be put on this letter. In similar circumstances in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re W,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> Pauffley J accepted Ms Cronin&#8217;s wide construction of the phrase </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;in the care of&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. In that case, as here, the child was placed in the care of the wider family under the direction and supervision of the Applicants. Mr Badejo&#8217;s advice in that case, as here, strongly supports the contention that V&#8217;s welfare interests predominated in accordance with Child Rights Law of the State in question and the inference must be that the residence requirements were capable of liberal interpretation, both as to precise timescales and delegation of the care of the child. This supports what Mr Badejo states in this case. I am satisfied this adoption order was made in accordance with the requirements of Nigerian law.</span></p>
