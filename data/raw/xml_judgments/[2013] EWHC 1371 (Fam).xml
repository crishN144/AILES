On that morning, I received e-mail communication from Goodman Ray, solicitors instructed by Mrs Z, seeking an adjournment of this hearing for several days so that she could be represented at this hearing.  I declined that application as sought because: (a) Mrs Z has known about this application, and the Order I first made in respect of it, since 3 May 2013; (b) Mrs Z&#8217;s argument for the continuation of the current comprehensive Reporting Restriction Order (including a prohibition on the reporting of her name) irrespective of the outcome of the criminal trial is advanced on behalf of Mr Z (by Miss Lazarus) in any event; and (c) I heard briefly from Mrs Z&#8217;s new partner, in person; nothing said by her partner suggested that Mrs Z had any independent, or novel, point to advance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Lazarus has argued that a guilty verdict on any of the 24 counts of fraud should not disturb the balance currently positioned marginally in favour of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Article 8</span> rights of the children; she contends that the current embargo should hold firm. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She refers to the fact that there has in fact been some partial reporting of the trial by NGN Ltd and others already (thus pointing out, fairly, that I was in error in assuming that this would not be possible in any meaningful way), and disparages what she describes as the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">sensational</span>&#8221; nature of the press coverage in The Sun newspaper (8 May 2013).  She expresses concern that any reporting of the outcome of the trial is likely to focus on the children rather than the defendant, and seeks to illuminate that submission by reference to the already published piece.</p>

It is apparent (from both the letter and supporting submissions) that an outline &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">crisis</span>&#8217; plan (see [2013] EWHC 1150 &#167;93) has been devised to assist E to cope with the consequences of her mother being convicted and associated press reporting.</p>

She rejects the claim of sensational reporting of the trial thus far, and reminds me (so far as any future reporting is concerned) that the press has a responsibility for conscientious and lawful reporting of criminal process, following specifically the letter of the Editor&#8217;s Code of Conduct.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, the marginal re-weighting of factors in this case in the event of a conviction would tilt the balance in favour of freedom of expression.  It follows that in the event that Mrs Z is convicted of any of the counts on the indictment, I consider that the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Article 10</span> right to publish her name as a convicted person prevails over the right of the whole family to anonymity in the press.   It would, in my judgment, be unconscionable for the public not to know the name of a person convicted of fraud, possibly (depending on the extent of the guilty verdicts) substantial fraud, upon the State.   In so finding, I have very much in mind the powerful (albeit <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span>) comments of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Trinity Mirror</span> [2008] 2 Cr.

I regret that by involving the children in any proven crime, the mother herself must take significant responsibility for the public acquiring knowledge of her exploitation of them.  </p>

It is with considerable regret that in varying the Reporting Restriction Order in the event of a conviction, I will expose the children of Mrs Z to the risk of identification.  A guilty verdict would reflect the jury&#8217;s satisfaction that Mrs Z had improperly used her children as innocent instruments of her crime; if this is the outcome of the criminal process, then it is she alone who has unhappily heaped upon her family the misery, shame and disadvantage, which is the inevitable consequence of her offending. </p>
