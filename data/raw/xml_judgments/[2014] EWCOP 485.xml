	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is concerned with applications originally made by the London Borough of Redbridge under the Inherent Jurisdiction of the High Court in respect of an elderly woman considered to be a vulnerable adult and a proposed application under the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 in respect of the same elderly woman following psychiatric evidence of lack of capacity due to mental impairment. Before the case can proceed any further a decision has to be reached as to capacity; if G lacks capacity and if she does whether it is because of mental impairment within the meaning of the MCA sections 2 and 3 or if not whether she is a vulnerable adult deprived of capacity by constraint, coercion or undue influence and so entitled to the protection of the court under its inherent jurisdiction. The local authority and the Official Solicitor (who acts as litigation friend for G) have both submitted that G lacks capacity and falls within the MCA. C (her current live-in carer) submits that she does not lack capacity under the MCA nor has she been deprived of it by duress or the influence of C and F.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case the local authority were under a duty to investigate the circumstances of an old and frail lady following reports regarding the behaviour of C and F and their influence over G, her home and her financial affairs and with respect to her personal safety from multiple sources including private citizens and professionals, from agencies providing care support and from a lawyer engaged by C to act for G (to change her will in C&#8217;s favour). The complaints came from G too; although she would later retract them. The obstruction met by the social worker when she tried to carry out her duties led to the attendance of the police more than once.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority had no alternative but to visit on numerous occasions and to attempt to see G on her own. Anything else would have been a dereliction of their duty to her as a vulnerable person about whom they had received complaints about possible financial predation. Local authority staff must be permitted to carry out their duty to investigate reports relating to safeguarding unhindered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court has decided for reasons set out in full below that G lacks capacity under the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> and that further investigation needs to be carried out to decide how her best interests will be met and her comfort and safety assured. Her wishes and feelings will be taken into account at every stage as will her desire to remain in her own home. It is the court&#8217;s intention that every measure that can be put in place to secure her in her own home is put place. There is an equal need to ensure that she is not overborne or bullied and that she can lead her life as she wants it led. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All the expert evidence put before the court was of the opinion that G was a vulnerable person who lacked the capacity to conduct this litigation and to decide on her financial affairs and the disposition of her property without the assistance of an independent professional appointed by the court. There was disagreement as to the reason for the lack of capacity; the court decided, on the balance of probabilities, that it was due to a impairment of G&#8217;s mind or brain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The elderly lady, G, with whom the court is concerned lives in her own home in London. G is 94 years old. She worked for many years in the health service and should now be enjoying the end of her retirement at home, in comfort and in peace. G has herself told me from the well of the court on more than one occasion that she is her own woman, she knows her own mind, that she and the people living with her are family and that they want to be left alone and not bothered. It is not hard to imagine that these proceedings must feel like the most unwelcome and distressing intrusion into her life. I was impressed by her dignity and determination to say what she wanted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">G is British African Caribbean; her family came from Barbados and lived in St Lucia for a time. G has never married and has no children. She has no family living in the UK; her only family appears to be her surviving sibling, a brother C, who lives in Barbados and a cousin or niece, O, who lives in the Netherlands. G lives in the house that she bought in 1983. G suffers from conditions that have limited her mobility; arthritis, rheumatism, a dislocation of her left knee and carpal tunnel syndrome. She also has high blood pressure and double incontinence. G rarely leaves home now, except for hospital appointments. But she has come to court and sat in court all day for the two days of this hearing. G is clearly an intelligent and a capable woman and she has been and wants to continue to be independent. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I set out the facts as they appear on the papers before the court: G first came to the notice of the local authority when her GP contacted them following some invasive surgery in March 2011. Following this a care support package was put in place providing two calls each day to assist with care and meals. In November of the same year there was a safeguarding referral as G alleged that money had been stolen from her house; but as it was not possible to ascertain that the money had been in her home there was an inconclusive investigation. In July 2012 G again alleged money had gone missing and a 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> safeguarding referral was inconclusive.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In March 2013 G&#8217;s case was allocated to a social worker (Ms Murray) following a safeguarding referral made by a care co-ordinator from Carewatch. Carewatch had been providing the care support package put in place which included twice daily visits. It was reported by the daily carers that there were concerns that C (identified as G&#8217;s lodger) was possibly intimidating her; C asked to be named as G&#8217;s next of kin and refused to leave the room when they were attending to her personal care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Initially Ms Murray visited G at home on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013 and G told her that C and her husband F had moved into her home around May 2012; they had been introduced by a friend at church. G said she needed help at night so the arrangement was that C would move in to provide it and that she would live there, rent-free, in return. G said that C wanted to order her around and she could only go upstairs at 9 pm and not before and her access was blocked; that C had taken over the house and told her to stay out of the kitchen; that C ignored G&#8217;s wishes. G confirmed that C would not leave the room when the carers were attending to her and ignored requests to leave and that C was very possessive. C listened in from the other side of the door and entered the room shouting and ranting, saying she did not like the questions G was being asked. However when the social worker returned the next day G retracted the allegations saying she could not remember the visit of the day before, she did not want to be asked questions and felt she was being harassed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There followed a safeguarding referral on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013 from Age UK. This concerned the bullying behaviour of H (then recorded as G&#8217;s next of kin). There were complaints regarding the behaviour of the carers; that they were inattentive, ate food from the fridge and arrived at different times. This complaint originated from A (a church elder), and by the time it was received H was no longer visiting G. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013 there was a request from G to cancel her care support package. This was communicated by A, who did not give a reason for the request. On the same day one of the care workers reported that G had told her the request came from C. G told the care worker that she was no longer free in her house or safe any more. There followed another visit by the social worker accompanied by a senior practitioner. They were unable to speak to G on her own &#8211; F stayed in the room. She said that the care package was cancelled as C was doing everything for her. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During March 2013 when on a house call G&#8217;s GP was unable to see G on her own; despite asking for privacy C stayed in the room. A, a church elder visiting G, reported that he was unable to speak to G on her own. The local authority became concerned that G would often change her mind about what she had said, not only withdrawing complaints about C but also changing her mind when she spoke positively of someone, such as her erstwhile care worker. There were concerns that this was as a result of manipulation by C. The change of view invariably occurred when C was in the room. The local authority became concerned about the management of G&#8217;s financial affairs and that this may be happening because she was increasingly isolated. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013 the social worker visited to complete a safeguarding risk assessment. C was present as was A. G said that she was not at risk and that she was satisfied with the support provided by C. The support provide by Age UK was also cancelled in April 2013.  G refused the offer of daily monitoring calls and declined support to apply for attendance allowance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time of the first visit by the social worker G was being regularly visited by members of the church and supported by them. However their visits have been discouraged to the extent that G, at the time of this hearing now has little or nothing to do with them. G had been a member of her local Seventh - Day Adventist church for over 10 years. When her health deteriorated in 2011 and she was no longer able to attend church, there was a rota arranged to visit her at home. Two members of the church were named as executors in her will. Someone from the church (A) was helping with her financial affairs.  It was through A that G came to the attention of the local authority again in May of 2013; he alleged financial abuse and said the C was attempting to take over the affairs of G. Again the investigation into the allegation was considered inconclusive. </p>

Each wrote down a description of their visit and they reported their concerns to social services asking them to investigate. The Pastor reported that he had visited following a phone call from G who was complaining that she was having serious problems with the people who were in her house; C interrupted the call, taking it over saying that neither she nor G wanted A to deal with the finances. According to the pastor A had done this for some time with the agreement of O (G&#8217;s niece). </p>

They described G as looking fearful while C was in the room and visibly relaxing when she left. G complained that she was not allowed to speak privately on the phone, that her money was being spent on high phone bills; she expressed a fear that she would end up losing her house. She said that she was in a corner in her own house. She complained that A (the church elder) had withdrawn cash and not given it to her. G complained that she was not allowed access to her mail. She was described as no longer appearing to be as she had in the past, an independent person, and as being more physically frail than she had been previously. She was described as being dependant on her lodgers and having to placate them. G said she was in a mess and asked for some government authority to intervene on her behalf. </p>

C then took the phone and started shouting saying she was now in charge of G&#8217;s affairs from the government&#8217;s point of view. The pastor called O who said she and G&#8217;s brother were extremely unhappy about C&#8217;s influence over G.

It is believed that she had left the bulk of her estate to the church. He became concerned about what he witnessed during his visit. He was told that G had been ostracised by the church. He was able to see G on her own but was presented with a piece of paper on which was written in C&#8217;s writing &#8220;I wish to leave my house my money to A and F&#8221; signed by G. G said to L that she had been told by C and her husband to leave everything to them. G said she wanted her brother CG and his family to be beneficiaries. L was able to assess the size of her estate which appeared to be in excess of &#163;300,000. In her note book he observed that G had written the words &#8220;threatening behaviour&#8221; under the names of C and F. G told him they were being very bad to her. She later said that C had told her that if she made alternative care arrangements C would tell everyone that G had Alzheimer&#8217;s so that she would placed in residential care. This is something that G greatly fears. L thought G appeared resigned to her predicament. When leaving he said he would be contacting G&#8217;s brother to act as Attorney.</p>

G initially said C should stay in the room; but C was accompanied upstairs by the police officer. C told the social worker that she felt obliged to change her will in exchange for the support she provided; she confirmed that neither C nor F contribute to the household expenses and that C bosses her around and shouts at her; although she was good to her now. She again said that she did not see her bank statements and did not know how much she had in the bank but that she wanted a quiet home. G revealed that she had signed papers for some man that day that she could not identify. G said the visit would result in her being shouted at but that she would not be physically harmed. On departure C began shouting at the social worker saying that she hated her; once outside C could be heard shouting and slamming doors.

C called the friend the next day and said that she did not want her to visit. N said that she no longer visited and that one by one the visitors from the church had ceased to visit. N went on to say that G had changed and her mental ability seems to have been affected, C always stayed in the room and never left G alone with her.

Counsel for C, Ms Hewson, submitted that his evidence should be taken into account by the court. Despite the failure to comply with any of the procedural rules pertaining to the preparation and production of expert evidence and provided Dr Lowenstein&#8217;s evidence could be challenged by cross-examination, I allowed it in as G was aware of it, having been taken to see Dr Lowenstein. It is important for her to be aware that the court had heard all the available evidence about her capacity.

The obstruction of C and by F led to the intervention of the police more than once. Local authority staff should be permitted to carry out their duties unhindered.</p>

It was said on behalf of C that there were no decisions to be made other than day to day decisions about her care and therefore the court need not intervene as there were &#8220;no major decisions on the cards&#8221;. While that may be true as of the end of this hearing, there being no alternative care plan in place, it is, at the very least disingenuous, as the decisions about who is to live with G and how her care and financial affairs are to be managed are what is at issue and are complex and difficult matters about which G has to be able to decide. It is not a &#8220;moot decision&#8221; that the court is being asked to make but one that is entirely pertinent to G&#8217;s welfare and longer-term future care. Similarly it was put that there was no need to appoint a financial deputy or to have a public health and welfare deputy appointed in place of C as C was able to continue to deal with day to day financial matters and, in the case of the latter there were no major health or welfare issues.</p>

From what she has said to others G knows that she needs help with her personal care and that C provides that. G is an old lady and she has sat in court displaying dignity and  determination to get her views across. It is the duty of this court to listen to what she says and to keep it in mind when considering the evidence about her, about her capacity and when reaching a conclusion about her ability to make her own decisions. As I shall first consider whether G lacks capacity under the MCA I keep in mind the principle that it is assumed she has capacity unless it is established, on the balance of probabilities that she does not. </p>

There was an advocate present, L, who said that he had been employed by C and was to report back to her.  G seemed to be unaware of who he was or the reason for his presence. She complained about H and her husband and said the proceedings in the High Court were initiated by them. She described being shouted at by C and F; that they had her bank card and PIN and that she did not know how much money they took out. She explained that she needed help because of her poor health. She appeared to be in ignorance of and confused about her financial situation. She thought social services were after her money. On applying the Montreal Cognitive assessment Dr Barker concluded that G could not maintain attention and concentration, and had a low score on delayed recall of 5 words. G was unable to retain information, a necessary part of the function of decision-making. In addition G was worried about being taken out of her own house and put in the &#8220;mad house&#8221;.

In his oral evidence he explained how the thought process in decision making is affected by short-term memory loss. While past memories may be clear to make decisions one has to bring past memories and experience forward and apply them to the present and the future. G&#8217;s loss of short term memory seriously compromised her ability to do this and to make decisions. More complex decisions such as who lives with one require abstract thought weighing relevant information and experience in the present and G&#8217;s ability to do this was impaired.</p>

That latter is certainly true and, again, is not a matter of dispute between any of these witnesses. Dr Barker said that G did not have the capacity to make decisions regarding having contact with others for the same reasons as she could not decide about who she lived with and that this was harder for her because of the influence of C and F. He had found that G was unaware of her financial situation, income or expenditure and that her finances were controlled by C and F without her involvement; but that even if she were supported she could not do so because of impaired retention and an inability to weigh information due to mental disorder. </p>

If, as appeared to be the case, he felt sympathy for her and did not wish to say that she lacked capacity that is understandable but it is not the rigorous or analytical approach required of the expert witness.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Taking as my starting point the assumption that G has capacity I ignore the wisdom or otherwise of allowing strangers to live in her house and control her finances. I turn to the evidence regarding G&#8217;s capacity or lack of it; Dr Barker and Mr Gillman-Smith both found evidence that G lacked capacity (as did Dr Lowenstein to an extent) but differed in their reasoning; their evidence is set out above [50] &#8211; [61] and I do not repeat it here. The requirement of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1 (3)</ref> that G is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps have been taken without success is, in this case, more difficult to assess as any steps taken by the local authority or others  have been hampered by the actions of C and, to a lesser extent, F. However the local authority has, on many occasions, attempted to intervene on G&#8217;s behalf and tried to assist her without any success. </p>

When it comes to this question I prefer the evidence of Dr Barker, for reasons I have alluded to previously. He is an expert in Old Age Psychiatry and eminently qualified to reach the conclusion that he did; finding evidence of significant cognitive impairment on the basis of his examination of G which included carrying out tests recognised and approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). There is no evidence from an equally well qualified expert to gainsay his evidence and on the balance of probabilities I find that G has an impairment of her mind or brain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second stage, under the provisions of s 3, is to consider whether this impairment of her mind or brain has rendered G incapable of making decisions in relation to 1) the people who live with her; 2) contact with others; 3) financial matters; and 4) litigation capacity in respect of those three areas. The evidence before the court in respect of G&#8217;s litigation capacity has not been challenged and therefore in the absence of any evidence to the contrary I find that G is not able to reach decisions as to this litigation because of impairment of her mind or brain as diagnosed by Dr Barker. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of financial matters there is evidence that G is unaware of her financial situation, of her income and expenditure. While there is good reason to believe from what she herself has told others, that this information is being kept from her and that she is fearful of C should she try to regain control, there is also evidence that she has difficulties in retaining information and formulating decisions as described by Dr Barker [46]. Both he and Mr Gillman-Smith considered the influence and controlling behaviour of C and F to make decision making even more difficult for G; it is obvious to this court from what she has said that she is at times almost paralysed by the threats regarding her removal to a care-home or to have F take over her personal and intimate care. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The impairment of G&#8217;s brain has affected her ability to retain information relevant to the decisions she has to make, as described by Dr Barker. She has difficulty in understanding the necessary information and to use and weigh the information. G could not remember the details of her will, and did not know the name of the advocate present when she saw Dr Barker or why he was there, despite having told Dr Barker his name the previous week. G referred to C and F as H and R (the previous carers) and expressed paranoid ideas about social services and previous friends from the church saying they were after what they could get from her. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is evidence that G understands some of the information relevant to decision making, for example she well understands that she is frail and needs assistance with her personal care and house-work to be able to remain in her home and that C provides that care. At the same time G is either unaware of or unable to remember details of C&#8217;s and F&#8217;s backgrounds; she could not, for example, say how old they were. She also understands that C and F have taken control of her finances and has complained about being shouted at and physically shaken but she is unable to use the information to make a decision about her own welfare and care and allows them to remain in her home. This information about C and F living with her or not is relevant for the purposes of s3 (4) as it includes the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or another or failing to make the decision. The decision as to contact with others and whether or not she should see other people falls into this same category. She does not foresee that to allow visitors would have benefits including oversight of her care and treatment at the hands of others. I accept that the influence and controlling behaviour of C and F described by the witnesses and in the documentary evidence before the court will have further compromised the ability of G to make decisions and understand what is happening to her.</p>
