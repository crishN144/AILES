On 27 March 2018, Roberts J made an order providing for the instruction of a Mr A of a firm I shall refer to as XYZ as SJE to value a company which I shall refer to as S; the order provided that the report (the Report) was to be filed by 4 May 2018 and that Mr V alone was to be responsible for paying the SJE&#8217;s fees. It was agreed that XYZ&#8217;s fees would not exceed &#163;62,500 plus VAT, a total of &#163;75,000. Instructions were given to the SJE on 28 March 2018. Despite the terms of the order, the Report was not received by the parties until 5 June 2018. On 7 June 2018, a financial dispute resolution (FDR) hearing took place before Moor J. </p>

So far as material for present purposes, it contained the following provisions: an undertaking by Mr V to provide security for the second lump sum payment of &#163;1.1 million (para 15); an undertaking by him to continue to make payments equivalent to the periodical payments to Ms W notwithstanding her remarriage, until payment of the second lump sum (para 18); an order that he pay her lump sums (a) of &#163;1m within 3 months and (b) of &#163;1.1m by 19 June 2023 (para 24); an order that in the event of late payment of the lump sums simple interest should accrue on the remaining balance of the lump sum(s) at the rate applicable for the time being to a High Court judgment debt (para 25); an order that he pay her periodical payments at the rate of &#163;50,000 per annum, ending upon payment of the second lump payment (para 33); and an order that he make payments for benefit of the child of the marriage at the rate of &#163;25,000 per annum, the payments to end upon the cesser of full-time tertiary education to first degree level, including a gap year (para 34). There was also (para 40) the usual liberty to apply &#8220;concerning the implementation and timing of the terms of this order only.&#8221; The decree nisi of divorce was made absolute in January 2019. </p>

So far as material for present purposes it was further alleged: that because of the late delivery of the Report he and his legal advisers &#8220;were prejudiced in their conduct of the FDR and of the financial proceedings&#8221; (defence, para 15); that at the FDR Moor J &#8220;gave a strong indication that any judge at the final hearing would most likely make findings of fact as to [his] total matrimonial assets, including his interest in S, which were based on the valuations in the report and that this would have a consequential effect on the size of capital and/or other payments which [he] would be required to make to [the wife]&#8221; (counterclaim, para 24); and that &#8220;In reliance on the Report and/or on the effect which the Report was likely to have on the reasoning of the judge hearing any final hearing&#8221; he and his legal representatives entered into negotiations and thereafter reached the settlement embodied in Roberts J&#8217;s order (counterclaim, para 25).

Despite his best endeavours to enlighten me as to how Mr V was now putting his case and how he might seek to amend his pleadings, Mr Finch left me far from clear in my own mind as to these important points, though I understood him to be saying that his client was going to abandon both his case as pleaded on the &#8220;indication&#8221; and his claim as pleaded to the very large damages being sought. I was told there might be added a more modest claim for damages in respect of costs unnecessarily incurred, so it was said, in considering the Report. I was also left unclear as to why, given these proposed amendments, it was said that Mr V needed disclosure of all the 201 pages of documents now being sought. Why he needed to have disclosure of all this material to haul down the flag eluded me &#8211; hence the order I made (see below). I do not, in saying this, criticise Mr Finch. He is not instructed in the civil proceedings and, as he told me in answer to a specific question, the proposed amended pleading had not yet been drafted. </p>

So far as concerns the FDR, the relevant provisions are in FPR 9.15(4), 9.17 and PD9A, para 6. For present purposes, two aspects of the FDR process are significant. The first is that the FDR is compulsory and both parties must personally attend: the parties cannot themselves contract out of it, though they can pre-empt the FDR by embarking upon a &#8216;private&#8217; FDR: see <span style="font-style:italic">President&#8217;s Circular: Financial Remedies Court Pilot Phase 2</span>, 27 July 2018, paras 7-11. The other is the obligation on the parties to hold nothing back at the FDR and, indeed, to put forward their best offers. Moreover, it is fundamental that the FDR is a confidential process, differing from other types of family hearings in two significant respects: first, journalists are not permitted to attend the FDR: FPR 27.11(1)(a); secondly, the judge hearing the FDR must have no further involvement with the case: FPR 9.17(2).  </p>

Nor, indeed, would the judge. And, I might add, the same would apply if the client wished to make a complaint about the conduct of the judge conducting the FDR. All that I readily accept, but is it enough to justify a judge departing from what, in my judgment, are the plain words of PD9A, para 6.2? </p>

It is, as it seems to me, entirely consistent with the remainder of the statutory provisions providing for and regulating the FDR. And I cannot identify any respect in which it might otherwise be said to be wrong in law. If the law regulating the FDR is thought to be unsatisfactory, then the remedy lies with the relevant lawmakers: in the case of the FPR the Family Procedure Rule Committee and, in the case of a Practice Direction, the President of the Family Division. They, after all, are in a much better position than a judge to decide if change is needed and, in particular, if it is, to decide what form that change should take. Indeed, were a judge to embark upon the latter task, the judge would no longer be acting as a judge but arrogating to himself the function of a legislator. </p>

It is that parties should be encouraged so far as possible to settle their disputes without resort to litigation and should not be discouraged by the knowledge that anything that is said in the course of such negotiations (and that includes, of course, as much the failure to reply to an offer as an actual reply) may be used to their prejudice in the course of the proceedings. They should, as it was expressed by Clauson J in <span style="font-style:italic">Scott Paper Co v Drayton Paper Works Ltd</span> (1927) 44 RPC 151, 156, be encouraged fully and frankly to put their cards on the table. ...

The court still has control over documents &#8220;filed or lodged in the court office&#8221; and permission pursuant to FPR 29.12(1) is therefore required to disclose them. Moreover, as he points out, that rule is supplemented by the &#8216;implied undertaking&#8217; by parties not to use information disclosed to them in financial remedy proceedings for any other purposes: see, amongst other authorities, <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allan</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2002/45" uk:canonical="[2002] EWCA Civ 45" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWCA Civ 45</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] Fam 261" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] Fam 261</ref>. He accepted in his written position statement that, insofar as the documents in issue had not been &#8220;filed or lodged in the court office&#8221;, they are likely captured by the implied undertaking. He went on: &#8220;permission is therefore sought in respect of them all.&#8221; He reiterated that in his oral submissions: &#8220;even so far those documents have not been lodged in court they are still subject to the court&#8217;s permission because likely to be captured by the implied undertaking of the parties not to use the documents for any other purpose &#8230; I do not draw a distinction &#8230; I accept I require permission with respect to both.&#8221; </p>

As a general rule documents and other evidence produced in ancillary relief proceedings (now called financial remedy proceedings) are not disclosable to third parties outside the proceedings save that exceptionally and rarely and for very good reason they can be disclosed with the leave of the court. The fact that the evidence may be relevant or useful is not by itself a good enough reason to undermine the rule.&#8221; </p>

Nor, as a separate point which goes only to the FDR materials, am I persuaded that there is any need for him (even if it were permissible) to plead what took place at the FDR (paragraph 22). Mr V can justify the disclosure sought only if it is actually needed by him to support some legally sustainable defence or counterclaim in the civil proceedings. I am not persuaded that it is. </p>
