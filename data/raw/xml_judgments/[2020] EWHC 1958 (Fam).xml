The Applicant Trust is represented before me by counsel Ms Watson, 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> and 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondents are represented by leading counsel Ms Powell QC, and X is represented by her own leading counsel Ms Butler-Cole QC through her court-appointed guardian. The Applicant Trust seeks declarations that it is lawful and in X&#8217;s best interests to receive palliative care (also known as symptom management) to keep her comfortable and pain free and to maintain her dignity, and that the following treatment is not in X&#8217;s best interests and it is not lawful for the following treatment to be provided.  </p>

With the encouragement of the Court two mediation meetings took place on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2020 and on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2020, attended by X&#8217;s treating clinicians from the Applicant Trust. The meetings allowed for an exchange of information about X&#8217;s condition and her parents were able to voice their concerns and although no agreement was reached it paved the way for the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> and 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondents to read and listen to the evidence of  the two independent experts in paediatric intensive care Dr Inwald (instructed by the Applicant) and Dr Nadel (instructed by the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> and 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondents) and to agree that it is not in X&#8217;s best interests to undergo elective surgery, save for urgent palliative surgery.    </p>

The key remaining issues in respect of declarations were whether it was in X&#8217;s best interest to receive Optiflow, a form of non-invasive ventilation delivered by cylinder placed under the nose, in the event of a deterioration in her condition; and, whether it is in X&#8217;s best interests to be re-admitted to the intensive care unit and receive intensive care, including inotropic support (excluding those treatments above), in the event of a deterioration in her condition.  </p>

When she was still an infant X was diagnosed with Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS), a disorder affecting kidney function, and in 2012 developed end stage renal disease for which she received a donor kidney transplant in the USA in 2013; she now has a complex medical history. Her current diagnosis includes renal disease secondary to Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS), chronic lung disease and intestinal failure. X underwent the kidney transplant surgery in Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital in the USA in 2013 and has spent the greatest part of her short life as an inpatient in various hospitals in the USA, Switzerland, and the UK.   </p>

In his oral evidence to the Court, X&#8217;s father, the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent, who was understandably positive and optimistic about his daughter&#8217;s condition, was at pains to point out that not all of the time that X was in hospital was for her to receive medical treatment <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> but that she had been in rehabilitation and/or awaiting the provision of appropriate support and care provision at home. Nonetheless the complexity of X&#8217;s multiple and inter-linked conditions and resulting symptoms have obviously made living at home almost impossible, as submitted by the Applicant X&#8217;s extensive medical records show that since the beginning of 2019, apart from two days at home, X has been in hospital and overall has spent over a year of her life in paediatric intensive care units. Even though the Applicant supports X&#8217;s parents&#8217; wish to have X at home there remains treatment that she needs which would prevent that happening in the immediate future, matters which I shall return to below.    </p>

Prior to the kidney transplant in Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital, X suffered from a cardiac arrest leading to hypoxic ischaemic brain damage, as a consequence of which she developed four limb cerebral palsy with severe dystonia. X has cortical blindness, with no light awareness and severe developmental delay, she is unable to communicate verbally. Secondary to her cardiac arrest, she suffered from ischaemia of her bowel and has had to undergo multiple operations to remove the ischaemic bowel leading to the formation of stomas, episodes of bowel obstruction necessitating further abdominal surgery, gastro-oesophageal reflux, intestinal failure and is dependent on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). </p>

During her current admission X&#8217;s case and her treatment have been the subject of a number of multidisciplinary team meetings.  The consensus was, and remains, that any escalation of treatment, including, but not limited to, renal replacement therapy, extra corporeal pulmonary support, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, or increased levels of intensive care support, are not in X&#8217;s best interests.  The clinical team at GOSH considers that escalating treatment carries significant burdens and would have minimal benefit for X.  It is the strongly held view of the clinical team that it would not be in X&#8217;s best interests to have an unplanned death on PICU and that she should receive palliative care to allow her to have a compassionate and dignified death surrounded by her family at home if possible or elsewhere if not.  </p>

X&#8217;s parents, entirely understandably, chose to focus on any improvements in X&#8217;s condition following her acute deteriorations during this admission but those improvements are relative as there has been no sustained or substantial improvement in X&#8217;s pathology.  The medical evidence is (as can be seen above) that X&#8217;s admissions to intensive care have become more frequent and longer in duration. Moreover the records and medical opinion disclose that an improvement in one condition following an acute deterioration inevitably has a negative impact elsewhere, such as restricting fluid intake to prevent fluid overload and retention affecting the child&#8217;s chronic kidney disease and her nutrition, or that any and each deterioration requiring invasive ventilatory support causes further damage to X&#8217;s already damaged lungs.  As Dr Nadel put it in his report, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;she has recurrent acute crises from which she recovers and then soon deteriorates again either on the PICU or on the ward where she only managed a few days. The periods in which she interacts with her family, enjoys music and giggles/smiles are very infrequent and I understand that she has spent only about 16 days in her home environment in 7 years. The issue for the PICU team is the balance between these few episodes (where she is able to interact with her family) and the far more frequent periods she is being instrumented and subjected to painful procedures.&#8221; </span></p>

The Guardian may have been reassured, as I was to a degree, to be informed that the Applicant generally takes the approach of involving parents, but the fact that in this case, which was then the subject of proceedings in the Family Division and where there already were (and remained) issues between the parents and the hospital there was no involvement of the parents, or of their views being placed by the committee for consideration during their deliberations, is a matter of some concern. I remain uncertain as to why it was not felt possible to involve the parents with the Ethics Committee in this case, particularly as matters progressed and the urgency and nature of the decisions in issue changed, so that there was time for further advice and opinion from the clinical ethics committee to be obtained. The fact that outcome of the meeting was discussed with the parent&#8217;s later that day and after the meeting does not cure the deficiencies set out above and had the effect of both raising their anxiety and contributing to their feelings of alienation and exclusion.  </p>

The evidence of the lead treating physician (on PICU) was that she and her consultant colleagues at the Applicant Trust considered that it was in X&#8217;s best interest not to receive further invasive and often painful treatment and that she should be allowed to die.  On behalf of her parents it is submitted that that is the wrong approach to this case as it is not a case about withdrawal of life sustaining treatment; for example, of withdrawing X&#8217;s source of nutrition TPN and allowing her to die.  Moreover it is X&#8217;s parents&#8217; case that because the treating clinicians consider X has had too many invasive interventions already they do not think she should have any more. In any event, whatever the possible difference of clinical opinion between current treating clinicians and those who have previously treated X, the interventions now in question are not very burdensome.

The guardian invited the court to accept the evidence of Drs Inwald and Nadel that Optiflow is a gentle treatment that is generally well tolerated by children, that if problems arise with its use these will be identified and the treatment stopped and that the provision of oxygen in this way may mean that X feels more comfortable if her breathing is difficult, and may be supported to recover from a temporary deterioration in her condition. I agree with the observations made by the guardian that Dr Inwald and Dr Nadel gave a realistic and objective account of the benefits and uses of Optiflow, and that the  evidence of the leading consultant and the Applicant&#8217;s witnesses has been affected by their strong view that no further treatment of any sort (beyond symptom management) should be given to X and their assertion that practical arrangements in GOSH mean that Optiflow is a treatment that is only given within PICU.

In keeping with the evidence of Dr Nadel, it is submitted on X&#8217;s behalf that if circumstances arose in which the provision of Optiflow was available it may be that it would make X feel more comfortable and provide a &#8216;bridge&#8217; (to use Dr Nadel&#8217;s word) through a period of mild infection. While none of the clinicians whose evidence is before the court thought it likely, as can be seen from the relative recovery that X made during the currency of these short proceedings it remains a possibility, and it would be wrong to make a blanket declaration that the use of Optiflow would never be in X&#8217;s best interests.  X&#8217;s guardian has submitted to the court that she is mindful that for X, as other children with serious illnesses, it is difficult to predict the fluctuations in her presentation and the further problems that may arise, which makes it risky to rule out treatments in advance which may be of benefit and do not, in themselves, pose a significant burden. In that submission the guardian, on X&#8217;s behalf, is supported by the evidence of Dr Nadel. </p>

It would seem that the Applicant&#8217;s position has been informed by an understandable reluctance on behalf of the treating team to inflict burdensome and painful treatment on a child who, in their opinion, has already had too much intervention. On the other hand X&#8217;s parents have seen X&#8217;s illnesses as something that they must overcome on her behalf, an approach for which they cannot be faulted, and the result in  this case is of the two parties approaching the child&#8217;s current situation and her overall deterioration as if from opposing sides during any consultation or discussions of X&#8217;s case which took place. It is highly regrettable that it is not possible to discern from the evidence before the court any real consideration of the benefits to X and the positives of quality of her life on the part of the Applicant.   </p>

Her current respiratory status was that she was comfortable at rest, she was receiving 30% inhaled oxygen by way of High Flow Nasal Cannula (Optiflow) delivered at 60litres/minute. She was warm and well perfused; her chest and abdominal examination were unremarkable apart from multiple chest scars from previous line and drain insertions and a midline abdominal scar. She had a gastrostomy in situ, through which she has a jejunal tube in place through which she is receiving 5mls/hour of feed.

She was started on 5mcg/kg/hour, but became very sleepy on this dose, so it was reduced to 2.5mcg/kg/hour, which appeared to allow her to be a little more wakeful. In addition X had also started to be treated with a selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics because she was growing Pseudomonas bacteria from her lungs, her urine, and most recently from the wound on her right arm. She had a rise in her inflammatory markers (CRP) last weekend, and since the newer antibiotics were started, there has been a reduction in her CRP. At that time, the rest of X&#8217;s blood count was within acceptable limits.  </p>

She remained on a large dose of furosemide (diuretic) to maintain adequate fluid balance, and it was noted that she has lost a considerable amount of excess fluid over the last few weeks, with her latest weight around 36kg. Her treating doctors had told Dr Nadel that there is a delicate balance with X&#8217;s fluids, between fluid overload, leading to fluid accumulation in her lungs, and dehydration leading to worsening renal function. In other words, as has been observed above in this judgment, the treatment of one X&#8217;s co-morbidities had a deleterious effect on one or other of her interlinked conditions. </p>

On that examination X&#8217;s respiratory function appeared to be improving and she had less respiratory distress, and apart from a slightly increased respiratory rate, did not seem to be working hard to breathe. There appeared to be an objective improvement in her oxygen requirement and work of breathing over the past few days. X&#8217;s secretions were not thick or troublesome, able to be cleared adequately with roughly hourly oral suction. In the opinion of Dr Nadel (and as proved to be the case) X&#8217;s Optiflow could be weaned slowly and she would probably tolerate low flow nasal cannula oxygen. Tellingly, in respect of the decisions that remain to be made by this court, Dr Nadel observed that while a nasal cannula might be more acceptable to X, as high flow nasal cannula oxygen can sometimes be less well tolerated, she seemed to be comfortable and not distressed by her current treatment. </p>

That is a statement that begs questions and fails to recognise that X has, in fact, had multiple complex clinical problems as part of her underlying condition for much of the past seven and more years during which she has had more than one acute crisis which has necessitated her admission to intensive care. This most recent admission to PICU has assisted X to recover from an acute crisis so that she is medically ready to be discharged back to a ward, which I understand happened on Monday 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2020, this is surely the aim of intensive care treatment. X&#8217;s condition has since fluctuated and there is every reason to believe it will continue to fluctuate.

As Dr Nadel observed if Optiflow would be of benefit to X and in her best interests <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> it is only available on PICU then she would have to be readmitted to receive it. As has been set out above the independent medical evidence has established that Optiflow is not a particularly burdensome treatment. The evidence of X&#8217;s father was that there could be a benefit to X if it were to be provided for some simply reversible cause of respiratory distress such as some extra secretions that had not been cleared.  This was supported by Dr Nadel who also said that if there was respiratory distress because of an intercurrent viral infection, it could be a benefit. It was possible, he said, that its use could get her over some minor deterioration and provide some relief. It is clear that there are possible benefits and that the burdens of such treatment are relatively minimal, X has been seen by the independent expert Dr Nadel to tolerate Optiflow and the balance is that it is in this child&#8217;s best interests in some circumstances. </p>

The relevant evidence and consideration of the burdens and benefits of re-admission to PICU or intensive care are set out above and I do not intend to repeat them. The Applicant Trust&#8217;s own expert from whom they sought a second opinion, Dr Inwald, agreed that it would not be unduly burdensome to re-admit X to PICU. There is, in fact, no evidence that X is particularly disturbed by the environment of PICU. The Applicant has not identified any other burdens of re-admission to PICU but relies on a presumption that re-admission to PICU is inconsistent with a palliative care plan. While it can be seen that this will often be the case each plan of symptom control should be tailored to each individual child and it is hard to envisage that an effective exclusion from PICU or intensive care is either inevitable or acceptable. Given the fluctuations and unpredictability of X&#8217;s condition overall and mindful of the complexities of her condition it cannot be in her best interests to make the declaration sought by the Applicant Trust and I decline to do so. It is not possible to say on the evidence that it will not be in X&#8217;s best interests to be readmitted to PICU to receive Optiflow or other treatment which may be considered of benefit to her and in her best interests within the confines of the ceilings of treatment already agreed.   </p>

The need to balance open justice and for the courts to be transparent has been better analysed and fully amplified in previous cases. If the arguments advanced for and on behalf of the Applicant were to be accepted in this case and applied to all cases involving the Applicant Trust, the result would be that the Trust would always remain anonymous. This case falls to be decided on its particular facts and there is no evidence in this case of the kind of distressing, intemperate and intimidatory publicity and social media comment that has occurred in other cases. It in these circumstances, where the evidence of actual risk to individuals employed by the Applicant is negligible, it would be disproportionate to restrict the reporting further than is provided for in this judgment and the reporting restrictions order will be made in accordingly. </p>
