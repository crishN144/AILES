For the purposes of this judgment it is sufficient to say that M was more actively in pursuit of this plan than F, who was more cautious and disengaged.

This marriage was highly abusive, and after some years M fled. In the course of these proceedings there has been considerable debate about whether that marriage was a forced marriage or not, but on any basis the married life M describes will have been highly traumatic. It is also common ground that F was one of those who supported M in the period after her marriage came to an end and when she was estranged from her family. In due course their relationship became romantic, F converted to Islam, and the couple were married. F no longer maintains his Muslim faith.</span></p>

The District Judge made an order preventing M from removing the child from the local county or from changing her school without the father&#8217;s agreement. The application focused on the absence of his consent and the lack of planning, and stated that the father was in fear of expressing his lack of consent in case the mother&#8217;s reaction was abusive and played out in front of the child. He raised concern about the influence of the maternal family on the move, but did not raise any concerns about forced marriage. As far as I am aware no further hearing was listed and the proceedings were treated as concluded. In a safeguarding letter from October of that year F was reported to have told Cafcass that the parties were attempting to reconcile and raised no safeguarding issues.</span></p>

S is very bright and also adventurous and independent. Part of her would be looking forward to a challenging change in an urban more cosmopolitan environment at a school where she feels she would be more stretched. Another part of her likes the rural peaceful life &#8230; with her pets around her. She does worry about how she will continue to get to school should she stay &#8230; as the journeys have put pressure on her mother's finances. However, we have explored the pros and cons and her most up to date position is that she does not mind where she lives as long as it with her mother.

Dr X&#8217;s explanation of how coercion can operate powerfully but insidiously in communities or households which operate in line with collectivist honour cultures, and where the concepts of shame and honour hold power, was important and helpful in understanding the mother&#8217;s experiences in this case.

Through careful scrutiny of Dr X&#8217;s CV and report I was able to ascertain that Dr X&#8217;s expertise was as an academic not a practitioner. As such, they are not registered with the HCPC. Registration is not a mandatory pre-requisite when the court appoints a psychological expert, and it is open to the court to appoint an unregistered psychologist, usually where that psychologist is an academic who holds Chartered Psychologist status as Dr X does. However, the task Dr X was set was broader than a simple exposition of the way in which cultural or religious issues work to give rise to risks around forced marriage or honour based abuse, and encompassed questions that would usually be answered by a practitioner psychologist, where registration is mandatory. Dr X is not a clinical psychologist qualified to make a diagnosis. It is not clear to me that any of the professionals had considered or appreciated these matters until I queried them.</span></p>

A number of those questions were the sort of questions which I would ordinarily expect a clinical psychologist to deal with, and I would expect those questions to have prompted more detailed responses than were provided, as part of an overall psychological formulation (there was some limited psychometric testing, relatively short single interview and some brief treatment of medical records).

In my view, the absence of a correct declaration should have been a red flag to the lawyers in the case which should have prompted query or further scrutiny. The court is entitled to expect that experts will read their instructions properly and be familiar with the basic expectations that the family court has of experts working in this field. Had Dr X read the materials to which they were signposted I am sure it would have assisted them in the preparation of the report and in giving their evidence, given that Dr X has so far limited experience in giving evidence in this specialised forum.</span></p>

Dr X also placed substantial reliance on the description of the mother not seeing her husband&#8217;s face until after the marriage because her glasses had been removed from her. Based on the mother&#8217;s description of events as they are recorded in the report (which were not challenged in cross examination), the arrangements do seem to meet the definition set out above, and potentially the slightly different definition in s63A Family Law Act 1996. The somewhat different description given in the mother&#8217;s subsequent oral evidence has meant that I have needed to reconsider some of the specifics of the account set out in Dr X&#8217;s report, but importantly, Dr X explained that coercion can operate insidiously over time so that a person who is immersed in a culture does not realise its influence upon their behaviour as expectations become normalised. Dr X helpfully unpacked what they meant by a collectivist culture:</span></p>

The mother had made, it was said, two very recent applications for employment in the [town] area and had identified a potential rental property. Details of the property beyond &#8216;two bedroom studio flat&#8217;, whether it had a garden or could accommodate pets etc, were not specified. There was no supporting documentary evidence of job adverts, property particulars or otherwise. As regards schooling, whilst the mother had provided some basic information about two proposed schools in the S area (neither of which the father took any particular exception to IF there was to be a move), it was now proposed that a third school (a single sex school) should be added to the list. The court was not provided with any information about this school, but was told that S had recently identified it herself and was keen. No advance notice of this proposed new school, or indeed the plans for the move had been provided to the father.

The circumstances in which she envisaged actively encouraging S to attend contact were centred around the moral obligation not to let other people down at short notice, and I did not detect a strong motivation to encourage S to maintain her relationship with her father for her own benefit. I was left with the distinct impression that &#8216;encouragement&#8217; would be potentially quite limited.

That my recollection was correct is borne out by a reading of the mother&#8217;s position statement, and the questions she at that time proposed to ask the expert. When re-called to the witness box to clarify the position, the mother stated that she acknowledged that her experiences fit the legal definition. However, she said, &#8216;I had to acknowledge it immediately but it probably took a few days to sink in as part of me.&#8217; Reminded that she had been actively asserting that there were substantial factual inaccuracies in the report at the July hearing, M told me that &#8216;Some of my responses were because I was angry at what was in there.&#8217; (the report). Asked if she was angry at the things F had said, or the report or both she said &#8216;A bit of both but mainly at the report&#8217;. Questioned by Ms M as to what those factual inaccuracies were, M&#8217;s responses strongly suggested that in fact her &#8216;acceptance&#8217; of the marriage as forced was technical but not internalised. The tendency to self-blame that Dr X had described in ]their] report was clearly evident when M, having compared her forced marriage to reality TV Programme &#8216;Married at First Sight&#8217; confirmed as accurate that she had told Dr X she was fearful before the marriage :</span></p>

Her evidence was that her widowed mother is very much &#8216;done with&#8217; the whole idea of arranged marriage, and that many of the young adults in her extended family (her nephews and nieces) are unmarried and gainfully employed. She acknowledged that her brother and sister are more strict observers of tradition than she, but told me that the contact with her brother was, and would remain, limited. She anticipates that she and S would see her sister at her mother&#8217;s home (as currently happens), probably slightly more frequently than currently happens but for shorter periods (currently distance and the </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt;color:#000000">PSO means that </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">S and the mother visit when permitted and stay for the weekend, whereas in future they might visit for an afternoon once a fortnight, or go swimming together). </span></p>

He told me that he had changed his approach so that he now asked S &#8216;Do I get a hug today then?&#8217; at the end of contact, and he did not think this would inadvertently place S under pressure.

F was in my view quite dismissive of suggestions about how he might be creative in finding ways to connect with S and to step into her world by attending cultural events together and reluctant to take the initiative in finding out more about the reality of Islamic life for fear of encountering extreme or intolerant beliefs (as he has done in the past). </span></p>

It seemed to me that both parents expected the other to feed S, and in part the issue was their failure to communicate about this. F told me he provided snacks or a meal deal before the session, but at this time S was rarely hungry, and he was clearly expecting her mother to feed her when she arrived home after 9pm. Small gestures such as preparing or purchasing a halal meal for her would not only ensure S was not hungry, it would send a powerful signal to S that F was sensitive to her needs and respectful of her beliefs. </span></p>

One can only wonder whether the parties could have agreed a compromise on all matters between themselves if only there had been earlier and more effective communication and issues around the risks associated with S in particular had not diverted attention. </span></p>

As regards the marriage itself, it seems clear that M was a passive participant in the process and was not fully informed or engaged with that process. There is no dispute that it was subsequently an abusive and traumatising relationship and that M found it difficult to leave, and the act of doing so caused some substantial difficulties subsequently in her relationship with her family. M was clear in her evidence that her parents did not intend to do her wrong or cause her harm in arranging the marriage for her, and I have no reason to doubt that - but it seems to me that Dr X&#8217;s description of process whereby an individual is so immersed in a traditional culture that they do not see the influence being brought to bear upon them through cultural expectations, and so that they feel they have agreed or at least gone along with a decision that in reality has been made for them is apt to describe the situation for M. There is no suggestion that M was subjected to threat or physical </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt;color:#000000">force by them</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">, and it may well have been that the removal of her glasses was not designed to disempower her (M told me it was done by the ladies sorting out her makeup because of the stigma associated with any sort of visible disability or aid), but clearly the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">effect</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> was to further disengage her from the process at a time when she was both conditioned to be accepting of the plans being made for her and to view them as benign, and was at a vulnerable moment in her life. I think Dr X is right to describe the marriage as a &#8216;forced&#8217; marriage&#8217;. I think that the explanation for the development of M&#8217;s evidence on these issues is that M is still in a process of coming to terms with her formal acceptance that it fits that definition, and she still holds herself at least partly responsible for it and for the consequences that flow, when in reality she was not to blame for the poor decisions made on her behalf. </span></p>

I agree that is not an issue in this case. The risk contended for (to the extent there is one) is that such a marriage would be arranged by others and M would be herself coerced to allow it to happen, perhaps without even realising she was being coerced. Similarly with spiritual or honour-based abuse, M is not the source of risk, the question is the extent to which she can protect S from exposure to harm emanating from others.</span></p>

S has been raised as a dual heritage child, by parents born and raised in the UK, with moderate religious views, at a time when diverse views and experiences are readily accessible to any child through social media. S&#8217;s main carer and an important role model has been her mother &#8211; a survivor of trauma who is intelligent and independent, employed and who has lived with and married a white Christian man. Moreover, S is a young woman who knows about honour-based abuse and forced marriage and that it is now considered harmful, by virtue of her involvement in these proceedings and her knowledge of her mother&#8217;s experiences. </span></p>

She tells me that her mother is not interested in arranging marriages for family members (and has recently told a nephew who sought her assistance to go and find a girlfriend for himself). No party has sought an assessment of the mother, the brother or sister and this evidence is in effect unchallenged. From M&#8217;s evidence it seems unlikely that her mother fully appreciates or accepts that the marriage was forced. But there is no evidence of any attempts to arrange marriages of other children or grandchildren in the subsequent several decades, and no evidence of any expressed wish to do so for S. It would be inappropriate to make any specific findings with regard to any specific family member&#8217;s current motivation, beliefs, or likely future actions towards S beyond what I have said here.</span></p>

I am sure there may be moments where S&#8217;s views, lifestyle and aspirations clash with the views of the more traditional members of her family, there may even be disputes about those matters. But clashes and tensions between one generation and the next are not unique to South Asian cultures or to Muslim families &#8211; and if S is to come to connect with her South Asian, Bengali, Muslim heritage (as is her right and will be to her benefit) then she will need to be able to experience and understand even its less tolerant or palatable sides. This is inevitably something that S will have to deal with. In her mother she has a role model of someone who has demonstrated since leaving her first marriage that it is possible to do so whilst maintaining family connections and faith. </span></p>

She would be living in an urban, diverse community, with a moderate Muslim carer, with (hopefully) regular contact to her white Christian father, spending regular time in her rural former home with her friends in that location, and connected still to her various activities. Even though I think access to the maternal aunt and grandmother&#8217;s home is more easy than the mother suggested to me in evidence, the likelihood is that S will be focused on her academic studies and activities and will be spending shorter, less intense bursts of time with her maternal family than she does presently where she only now sees them for entire weekends, when she is staying at her grandmother&#8217;s home. I think that the frequency of contact will increase but the overall intensity or &#8216;immersion level&#8217; will not materially rise. </span></p>

She also says she wishes to have regular contact with her father. Whatever decision I make S&#8217;s main priority will be secured: she will live with her mother. In my view, if I order that the PSO should remain in place so that S continues to live in [county], S will accept that decision. I note that even whilst expressing a preference to live in [town] in line with her mother&#8217;s wishes, S was quite content to allow the Guardian to advocate on her behalf rather than seeking to exercise the option of separate representation, and I think that this signals that that apart from receiving confirmation that she will continue to live with her mum, the next most important thing for S is that she has a decision and can get on with her life.</span></p>

As regards emotional needs, S has a need for closeness with her mother, and benefits from living with her as the primary care giver. She also has a vital need to maintain regular contact with her father in order to continue the important work of repairing their strained relationship. In the event of a move S will lose the important weekday contact with her father, which as the Guardian says, are currently performing an important function in allowing S and her father to reconnect in a less intense way than large blocks of uninterrupted contact offer. Any arrangement which minimised or makes more cumbersome the maintaining of regular contact between S and her father will have potential not to meet her emotional needs. I could try and secure S&#8217;s contact with her father by making an order for contact, but in itself that may not be effective, and it could even be counterproductive. I am concerned that if S were to move to [town] her relationship with her father would potentially be diminished. It is all too easy to imagine S being too tired, too busy to travel to contact, or to be dissuaded from going to the next contact if she and her father meet a bump in the road. I am worried that M might not see or emphasise the importance of contact on those times when S is reluctant and flexible contact would turn into infrequent contact &#8211; or if undertaken under duress, it could be contact that S resents. I think S would potentially become more isolated from her father, more so given my concerns about his own continuing anxieties about engaging with S&#8217;s world and what I perceive as his nervousness to meet her on her own turf by travelling up to [town] to see her. </span></p>

I think F&#8217;s fears had run away with him slightly when he told me S would be at high risk of bullying and would struggle to make friends. She is a shy and sensitive young woman but she is also socially capable. I have no doubt she would adapt to a new school, but equally, a move to a much larger more urban school in an entirely unfamiliar area half way through a school year where she knows nobody is a somewhat different prospect to a move to a school slightly down the road in a familiar area and where S reportedly does know one or two of the pupils.   </span></p>

I hope M will not take it the wrong way if I say that my impression is that she may find that the conclusion of these proceedings as liberating as putting greater physical distance between her and F. They have not been helpful for any one of the three members of this family.</span></p>

In reality, S will be spending alternate weekends with her father in any event, and I anticipate half of the holidays. The guardian suggests S could spend up to two blocks of seven nights in the summer holidays, additional nights over Eid and up to four nights in half term in addition to the current monthly quota of visits. I do not think there is any particular magic in the Guardian&#8217;s proposed number of nights. No party suggests that these quite substantial periods of time would give rise to an unacceptable risk and I cannot see any need or advantage to the residual restriction over and above the natural limit that will flow from S&#8217;s other commitments to spend time at school and with her father (and no doubt to go and do activities independently with her mother from time to time).  </span></p>

I am mindful that no order has been necessary to date, however I have taken the view that I should make some form of order in respect of contact, in order to mark the continuing priority of it. It would be unhelpful to dictate the terms of the weekday contact but my making no order about that should not be taken as any indication that the court does not endorse this contact. But I do consider that it would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to direct that S will spend time with her father on alternate weekends, and for approximately half the holidays (I do not propose to be more prescriptive). My order will record the obvious importance of S&#8217;s wishes and feelings in making any adjustments to the precise arrangements for contact, and I would expect the parents to be flexible of S&#8217;s other priorities as she matures, but also to enforce the importance for S of spending time with each of her parents.</span></p>

Equally, it is important that F engages with communication and listens to what M and S are telling him, even if it is uncomfortable or hurtful. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Thank you for coming to meet me earlier this month. I told you when we met that I would listen to what everyone had to say and do my best to make a good decision for you. </span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I think it&#8217;s really important that you understand some things that your mum and dad were able to agree and that I have approved. Firstly, everyone agreed that you should carry on living with your mum, which I know is your wish. Secondly, that you should be allowed to travel abroad, except to Bangladesh for now (although I know you aren&#8217;t planning to go there at the moment anyway). </span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I have thought very hard about what you have told me through [Guardian and solicitors&#8217; first names], about everything your mum and dad told me, and about what Dr X and [Guardian] themselves told me. I have decided that it is better for you to carry on living in [county] until you have finished your GCSEs and that you should not go to live in [town]. Your mum has told me about [X] school and your dad has told me that he would consider a move to that school if you felt it would be right for you. That is something that I think the three of you can talk about and agree between yourselves. </span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I have decided that you and your mum should be able to go and visit Nanu and your auntie more often, but I also think it&#8217;s really important that you and your dad carry on spending time together regularly, working things through and learning to understand one another a bit better. </span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I have written a judgment explaining in more detail about the evidence I&#8217;ve heard and why I&#8217;ve decided these things, and I know that [Guardian] will go through this with you if you want to understand more about it (or you can keep it to read in the future, if you prefer). I&#8217;ve tried to summarise in this letter the things I know are most important to you.</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I think it&#8217;s been really hard for you over the last two years, knowing that your mum and dad couldn't agree where you should live, and I&#8217;m pleased to be able to make a decision so that uncertainty can stop and you can focus on getting on with your studies and spending time with the people who are important to you, including your pets. Nobody&#8217;s parents get things right all the time, but I do think your parents have, in their own way, both been doing their best for you. </span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Both your parents are rightly very proud of you, and I am sure that you have a great future ahead of you.</span></p>
