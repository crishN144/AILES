	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the hearing on 11 September, and following discussion as to the terms of the order, Miss Renton, on behalf of the Applicant, Mrs. H, made an oral application that the Respondents should pay, or substantially contribute to, the Applicant&#8217;s costs of the litigation.  The First Respondent father was neither present nor represented at the hearing; he was apparently suffering ill-health. The Second Respondent, Miss B, who was present and accompanied by a McKenzie Friend, asked that they be given the opportunity to consult with each other about the application and respond in writing.  I acceded to that request, and gave them 14 days to do so.  </p>

More significantly, the father&#8217;s conduct has, in her submission, been to the detriment of T.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that in September 2016 Mrs. H felt reluctantly compelled to make the application for a variation of the child arrangements order which I had made only months earlier because it was clear to her, as it has been clear to me, that the father had little interest or motive in complying with my earlier order.  His specific and deliberate breach of the order about summer contact in 2016 was in my view serious; it was on any view &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; and &#8220;reprehensible&#8221; conduct, which materially undermined the integrity of my earlier order, and the trust of Mrs. H and T.  His deception of Mrs. H, and his manipulation of T, has had serious adverse consequences for his relationship with his daughter.  It is clear that the father knew that he was breaching my order, and the seriousness of that breach was compounded by inveigling T into his deception.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father did not need a lawyer to tell him that he was doing wrong in deceiving Mrs. H and T, and wilfully breaching my order; it is clear from the evidence laid before me at this hearing that he knew he was.  The father did not need a lawyer to tell him that failure to abide by a contact order would be likely to cause his daughter considerable distress.  Nor is the father prejudiced by the absence of a lawyer in now having to face up to the consequences of his actions; I have listened to him, and to Miss B &#8211; assisted by their McKenzie Friend &#8211; through the two days of hearing.  Moreover, the father only has himself to blame if he chooses not to read the order which I made (see [10](v) above).  While there are certain exceptional circumstances in which the court may be prepared to show a degree of latitude to an unrepresented litigant for minor defaults of an order, where with the benefit of legal advice the court is satisfied such default would not have occurred, I am satisfied that this is not such a situation.   The father&#8217;s apologies to the court rang hollow when heard alongside his diatribe against Mrs. H, and his complaint about the court and its processes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having weighed all the matters discussed above, I have reached the conclusion that the father must contribute towards Mrs. H&#8217;s costs; his contribution could, and probably should, be more significant than I am proposing to order.  In moderating the sum, I take into account that, in part, his disengagement from the process may be attributable to his illness, and I have borne in mind his apparently modest means.  I am keen to ensure that he does not use this costs order as an excuse for him not to comply with the child arrangements order which I have now made, and I propose therefore to direct that the costs order will not be enforceable without my permission.</p>

She and her husband support T entirely without assistance.  I propose to direct that the father should contribute the sum of &#163;15,000 towards those costs.   I make no separate order against Miss B.  As I say ([16] above), this order for costs should not be enforced without leave.</p>
