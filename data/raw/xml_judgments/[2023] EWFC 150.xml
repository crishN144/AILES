It is only where the decision exceeds the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible and it is, in fact, wrong, that an appellate body is entitled to interfere.</p>

The expert evidence identified that the mother did not then have a current mental health disorder. The expert concluded that the mother had felt the need to protect herself from the father. The father was considered to have limited insight into his ability to think reflectively and empathetically about his children. In the expert analysis of Dr Lopez, the father had elevated scores on the narcissistic and histrionic personality constructs. It was suggested he might use coercive anger to manage his feelings about relationships. Dr Lopez recommend that the father engage in psychodynamic therapeutic work. </p>

In this regard, the identification of &#8216;alienating behaviour&#8217; should be the court&#8217;s focus, rather than any quest to determine whether the label &#8216;parental alienation&#8217; can be applied.&#8221;</span></p>

It is widely recognised that Judges sitting in the Family Court, where the intense and unabating pressure of work is very great and resources limited, face enormous difficulties and challenges. Regrettably, with respect to this experienced Judge, no judgment was given by the lower Court in any form. The Judge did not engage in the arguments raised by the parties. No reasons were given by the Judge at all, addressing the test of necessity, in circumstances where information already before the Court below included existing expert evidence. No facts had been found by the Court on the disputed issue of parental alienation. There was no consideration by the Judge of the mother&#8217;s assertion that the father had not completed the work recommended by the previous expert Dr Lopez. There was no consideration by Judge of the potential harm to the children of exposing them to another professional, where they had already been required to meet the Guardian and a Local Authority Social Worker. I reject the submission that the Judge&#8217;s reasons can be implied or read holistically. There was, very regrettably, no determination by the lower Court of the key issue in dispute, namely, whether expert evidence was necessary, by reference to the relevant factors in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6/section/13/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(7)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6" uk:canonical="2014 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2014 Act</ref>.  The omission of a judgment is significant. That was not simply a procedural error. Judgments are the means through which Judges address the litigants and the public at large and explain their reasons for reaching their conclusions. A judgment providing reasons for rejecting one party&#8217;s submissions or preferring the submissions of another party was a fundamental aspect of the Court&#8217;s duty to deal with the case justly. </p>
