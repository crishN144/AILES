However, on the morning of the first day of the hearing I was told that the position of the parents had changed, and they were now not opposing the making of the orders, albeit they were not actually consenting. They were no longer proposing SA as the carer for JN. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">Both parents were on the video link on Friday, with an interpreter present in the courtroom. Both were represented by experienced lawyers, Mr Rashvand for the Mother, and counsel, Ms Franklin for the Father. Their representatives were clear that they had withdrawn their opposition to the orders being made. They invited me to explain to their clients over the video link that I was intending to make the orders and that in my view they were justified.  I did so, in language which I believe was clear and straightforward, making it entirely clear that the orders were going to be made.  In the light of that position I said that I would make the orders, but given that the parents were not consenting I reserved judgment to Monday to set out my reasons. I explained to the parents on Friday that I thought the orders should be made and I did not need to hear oral evidence. The other reason to reserve judgment was that the Council were drawing up the final care plan. The witnesses were released, and Dr Farooqi (Dr F) who was intending to give evidence on Monday was told she did not need to attend. The social worker, Ms Dodwell had been programmed to give evidence on Friday, but obviously was not called.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">However, on Monday morning at about 11am,  I was told by Ms Franklin that the Father had changed his position and now wanted to again oppose the orders and give oral evidence. This was simply on the basis of his having changed his mind. There was no suggestion that there was any material change of circumstance or any new evidence, merely that the Father had changed his mind. The position of the Mother was that although she did not want to agree to the orders she was very concerned that there be no delay as that would be contrary to JN&#8217;s interests (for reasons I will explain below). Mr Rashvand therefore said, very fairly, that she would not oppose the orders if that meant the case would go beyond the coming Friday (5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April), which should have been the final day of the hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Evans, for the Council, opposed my reopening the matter, or in the alternative argued that I should determine the applications without calling oral evidence. He pointed to the fact that the parents had made a decision on the basis of legal advice, and that there was no change of evidence, or other circumstances. He strongly relied on the detriment to JN from any delay in making the orders. It was his submission that if the case now went ahead it would be virtually impossible to finish it on Friday, and thus there would inevitably be delay. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">On the Father&#8217;s interests, he has been represented throughout by solicitors and counsel. They will have fully advised him as to the proceedings and as to the consequences of not opposing the orders being made. He completely freely changed his position on Friday to one of non-opposing, and I understand this was after receiving full legal advice. I do not of course seek to go behind that legal advice, for reasons of legal professional privilege. However, there is no reason to believe that he did not fully understand the position on Friday. Further, he was present on the video link on Friday (and was being communicated with via WhatsApp so that the court could be confident he and the Mother could hear and understand what was happening). I am therefore confident that he fully appreciated the position  and made his decision on the basis of full information. The Father has had every opportunity to have an article 6 compliant hearing that fully protected his article 8 rights. </p>

I have to say there is a strong element of unreality about the Father&#8217;s position. As I set out below, the parents now have another child who is living with them, and the ability of SA to come to the UK ultimately rests on the Home Office, who have currently refused her a visa.  </p>

As I explain in detail below, JN is profoundly deaf and has been diagnosed as being suitable for cochlear implants. She has already missed the optimum time for these, largely I believe because of these proceedings, but she needs to have them within the next 2-3 months to maximise the benefit. If she does not have them within this window then the benefits to her will diminish, and this will impact upon her for the rest of her life. This is a case where the principle in s.1(2) of CA that delay is likely to harm the welfare of the child applies particularly strongly. </p>

This is because we have now lost 1.5 days  of the 6 hearing days, when we should have heard Ms Dodwell&#8217;s and at least half of Dr F&#8217;s evidence.  Dr F has been released, and I am told  cannot now attend this week. It might be possible to proceed without Dr F giving oral evidence, but in the light of the Father&#8217;s position I think that would now be very difficult. Further, there is also a significant problem with the video link which means that oral evidence from Mother, Father and SA is likely to take considerably longer than planned.  Therefore, in terms of the timetabling if I do agree to reopen the matter I think it will be very difficult and in practice unlikely,  to finish by Friday. Therefore, allowing the Father to change his position, and to reopen the hearing will probably lead to a significant delay (the case was listed for 7 days), which given the difficulty of listing a 7 day (or even 5 day) case, could run into months.  </p>

Neither Ms Franklin nor Mr Rashvand ask me to recuse myself, but that must be at least partly because they realise that if I were to do so there would inevitably be significant delay. Bias, including predetermination, is not a matter that can be waived by the parties.  I find it difficult to see how a judge who has already given her decision can then consider the matter with an open mind, when there is no new evidence, new caselaw, nor any material change of circumstance. As I have said I have already determined this matter, and no new material is being put in front of me.  In that situation going through the hearing of oral evidence would be entirely about the Father&#8217;s perceived need to have an oral hearing and to be seen publicly to actively object to the orders, rather than a genuine forensic exercise. </p>

The original grounds for making the interim care order, and the focus of the threshold criteria was the Mother&#8217;s own inability to care for JN without very significant help, and it was that concern which led to the alleged significant risk of harm. However, as I explain below given JN&#8217;s subsequent diagnosis of profound deafness and the implications thereof for her care, that factor has become a major focus of the reasons for making the orders and the Council&#8217;s strong view that SA cannot meet the child&#8217;s care needs. It is for that reason that I will say relatively little below about the Mother&#8217;s family, and  the Mother&#8217;s own learning difficulties.

Dr Hanvey explains that there are two parts to the implants, the implant itself and a sound processor which is worn near the ear. The processor has to be maintained for the implant to work. The optimum time for the surgery is 10 months but that does not mean that JN is too old. However, the longer she waits the less benefit she will gain, and the aim is for her to have surgery within the next 2-3 months.  </p>

The fact that the Mother was pregnant and had then given birth was deliberately kept from the Council (and indeed Dr F) by the parents and SA. The parents and SA say they did this because they were so concerned about what actions the Council would take in respect of the baby. It is very easy to see that this strategy is wholly counter-productive because what it has done is destroy trust between the Council and the parents (and SA) , and has led the Council to take the view that it is going to be very difficult to be confident in anything that was said to them by the extended family in Pakistan.  </p>

The concerns can be summarised as follows. Firstly, SA failed to produce full evidence to show that she (and the wider family) would be able to afford the medical expenses that looking after JN will involve. This concern has become even greater in the light of Dr Hanvey&#8217;s report. Secondly, SA had shown no commitment to looking after JN, and this was exhibited by the fact that SA had not participated in any of JN&#8217;s video contact. It is important to note that SA has never met JN, and thus has no bond or relationship with her, save through the simple matter of being a blood relation. Thirdly, SA had not been honest with the Council over the Mother&#8217;s pregnancy and the birth of the new baby. They say she has shown no insight into the concerns of the Council, and in fact does not accept those because she continues to consider that the parents could look after JN. It is noteworthy that the parents accept that they cannot care for JN, but SA does not appear from her written statement to actually accept this.  </p>

However, Dr F&#8217;s report was written before Dr Hanvey&#8217;s report, and she accepts that there is little evidence as to how the family will pay for the medical treatment that JN needs. She seems to assume that the Council would pay for JN&#8217;s aftercare in Pakistan, but the Council have certainly not agreed to this, and are exceptionally unlikely to do so (even if it was lawful for them to do so).  Further Dr F&#8217;s recommendation is that SA comes to the UK for a Special Guardianship Assessment. However, as she has not been given a visa by the Home Office, it is wholly speculative as to whether she would be able to do this. In my view this is a fatal flaw in Dr F&#8217;s evidence. There is no doubt as to the urgency of a decision as to where and with whom JN is to live, but there is absolutely no known timescale for when, if ever, SA might be able to come to the UK.  </p>

However, firstly, the one specialist they approached, Dr Lodhi at Shifa International Hospital, declined to produce a report setting out either a treatment programme or indicative costs for JN; and secondly, there was very scant evidence of how the family could afford what was obviously going to be very significant costs.  Even before Dr Hanvey&#8217;s report there was a very obvious discrepancy between the family&#8217;s income and the likely cost of JN&#8217;s treatment and care for her deafness.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">My conclusion that the orders should be made are based on  two separate but interrelated reasons. The first set of reasons relate to JN&#8217;s deafness. She is a child who is profoundly deaf and who needs cochlear implants as soon as possible. This necessarily entails a large amount of aftercare to ensure that she obtains the benefits of the implants for the rest of her life.  She will suffer significant long-term harm if she does not have the implants, and does not have them within a relatively short period of time, preferably the next 2-3 months.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">It is entirely clear from Dr Hanvey&#8217;s report that she would not be given the implants if she were to move shortly to Pakistan. It is equally apparent that her parents, and extended family, are not in a position to ensure that she can obtain the appropriate treatment and aftercare in Pakistan. Indeed, I understand them now to accept that they could not afford the very extensive treatment that would be involved. The Father now suggests that he will sell his house, or take other steps but (a) there is no evidence on what funds this would raise; (b) there is nothing to explain where he, the Mother and MN would then live. I consider the Father&#8217;s position to be unrealistic, but also not to take into account JN&#8217;s best interests. I note that the Mother, who knows JN and lived with her for the first four months of her life is more prepared to prioritise the child over her own wishes.  </p>

Otherwise the implants will not deliver the benefits she needs. There is no family member in the UK who is being suggested as an appropriate carer for JN. In any event, Dr Hanvey makes entirely clear that JN will not be given the implants unless she is going to stay in the UK for the after care, or perhaps there is an absolutely secure aftercare package in a third country, which there certainly is not here.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, the parenting assessment at Crown House established that the Mother could not meet JN&#8217;s needs without very extensive support. This is not challenged by the parents, who do not put themselves forward as carers. The parents have instead put forward SA to care for JN. However, quite apart from the financial impossibility of meeting JN&#8217;s needs, I would not have considered that it was in JN&#8217;s interests to be cared for in Pakistan by SA. SA has chosen not to participate in the contact sessions with JN. She has never met JN, and JN has no actual relationship with her. It is not at all clear how SA would cope with a profoundly deaf child with developmental delay, and whether she could meet JN&#8217;s needs. I cannot see how it could possibly be in JN&#8217;s interest to move her from a foster carer with whom she is very well settled, and a well worked out package of treatment and support in the UK, to an entirely new environment with a principle carer who she does not know. This would be particularly damaging to JN given that it would not be possible (certainly at the present time) to ensure gradual transition to being cared for by SA.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">I appreciate that this conclusion is contrary to Dr F&#8217;s view that SA should undergo further assessment. Because SA was not given a visa she could not undertake the special guardianship assessment that Dr F had recommended, and that this also prevented her from getting to know JN. However, at the forefront of my consideration must be JN and her interests. There is no timescale of when, if ever, SA might get a visa and it cannot be in JN&#8217;s interests for her to have to wait some indefinite period. The same point goes for the Father&#8217;s proposal that SA move to the UK to look after JN. There is no evidence that she would get a visa to do this, nor any evidence as to how she would live in the UK, a country where she has never lived. This is again a completely unrealistic approach.  </p>

I agree with the Council and the guardian that this gives very little confidence in SA&#8217;s commitment to work with the professionals involved and to prioritise JN&#8217;s interests over other members of the family. This would have been critical if I had been seriously considering placing JN with her, or requiring a further assessment.  </p>

It is in her lifelong interests for this to be done and then for her to be in a position to maximise the benefits by the best possible aftercare. </p>

There is no family member who is still being advanced as a potential carer, other than SA who I have dealt with above. As the Guardian explains, long term fostering will be much less beneficial to JN than placing her in a permanent family.  </p>
