That letter was sent to her, somewhat surprisingly in the circumstances I will outline in a moment, in February 2015.  It contained the minutes of some LAC reviews.  Although dated January 2015, the actual LAC reviews took place in November 2014.  It is knowledge of the information within those documents which indicated that the children were not, as the applicant had understood, in the care of the mother; that prompted this application to revoke the placement order.</span></p>

The mother, following the directions hearing before me in April of this year, was contacted by the local authority through her former solicitors.  She has informed the court, through the local authority, that she does not wish to attend to take part in this application, and she does not support the application.  The indication through the local authority is that she has accepted the children will be placed away from her with the foster carers through an adoption order being made.  That is slightly different from the position that is recorded in the LAC minutes in November 2014, but, in any event, in relation to this hearing today it is not an application that she wishes to take part in or support in any way.</span></p>

This change does not have to be significant, but must be of a nature and degree sufficient to reopen consideration of the case and of the placement order that was made.  Secondly, if the court is satisfied that there has been a change, the court then has discretion to decide whether leave should be given and, in exercising that discretion, the children&#8217;s welfare is relevant but not paramount.  The question for the court is whether, in all the circumstances, including the applicant&#8217;s prospects of success in securing revocation of the placement order and the children&#8217;s interests, leave should be given.</span></p>

Having heard the evidence, I made certain findings of fact, including that the father had unlawfully killed A and B&#8217;s sibling, C, in March 2013, that he had been violent and threatening to the mother and was controlling in relation to his behaviour towards her.  Even though the expert evidence before the court at that time was that the court should conclude the proceedings then with final orders being made, having seen the mother  give evidence and having heard the evidence about the strength of her relationship that had been observed with these two very young children during periods of contact, I determined that the mother should be given a period of time to be able to consider the findings that had been made by the court, to see whether she could make the necessary changes within a time frame for these children to be able to have some prospect of caring for them in the future.</span></p>

In the judgment, dated 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2013 (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/4672" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 4672 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 4672 (Fam)</ref>), I concluded, with great sadness, that as a result of the findings that the court had made the mother was unable to recognise the significant risks of physical and emotional harm that there were for these children and she was unable to provide them with the protection that they required during their minority.  As a result of the balancing exercise undertaken by the court at that hearing, I concluded that the court should make care orders and a placement order endorsing the plan put forward by the local authority that the children should be permanently placed away from their birth family.</span></p>

That was in the context of the mother&#8217;s application that had been made in the early part of 2014 to revoke the placement order I had made the previous November. She said there was a change in circumstances; she had left the accommodation that she was living in, which she said was accommodation that was provided for her by the paternal family; she was receiving support in relation to her welfare within a refuge at an address that was unknown to the family; and she was beginning to show a recognition and an understanding in relation to what had happened to her and the children in the past.  As a result of that, it was said on her behalf there had not only been a change of circumstances because of those changes by her in relation to her understanding of the history, but also that the court should exercise its discretion and give leave for her to make an application to revoke the placement order because it was said that she was now in a position to be able to safely care for the children.  For the reasons I set out in that judgment, I rejected that application. The mother&#8217;s contact with the children was then managed in such a way that she had her farewell contact with the children in August 2014.  </span></p>

I also found that the local authority had established to the required standard that there had been domestic abuse between the mother and the father and that he had exerted controlling behaviour in relation to her.  The father had been charged with murder.  A trial took place at the Central Criminal Court in January 2014.  The father was convicted of manslaughter and was sentenced to ten years&#8217; imprisonment.  The mother separated from the father and the court had carefully considered whether she could protect the children.  When I considered the position in November 2013, I concluded she could not.  When I looked at the matter again in June 2014, I concluded she had not satisfied the two requirements to enable the court to give leave for there to be an application to revoke the placement orders.  The mother had her farewell contact with the children in August 2014.</span></p>

They had understood from the father, Mr. F says in his statement, that the mother was caring for the children. As I have indicated, this application is made on behalf of other members of the paternal family. Mr. F does not put himself forward as a future carer for the children.  </span></p>

It is submitted with some force, not only in the written material but also by Miss Papazian who appears on behalf of Mr. F, the importance of the court considering placement options within the birth family.  It is said that the welfare of the children would be enhanced by a family placement and, whilst this remains an option for the children (as stressed in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re B-S</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/813" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 813" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 813</ref>), the court needs to consider and investigate whether that option would meet the welfare needs of the children.  As Miss Papazian emphasised in her oral submissions, due to the very young age of these children, they have at least 14 to 16 years ahead of them in their minority and this application needs to be considered in that context when considering such a draconian step as a placement away from the birth family.  Miss Papazian submits that the applicants feel very strongly (and I hope Mr. F will forgive my paraphrasing of this) that the sins of their father should not be visited on these two young children; that they should not bear the responsibility of the dreadful actions that he took in bringing about C&#8217;s death.  </span></p>

Mr. F seeks, on behalf of the un-assessed members of the paternal family, the court to grant leave to make their application to revoke the placement order and have an assessment undertaken in relation to that.  They submit, with some force, that there will be no impact on the children of further delay as there has already been the delay as a result of the failings of this local authority.  They say that they are not proposing there should be any change in the children&#8217;s current placement and that stability and position needs to be looked at in the context of the longer term benefits of the court having the advantage of properly being able to consider the children being brought up in the wider birth family.</span></p>

The local authority, supported by the guardian, submits that there has not.  The local authority submits that seven members of the paternal family attended the family group conference in June 2013, including Mr. F, and that, following that conference, five family members were assessed.  It was clear from the minutes of the family group conference the father had been charged with murder, the local authority were involved in decisions regarding the future care of the children and  there were court proceedings ongoing.  In fact, I believe Mr. F attended outside court at one of the hearings in September.  There is reference in the minutes to a member of the extended family living in Germany, but no one suggested at that stage that family member should be assessed to be able to provide a home for the children.  No one attending the conference in June 2013 suggested other people should be put forward for consideration of the future care of the children, in the event they could not be cared for by their parents.  </span></p>

Secondly, on the face of the applicant&#8217;s statement, there is some suggestion that there is an understanding of the father&#8217;s culpability, although the position is much less clear as to the views on that by the wider family members who are put forward.  Thirdly, in relation to supporting the conclusion that there probably has been a change of circumstances, it is a fact that the children have not yet been placed for adoption or made the subject of an adoption order, as was clearly envisaged when this matter was last before the court in June 2014.</span></p>

Firstly, the role of the paternal family in light of what the mother said about their role in the latter part of 2013, as set out in her statement before the court in June 2014.

By embarking on such a process, there is a real risk that the current secure placement where the children are could be put at risk in relation to its stability.  Whilst it is said by Miss Papazian that there is no suggestion during this process that Mr. F or the paternal family would seek to move the children from their current placement, the fact is that that placement would not be in the secure setting that the court had envisaged when it made its previous decisions.
