	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case concerns DB; she was born in 1923, and it therefore now 90 years old.  She suffers from a progressive dementia.  She has been cared for by JS (her daughter) and MS (her son-in-law) for over three years now, in line with a family arrangement first discussed with KB (DB&#8217;s son) over their Christmas day meal in 2009.  The actual care arrangement is in many ways excellent; DB is receiving devoted care and is reported to be happy.  For this, JS and MS deserve genuine credit.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, the informal, and as I find improper, means by which DB&#8217;s finances were utilised by JS to fund the current care arrangement led to the sale of the home in which she had lived for over fifty years effectively &#8216;over her head&#8217;, and the proceeds of sale being placed out of her immediate reach, rendering her financially highly exposed; state benefits and retirement pension payable to DB have subsequently been diverted into an account in JS&#8217;s name.  All of this was done without legal authority.  Only with the intervention of the court appointed deputy was the situation regularised.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Regrettably, the actions of JS, of which DB would have been largely unaware, and which were in some important respects kept secret from KB, caused a deep schism within the family, generated lengthy and avoidable litigation, and caused the parties to expend considerable sums which they can little afford in legal costs.</p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">KB is not entirely blameless in the tale.  He knew or reasonably believed that his mother lacked capacity to manage her financial affairs when arrangements were being made to establish the current care regime, made no enquiries of his own, and (at least for a period of time) acquiesced in the arrangements.</p>

By such an appointment, JS sought to have the authority to continue to make decisions on behalf of DB (which she had been making for some time) given that DB was unable to make such decisions for herself, in relation to her property and financial affairs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That application was resolved finally, save for this question of costs, by HHJ Hodge QC on 6 September 2013.  By order made on that date (which was consensual), it is recorded <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>that JS agreed not to pursue her application to be appointed as DB&#8217;s property and affairs deputy.  </p>

At times JS was understandably emotional in discussing these aspects of her, and her mother&#8217;s, current life; she plainly feels that she and her husband have made a significant sacrifice in entering into this arrangement, and this underscored her evidence.  However, in relation to DB&#8217;s financial affairs, which were under scrutiny at this hearing, JS had a different tone; she was defensive and guarded.  Occasionally she was even quarrelsome when answering counsel&#8217;s questions, and appeared aggrieved (even affronted) that she was being questioned over her actions in relation to her mother&#8217;s money.  On important aspects of the history, I felt that she had a tendency to remember events as she would want them to have happened; inconsistencies in her written and oral evidence exposed the shaky foundations of her case.</p>

It is more likely than not that KB assumed that the property would be conveyed into the name of his mother, but did not explicitly check this with his sister; JS did not tell her brother of her actual intentions, nor did she mention the loan, until after the property had been purchased.  </p>

I find that she lied to KB, and to the court, in asserting that KB had always agreed this.  In my judgment, JS acted in this way because she wanted to give herself a degree of security, and felt entitled to some compensation for the sacrifice of looking after her mother (possibly abandoning her plan to retire to Spain).  The plan also suited MS who has a significant disability himself; the adaptations to the property ostensibly for DB, just as importantly benefited him.  </p>

As it became increasingly apparent to JS that her mother&#8217;s capacity was waning in late 2009 and 2010, so, in my judgment, did JS step up her intervention in this respect.  It seemed to me that she made ever-increasing assumptions about her authority to manage DB&#8217;s financial affairs, initially encroaching subtly on that activity, but by the summer of 2010 I find that she was boldly acting as if she was a full agent of her mother under a Lasting Power of Attorney.  </p>

While I do not purport to adjudicate upon her associated claim for an entitlement to a share of the beneficial interest in Beech Avenue, it was not prudent for her to pursue such claims when it must have been clear to her, particularly when she had legal advice, that the manner in which she had placed her mother&#8217;s funds in her name was (at best) highly questionable, or (at worst, and in the words of MP) &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">financially abusive</span>&#8221;.</p>
