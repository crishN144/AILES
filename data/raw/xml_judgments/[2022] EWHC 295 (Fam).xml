	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns two children now aged 13 and 9 at the time of the final hearing in 2021. In this judgment they are called X &amp; Y to preserve their anonymity: the children&#8217;s genders will not be identified for the same reason. They are represented as 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> &amp; 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> respondents through their Children&#8217;s Guardian (the guardian). Their father (also FZ in this judgment) is the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent; he has not attended any of the hearings including the substantive hearing in May 2021 although he has contacted the Court by email and by the same means has been in contact with the parties&#8217; solicitors. The primary application brought by the children&#8217;s mother (the applicant or MZ) under the Children Act (CA) 1989 is for protective relief and for the extensive curtailment of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent&#8217;s exercise of his parental responsibility (in the form of prohibited steps orders and specific issue order pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and additional injunctive relief). The application has been granted and was to intents and purposes unopposed and unchallenged by the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent, FZ. </p>

As the case was uncontested in respect of the injunctive and protective relief sought the Court made protective orders shortly after the hearing in May 2021 which have been in force for some time; the respondent father has not breached or attempted to breach the orders and the family remain unmolested, but as he has been unaware of their whereabouts it is not possible to conclude, given his previous behaviour (see below), that he would not have resumed his harassment and abuse on his release from custody. Strictly speaking and in fact there have been no further breaches or attempted breaches since 2018, but by then the children and their mother had moved and their location was not known to FZ. The orders made by this Court are far-reaching and comprehensive, the Court could do little more to provide protection under the law as it currently stands. Their welfare is, to that extent, well and thoroughly protected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nonetheless it is of concern to this Court, as a family court, that the children and MZ remain emotionally damaged and in the case of MZ and X (the elder child) will not be afforded the emotional relief that they so clearly want and need by virtue of the Court proceedings and this judgment: no judgment can expunge the past or cure and ameliorate its deeper-seated psychological effects on parties to proceedings. It troubles the Court that any emphasis on the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> applications risks overlooking the long-term emotional well-being of the children, and of the applicant herself. These children should be able to come to terms and reach some understanding of their past experiences including their father&#8217;s role and behaviour in that past which allows them not to demonise him to the extent that he and it continues to be a predominant defining element of their lives, affecting their long-term emotional resilience and ability to deal with adult relationships in an assertive and healthy way. Should the conclusions of this Court not bring the matter of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref> application to a close the children&#8217;s welfare is likely to be detrimentally affected by continuing proceedings but, unfortunately, in law that cannot be a consideration in reaching any conclusion in respect of that application. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No-one could fail to have sympathy for MZ and the children for the huge distress, fear and disruption to their lives that has been caused to them by the actions and behaviour of FZ. The Court was and is concerned for their safety and well-being both now and in the long term. Most unfortunately these, as all legal proceedings are not designed to provide, nor are they capable of providing, substantial emotional succour and relief. The Court does not question the harmful effects that FZ&#8217;s past behaviour has had on MZ and the children but cannot by its judgment provide counsel or support to MZ and the children in coming to terms emotionally with what has happened in the past that they want; such support must be provided by professionals with the expertise to do so. The limitations of litigation in providing closure or emotional relief are not the subject of this case but remain of concern to the Court.</p>

As the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent did not appear at or attend any hearing (they were all heard remotely) it is incumbent on the Court when it considers the respondent&#8217;s schedule of findings based upon the applicant&#8217;s statements, the guardian&#8217;s analysis, and the documents filed on her behalf, to have in mind the fact that it is unchallenged evidence and as it must be considered with some care. Court orders may only be made based on the evidence before the Court and it is all the more pertinent to set out the history and the complaints made by the applicant in respect of domestic abuse and its effects on her and the children. I have taken the history set out here in large part from the background as set out by Mr Mark Jarman in the helpful document which he prepared for the Court on behalf of the children who he represents. </p>

After the involvement of the police and social services and with their encouragement and FZ&#8217;s continuing abusive behaviour MZ applied for a non-molestation order in July 2016; by then she had been separated from her husband for some 2 &#189; years. Her statement in support her application sets out FZ&#8217;s failure to respect or adhere to any boundaries MZ had tried to impose in relation to him spending time with the children after they separated. It appears that at times he was homeless and would insist on sleeping on her sofa despite her objections. The non-molestation order was granted in what are the usual terms against FZ, the order to remain in force until 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2017.  Following attempts to serve him with the order and notice of the return hearing FZ attended court on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September 2016, for a hearing when the non-molestation order was confirmed, remaining in force until 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2017. </p>

On the evidence before this Court, it is clear that MZ and the elder child in particular were, and remain, emotionally damaged and affected by FZ&#8217;s abuse both before and after the separation. </p>

It must be observed that it is almost impossible for those who have not experienced it to understand the powerlessness, lack of control over one&#8217;s own life, fear and trauma induced in victims of stalking. MZ has suffered from PTSD (and is prescribed medication for anxiety) which is directly attributable to FZ&#8217;s abusive behaviour and harassment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her statement MZ said that she would <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;endeavour to briefly set out some of the many incidents and examples of [FZ&#8217;s] abusive behaviour and harassment which arose over the years, and which eventually led to his convictions.&#8221;</span> I have set out in this judgment some of what she told the Court here by way of illustration, but I find that all the incidents she describes took place on the balance of probabilities and when considered in the light of the evidence as a whole. MZ said that in 2013 to 2014, during the period after she had separated from FZ when he repeatedly and frequently returned to the family home and would not leave, he had discovered that she had applied for a job abroad, he was furious and started shouting.  In another incident in 2014 when FZ had insisted on entering the property to see the children and MZ had reluctantly agreed to allow him to come in, he then made MZ listen to him and threated to pour his drink over her and the child&#8217;s tablet device if she did not.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As part of his controlling behaviour FZ insisted on knowing where MZ and the children were at all times. Another example of his abuse that MZ gave was of taking the children to the seaside for the day (in or around 2014/15) when they had left their car at the train station. FZ texted her throughout the day and when they returned to the car at the end of the day, he had left a hand-written note on the car which read &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Where the hell are you? Why aren&#8217;t you back yet?</span>&#8221;. Bizarrely he had also left cakes and doughnuts on the car bonnet. FZ repeatedly came to their home unannounced, sometimes as often as two or three times in a day, and often at times when the children would be in bed. MZ told the Court that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[e]ven if he had seen the children in the morning, he would message me to then see them in the afternoon.  I did let him in sometimes as I felt scared, and the children were young and sometimes got upset if I didn&#8217;t. I did not want him there and told him so, but he just would not listen.&#8221;</span> MZ had started to contact the police in 2014 or 2015 when FZ was refusing to leave the premises.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During this period FZ had threatened MZ in numerous ways, for example by telling her that if she ever went to W, the children would stay there with his family, and he would not let them leave. FZ used these and other threats to intimidate MZ into allowing him to see the children whenever he wanted to; an all too commonplace example of controlling behaviour. In March 2015 MZ found out that FZ had been posting abuse about her on Facebook, such as that she was a bitch and should burn in hell; MZ had reported this to the police in April 2015. His threats extended to the children such as on another occasion when one of the children told FZ that they had a dream that people were trying to kill him, their father told the child this was true and going to happen. FZ told MZ that there was a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;wide-ranging conspiracy by security services to ruin his life and I was somehow part of this.&#8221;</span> While taken on its own this may appear risible, as part of a pattern of longstanding and persistent harassment it is intimidating and distressing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further serious incident occurred on X&#8217;s eighth birthday in 2015 when the children and their mother met her brother and X&#8217;s friends for pizza. On their return home FZ had knocked on the door of their home with a present. One of the children had let him in, not only had FZ refused to leave when asked by MZ to do so he had insisted on cooking a birthday tea for X, although they had already eaten. When he was holding a knife and chopping vegetables FZ began arguing because he had not been invited to the birthday meal. When MZ had asked him to leave FZ said that she would have to call the police to get him to leave and he said he would slit the throat of the first officer who knocked on the door. MZ pointed the knife at the children&#8217;s mother&#8217;s face with the blade so close that, as she described it, if she had moved the blade would come into contact with her. FZ stepped back when MZ had tried to push him away and placed the flat edge of the knife on her forearm as he put her right wrist on the counter. MZ said FZ was in a furious rage, and he told her to go on and call the police. MZ was very scared and worried that things could get worse, so she left the room. FZ had then left the house. MZ said that she did not call the police as she did not want the child to remember their eighth birthday as the day the police were called, and their father arrested. This incident must have been frightening and distressing for the children, and for MZ.</p>

MZ had pushed FZ to get him to leave and he responded by slapping her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">with such force that it threw me over the living room chair from the back of the chair. This caused a red mark on my face for three days afterwards.&#8221;</span> The incident occurred in front of the children and is remembered clearly by X who told the guardian about it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In August 2015 following a water leak MZ and the children had had to leave their home for four months while the repairs took place. The family were put up in a hotel and MZ took the opportunity to visit the children&#8217;s maternal uncle for six days. FZ had continued his campaign of harassment while they were away continuously contacting MZ on every day, sometimes as much as 12 times on one day, and sending her numerous texts asking why she was not answering his calls. FZ had even gone to another town to look for them. When he knew, they had returned to their hometown he came round uninvited and was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">really angry</span>&#8221; that MZ had taken the children away for a break. The insurance company then moved the family temporarily to another area while the house repairs continued. Although MZ did not tell FZ where they had gone, but he managed to find them and had come banging on their door. Unsurprisingly MZ was scared when FZ had turned up late at night, she had felt intimidated and was coerced into letting him in as, she said, she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;did not want to cause a drama where we were staying, knowing that the insurance company was paying. This went on for around 2 weeks. He would sometimes turn up 2-3 times per day. He would tell me and make me promise not to meet anyone else as he did not want another man around me. He also tried to be very &#8216;touchy-feely&#8217; which was completely unwanted.  It made me feel dirty and like a disgusting object. On another occasion after we separated, he had grabbed my hand and put it on his crotch, in front of the children. This made me feel dirty, cheap and worthless and again like any object.&#8221; </span>I find that FZ&#8217;s abusive behaviour on these occasions amounted to sexual assault and harassment in addition to the threatening behaviour and harassment, controlling and coercive behaviour set out above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When, later in 2015, FZ had gone to W to see his family he did not text or call MZ as much during this time and, as MZ said, it was a welcome break for the family; but as soon as FZ returned to the jurisdiction the harassment started again. When MZ didn&#8217;t respond to FZ&#8217;s messages, he threatened to call the police and report her missing. At this point FZ had been contacting MZ four or five times a day on average, in addition to which he followed her and waited for her at their former home when she returned to feed the animals and to top up electricity meter. The family moved to further temporary accommodation, at an address unknown to FZ, which he did not find initially. The intimidation extended to the children as MZ had been told by a woman who worked at the children&#8217;s breakfast club that FZ was seen waiting in the car outside the school at half past seven in the morning. MZ had had to start dropping the children off at a different entrance. FZ continued to send MZ text messages and notes saying how he loved her and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;wanted to reclaim his family&#8221;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;let&#8217;s all have a good Christmas together&#8221;</span>. In the context of FZ&#8217;s previous behaviour in this case I find that these messages were threatening and intimidating as they were totally at odds with the reality of the situation, the marriage being at an end and contrary to MZ&#8217;s express wishes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unsurprisingly by late 2015 MZ had been in contact with social services and had been advised she should not let FZ see the children, who were the subject of Child Protection Plans because of his harassment, domestic abuse, and controlling behaviour towards MZ. Another distressing and intimidating incident which took place about this time occurred when MZ had been driving into Tesco&#8217;s car park to go shopping with the children and had seen FZ pulling out. MZ had decided not to go to Tesco and drove out of the car park, whereupon FZ had then driven back in and followed them in their car up as they had pulled into Lidl. One of the children got upset as FZ had been waving to them. A couple of weeks later when MZ had gone shopping at Lidl FZ had been there and had called out to her inside the shop. FZ had told MZ that she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;looked nice&#8221; </span>and had attempted to engage her in conversation about the children and social services and said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;that he didn&#8217;t think it was me and that it was the police who had spun a load of lies&#8221;.</span> As FZ had been right in front of her, MZ had been intimidated and felt scared and had left the shop as quickly as she could.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">FZ continued to intimidate and intrude into the lives of MZ and the children. One incident was particularly sinister and frightening. In November 2015 MZ and the children had been living in temporary accommodation staying in a first floor flat in a building for which a code was required to gain entry to the building and a key required to get into the flat itself. On the 17th November MZ had left the property with both children at half past seven in the morning and dropped them off at the breakfast club but returned because she had forgotten their lunchboxes. MZ said that on leaving she knew all the windows were shut and that she had made all the beds but that she was not sure if she locked the flat as she was in a rush.  When MZ had returned home around six o&#8217;clock in the evening she found that the main entrance was open, and their flat door unlocked (she had not needed the key to open it). On entering their flat she had immediately noticed that the hallway window was open as far as it would stretch and from the hallway had seen that in the first bedroom on the right three teddy bears were now tucked in a row underneath the duvet. Neither she nor the children had done this as the bears were normally kept on the windowsill. Then one of the children had come came into the room holding a child&#8217;s toy wand in its wrapping which the child had had found it in doorway of the second bedroom. No one had seen this toy before, and MZ had not bought it. There was no explanation for its appearance and as nothing was missing there was only one probable intruder, FZ. MZ felt <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;creeped out&#8221;</span> by this incident as the only person she could think of who did this FZ; and I find that on the balance of probabilities that is the most likely explanation.</p>

Her neighbours had told her that he had been seen around there. Although MZ reported this incident to the police who told her they were concerned that she was being stalked and had made enquiries (including of local toy shops) she said that she was always <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;worried about escalating matters further and things becoming worse, this was always something I was very scared of when reporting matters to police as I was always scared that it would push the Respondent to threaten and intimidate even more.&#8221; </span>This is an all-too-common fear in victims of harassment and is used by perpetrators to further intimidate and in this case MZ&#8217;s fears proved to be well-founded.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further incident occurred in early December 2015, when on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> a message was sent to X that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;your daddy has presents and kisses in the car.&#8221;</span> X had become really tearful and upset, although MZ did not find out about it until she had collected X from the after-school club on the late afternoon of 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015. FZ had again followed MZ when she had returned to her family home and on pulling up outside the house had seen FZ&#8217;s car drive past which he then parked in front of her. MZ was frightened and in panic she had pulled away and had turned around at the end of the road and as she did so FZ did a three-point turn and left the road. MZ had then decided to carry out the tasks she had intended to do at the house but as she was driving back to their temporary accommodation had seen FZ&#8217;s car again as it had pulled out in front of her. Understandably in fear MZ had turned left into another road and then the first right and had spent <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;five minutes mazing around the roads&#8221;</span> fearful that FZ would try and follow her again. MZ had been convinced that FZ had been trying to keep track of her movements and knew her daily routine. &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I was very scared but also felt very trapped in the situation.&#8221;</span> I find that FZ had been following her and deliberately tracking her movements. </p>

No doubt as he intended her to, she felt intimidated and frightened. I find that FZ was responsible for this as there is no other probable or likely explanation for all four tyres being replaced with flats. MZ reported this to the police who she said were very worried about the family returning to the family home, which had by then been repaired. The police and social services insisted that a panic alarm be fitted into the house before they returned to live there. The garden fence was fixed to prevent intruders from climbing into the garden easily. MZ had been scared to return to their house but as she said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;this was our home, and my job and children&#8217;s school were nearby.&#8221;</span></p>

There followed a brief period that FZ did not contact MZ, but he soon resumed his harassment and kept on contacting her. Although MZ had tried to ignore him and to live as normal a life as possible with the children she had been constantly on edge and worried that she was being watched or followed. As MZ described it she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;was on high alert.&#8221; </span>She recalled an incident after they returned to live back home when there had been<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;a knock on the door, and it was [FZ] saying he was doing a parachute jump and wanted me and the [children] to come and watch him.

This harassment continued after FZ had been served with the non-molestation injunction, breaches of which ultimately led to FZ being held in custody and sentenced in the Crown Court. This period of escalating abuse and harassment started on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016, when MZ received a letter from a person [FB] whom she did not know telling her he had been asked to write to her to ask if FZ could collect tools from the family home, although there were none of his tools left there. <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;It also asked me to say hello to the [children] and that [FZ] respected me as their mother and that &#8216;we would be fine if we were on an island with no other people&#8217;&#8221; </span>Manifestly intended to intimate, that was the result and MZ felt scared; as she said, it is sinister to send messages through a complete stranger. For some time MZ had been trying to apply for protection from the family courts as advised by police and social services but was hampered in doing so, as is all too common, as she was not entitled to public funding and was left unprotected. As MZ said finally <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I summoned the courage to apply in person to [the] Magistrates and Family Court, without legal representation in July 2016&#8221;</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Notwithstanding the court order, and as MZ had feared, the injunction being in force did not deter FZ and his abusive behaviour and harassment and stalking of MZ escalated and worsened in the year that followed. Within weeks of the order being in place, FZ had breached it and went on to include the family&#8217;s neighbours and his own children. MZ discovered in early September 2016 that X had been contacted by FZ through social media and was in communication with him unbeknownst to X&#8217;s mother.<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">This was entirely against advice from social services. I removed the apps from [X&#8217;s] phone. On 5 September 2016, back at the family home, we were burgled. I had fallen asleep in [the child&#8217;s] bedroom when putting [them] to sleep. I had meant to lock the back door but had fallen asleep. I woke the next morning at 5.45am to discover that someone had entered the back door which was open. I found that my jewellery had been stolen (2 x gold wedding rings, an engagement ring and another wedding ring and some other sentimental jewellery) together with the children&#8217;s baby tags and baby hair from when they were newborns [sic].

I was convinced it was [FZ] who had entered the property given what was taken but I had no proof.&#8221;</span> Although the police considered that they could not find evidence that it was FZ, he was arrested. Later that week MZ had come back home to find FZ parked outside her neighbour&#8217;s house, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I left and did not go back home until later, feeling very nervous.&#8221;</span> By his conduct I find that FZ had interfered with MZ&#8217;s ability to access and egress her home unmolested. </p>

That evening a local resident D knocked at the door to tell MZ that FZ had left her a present of a bike. <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I felt like he was drawing attention to the fact I had been burgled. [D] then told me [FZ] wanted her daughter and [one of my children] to have a play date. He also told [D] he wanted her to supervise contact.

FZ had recruited this person to act as a conduit for his harassment. Whether this was done by the neighbour wittingly or unwittingly is something that this Court is unable to determine, but as FZ had been phoning the neighbour weekly to ask them to pass messages to MZ and as they must have been aware that MZ was separated from FZ and did not have direct communication with him, why they thought it appropriate to do so is incomprehensible. In addition, FZ had been asking the neighbour for Facebook and email contact details for the family and about collecting his (non-existent) possessions. Not content with recruiting one neighbour to use as a vessel for harassment, on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2017 FZ sent a message on &#8216;Messenger&#8217; to another local resident saying he needed to speak to MZ urgently.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a result of the harassment MZ had tried to leave their home in early 2017 and move to a location unknown to FZ, without the support of social services, because she was desperate, but FZ soon found them again and they moved back into their home. The continuous harassment resumed, and in March 2017 MZ found out that that FZ had been contacting the school and had asked about the children&#8217;s pick-up times, despite the fact that he knew he could only have supervised contact. Also, in March 2017 sex toy catalogues addressed to FZ were delivered to the family home. MZ believed this was done by FZ to make her feel uncomfortable and intimidated; I find that there could be no other reason and that it was further harassment of a sexual nature.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">FZ had been continuing to contact various local residents and had been speaking to them about MZ; his statements and behaviour were becoming more bizarre. MZ was told by one person that FZ had been ranting at her for 50 minutes that MZ was part of a corrupt system and his conduct had reduced her to tears. FZ had again contacted the school and said that they were plotting against him and he that he would have to go to the media to expose them. In April 2017, he contacted another neighbour and asked him to view a YouTube video in which FZ was speaking and said the people who did this [to him] will be punished. Inevitably MZ had become more intimidated, more anxious, and even more scared for her own and her children&#8217;s safety as well as becoming increasingly worried about FZ&#8217;s apparently worsening mental state.</p>

At around nine or half past on Sunday morning when MZ was at home when there was a knock on the front door and because it was still broken, she had had to go round to the side of the house to see who was there. This time it was an unknown woman who MZ assumed lived nearby. The woman had had a parcel in her hands and walked towards MZ saying &#8220;&#8217;<span style="font-style:italic">I have been asked to give this to you, I hope it doesn&#8217;t cause any trouble</span>&#8217;.&#8221; The parcel was a box wrapped in blue paper with &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; written all over it. MZ had then noticed someone standing diagonally from her at a distance of about twenty feet and had seen FZ staring at her. <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I was freaked out and quickly walked back to the rear of the house, went inside and locked the door. I was then worried all morning about leaving the house and stayed in until lunchtime, worried [FZ] was still waiting.&#8221;</span></p>

Regardless of his subsequent diagnosis of mental illness there is evidence here of a planning and he must have been sufficiently convincing to be able to recruit several neighbours of a period of months. MZ&#8217;s description of feeling like a prisoner in her own home rings true, and it must have caused the children harm as well. </span></p>

This left me feeling shocked and even more freaked out. X was mortified by this, as all [their] friends would see it on their way to school, [X] asked why [FZ] cannot just send &#8230; a card.&#8221;</span> The intensity of the campaign of harassment continued; on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2017 after MZ had gone out to the local shops she encountered FZ in his car. FZ stopped his car and got out so that MZ had had to move away but when she had looked back, she saw him still standing there and holding flowers in his hand. MZ had ignored FZ and gone home, where, as she did not have her mobile with her, she phoned the police immediately. The next day MZ had gone outside to top up the electric meter when <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I opened the door to the meter and found a bunch of fresh flowers with a card attached to the flowers which read, &#8216;thank you for being the perfect mum you are...&#8217; and signed as &#8216;Daddy loves you forever&#8217;.&#8221;</span> The note was in FZ&#8217;s handwriting and it constituted a further breach of the non-molestation order. As MZ had only made a statement to the police the day before following the previous breaches MZ had been very shocked to have received the flowers and had thought FZ was still in police custody. As she put it in her statement there seemed to be no end to FZ&#8217;s relentless, obsessive harassment which was causing her immense stress, fear, and frustration. MZ had decided to arrange for the house to be sold so they could move to get away from FZ. MZ reported the incident with the flowers and gave the note to the police.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further incident which took place occurred at around half past nine at night on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2017. Following a knock at the front door MZ had gone round to the side of the house and was confronted by a pizza delivery driver with a pizza in his hand which he was trying to deliver. Although MZ had told him she had not ordered a pizza he was so persistent MZ had to take it so he would leave. The children who were 10 and 6 at the time were already in bed and, because of what had happened before, MZ was frightened that FZ would be nearby and that he had watched her go outside and to collect the pizza. As the most likely person to have ordered an unwanted pizza was FZ, MZ thought that he had breached the court order again. I consider that MZ&#8217;s conclusion was reasonable and that it is more probable than not that FZ had ordered the pizza to be sent to the home of MZ and the children. MZ had reported the incident to police and gave them a copy of the receipt for the pizza. MZ must have felt that there was little or no point in the existence of the injunction as it had failed to contain or stop FZ&#8217;s harassment and abusive behaviour. </p>

On Saturday 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2017 at shortly after eight o&#8217;clock in the morning MZ was woken up by the sound of banging coming from the door or windows in the living room. She described it as follows: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The sound was a frantic hammering noise which was continuous and so I assumed it had to be [FZ]. I went to the front window and looked through the blind and saw [FZ] walking away from the front to the side of the house. I could see he was wearing a black T shirt and dark blue jeans. The banging then began at the side of the house, and I pressed the police panic alarm installed in the property and went to find the children and hid in the back bedroom with them as he would have had to climb the fence of the garden to access the back bedroom window. We must have sat hiding for 10 minutes in the bedroom until the knocking and banging stopped. I did not look out of the window again in case [FZ] was still waiting. I did not answer any doors until I heard a police officer shout through that they had arrived. When they had arrived, I checked the front door and found a note that had been left by [FZ], I recognised the handwritten as [his] on the envelope. I gave the note to the police. I felt terrified for myself and the children, given his past behaviour towards me and the persistent harassment and stalking behaviour despite the existence of the non-molestation order.&#8221;</span> This must have been a terrifying and traumatising event for the children and their mother.</p>

FZ was eventually charged with 2 breaches of non-molestation order, 2 harassment charges and one charge of witness intimidation. After sentencing on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2018, he was moved from prison to a secure mental health unit. An indefinite restraining order was made against the Respondent not to contact the children and/or MZ either directly or indirectly. MZ remained &#8220;terrified&#8221; that on his release from prison that FZ would find her, and the children and that the relentless harassment would start again. It was and is a reasonable fear based on her previous experience.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X is the elder of the two children and was described by the guardian as academically and emotionally intelligent and mature beyond the child&#8217;s years. Despite this X told the guardian that it is hard to enjoy school and to connect with the other children and to find things in common with them. X&#8217;s past experience of social workers has led to them being held in low esteem by X who considers that the family have not been helped by social services. The guardian considered that X showed profound care and concern for MZ and the younger sibling, Y. X supported the applications made by MZ including the name change and curtailment of FZ&#8217;s exercise of parental responsibility. The guardian considered that X demonstrated an understanding of what parental responsibility is in legal terms including the practicalities of what it would mean for this to be extinguished or curtailed and gave as an example being able to obtain a passport, which X has been unable to do. I am unclear as to why, as an application could be made with reference to the court, if necessary, I presume that it is because X would not want FZ to be involved and that this is because, as the guardian said, X resents the fact FZ retains an element of control and power over their lives which X considers he does not deserve. Any application that X now makes for a passport will not involve FZ by reason of the existing court orders. The guardian&#8217;s analysis does not fully consider or explore this child&#8217;s understanding of the long-term effects of extinguishing parental responsibility in respect of the child in terms of connection with X&#8217;s parental family and dual heritage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X&#8217;s feeling about FZ&#8217;s PR being removed as reported by the guardian was that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it is not as though anything will be lost</span>&#8221;. X told the guardian that X could remember the precise date that FZ was last seen in December 2016, a period of almost four and a half years, during which FZ has played no role in the lives of X or Y. It is of deep concern to the Court that despite this absence X has, according to the guardian seen FZ as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">continu[ing] to be a malevolent presence</span>&#8221; and that she has said he is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not here physically, but like a shadow hanging over us.&#8221; </span>I find that X&#8217;s fearful and negative view of FZ was formed not only by memories of the time prior to the parents' separation but also by the subsequent years of harassment and stalking. The guardian said some of what happened in the home went over X&#8217;s head, and didn&#8217;t strike the child at the time as dysfunctional or inappropriate, but the effects of domestic abuse in the home on the children living there are now recognised and it is more likely than not that the overall feeling or atmosphere in the house which X has described as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">chaotic and tense</span>&#8221;, and the tell-tale description of tiptoeing around trying to avoid triggering FZ into behaviour which was aggressive or abusive, which X recalled he regularly was, have had a lasting effect and caused X long lasting emotional harm. The description the guardian gave of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">walking on eggshells&#8221;</span> with which X agreed is redolent of the fear induced by coercive and controlling behaviour. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X has what is on the guardian&#8217;s evidence (as contained in her analysis for the court) a clear recollection of particular incidents of abuse, including violence such as FZ striking MZ across the face with a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">monumental amount of force</span>&#8221; which had caused MZ to fall to the floor and left &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a huge red mark</span>&#8221; on her face. X told the guardian that when X was seven years old MZ had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">had the strength to kick him [FZ] out</span>&#8221;, but following their parents' separation, FZ continued to do <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;creepy and disturbing things&#8221; </span>recalling that despite their separation, on X&#8217;s ninth birthday FZ put up banners outside their home saying <span style="font-style:italic">'[X] AND [Y], MISS YOU SO MUCH'</span>. That FZ had taken tyres off MZ&#8217;s car and that he had broken into their home and rearranged things. It is unsurprising that these and other instances of FZ&#8217;s behaviour subsequent to the children&#8217;s parents&#8217; separation continue to unnerve, disturb and distress X. That X continues to be distressed by the abuse was evinced by X crying when remembering the events when discussing them with the guardian and recalling the feelings of helplessness they induced.  This child told the guardian there had been occasions when FZ had hurt X by twisting and pinching X&#8217;s skin and digging his nails into the child until it bled.  X had never seen F hurt Y and hoped that he never did and told the guardian that it was MZ who &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">got most of [the abuse]</span>&#8221;. I accept what X told the guardian as an accurate report of X&#8217;s experience of the abuse suffered by the family as perpetrated by FZ. It is clear too that X has been the more obviously affected of the two children by his abuse and shall make further reference to this below.</p>

Sadly, as it is the experience of the family courts that the behaviour described by X and MZ is far from uncommon or unusual. The guardian&#8217;s view, which I share, it that the cumulative effect of FZ&#8217;s behaviour has had a profound impact upon X and that the transition into a new life has not been easy. X had not been comfortable choosing and coming to terms with a new name and has struggled to settle into a new life, and, in the guardian&#8217;s view, did not enjoy school as much as a child of X&#8217;s intelligence and academic capability should be able to. X continues to worry about MZ and Y coping with the struggle of adapting to their new life and surroundings which, in turn, the guardian has told the Court has an impact on X&#8217;s ability to heal.</p>

This latter wish has been granted to all intents and purposes by the extensive orders made by this Court and by FZ himself declaring (albeit by email) that he intends to live outside the jurisdiction and is seeking neither contact with, nor to play any role in X&#8217;s life. X told the guardian that FZ is not well enough to fulfil his role and while there is some basis (see the assessments carried out for the Crown Court pr&#233;cised above) for that belief this Court was not in a position to decide the current state of FZ&#8217;s mental health including his capacity to litigate nor his mental stability and the effect it may or may not have on his ability to exercise parental responsibility. The orders that have been made amount to a comprehensive and wide-ranging bar on his legal right to do so are made as a result of his past behaviour including criminal breach of previous court orders and the hospital order made by the Crown Court. </p>

As a matter of law, it is agreed by all parties that this Court cannot extinguish his parental responsibility as FZ has it because he was married to the children&#8217;s mother when X and Y were born (I shall return to the law below). The most this Court could do is to find the current legislation in respect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, by which parental responsibility is conferred on married fathers and &#8220;second&#8221; mothers and parents in civil partnerships automatically on the birth of a child, incompatible with the ECHR by virtue of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>. Whether the Court does or does not do so it may not bring matters to a close, there could be continuing litigation through the appellate procedure and beyond. The guardian&#8217;s conclusion that it is her assessment that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Court Order sought by [MZ] on behalf of the children is in line with the emotional needs of X, who currently is unable to fully move on from [X&#8217;s] experiences with the knowledge that [FZ] maintains parental responsibility for [X]</span>&#8221; is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the orders which this Court can make. FZ&#8217;s parental responsibility will remain unless and until there is a change in current law in this jurisdiction. It is worrying that X does not understand that legal reality, even more so if this child&#8217;s well-being is to be predicated on a mistaken understanding of the Court&#8217;s powers.</p>

There should be, and is on the part of this Court, concern that without appropriate professional intervention and support long-term well-being of both X and Y, who are of dual heritage, in respect of their self-image and in their ability to feel empowered not powerless will be further compromised. This will not only affect their view and ability to come to terms with their own father but also their future relationships with others as older adolescents and into adulthood. I am most concerned that they are able to access the appropriate professional support and counselling that will enable them to achieve the closure they want and come to terms with their past experience, something this judgment cannot do for them; the primary purpose of the Court&#8217;s judgment as with any judgment is to set out reasons for decisions the court has made.</p>

Y recalled seeing MZ scared which had naturally caused Y to feel scared. Nonetheless, unlike X, Y was able to tell the guardian that Y had some happy memories of FZ from a long time ago but no longer felt love for FZ mainly because of the amount of time which has elapsed since Y had seen him. Significantly Y would like to have a dad, although not the FZ. Y feels envious of the peers and classmates who have two parents and feels as though there is an important component of Y&#8217;s own childhood missing. This is a comment of some prescient wisdom and I consider that Y is able to reflect on the situation in respect of FZ in a more nuanced and balanced manner than the older sibling which I hope is a sign that Y will be able to mature without the level of residual trauma currently displayed X. </p>

It was the guardian&#8217;s assessment that, as was the case with X, Y was trying to recover from not only from experiences of domestic abuse and the absence of their father but also reconcile to the new life that was required to create safety for the family.  </p>

Y, as is common for youngsters who are seeking information about what is happening to them, had turned to social media for answers about this and told the guardian that Y has watched the videos which FZ had uploaded. The guardian has discussed this directly with MZ who planned to speak to Y and look into placing restrictions on the website to protect Y from this content.

I question whether court orders alone can achieve the reconciliation with the past that both the children so badly need, and hope that Y and X are able to access the professional help and support that can help them as they grow into adulthood so that they may achieve their real potential. </p>

The court must accept that the institution of marriage (which may be said to retain elements of its patriarchal foundations as illustrated in the proceedings brought in respect of heterosexual civil partnerships) is a fundamental part of the sociolegal familial framework in the United Kingdom. As referred to in the submissions of the Secretary of State, Parliament has had to consider the rights of parents and children on divorce including where a married mother or a married father acts incompatibly with their parental responsibility. </span></p>

Birth mothers and married fathers continue to acquire parental responsibility automatically and while unmarried fathers (being considered less committed parents) did not. We shall see that this dichotomy has been extended to other parents. As time has passed changes in society led Parliament to legislate so that &#8220;unmarried&#8221; fathers acquire parental responsibility more easily and that the current legislative provision, including the courts&#8217; power to revoke parental responsibility, was to encourage the granting of parental responsibility overall.  It was further submitted that the &#8220;special status&#8221; of birth mothers and married fathers should be retained and that their parental responsibility should not be &#8220;formally&#8221; revoked, but if a parent&#8217;s behaviour was such that continued exercise of their parental responsibility required it, the courts have a range of orders at their disposal, and the power to impose conditions.</span></p>

However, recommendations were made that the law should provide for an unmarried father to have the right to apply to the court for parental rights and duties. This was to enable the court to assimilate the position of an unmarried father to that of a married father if it considered this to be in the child&#8217;s interests. In its Report in 1986 the Law Commission recommended that courts should have the power to revoke parental responsibility orders. It was considered that courts might be reluctant to make such orders at all unless they were also able to revoke them, where it subsequently provided not to be in the child&#8217;s interests for the father to have them.&#8221;</span></p>

Nonetheless the Court has to accept that the legislative body has considered the effects of domestic abuse, indeed it had formed part of the rationale for legislating for the revocation of parental responsibility from unmarried parents so as to encourage the making of parental responsibility orders in the interest of the children of unmarried parents.

Again, at the risk of repetition, I have previously alluded to issues of self image and identity (including their dual heritage) which are quite different to any argument put forward by their mother, in addition to which the extinguishing of parental responsibility could well have additional ramifications in the future, such as inheritance, none of which have been fully argued or considered by this Court. It is quite possible that a court, had it been able to consider revocation, may have concluded that it was not in the best interests of both children jointly or individually to revoke FZ&#8217;s parental responsibility entirely; it is also possible that a court might have considered revocation was in the best interests of one or both of the children.
