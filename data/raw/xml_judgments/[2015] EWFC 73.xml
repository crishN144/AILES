	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with a child, Z, who was born in August 2014 in the State of Minnesota in the United States of America. Z was conceived with the applicant father&#8217;s sperm and a third party donor&#8217;s egg implanted in an experienced unmarried American surrogate mother. There is no need for me to go into the details. Suffice it to say that the surrogacy arrangements were made through the agency of an Illinois company and in accordance with Illinois law. The agency was paid $12,000 and the surrogate mother a total of $33,737.10, comprising $5,637.10 in expenses, $1,100 compensation for the inconvenience of fertility treatment, $25,000 pregnancy compensation and $2,000 C-section compensation. Following Z&#8217;s birth, the father obtained a declaratory judgment from the appropriate court in Minnesota, relieving the surrogate mother of any legal rights or responsibilities for Z and establishing the father&#8217;s sole parentage of Z. Following that court order he was registered as Z&#8217;s father in Minnesota. The father has since returned to this country, bringing Z with him.</p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The legal effect of this can be summarised as follows. The surrogate mother, although she no longer has any legal rights in relation to Z under Minnesota law, is treated in this country as being his mother. Whatever his legal rights in Minnesota, the father does not have parental responsibility for Z in this country. For the moment Z&#8217;s position has been secured by making him a ward of court, but this in the nature of things cannot provide a permanent solution. There are only two possible routes by which the court can secure the permanent transfer in this country of parental responsibility from the surrogate mother to the father: by means of a parental order in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>; or by means of a adoption order in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>. For reasons that are well understood and apparent from a number of authorities which there is no need for me to refer to, the father would very much prefer to be able to obtain a parental order. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus in February 2015 the father applied to this court for a parental order in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. The surrogate mother has executed a notarised consent to the making of the order which complies with the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/54/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 54(6)</ref> and 54(7) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> (see below). The parental order reporter supports the father&#8217;s application and invites the court to exercise its discretion retrospectively to authorise the various payments.</p>

From the very beginning of adoption in this country, the legislation has always provided for adoption orders to be made in favour of either one person (see, for example, section 1(3) of the Adoption Act 1926, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 14</ref> and 15 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1976</ref> and, now, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/51" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>) or a couple. Originally, and until quite recently, a couple could adopt only if they were husband and wife (see, for example, section 1(3) of the 1926 Act and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1976 Act</ref>). </p>

For present purposes, it suffices for me to note the Public Bill Committee debate on clause 54 of the Bill in the House of Commons on 12 June 2008. Dr Pugh, Member of Parliament for Stockport, moved a series of amendments, tabled by the Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Hansard, col 246), to permit the making of a parental order in favour of one person. Summarising his colleague&#8217;s argument, he said (cols 247-248):</p>

The Bill extends the provisions to include civil partners and couples who are not in a civil partnership or married, but who are living as partners in an enduring relationship. A parental order is awarded by a court, subject to the report of the parental order reporter, who visits the parties concerned and prepares a report on whether the provisions of the law are met &#8211; for example, whether the woman who carried the child has freely given her unconditional consent.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Surrogacy arrangements are not in themselves enforceable in law, although, when making decisions about whether or not to grant a parental order, the courts will take into account factors such a &#8211; as we would expect &#8211; where it would be in the best interests of the child to be brought up. The Bill does not extend parental orders to single people. As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendments seek to change that with regard to surrogacy. It is interesting to note that surrogacy has rarely featured in the scrutiny and the debates that have taken place on the review of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref> and the Bill.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Before I answer the specific points, it might be useful to recap by saying that surrogacy is such a sensitive issue, fraught with potential complications such as the surrogate mother being entitled to change her mind and decide to keep her baby, that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref> quite specifically limits parental orders to married couples where the gametes of at least one of them are used. That recognises the magnitude of a situation in which a person becomes pregnant with the express intention of handing the child over to someone else, and the responsibility that that places on the people who will receive the child. There is an argument, which the Government have acknowledged in the Bill, that such a responsibility is likely to be better handled by a couple than a single man or woman.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I would say to the hon. Gentleman that there is a difference. His point was that single people are able to adopt and to receive IVF, so why can they not get a parental order over surrogacy? The difference is this: adoption involves a child who already exists and whose parents are not able to keep the child, for whom new parents are sought. That is different, which is why there is no parallel. IVF involves a woman becoming pregnant herself and giving birth to her child &#8211; there is not a direct parallel. Surrogacy, however, involves agreeing to hand over a child even before conception. The Government are still of the view that the magnitude of that means that it is best dealt with by a couple. That is why we have made the arrangements that we have.</p>

The court&#8217;s role is one of review. The court will reach a different conclusion from the legislature only when it is apparent that the legislature has attached insufficient importance to a person&#8217;s Convention rights. The readiness of the court to depart from the view of the legislature depends upon the subject matter of the legislation and of the complaint &#8230; But &#8230; where the alleged violation comprises differential treatment based on grounds such as race or sex or sexual orientation the court will scrutinise with intensity any reasons said to constitute justification. The reasons must be cogent if such differential treatment is to be justified.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Isaacs elaborates the argument in this way. She points out that both the law, and indeed government policy, clearly support the principle that single people should not be excluded from being eligible to <span style="font-style:italic">adopt </span>by reason of their personal relationship status. The &#8220;complex&#8221; and &#8220;sensitive&#8221; features of adoption &#8211; deliberately she mimics the words of the Minister of State &#8211; are <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>regarded as a bar to single people adopting. So, she submits, it is artificial, disproportionate and discriminatory to distinguish between adoption and surrogacy on the basis of the complexity or sensitivity of surrogacy. The &#8220;two people&#8221; requirement in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(1)</ref> offends, she says, against two cardinal principles of twenty-first century family law: that there should be no discrimination against the increasingly different kinds of family which society is creating; and that the child&#8217;s welfare remains the court&#8217;s paramount consideration. </p>

She seeks to bolster the argument by pointing to the significant increase in international surrogacy cases, and thus of single parents in surrogacy cases, since the Minister of State was speaking in 2008. The legal and societal context is now, she submits, significantly, indeed profoundly, different.    </p>

It is reading the legislation in a way that draws out the full implications of its terms and of the Convention rights. And, by its very nature, an implication will go with the grain of the legislation. By contrast, using a Convention right to read in words that are inconsistent with the scheme of the legislation or with its essential principles as disclosed by its provisions does not involve any form of interpretation, by implication or otherwise. It falls on the wrong side of the boundary between interpretation and amendment of the statute.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">&#8230; the key to what it is possible for the courts to imply into legislation without crossing the border from interpretation to amendment does not lie in the number of words that have to be read in. The key lies in a careful consideration of the essential principles and scope of the legislation being interpreted. If the insertion of one word contradicts those principles or goes beyond the scope of the legislation, it amounts to impermissible amendment. On the other hand, if the implication of a dozen words leaves the essential principles and scope of the legislation intact but allows it to be read in a way which is compatible with Convention rights, the implication is a legitimate exercise of the powers conferred by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(1)</ref>. Of course, the greater the extent of the proposed implication, the greater the need to make sure that the court is not going beyond the scheme of the legislation and embarking upon amendment. Nevertheless, what matters is not the number of words but their effect.&#8221;</p>

Although the concept of who are a couple for this purpose has changed down the years, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>, like <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/30" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 30</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>, is clear that one person cannot apply. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 54(1)</ref> could not be clearer, and the contrast in this respect &#8211; obvious to any knowledgeable critic &#8211; between adoption orders and parental orders, which is a fundamental difference of obvious significance, is both very striking and, in my judgment, very telling. Surely, it betokens a very clear difference of policy which Parliament, for whatever reasons, thought it appropriate to draw both in 1990 and again in 2008. And, as it happens, this is not a matter of mere speculation or surmise, because we know from what the Minister of State said in 2008 that this was seen as a necessary distinction based on what were thought to be important points of principle.</p>
