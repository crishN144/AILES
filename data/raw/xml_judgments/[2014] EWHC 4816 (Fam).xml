	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The brief background history to this matter is as follows.  In 2008 A and B were married.  They attempted several cycles of IVF treatment, which were sadly unsuccessful.  In 2012 they approached B Local Authority department to enquire about being adopters and seeking approval as adopters.  Having waited a considerable period of time, in June 2013 they were engaged on an adoption course run by the local authority.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Approximately two weeks later a work colleague of A, G, asked him if she could have time off work because she wished to attend with her long-term friend D for her to undergo a termination of her pregnancy.  It was during the course of that conversation, I am told, that G learned that A and his wife were seeking to be adoptive parents and were on an adoption course.  It was then that she had the idea to introduce A and B to D and E.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In June 2013 D was pregnant with C, but both she and her husband felt that, given their financial circumstances, they were not in a position to look after another child.  Accordingly, they had come to the difficult and sad conclusion that she should undergo a termination.  </p>

E told me in evidence and I accept, terminating a pregnancy is the biggest sin and that it was far better that the child should be born and placed with a prosperous couple.  D agreed with everything that her husband said in evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note and accept that immediately after A and B had been introduced to D and E, B contacted B Local Authority.  She told me she was then, in colloquial terms, &#8216;given the runaround&#8217; by the local authority and was passed between B Local Authority and then A Local Authority.  It is recorded in the local authority&#8217;s file that B telephoned A Local Authority on 23 September 2013.  A and B tell me, and I accept, that throughout the balance of the pregnancy they paid some &#163;30 or &#163;40 per month to D and E in order to assist them with purchasing food and the like whilst D was pregnant.</p>

G was, by chance, present in D and E&#8217;s home and it was then that D and E asked A and B whether they could lend them &#163;5000.  The loan was for the purpose of them being able to satisfy the financial requirements of their visa application: D being here in this country only on a student visa.</p>

They offered to pay D and E &#163;1500 and that was paid through a bank transfer on 13&#160;January 2014, the selfsame date that C was born.  Three days later, on 16 January, upon being discharged from hospital, D and E handed over C to A and B and he has remained in their care since that time. </p>

A further request was made for a smaller sum of &#163;400 and that was paid on 31 March.  I am told by both A, B and D and E that in early April 2014 the sum of &#163;1650 was repaid to A and B.  In July 2014 &#163;700 was repaid in cash, in August 2014 &#163;300 was repaid in cash, in September &#163;800 was repaid in cash and on 20 October &#163;400 was repaid by bank transfer, leaving a total outstanding at the moment for repayment on the loan of &#163;1050.</p>

It was then revealed to the social worker that they had paid &#163;30 to &#163;40 per month or so to D and E.  During the course of that meeting they were asked whether they had paid any other monies to D and E.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At a subsequent meeting on 5 September the social worker asked A and B to produce their bank statements.  They did so and B told the social worker that it would be seen that there were large sums of monies paid by them to D and E.  The social worker had previously asked whether any other monies had been paid by A and B to D and E, to which B said no.  That was plainly not correct, but there is an issue.  The social worker was asking, she says, whether any other monies at all had been paid.  It would appear that B and A interpreted that question as being had any other monies been paid in relation to the adoption of C.</p>

The police undertook an investigation, having been reminded that pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 95</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> it was a criminal offence to make any payments in relation to an adoption.

However, it was, I am told, the clear view of the Local Authority that even if this payment of &#163;4900 had been made for or in consideration of the adoption of C, nevertheless the court should go on and make an adoption order.  As the social worker  clearly sets out in her annex A report, C has been with A and B since 16 January, so all but three days of the whole of his life so far, the care that has been afforded by them is exemplary and there are absolutely no concerns about the care that they have given to this little boy.</p>

It is plain, as was indicated by counsel for the Guardian, that both in the written evidence and some of the oral evidence there are slight differences of emphasis, possibly what could be connoted as inconsistencies between the accounts given by the adoptive parents and the natural parents and G.  However, I am quite satisfied overall that they, and I remind myself that A and D and E had to give evidence through interpreters,  were genuine and honest people in the explanation that they gave me of the arrangements which led to C being placed with A and B.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is, I find, a remarkable coincidence that large sums of money were paid by A and B to D and E on the day of and subsequently shortly after the birth of the child.  There are very strong public policy considerations against permitting monies to be paid for the handing over of a child or for the adoption of a child.  There are very strong public policy considerations against permitting privately arranged adoptions.  The reasons for those are all too obvious.  On occasions the court is aware that privately arranged adoptions have taken place in circumstances which are wholly inimicable to the welfare of the child concerned.  </p>

It was happenchance that she discovered that A and his wife wanted to adopt a child and, of course, she is a long-term friend of D of some four years standing. </p>

On the totality of the evidence, although very coincidental that the monies were paid around the time of the birth of the child, I accept the evidence I&#160;have heard that those monies, the &#163;4900, were not paid for or in consideration of the adoption of C.</p>

On the totality of the evidence I am satisfied that A and B are entirely proper and suitable people to be the adoptive parents of C.  I accept the evidence of the social worker that they have given him excellent care since 16 January and it would be wholly contrary to his interests for him to be removed from their care at this stage.  The social worker told me that they had considered alternative orders under which C could reside with A and B, namely a residence order under section 8 of the 1989 Children Act, or under a special guardianship under section 14(a) of the 1989 Act.  Having considered those options the social worker was satisfied, as is the Guardian, that adoption is the only route which provides proper permanence for C throughout his childhood and indeed throughout his life.</p>
