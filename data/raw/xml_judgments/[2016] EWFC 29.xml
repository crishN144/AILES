	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">It is almost always likely to be wrong for a recording device to be placed on a child for the purpose of gathering evidence in family proceedings, whether or not the child is aware of its presence.  This should hardly need saying, but nowadays it is all too easy for individuals to record other people without their knowledge.  Advances in technology empower anyone with a mobile phone or a tablet to make recordings that would be the envy of yesterday&#8217;s spies.  This judgment describes the serious consequences that have arisen for one family after a parent covertly recorded a child in this way.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The details of the case itself are not relevant.  It was a dispute about whether a child in the later stages of primary schooling, who I will call Tara, should continue to live with her father or move to live with her mother.  At the end of the hearing I decided in the mother&#8217;s favour, an outcome supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  That judgment will not be published lest a link be made between the family and the events now described.</span></p>

All in all, the proceedings ran for 18 months and during that time there were a number of meetings between Tara and her social worker, a family support worker and the Guardian.  Unfortunately, the father and his partner were determined to know what the child was saying at these meetings and also to record what the professionals were saying.  As a result they embarked on a plan of action described in this extract from the original judgment:</span></p>

Counsel on behalf of Tara drew attention to the court&#8217;s powers under FPR 22.1 to control the evidence it receives.  This includes the power to exclude evidence that would otherwise be admissible.  She urged that as a matter of public policy conduct of this kind should be discouraged and that the resulting evidence should only be admitted in exceptional circumstances.  Moreover, the material that the father wished to file was selective.  If the court did not exclude the evidence obtained in this way, it would send the wrong message to other parents.  At the same time, she contended that the fact that the recordings were made is in itself relevant and, indeed, important when considering Tara&#8217;s welfare.  She submitted that the recordings were not unlawful and do not constitute a breach of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/29" uk:canonical="1998 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Data Protection Act 1998</ref> because they fall within the &#8216;domestic purposes&#8217; exemption provided by s.36:</span></p>

However, the alternative &#8211; a conspiracy between those in court and the court itself to keep the matter secret from Tara and everyone else &#8211; is unacceptable in principle and unworkable in practice.
