In that case a mother had been convicted of the murder of her two children who had simply stopped breathing. The mother&#8217;s two other children had experienced apparent life threatening events taking a similar form. The Court of Appeal Criminal Division quashed the convictions. There was no evidence other than repeated incidents of breathing having ceased. There was serious disagreement between experts as to the cause of death. There was fresh evidence as to hereditary factors pointing to a possible genetic cause. In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal held that it could not be said that a natural cause could be excluded as a reasonable possible explanation. In the course of his judgment, Judge LJ (as he then was) observed: &#8220;What may be unexplained today may be perfectly well understood tomorrow. Until then, any tendency to dogmatise should be met with an answering challenge.&#8221;</span></p>

At paragraph 10, he observed: &#8220;A temptation there described is ever present in Family proceedings too and, in my judgment, should be as firmly resisted there as the courts are required to resist it in criminal law. In other words, there has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown. That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof. It is simply a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the causation advanced by the one shouldering the burden of proof is established on the balance of probabilities.</span></p>

In order to make a finding that a particular person was the perpetrator of nonaccidental injury the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities. It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child, although where it is impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example that Parent A rather than Parent B caused the injury, then neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so.&#8221;</span></p>

In his medical note he described the blood as &#8220;pouring from her rectum&#8221; and said that the anal opening was &#8220;large and irregular&#8221;.  In oral evidence Dr B (whose first language is not English) said that &#8220;dribbling&#8221; was a more accurate description than &#8220;pouring&#8221;.  However, because he was not asked about this for over a year, the difference of emphasis only became clear during his evidence at this hearing.</span></p>

At the meeting on 12 December Dr W, the paediatrician with responsibility for safeguarding, is recorded as saying &#8220;She suffered from chronic constipation and it would be normal for the anus to be dilated and for there to be blood&#8221; and that &#8220;Chronic means 6 months or more so it is not surprising that she became ill.&#8221;  I have not heard from Dr W, but this view can only have come directly or indirectly from the parents or from a misunderstanding.  It is wholly inaccurate, was not based on any medical evidence, and is not the version of events now put forward by the parents.  However, it was accepted as fact without challenge and must have influenced many of the decisions that followed.</span></p>

It was only on that date that the children were medically examined, five days after they had gone back to live at home.  The findings from those examinations were within normal limits.</span></p>

A polite letter was written by the allocated social worker requesting that unsupervised contact should not be allowed.  Following the parents&#8217; arrest on 27 August, arrangements were made for the maternal grandmother to supervise the children&#8217;s contact with the mother.  On 25 September, the local authority became concerned that the mother was breaching her bail conditions by having unsupervised contact with the children.

The original interim care plans were for them to be divided between several foster placements.  After discussion with the Children&#8217;s Guardian, the plans were changed and the children were placed with their grandmother who had been given temporary approval as a local authority foster carer.  However, the grandparents, who were already looking after the three children of the mother&#8217;s sister, came to find the task of looking after so many children too much.  The five children were moved on 8 January 2014 to a single placement out of county where they are having regular contact with the mother and appear to be thriving.  The father has no contact at present owing to his bail conditions. </span></p>

The assembly of the parties' evidence, the obtaining of police disclosure and the gathering of expert evidence represented a very considerable challenge, but it has been met.  This hearing could not have been effective without the outstanding cooperation and expertise shown by the parties and their representatives, leading and junior counsel and solicitors.  I particularly pay tribute to the efficiency of the local authority solicitor, Ms Haughin, who gathered a very large amount of witness evidence within a very limited timescale, and to the Guardian's solicitor, Mr Lewis, who has marshalled the expert evidence.  The hearing itself has been conducted by the advocates with an economical focus on the real issues, both orally and in writing.  </span></p>

She did not accept the suggestion that the delay was unacceptable.

P would probably have continued crying for many minutes.   It would have been obvious to any carer witnessing the incident that she had suffered a significant injury.  For some days thereafter, anyone performing care tasks (including nappy changing, dressing and undressing) would have noticed that she was in discomfort.  To the extent that P was mobile, a reduction in her mobility and a favouring of the other leg would have been apparent.

It may have been inflicted cruelly, negligently or accidentally by one or other of the parents, or it may have been an accident that was covered up, but neither possibility has been proved to my satisfaction.  Whether it may have occurred when P was with a third party, unlikely though that seems, has never been investigated.  The injury is not of a type that is specific for ill-treatment as opposed to accident.  The overall family circumstances do not suggest an environment in which physical violence was regularly meted out.  There was no recent history of concern from school or health professionals.  No external injuries were found on any of the other five children.  Rather, the picture is of a small and very crowded house with a great deal of coming and going and rumbustious play.  Because the injury was not discovered at the time, it is impossible to fix it in time or place or to ascribe responsibility.</span></p>

I am unable to say whether they knew something was wrong but did not act, or whether they culpably failed to notice.  The latter is a possibility, given the nature of the household and the number of children.

Likewise, Dr Leadbeatter gave valuable assistance.  He was a cautious witness who measured his words with exactitude, a very proper approach in a case of this kind.

She says that this injury is very unusual.  She has never seen such an injury in 25 years experience.  Her opinion is that this is a bruise caused by trauma.  It is very difficult to say what type of trauma would have caused it but it would be some sort of trauma around the lower abdomen or pelvic region.  It could have been caused at the same time and in the same way as the anal findings, namely by penetrative entry into the rectum.  This fits with the architecture of the body.</span></p>

If it is bruising, it could be due to sexual abuse.  Taken in isolation, it is worrying and difficult to explain.  He has never seen this finding in over 30 years&#8217; experience.  It is unique and, where one has not seen it before and there is no peer-reviewed research, one is cautious.  He agrees that if there is a bruise in the parametrium, this is more consistent with something going in rather than something coming out.</span></p>

Dr Armour said that she had never seen anal injuries such as these as a result of constipation.  There is no evidence that P was constipated at or around the time of her death or that she passed a stool of this kind.  On the contrary, the reliable descriptions are of her stools being loose.  Nor is there any evidence that she had diarrhoea.   I find that the injuries to the anal region were not the result of P passing a hard bulky stool.  </span></p>

I was not impressed by his account.  His description of being woken by a cry and then removing P from her cot in a most unusual condition (clenched teeth, rigid body) before loosening her nappy and leaving her on the bed was puzzling.  It is hard to understand why he should have loosened her nappy or why, having gone downstairs to get another nappy, he should have begun to go back to sleep without changing P while leaving her on the bed.  There is also no explanation as to why he would then have reached out to touch P, when his whole object would on his account have been to keep her asleep as long as possible.  Moreover, in the overall circumstances, the fact that this was the only occasion (according to the father) when he and P were in the bed together raises concern when taken together with the fact that P suffered injury on that very occasion.  Overall, the sequence of events that the father describes is unconvincing as an account of a parent comforting a distressed child in normal circumstances. </span></p>

As to the argument that this was a crowded house, the fact remains that the father had the clear opportunity to carry out the assault, however risky it might have been.

The absence of any report of P&#8217;s blood in the bedroom or living room would seem at first sight to be highly significant, but has to be taken along with the evidence that clearly establishes that she was bleeding in the ambulance moments later.</span></p>

Having considered the matter carefully, I have concluded that it would not be appropriate to make that finding.  Instead, I find that P died during or shortly after the assault upon her but that the cause of her death is unascertained.  </span></p>

However, it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond the finding that I have made.  Dr Armour&#8217;s hypothesis may be correct, but, like Dr Leadbeatter, I consider that the evidence on this question is not sufficiently strong to underpin her conclusion.  I have taken account of the post-mortem findings relating to the lip, the throat and the lungs.  I conclude that they are suspicious but unexplained.  Having heard from Dr A, I cannot exclude the possibility that one or more of the injuries to the pharynx and oesophagus might have been caused by the attempts at intubation during a very difficult process of attempted resuscitation.  Likewise, suffocation is not the only mechanism by which the marks to the lip might have been caused.  The blood in the nose may be associated with abuse, but I cannot discount the possibility that it may have been caused during the protracted CPR at home, in the ambulance and in hospital.  The extent of the intra-alveolar haemorrhages is more than mild but is not diagnostic.  In conclusion, it is possible that P died of suffocation, but this has not been proved by the existing evidence.  </span></p>
