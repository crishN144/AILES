	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to the matter is the subject of significant dispute between the parties.  In refusing the father&#8217;s application to adduce oral evidence on matters of disputed fact at this hearing, I made clear that it would not be appropriate at the stage of determining which jurisdiction should determine the welfare issues that arise in respect of N to make findings of fact on the matters in dispute between the parties, of which there are many.  The determination of those factual disputes (if required) must await a further hearing in the Azerbaijani court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents are not even able to agree whether or not they were in a relationship prior to or after the birth of N.  The mother states that the parents entered into a committed relationship in 2012.    In contrast, the father asserts in his statement to this court that the parents had a casual sexual relationship from September 2013, although in his account to the Azerbaijani police on 16 March 2016 the father states he and the mother commenced a relationship at the end of 2012.  Within this context, the father further asserts at various points in his evidence that the mother worked as a prostitute. He however fails to produce the email in which he alleges the mother conceded the same.  The mother vehemently denies she worked as a prostitute.  There is no cogent evidence before this court to suggest that she did so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother fell pregnant with N in September 2013.  The mother states that the parents were happy when she became pregnant.  In contrast, the father contends that the mother wanted to terminate the pregnancy but that he persuaded the mother not to undergo a termination on the basis that he would raise the child.  The mother vehemently denies wanting an abortion.  By agreement between the parents the mother travelled to England to give birth to N, which she did in June 2014.  The mother returned with N to Azerbaijan in August 2014.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is also a marked dispute over the respective level of involvement of each parent in the care of N subsequent to his birth (I agree with Mr Scott-Manderson that this was, in part, generated by an attempt on the part of each parent to attain what they each perceived to be the forensic high ground of bringing themselves within the phrase &#8220;primary carer&#8221; used by Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">(A Child)(Custody Rights: Jurisdiction)</span>).  The mother contends that the parties lived with each other from October 2012 and after the birth of N.  The father contends by his statement that the parties never &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">fully</span>&#8221; co-habited and lived in separate properties, the father at an apartment in a luxury hotel and the mother at a property with the maternal grandmother in, as the father describes it, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a very poor area of Baku</span>&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I make no findings in respect of these disputed matters, I am bound to note that there is a concerted attempt on the part of the father to seek to draw a picture of a casual sexual relationship between himself and the mother, and to actively seek to downplay the role of the mother in the care of N that is not borne out by the evidence that is currently available to the court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following return of mother and N to Baku in August 2014 it is plain that N has spent the majority of his short life in that jurisdiction.  It is equally plain on the information currently available to the court that the father and the mother sought to continue their life in Azerbaijan and made their home there.  As set out above, the evidence before the court suggests that the parents moved back into the apartment as the family home and shared the care of N in that home.   The father continued to work in that jurisdiction as he had done since 2004.  The mother is of Russian descent but has lived in Azerbaijan all of her life and is an Azerbaijani citizen.  Members of N&#8217;s extended maternal family reside in Azerbaijan, including his maternal grandmother and maternal great-grandmother.   N has been exposed to both his father&#8217;s first language, English, and his mother&#8217;s first language, Russian (which is one of the second languages spoken in Azerbaijan).  There is a dispute between the parties as to the extent to which N, as a British national, has a secure immigration status in Azerbaijan.  I examine this issue further below having considered the expert evidence in this regard.  </p>

As I have recounted, N was born in the United Kingdom and has British citizenship.  He spent the first 2 months of his life in England before being taken to Azerbaijan in August 2014.  N has paternal relatives in this jurisdiction, including the father&#8217;s children from a previous relationship.  The parents appear to have discussed the possibility of coming to England in the future as a family. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once again, it would not be appropriate for me to make findings of fact in relation to the incident on 8 February 2016.  However, the events of that day are tolerably clear from the concessions made by the parties in respect of the same.  The mother and the father appear to have argued in circumstances where the mother believed that the father was being unfaithful to her with one of her friends and the father believed the mother was failing to care appropriately for N (the father does not appear to dispute that he is now residing with this friend of the mother in England).  The mother concedes that she had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">drunk a few beers</span>&#8221; prior to the incident (although she denies being drunk) and that she scratched the father during the course of the argument, albeit she states that this was accidental.  A medical report on the father dated 9 February 2016 records &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">multiple deep scratch marks on his torso, neck and L arm</span>&#8221;.   The mother further concedes that she did throw things around the apartment and out of the window, that she smashed the father&#8217;s iPad and after-shave bottles and that she was throwing things at the father.  Whilst the father alleges that N was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">clipped</span>&#8221; by an object thrown by the mother resulting in bruising to his face.  This is denied by the mother.  A medical report on N dated 9 February 2016 records &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">slight bruise under R eye, abrasion on R cheek</span>&#8221;.  The mother contends this injury was caused earlier when N fell over. There is no cogent evidence before the court of any other domestic incidents between the parents prior to 8 February 2016.</p>

It is important to note that the father accepts that he has managed to persuade the Police in Baku, through his lawyer, to re-open the criminal investigation of the mother.  The father states that this was achieved by his lawyer going direct to the Chief Prosecutor and that the mother may now receive a custodial sentence.  It is not immediately clear to me how the father&#8217;s previous insistence on seeing the mother prosecuted, with the attendant possibility of a custodial sentence, promoted N&#8217;s welfare.</p>

It is clear from subsequent text messages, and as she concedes, that the mother returned to the flat at 4 or 5am in the morning in an attempt to see N.   The text messages show that the mother was pleading to see N at this point.   The mother also sent unpleasant text messages to the father and posted accounts of the incident of 8 February 2016 online and on the LinkedIn page of the father&#8217;s employer that differ significantly from that which she now concedes.

The terms of the agreement include, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, a requirement that the mother &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">remove her false complaint</span>&#8221; to the Police against the father, that the mother agree that the father &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">be the sole guardian of </span>[N]&#8221; and that, as soon as the Baku court approves the father as the sole guardian of N, that the mother will &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">become the nanny to </span>[N]<span style="font-style:italic"> at his home</span>&#8221; from 6am to 6pm Monday to Friday excluding weekends and holiday periods.

The agreement provided that the father was free to leave the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan and that the father would be responsible for the education of N.  The agreement also provides for two alternative proposals for the mother to maintain contact with N in the event that the father returned to England with N permanently.  I pause to note that those two proposals are almost identical to the two proposals set out in the father&#8217;s statement to this court dated 12 May 2016.  The agreement concludes with the following words: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Should the terms of this agreement be breached by </span>[LM]<span style="font-style:italic">, the all her rights to </span>[N]<span style="font-style:italic"> will be lost</span>&#8221;.</p>

Whether he saw the document itself or not, I am not able to accept the implication contained within that assertion that the father&#8217;s lawyer was acting without instruction (an allegation that the father was careful to avoid making explicit).  First, the document dated 1 March 2016 contains, in almost identical terms, the proposals the father now seeks to advance in his statement to this court regarding contact between the mother and N should the father be permitted to remain England.  Second, and within this context, I consider it highly unlikely that the father&#8217;s Azerbaijani lawyer would have acted unilaterally and without taking instructions from the father as to the terms of the proposal to be offered to the mother.  Once again, it is not immediately clear to me how the father&#8217;s insistence on the terms of this agreement advanced N&#8217;s welfare.  Further, the fact that the father offered these terms on 1 March 2016 rather undermines his case that the mother presents a risk of harm to himself and N arising out of the incident on 8 February 2016 and the father&#8217;s assertion that the mother will abduct N to the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation.</p>

If this is the case it remains unclear why the father went to the airport a mere two days after the decision of the District Court on 14 March 2016 and not only with N but also accompanied by his lawyer.  In any event, by common consent the mother was not aware that the father intended to remove N from the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan and had not given her consent to that removal.  Indeed, upon discovering the departure the mother wasted no time in indicating her objection, resulting in the authorities in England being alerted and in the father and N being met by the Police, who boarded the plane when it landed in England.

A case against his doing so has to be made. But the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case. What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run.

This is not to apply what has become the technical concept of habitual residence, but to ask in a common sense way with which country the child has the closer connection. What is his "home" country? Factors such as his nationality, where he has lived for most of his life, his first language, his race or ethnicity, his religion, his culture, and his education so far will all come into this.</p>

Uprooting a child from one environment and bringing him to a completely unfamiliar one, especially if this has been done clandestinely, may well not be in his best interests. A child may be deeply unhappy about being recruited to one side in a parental battle. But if he is already familiar with this country, has been here for some time without objection, it may be less disruptive for him to remain a little while longer while his medium and longer time future is decided than it would be to return.&#8221;</p>

A child who is cared for by nannies or sent away to boarding school may move between households, and indeed countries, much more readily than a child who has always looked to one parent for his everyday needs, for warmth, for food, clean clothing, getting to school, help with homework and the like. The courts are understandably reluctant to allow a primary carer to profit from her own wrong by refusing to return with her child if the child is ordered to return. It will often be entirely reasonable to expect that a mother who took the risk of uprooting the child will return with him once it is ordered that he should go home. But it will sometimes be necessary to consider whether it is indeed reasonable to expect her to return, the sincerity of her declared refusal to do so, and what is to happen to the children if she does not.&#8221;</p>

It would be wrong to say that the future of every child who is within the jurisdiction of our courts should be decided according to a conception of child welfare which exactly corresponds to that which is current here. In a world which values difference, one culture is not inevitably to be preferred to another. Indeed, we do not have any fixed concept of what will be in the best interests of the individual child. Once upon a time it was assumed that all very young children should be cared for by their mothers, but that older boys might well be better off with their fathers. Nowadays we know that some fathers are very well able to provide everyday care for even their very young children and are quite prepared to prioritise their children's needs over the demands of their own careers. Once upon a time it was assumed that mothers who had committed the matrimonial offence of adultery were only fit to care for their children if the father agreed to this. Nowadays we recognise that a mother's misconduct is no more relevant than a father's: the question is always the impact it will have on the child's upbringing and wellbeing. Once upon a time, it may have been assumed that there was only one way of bringing up children. Nowadays we know that there are many routes to a healthy and well-adjusted adulthood. We are not so arrogant as to think that we know best.</p>

It looks at the child and weighs a number of factors in the balance, now set out in the well-known "check-list" in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>; these include his own wishes and feelings, his physical, emotional and educational needs and the relative capacities of the adults around him to meet those needs, the effect of change, his own characteristics and background, including his ethnicity, culture and religion, and any harm he has suffered or risks suffering in the future. There is nothing in those principles which prevents a court from giving great weight to the culture in which a child has been brought up when deciding how and where he will fare best in the future. Our own society is a multi-cultural one. But looking at it from the child's point of view, as we all try to do, it may sometimes be necessary to resolve or diffuse a clash between the differing cultures within his own family.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.2in">[39] In a case where the choice lies between deciding the question here or deciding it in a foreign country, differences between the legal systems cannot be irrelevant. But their relevance will depend upon the facts of the individual case. If there is a genuine issue between the parents as to whether it is in the best interests of the child to live in this country or elsewhere, it must be relevant whether that issue is capable of being tried in the courts of the country to which he is to be returned. If those courts have no choice but to do as the father wishes, so that the mother cannot ask them to decide, with an open mind, whether the child will be better off living here or there, then our courts must ask themselves whether it will be in the interests of the child to enable that dispute to be heard. The absence of a relocation jurisdiction must do more than give the judge pause (as Hughes J put it in this case); it may be a decisive factor. On the other hand, if it appears that the mother would not be able to make a good case for relocation, that factor might not be decisive. There are also bound to be many cases where the connection of the child and all the family with the other country is so strong that any difference between the legal systems here and there should carry little weight.&#8221;</p>

It is further submitted on behalf of the mother that such a course would, in contrast to the father&#8217;s position in Azerbaijan, leave her litigating in a jurisdiction where her immigration status is precarious, where she does not speak fluent English and where she will not have funding for representation in any proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and would leave both parents litigating in a jurisdiction where neither has employment.

The father submits that the court is in a position to do so notwithstanding that the majority of the relevant events took place in, and majority of the evidence is in Azerbaijan in circumstances where the court is able to utilise video link technology to hear evidence from Azerbaijan.   Mr Scott-Manderson characterises the father&#8217;s proposal as an appropriately cautious approach to take in light of the risks of peremptory return (to adopt Mr Scott-Manderson&#8217;s phrase) the father contends arise from the incident on 8 February 2016 and the risk that the mother will seek to take advantage of corruption and lack of respect for human rights in Azerbaijan.

Whilst N has significant connections to the United Kingdom, not the least of which are the fact that he was born here, is a British Citizen and has extended family here, the evidence available to me indicates that it is in Azerbaijan that he has lived the majority of his life, it is Azerbaijan where his parents made their life together with N and cared for him prior to their separation and it is in Azerbaijan that he was residing immediately before his clandestine removal by the father.  It is in Azerbaijan that the members of N&#8217;s extended maternal family with whom he has had extensive contact live.

Rather, I am satisfied that the evidence currently available tends to suggest that whilst N was in Azerbaijan his mother undertook the majority of the care of N during the week prior to the breakdown of the relationship that I am satisfied that the parents were in.  On the father&#8217;s own evidence, the mother was responsible for caring for N between 7am and 5pm each weekday and on some weekends.  I consider it unlikely on the evidence currently available that upon the arrival of the father from work the mother was excluded completely from the care of N.  From the respective descriptions provided (or not provided) by the mother and the father, it appears that the mother was responsible for at least some of the night time care of N.   In the circumstances, prior to his sudden and peremptory removal from Azerbaijan I am satisfied that N would have experienced his mother as consistent and vital presence in his life. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, the evidence available to the court demonstrates clearly that on 17 March 2016 the father removed N from his home country and from the affection and society of his mother in a clandestine manner and without notice to, or gaining the consent of the mother.  Whilst it would not be appropriate to make a definitive finding regarding the father&#8217;s precise level of knowledge with respect to the proceedings in the Baku court at the time, the fact he took this step only two days after the District Court had refused to grant his complaint against the travel restriction and was accompanied to the airport by his lawyer tends to suggest that father was aware of the restriction on his travel but had decided to take matters into his own hands rather than let his appeal run its course.  However, in my judgment it is the action of the father in unilaterally removing N from Azerbaijan without the knowledge or the consent of the mother, rather than the legality or otherwise of that course of action under Azerbaijani law, that is the important factor when considering N&#8217;s best interests (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re F (Minor)(Abduction: Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 1 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 1 FLR 1</ref>).

I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s uncertainty and insecurity would, in turn, impact on N&#8217;s welfare.

More importantly, and as I have already recounted, N&#8217;s home country is Azerbaijan and is where the parent who, the currently available evidence tends to suggest, provided N with the majority of his care prior to the end of the parents&#8217; relationship resides.

Further, whilst I accept that it is possible to utilise translators in respect of documentary evidence and video-links to secure the attendance of witnesses at a hearing in this jurisdiction, those procedural tools do not make up for the fact that the court in the child&#8217;s home jurisdiction will have a closer connection with, and a greater understanding of the &#8220;physical, emotional, social and cultural milieu in which the family lived&#8221; and in which the welfare issues between the parties arose, and the relevance and impact of the same on the welfare outcome for the child.

Against this, I note that there is no evidence of other incidents of a similar nature having occurred during the parents&#8217; relationship and that the events that took place on 8 February 2016 occurred within the context of the parents&#8217; relationship breaking down and the mother having discovered, on her case, the father&#8217;s infidelity.  Within this context, the father was, by virtue of his proposal of 1 March 2016, plainly willing to allow the mother to assume care of N (albeit on a contractual basis) notwithstanding the incident of 8 February 2016 and his stated concerns that the mother may abduct the child to the Russian Federation.   I also bear in mind that the father has been content to have the mother residing with N and himself during the course of this hearing.  In the circumstances, I do not consider that the single incident on 8 February 2016, whilst strongly to be deprecated, leads to a conclusion that it is not in N&#8217;s best interests to be returned to the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am likewise not persuaded that the mother will seek to take advantage of corruption or a lack of respect for human rights in Azerbaijan in order to gain advantage in proceedings in that jurisdiction.  Whilst the documentation relied on by Mr Scott-Manderson indicates that corruption and human rights abuses occur in Azerbaijan, I am not satisfied that the father has demonstrated that the mother has used corruption to gain advantage or that she is likely to do so.  In particular, I am not satisfied that the certificate setting out N&#8217;s citizenship status is evidence of the mother taking advantage of corruption, satisfied as I am that that certificate merely records the legal position regarding N&#8217;s status subject to satisfaction of the requirements of Azerbaijani law as opposed to being a certificate of citizenship. Nor am I satisfied that certain unwise and emotional statements the mother has made online and over Skype evince an intention to take advantage of corruption to the prejudice of the father.  With respect to proceedings, the mother appears to have reacted entirely predictably and appropriately to the dispute between the parents in respect of N&#8217;s clandestine removal.  She sought relief in the Azerbaijani court and has diligently pursued litigation in this country following the father removing N without notice or her consent.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, whilst I have paid very careful regard to, and do not dismiss the concerns regarding corruption and human rights abuses raised in the documents relied on by Mr Scott-Manderson, it remains the case that there is no evidence before the court that the father&#8217;s position in the family proceedings in Azerbaijan will be prejudiced by these matters.   The father has lawyers protecting his interests in the Azerbaijani proceedings. He has been successful in part at appellate level and he has persuaded the Chief Prosecutor to re-open the Police investigation into the mother&#8217;s alleged conduct on 8 February 2016. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the matters relied on by the father in this regard can properly lead to a conclusion that it is not in N&#8217;s best interests to be returned to the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan given the matters I have outlined above pointing to such a return.</p>

On the evidence available to the court the father&#8217;s employment position appears to be that he will continue to have a job with X subject to the company obtaining contracts on which his services are required.  Within this context, I note that the father has worked in Azerbaijan (with short sabbaticals in other countries) since 2004 and is an expert in his field.   Within this context the father at present has a family home and current employment in Azerbaijan with apparently good prospects.  He knows the country well after 12 years residing there, is familiar with its conventions and has a social network.  Once again, by contrast, were she to have to remain in England pending the determination of the welfare issues in respect of N, the mother has no employment, no independent accommodation, no secure immigration status and limited English.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The immigration position of both the father and N is clear. The father is entitled to remain in Azerbaijan whilst he is in employment.  Even were his job to cease in November 2016 (in respect of which assertion I entertain significant doubts) he will be able to remain as a visitor at least until April 2017.  N is a British citizen and has a visa valid until March 2017.  The expert evidence suggests that the proceedings in Azerbaijan concerning N&#8217;s welfare will be completed well before the expiry of this period.  </p>

For the reasons I have given I am not satisfied that a case has been made against adopting this course.   Rather, having regard to the evidence currently available to the court and for the reasons set out in this judgment, I am satisfied that it is in N&#8217;s best interests to be returned to the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan to enable the proceedings currently on foot in that jurisdiction to determine the welfare issues in respect of him.</p>
