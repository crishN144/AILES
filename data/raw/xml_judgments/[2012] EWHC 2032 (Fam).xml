	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 2 July 2012, at the suit of the Applicant (&#8220;W&#8221;),  I set aside a transaction made by the First Respondent (&#8220;H&#8221;) on about 2 December 2010, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>&#8221;). That transaction was the transfer by H of his 86.24% shareholding in D (Holdings) Ltd (&#8220;DH&#8221;), a valuable enterprise, to the Ninth Respondent (&#8220;R9&#8221;), which is a corporate trustee in the Isle of Man. I further set aside under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> onward transmission by R9 of those shares to the Second Respondent (&#8220;R2&#8221;) (as further described by me in paragraph 8 below) and the further onward transmission by R2 to the Third to Eighth Respondents (which are Manx Companies) and certain other related transactions. Each Manx Company is owned by a separate sub-fund of an Employer-Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme which had been established for H together with certain other directors and some minor shareholders of DH connected with the company&#8217;s directors (&#8220;the directors&#8221;).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application was not opposed by any of the Respondents. Sadly H is very unwell and his life expectancy is limited. Were he to have died before the decision to set aside the transactions there would have been many adverse legal and fiscal consequences. Beyond explaining, in short form, why I was satisfied that the relevant criteria within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> were met I did not give full reasons. I did not do so as all parties wished my judgment to incorporate my views as to whether the effect of a &#8220;set aside&#8221; is to operate retrospectively for all legal (including fiscal) purposes. I directed that further written arguments be supplied and I have received very full, detailed, and interesting submissions from all parties. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my judgment incorporating those views.  I have not had submissions from HMRC. There was some discussion as to whether HMRC should be invited to intervene, or even joined as a party under FPR 2010 rule 9.26B. But the combined view was that this would engender a deal of delay, and given H&#8217;s precarious state of health, no appreciable period of delay could be countenanced. So I have not heard any counter-arguments by HMRC to the unanimous view expressed to me by all parties (although it should fairly be stated that Mr Carden for the Second Respondent is more neutral than the others). Therefore my views will not bind HMRC, but they will surely, given the depth of learning which I have received, be influential. The same situation arose in <span style="font-style:italic">G v G (Financial Provision: Equal Division)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 2 FLR 1143" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 2 FLR 1143</ref>, FD where Coleridge J gave an opinion at para 43 on whether the transfer to the wife of some shares in the husband&#8217;s business would give rise to business hold-over relief so that the wife would receive the shares at the husband&#8217;s base value and that no liability to CGT would therefore arise on the husband as a result of the transfer. He opined that the relief would be available, but was careful to explain that he could not &#8220;ultimately bind the Inland Revenue&#8221;. In  <span style="font-style:italic">Hill v Haines</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 1192" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 1192</ref>, CA Rix LJ observed at para 81 that &#8220;the view expressed by Coleridge J [in <span style="font-style:italic">G v G (Financial Provision: Equal Division)</span>] at para [43] regarding potential consequences for the purposes of capital gains tax can hardly be regarded as authoritative in the absence of the Revenue&#8221;. It may not have been authoritative, but it was influential as following publication of the judgment of Coleridge J the Inland Revenue adjusted its Practice Manual to reflect the terms of his opinion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H and W married in 1998. H is now aged 62; W is aged 34. They have three children aged 14, 12 and 3. In 2008 W observed deterioration in H&#8217;s behaviour in that he became increasingly aggressive and dis-inhibited. In June 2010 the marriage broke down in sad circumstances which do not need to be repeated here. In September 2010 a consultant neurologist diagnosed H as suffering from frontal lobe dementia. In December 2010 W issued divorce proceedings and a Form A.  H was much distressed by this and persuaded W to agree to their dismissal. This was effected by a consent order made on 7 April 2011. W issued a fresh petition for divorce and Form A in October 2011.  The medical opinion is that H is incapacitated under the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. He is represented by his litigation friend Mr T. Decree Nisi was pronounced on 30 March 2012. On 2 July 2012 it was agreed that this Decree Nisi of divorce would be rescinded and that the petition would be amended to pray for judicial separation. I made orders abridging all time and dispensing with all formalities and heard W&#8217;s evidence in proof of the amended petition; and pronounced a decree of judicial separation on 3 July 2012.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The question is therefore whether the termination of a tenancy can be a disposition of property. &#8216;Disposition&#8217; is a familiar enough word in the law of property and ordinarily means an act by which someone ceases to be the owner of that property in law or in equity: see the formulation by Mr R.O. Wilberforce QC in <span class="Emphasis" style="font-size:11pt">Grey v Inland Revenue Commissioners</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1960] AC 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1960">[1960] AC 1</ref>, 18. In some contexts it may include the case in which the property ceases to exist. It is unnecessary to decide whether it has such an extended meaning in this case. There are contrary indications, namely that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37</ref> contemplates, first, that the disposition will be capable of being set aside and secondly, that the beneficiary of the disposition may be able to show that he took in good faith and without notice. On the other hand, I feel sure that &#8216;disposition&#8217; was intended to include the surrender of a subsisting proprietary interest, such as a tenancy for years or for life, so as to merge in the reversion or remainder: see <span class="Emphasis" style="font-size:11pt">Inland Revenue Commissioners v Buchanan</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1958] Ch 289" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1958">[1958] Ch 289</ref> per Lord Goddard CJ at 296. But, be that all as it may, I think it is essential to the notion of a disposition of property in this context that there is property of which the disponor disposes, whether to someone else or not. <span style="font-weight:bold">It is this property which the court can restore to his estate by setting aside the disposition&#8221;</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Le Grice QC cautions me not to be drawn into making comparisons with the distinctions between void and voidable marriages. I shall do so nonetheless, not just because it is a field in which I feel confident, but because the old cases do provide some interesting insights into the issue with which I am presented. The distinction between void and voidable marriages is explained with characteristic scholarship by Joseph Jackson QC in his seminal book <span style="font-style:italic">The Formation and Annulment of Marriage </span>(2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> edition, Butterworths, 1969) at pages 98 &#8211; 127. Many financial disputes were fought over the effect of an order which decreed the annulment of a voidable marriage. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">P v P </span>[1916] 2 IR 400 the question was whether a woman who had paid a dower of &#163;475 in consideration of her marriage could recover it when the marriage was later annulled on the grounds of the husband&#8217;s impotence, a defect which rendered the marriage voidable, but not void. The husband had used &#163;400 to pay off a charge on his lands, and had spent &#163;75 on living expenses. Madden J held, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that the decree of nullity operated ab initio in relation to the &#163;400, which the wife was entitled to recover, but as regards the spent &#163;75 this &#8220;was a concluded transaction by which both parties benefited, and ought not now to be disturbed&#8221;. Sir Ignatius O&#8217;Brien LC reasoned the decision as regards the &#163;75 as a form of estoppel operating against the wife. </p>

There a husband obtained a nullity decree on the ground of his wife&#8217;s inability to consummate the marriage in 1933. As Jackson puts it &#8220;an enterprising Inspector of Taxes claimed the payment by the husband of the difference between a married and unmarried man&#8217;s personal tax allowance for tax purposes for the years 1928 to 1933 inclusive&#8221;. Lawrence J held at page 511 that &#8220;a marriage which is null on the ground of the incapacity of one of the spouses is voidable and not void; but when avoided, it is void ab initio but not for all purposes&#8221;.  At page 512 he stated &#8220;things which have been done, during the period of the supposed marriage, cannot be undone or reopened after the marriage had been declared null and void&#8221;.

It involves a giving and taking back on both sides. If it is necessary to have recourse to an action in order to implement the rescission, the court will make such orders as are necessary to put both contracting parties into the position they were in before the contract was made. There is, however, also a line of authority supporting the proposition that, upon rescission of a contract for fraudulent misrepresentation, the beneficial title which passed to the representor under the contract revests in the representee. The representee then enjoys a sufficient proprietary title to enable him to trace, follow and recover what, by virtue of such revesting, can be regarded as having always been in equity his own property. This may be an essential means of achieving a proper restoration of the original position if the representor has in the meantime parted with the property and is ostensibly a man of straw unable to satisfy the court's orders for restoration of the original position.&#8221; </p>

Unless a taxing statute says to the contrary the right of the state to charge tax in relation to a given transaction is subject to the effect of that transaction as defined by the general law. In the specific context with which I am concerned there is long-standing authority from the Court of Session (First Division) in Scotland, <span style="font-style:italic">IRC v Spence</span> (1941) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="24 TC 312" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">24 TC 312</ref>, never doubted in subsequent tax cases in the English Courts, which says that the tax effects of a transaction will be annulled retrospectively if it is subsequently found to be voidable, and is declared void. The case concerned the tax implications following a share sale transaction carried out by the taxpayer, Spence, which was subsequently declared void. Spence had entered into and completed a contract to sell shares to a purchaser, Crawford.   Crawford had then received the dividends. 6 years later, Spence was successful in an action to have the share sale declared void on grounds of Crawford&#8217;s fraudulent misrepresentation. Crawford was ordered to retransfer the shares, Spence accounting to Crawford for the price, interest thereon, and half the increase in value since transfer. Crawford was also ordered to repay the dividends received since the original transfer less the income tax he had paid on them. The Inland Revenue repaid Crawford the income tax he had paid to them, and assessed Spence on the dividends for each of the years in question, giving him relief for the interest paid. Spence appealed against the assessment, claiming that the amount paid by Crawford to him was not actual dividend income of his but compensation for the dividend income out of which he had been defrauded.  The Special Commissioners and on appeal the First Division of the Court of Session rejected his appeal. Lord President Normand giving the leading judgment, said at page 316: </p>

In this case the party sued for rescission and in the end of the day he obtained a decree of reduction. The effect of that reduction was to restore things to their position at the date of the transaction reduced, with the result that as at that date and afterwards the successful Pursuer in the action fell to be treated as having been the person in titulo of the shares which he had sold to the Defender and therefore to have been in right of the dividends.</span> No doubt it is true that in the interval the dividends had to be paid and were paid to the Defender because his name stood in the register as the proprietor of the shares and no doubt also they were for the time being treated by the Inland Revenue as his income and while matters stood entire no other person had any right to the shares or to the dividends except the Defender, Mr. Crawford. But from the moment the reduction took place Mr. Spence fell to be treated as having been throughout the proprietor of the shares and equally the person properly entitled to receive the dividends. On the other hand the Inland Revenue repaid to Mr. Crawford the Sur-tax attributable to the dividends actually paid to him by the company on the footing that he had never been in titulo to receive them. In my opinion the way in which the statement of accounts which was laid before the House of Lords was made up is in exact accord with that situation&#8230;. It was said by the Counsel for [Spence] that what his client received as the result of the decree was not the dividends but compensation for the dividends, something in the nature of damages measured by the value of the dividends as they had accrued in past years. Of course, it is often necessary for a Court to estimate damages by reference to loss of income in a series of years, and when it does so the resulting amount of damages which is awarded to the successful party is a lump sum capital payment in place of income payments which he might have received annually. &#8230; But payments of that sort, payments of damages or payments of compensation, are in no way similar to the payments with which the Appellant was credited in the statement of account between him and Mr. Crawford submitted to the House of Lords. The fact is that the only title which the Appellant could put forward to demand these payments at all was that he was the person in right of the shares at the time the dividends were declared, and therefore the person in right of the dividends. That was the basis of his legal claim for reduction and it was that legal claim to which effect was given by the judgment of the House of Lords and the subsequent Interlocutor of this Division. In my opinion what he received was the dividends and not a surrogatum of the dividends. It was not compensation for loss of the dividends nor was it damages for loss of the dividends. It was just the dividends which, one may say, Mr. Crawford received and had for the person whom he had defrauded&#8221;. (emphasis added)</p>

I have also been referred to authorities that show that HMRC (or its predecessors) has never sought to argue against the view that an order which is retrospective as a matter of general principle will not be retrospective for any fiscal purposes.

Popplewell J in granting the order for rectification sought by the Inland Revenue considered that the order would have the retrospective effect of bringing into charge to tax amounts which absent the retrospectivity of the order would have escaped charge to tax by virtue of the excessive amounts of group relief erroneously conceded in the settlement contract. </p>

There is no corresponding provision for capital gains tax, or for any other tax, which expressly treats a voidable transaction for tax purposes as if it had been void ab initio.  The existence of the IHT provision (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51/section/150" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.150</ref> IHTA) raises the question as to why it was thought necessary to enact the provision, if the law already produced the same effect independently of the provision. It might also be argued, on the principle inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, that if the provision is explicitly there for IHT Parliament by not enacting a corresponding provision for any other form of tax intended that it should not apply to those other taxes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second reason is that it may be a false supposition to accept that tax legislation is drawn up completely consistently, and that the draftsman of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51/section/150" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s150</ref> IHTA would have had specifically in mind that there was no corresponding provision in the same terms for other taxes in other taxing statues. Mr Goodfellow QC has plausibly submitted that little assistance is to be obtained from a comparison of different statutory provisions in different Acts or from the inclusion of express deeming provisions in one tax code and the absence of any equivalent in another tax code. The UK tax code is so vast and so complex that it would be a pure fiction to proceed upon the basis that Parliament was familiar with all the provisions it had enacted over hundreds of years or that the Parliamentary draftsman must have had in mind the provisions of a different tax code, when drafting another and so must have made a conscious decision not to include a particular provision. </p>

The purpose of the variation was to make the maintenance payments the income of the child rather than the income of the wife, and so improve the income tax position. The wife sought repayment of income tax on the maintenance payments for the past tax years on the grounds that, as a result of the variation order, the payments were to be treated as not her income but that of the child. Her argument prevailed in the High Court, but on appeal the Court of Appeal held that the order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref> back-dating the variation could not alter the position for tax purposes in the years before the variation.

If the power to set aside a reviewable disposition were not (at least) capable of reversing the legal effect of the reviewable disposition sufficiently so that tax charges which had arisen as a result of (or during) the (albeit temporary) validity of the reviewable disposition and/or subsequent dealings, the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> (to preserve the assets of the family) would likely be frustrated in part. If such tax liabilities survived the setting aside of a transaction, they would frequently end up being attached to the disponor, or to the assets disposed of, and so diminish the disponor&#8217;s resources and the Court&#8217;s ability to restore the status quo ante. This is because the disponee would find himself not only deprived of an asset but also exposed to a capital gains tax charge on any chargeable gains crystallised in respect of that asset on his disposal of it (i.e. by reference to the growth in value of the asset between the date of its acquisition by the disponee and his subsequent disposal of the asset pursuant to the order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref>).
