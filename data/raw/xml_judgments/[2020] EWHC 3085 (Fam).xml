That judgment is publicly available and reported as <span style="font-style:italic">Moutreuil v Andreewitch (Contempt: No.2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2020/1301" uk:canonical="[2020] EWHC 1301 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWHC 1301 (Fam)</ref>.

It is a measure of last resort. A suspended prison sentence, equally, is still a prison sentence. It is not to be regarded as a lesser form of punishment. A sentence of imprisonment must not be imposed because the circumstances of the contemnor mean that he will be unable to pay a fine. A sentence of imprisonment may well be appropriate where there has been a serious and deliberate flouting of the Court's order&#8221;. </p>

The consequences were serious for MM and the children, whose proprietary interests the injunction order had been in part designed to protect. I have of course subsequently found (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2020/2068" uk:canonical="[2020] EWHC 2068 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWHC 2068 (Fam)</ref>) that the funds in the account actually belonged to MM.

He observes that while PA used the account freely, the withdrawals were made for essentially routine household purposes, and to meet day-to-day expenses; they were not to fund separate secret investments nor to fund an extravagant lifestyle.  While I make no finding about his ability to fund such purposes otherwise in the relevant period (I note that he had access to other funds) such is the way of things in this family, that even now, in spite of the highly contentious litigation, MM has taken it on herself voluntarily to support PA and their older son financially to meet their daily living costs.   </p>

PA has indicated that he will &#8220;do everything [he] can&#8221; to repay the money taken; while I make no finding that PA cannot currently repay the money, I fully expect that he should repay the sum taken, when he is in a financial position to do so. </p>

However, I do have regard to the fact that PA currently cares for his older son who is still of school age; he also has regular contact with his other minor children who live with their mother.  I am keen to promote family relationships not compromise them further; all of these children have suffered and are suffering the consequences of extreme parental conflict over the last two years, which has left them all (to a greater or lesser extent) scarred.  I am very keen that PA should engage forthwith in family therapy &#8211; which, as I made clear in my welfare judgment, I regard as extremely important for this family &#8211; and I do not want this to be stalled or frustrated by the fact that PA is in prison.    </p>
