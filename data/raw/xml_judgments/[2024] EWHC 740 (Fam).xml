	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties were married for three years.  There were no children.  The wife deposes to assets of approximately &#163;61.5 million.  The husband asserts that the wife is worth nearer &#163;74&#160;million, but the difference is immaterial on the facts of this case.  The husband deposes to net assets of approximately &#163;850,000, although about &#163;500,000 of that is tied up in a property in Spain, of which he is a one-third owner and he is unable to liquidate his share in at least the short to medium term.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife works through a network of her father&#8217;s companies in Dubai and has income from all sources, including rental income, approximately &#163;600,000 a year.  The husband asserts that she earns about &#163;1 million a year.  Again, the difference is immaterial on the facts of this case and, in any event, the wife clearly receives a mixture of income from employment and income from dividends.  As I understand it, there is no income tax on that income in Dubai.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The day that the parties married, they both signed a prenuptial agreement which provided that each party shall retain their own separate property, that any jointly owned property would be split between them and that neither party would bring a claim against the other in any jurisdiction.  The agreement contained a jurisdiction clause, the jurisdiction being England and Wales.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife asserts that the whole point of the prenuptial agreement was to avoid the very contest that these parties have had at such personal and financial cost to themselves.  The claim originally articulated on behalf of the husband was for &#163;10 million.  The claim which he now puts forward is for just over &#163;2.4 million.  The parties&#8217; respective open positions at court was that the wife should pay the husband nothing and the husband adjusted his claim, as I have said, to about &#163;2.4 million.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The costs incurred by the parties in this case are that the wife has incurred costs of about &#163;600,000.  No VAT is payable on that because, of course, she is outside the jurisdiction of England and Wales, so, notionally, Ms Bangay tells me, and I accept, that I should add 20&#160;per cent to that if one is to view the costs figures on a like for like basis.  The husband&#8217;s costs are approximately &#163;450,000.  It may be that I need to add &#163;20,000-odd or so to that in the light of the costs recently incurred.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Between them, the parties have therefore spent a little over &#163;1 million in costs and, as I have said, if one adds the notional VAT to the wife&#8217;s costs number, to achieve a like for like position, that takes the combined costs figure to about &#163;1.2 million.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">One often hears counsel and solicitors and judges talking about something being a &#8220;paradigm case&#8221;.  In my judgement this case is a paradigm case of how not to conduct litigation on the breakdown of a short childless marriage.  If, at the commencement of a dispute, a party adopts an extreme position, an equal and opposite extreme position is likely to be adopted on the other side.  Importantly, in my judgement, on 25 September 2023 the wife offered the husband &#163;800,000.  In the post-<span style="font-style:italic">Calderbank</span> era, litigating spouses need to know the consequences of making open offers and the consequences of rejecting them.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">From 24 November 2022 until 23 August 2023, the husband persisted with the offer made in his Form E of &#163;9.6 million, plus periodical payments to support an asserted income need of &#163;208,000 a year for two years, hence a global sum of &#163;10 million.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The absurdity of that offer made by the husband is best demonstrated by his own position adopted in this hearing which, as I have said, is &#163;2.4 million.  This represents a collapse of 75&#160;per cent in the claim that he has pursued.  Parties litigating after their divorce need to appreciate that litigation is not a negotiation which rewards untenable positions.  Starting high to try and make the midpoint higher than it should be is an unwise tactic.  The same, of course, applies the other way around, if one starts low.  Offers need to be focused, wise, based on likely outcome and not on greedy expectation.  The penalty of the failure of such tactics will resound in costs and can be devastating in their consequences.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Unless there is a fundamental issue regarding computation, the correct bracket of settlement will be known to the lawyers advising, lawyers who are, as here, experienced in this area of the law.  It is obvious that such lawyers will explain to their clients the risk of aiming too high or too low.  Litigation, as this case shows, is fearsomely expensive.  The costs of the litigation are underwritten by no one and there should be no expectation that one&#8217;s costs will be paid by the other party.  There can never be an assumption that the economically stronger party will just pay the other party&#8217;s costs without more.  People embark upon litigation at risk.  That risk must be calculated, measured; and wise decisions taken.  Risks need to be balanced and judged.  This applies all the more where, as here, there is no meaningful dispute about computation or, perhaps better put another way, where, as here, computation issues are irrelevant.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">What difference, I ask rhetorically, does it make after a short childless marriage whether the economically stronger party is worth &#163;50 million, &#163;60 million or &#163;70&#160;million, when none of the capital forms any part of the marital acquest, but was gifted to that person by a parent?  I ask that question absent of prenuptial agreement, although there is one present here which just adds to the overall risk assessment.  For the avoidance of doubt, this is not to condone dishonest or careless disclosure by the wealthy party.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The prenuptial agreement here is litigated about as if it is difficult.  I am told by Miss Bangay for the husband that it should be cast aside and ignored.  I return to that in detail below, but even without the prenuptial agreement, in my judgement, the husband&#8217;s claims were overblown.  A good starting point, in my judgement, is to assess the value of the husband&#8217;s claims absent the prenuptial agreement.  No reasoned assessment of the husband&#8217;s claims could possibly have justified an offer anywhere close to &#163;10 million.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">For her part, the wife allowed, if not caused, a remarkably unhelpful and poorly thought through letter to be sent to the husband shortly after the separation.  The wife&#8217;s Dubai solicitors informed the husband by letter dated 24 August 2022 that the husband had to leave the former matrimonial home within three days or face forcible removal by the Dubai authorities.  His right of residence, which had been provided by a visa from W&#8217;s father&#8217;s company as a result of his historical employment there, had been revoked earlier that month with his knowledge and consent, albeit he said he felt he had no option but to give his consent as he was presented with a form to sign by W.  The letter threatened him with proceedings for divorce and even maintenance in Dubai.  Quite apart from the fact that this was a completely absurd threat when the wife had &#163;60 million or &#163;70 million to her name and the husband had very little, this also flew in the face of the very prenuptial agreement on which the wife sought to rely, which provided for an English jurisdiction clause and no claims being made by any party in any jurisdiction.  And so it was that the husband felt obliged to leave Dubai, which had been his home for nine years, his belongings were placed in storage and, as I understand it, remain there to this day.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Adopting a phrase from Mostyn J, but in very different circumstances, when parties litigate in this fashion, a nuclear winter descends and negotiation becomes all but impossible.  Positions become entrenched.  Costs are incurred.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_16">
	  <num>16</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Bangay, in her submissions, forcefully blames the wife for the fact that this inappropriate letter was sent.  Whilst I acknowledge that the letter must have been approved by the wife, having heard her evidence over the course of most of a day, I have formed the very clear view that the wife was inexperienced in litigation and in confrontation.  She placed, as she was entitled to, trust in her Dubai solicitors and she said that she approved the letter, which she was encouraged to approve, and to have sent.  I do not believe that either of the solicitors now instructed by the parties in this jurisdiction would have sent such a letter.  Even if a litigious client insists upon a difficult, bad-tempered and stroppy letter, solicitors who are members of Resolution and who abide by the Resolution Code of Conduct rarely send such letters and, in my judgement, should not do so.  There is a duty upon solicitors not only to their client but to the court, and that duty requires them to temper the tone and not to worsen it.  Of course there can be some exceptions, but in my judgement this letter was sent on behalf of the wife because it was what was recommended to her and not what was chosen by her.  I do not find that the wife intended to send a letter which I regard as deeply inappropriate and which I dare say to her, with hindsight, now seems deeply inappropriate.  However, the letter was sent and the husband cannot be blamed for being aggrieved by it.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_17">
	  <num>17</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Having said all of that, the fact is that the letter was sent and goes some way to explaining, albeit not justifying, the remarkable stance that was taken for a long time on behalf of the husband.  As I have said above, extreme positions taken by one side tend to force an extreme position by the other side.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">And so it was that after this short marriage, where the exit should have been easy, cheap and obvious, the parties were at loggerheads, opposite positions having been taken, trenches dug and a long cold winter anticipated.  In this case the wife had and has the luxury of infinite resources.  The husband had the benefit of having enjoyed the trappings of being married into a family of exceptional wealth.  I am as certain as I can be that had different positions been adopted from the start, the wife would have given a bit, the husband would have given a bit and the case would have been resolved.  Instead, these decent people have litigated in a deeply acrimonious way.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is obvious to me from all that I have seen, hearing the parties give evidence, witnessing their demeanour in court and reading what I have about them, that they have suffered immensely as a consequence.  The wife suffered from mental health issues prior to the marriage and the husband has suffered from mental health issues after the breakdown of the marriage.  They are both in a difficult place.  The fact that their marriage was difficult and was ended after such a short period of time is not something which this court can alter or in any way comment upon but the fact that they have gone through years of litigation hell, given evidence in the most difficult of circumstances, had their personal, medical and mental health history deeply analysed is something that should have been avoided.  It was unnecessary.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I am sure that, had things been different, the wife would have made an offer that the husband would have accepted and they could have parted with dignity.  Instead, I have witnessed two decent people at their wit&#8217;s end because of the litigation into which they have been plunged.  It is an abject lesson to anyone working in the complicated field of family law.  It has often occurred to me as a family lawyer that if this was a straightforward commercial dispute between two insurance companies arguing over a lost cargo at sea, the matter would have been resolved.  What makes family law both so interesting yet also so challenging is that we are dealing with raw human emotion.  It is, in my judgement, the duty of the lawyers to do their best to protect parties in such a situation from themselves.  I make it clear that I have no criticism at all of the current legal teams instructed.  I am complaining not about the solicitors and counsel in front of me this week in court, I make that very clear.  I am talking about the solicitors who started this case in the way that I have described above.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I also accept that lawyers, at the end of the day, are only as good as the instructions that their clients give them, but I do strongly take the view that the way that this case was kickstarted overlays everything that has happened since.  Eventually, the hole that people dig themselves into becomes an impossible one to get out of because of the incident of costs.  If the supposed man on the Clapham omnibus, to coin a phrase from a previous era, was told that a couple spent as much arguing about the case as the case was worth, they would wonder what on earth was going on.  They would comment that the only winners were the lawyers.  Maybe that is true but, I repeat, I make no criticism at all of the lawyers currently instructed.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Bangay correctly also draws my attention to this: the court must, in this case, as in all cases, avoid any form of sexual or gender discrimination.  Much has been written about the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Granatino v Radmacher</span>.  Would the result have been different, people ask, if Mr Granatino had been the wife and not the husband?  The Supreme Court, by a majority of eight to one, gave a very clear Judgment and I must of course assume that there was no gender discrimination or sexual discrimination present in that decision.</p>

It was obviously appropriate that the wife&#8217;s application in respect of the prenuptial agreement should be heard together with the wife&#8217;s application for financial remedy.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife&#8217;s case as articulated by Mr Harrison can be summarised thus.  This was a short childless marriage.  The husband entered into the prenuptial agreement freely and willingly, with legal advice, aware that the wife was very wealthy, and he understood the consequences.  The prenuptial agreement was clear and it was intended to be determinative on divorce.  The husband&#8217;s needs, continues Mr Harrison, are met by his own resources and, accordingly, Mr Harrison contends, the prenuptial agreement should be upheld and the husband awarded nothing.  Mr Harrison contends forcibly that the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Granatino v Radmacher</span> is not a green light for a disappointed spouse to come to court with a shopping list of asserted aspirational needs.  Mr Harrison contends that the failure to abide by the prenuptial agreement would be a fundamental betrayal of what the parties intended and agreed and would ignore the important respect of autonomy which these courts always encourage.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband&#8217;s case, articulated by Miss Bangay KC, may be summarised thus.  The husband should not be held to the terms of the prenuptial agreement.  He was persuaded to enter into it by the wife as a sop to her father, the wife assuring the husband that, in reality, he would always be provided for as &#8220;he had married a Helliwell&#8221;.  Miss Bangay contends that whilst the husband did receive some preliminary limited advice on the prenuptial agreement, but it was without benefit of any financial disclosure from the wife.  The husband has waived privilege in relation to the advice that he received from experienced family lawyers, Hall Brown.  That firm expressed concern to the husband about the lack of financial disclosure.  Miss Bangay contends that the wife admits to a profound reluctance to provide any financial disclosure as she was determined to keep the family assets private.  Miss Bangay contends that when the wife eventually provided her financial disclosure, she admits that she deliberately grossly understated her wealth by excluding her business assets and some property interests.  Miss Bangay continues that the wife asserted that her wealth was &#163;18 million to &#163;23 million when, in reality, she was worth in excess of &#163;70 million.  Miss Bangay also contends that, in any event, the terms of the prenuptial agreement are grossly unfair in that they do not begin to provide for the husband&#8217;s needs.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the many side issues with which the court has been concerned during the course of this hearing has been the date of cohabitation.  The husband contends that the parties began to live together in the wife&#8217;s home in Dubai in October 2016.  The wife asserts that the date was April 2017.  The parties have also thought it relevant to argue in court about the date of separation.  The wife asserts the separation was in April 2022.  The husband asserts that the relevant date is the date when written notice was given by the wife&#8217;s Dubai solicitors, James Berry, on 24 August 2022.  Other than the fact that it may go to the issue of credit, in other words which of the parties I believe is giving more truthful and more reliable and honest evidence, I do not think that the difference between the parties regarding the date of cohabitation or the date of separation is of particular assistance to the court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I have said often I other cases, and I repeat here, a relationship is not something that is on one day and off the next.  A relationship is something that is usually fairly slow to develop, it is nurtured and comes to a point at which the parties may regard themselves as committed or in an exclusive relationship or engaged or married.  Similarly, marriages do not usually break down as a consequence of a single event.  Breakdown is usually difficult, gradual, unpleasant.  Of course, there comes a time when one or other or both of the parties regard the relationship as over, but I think it is wrong in most cases, and wrong in this case, to look for a specific start date or a specific finish date.  Moreover, the irony is not lost on me that the husband asserts that the notice of determination of the relationship must be given in accordance with the prenuptial agreement, but in all other respects of course the husband rejects and disowns the prenuptial agreement.  In a similar vein, the wife who seeks to rely on the prenuptial agreement initially threatened the husband with a divorce in Dubai, and even with a maintenance claim in Dubai, by her against him.  That, of course, was in flagrant breach of the prenuptial agreement on which she now relies.  Moreover, it is farcical in my judgment to suggest that a spouse with the resources available to the wife, whether they be &#163;20 million or &#163;70 million, or anywhere in between, can or should make a maintenance claim against a spouse with resources of less than &#163;1 million and where, as here, the wife&#8217;s income was at least five times the husband&#8217;s income, and possibly a very great deal larger than that.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">My view on the length of the relationship is straightforward.  There was a period of cohabitation which moved gradually, if not seamlessly, into marriage.  Miss Bangay has quite properly referred me to some of the well-known cases on this issue, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">RW v GW</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">VV v VV</span>.  I am bound to say that I think it is generally recognised by judges working in this field of the law now that, when considering, as they are obliged to do under section 25, the length of the marriage, it is generally the custom now to add to the length of the marriage a period of premarital cohabitation which has, to use the well-worn phrase, moved seamlessly into marriage.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband, as I have said, asserts that cohabitation commenced in October 2016.  Mr Harrison, on behalf of the wife, says this is a tactical ploy to try and extend the length of the relationship.  The wife says that cohabitation commenced in May 2017.  The marriage and the relationship were short.  In my judgment, with or without the prenuptial agreement, the difference between the parties of months is an irrelevant tangent which we should not have spent very long listening to or dealing with.  It would, in my judgment, be wrong to regard the length of the marriage as some kind of time-related scheme whereby extra entitlement is earned with points granted to each spouse as each month passes.  It simply is not like that and, in my judgment, the difference of a few months about which the parties are arguing is of marginal relevance to the decisions which I have to make.  Of course, if I come to the view that the prenuptial agreement should be treated as binding, I must look at that agreement itself for the relevant start and finish dates.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.98in">&#8220;Memory is especially unreliable when it comes to recalling past beliefs.  Our memories of past beliefs are revised to make them more consistent with our present beliefs.  Studies have also shown that memory is particularly vulnerable to interference and alteration when a person is presented with new information or suggestions about an event in circumstances where his or her memory of it is already weak due to the passage of time.&#8221;</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.98in">&#8220;In the light of these considerations, the best approach for a judge to adopt in the trial of a commercial case is, in my view, to place little if any reliance at all on witnesses&#8217; recollections of what was said in meetings and conversations, and to base factual findings on inferences drawn from the documentary evidence and known or probable facts.  This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful purpose &#8211; though its utility is often disproportionate to its length.  But its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events.  Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth.&#8221;</p>

In that seminal criminal case, Lord Lane, then the Lord Chief Justice, held that the mere fact that a defendant has lied is not in itself evidence of guilt.  In the instant case it is important for me to remind myself that people may lie for various reasons, such as shame, panic and the desire to cover for someone else, and I bear what is called that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span> warning&#8221; in mind very much when commenting on the parties&#8217; evidence.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to this case can be summarised succinctly.  The husband has an honours degree from the University of Leeds in Law and Accountancy.  He told the court he had a 2:1.  He is obviously a bright man.  He had been previously married in 2013.  Initially, he and his first wife lived in Salford, and then moved to Dubai, where the husband secured employment with one of the big four firms of accountants, PwC.  He is obviously a clever and talented person.  When they moved to Dubai, the husband and his first wife did not sell the Salford property, but arranged for it to be let and they rented accommodation in Dubai.</p>

I have to say that I do not find this particularly helpful.  I am not concerned with the husband&#8217;s first marriage but with his second.  I did not find this line of cross-examination illuminating.  I dare say that Mr Harrison had hoped that if he persuaded me that the husband had a prenuptial agreement with his first wife, it made it more likely he would understand the consequences of the prenuptial agreement in his second marriage.  I am concerned with whether the husband knew what he was doing in relation to this case.  As I have said, he is a clever man, familiar with reading important documents, not the sort of person who would fail to understand the significance of what he was being told or what he was signing.  I do not need evidence on whether he knew about prenuptial agreements in his first marriage to decide whether he understood what it meant in his second marriage.  </p>

The husband agreed in oral evidence that he knew that his wife to be had suffered from considerable mental health issues and from anorexia and had long periods of time as an in-patient in connection with those conditions.  He agreed when it was put to him that he knew that the wife was vulnerable.  She was taking anti-anxiety medication and having regular sessions with a psychotherapist.  </p>

The wife works as an interior designer, possibly in other roles as well, for one or more of her father&#8217;s companies, and she receives what, by any standards, must be regarded as a huge income(sic).  There is a dispute between the parties as to whether her income is(sic) &#163;500,000 a year or &#163;1 million a year, or something in between.  I dare say it varies, but given that there is no income tax in Dubai and that, according to the tables in At a Glance, the cost of living in Dubai is actually a little bit less than that in London, that is plainly a huge income and, without in any sense doing down the wife&#8217;s hard work and achievements, it seems to me to be obvious that the amount that she receives overall is more than the income that someone doing her job would usually be likely to receive.  That is not a criticism, it is simply an observation.</p>

Her father did not, of course, give evidence, but I get the clear impression that he was a generous man, but that his generosity was very much on his own terms.  For example, if the wife or any of her siblings wanted to use one of his many fine properties, such as that in the South of France, they needed to seek his permission and make the relevant arrangements.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is obvious from everything that I have heard that the wife&#8217;s father put a very substantial number of assets into her name, and probably the names of her siblings as well, although I do not know.  The wife said, and I accept, that she really did not know what assets he had put in her name, and I gained the very clear impression that she was anxious, if not actually afraid, of asking him for details.  I gained the impression that the love that this father gives to his children is, in many respects, conditional love.  I sense that one of the essential conditions is their obedience to him and respect for him.  I can well understand that the wife did not want to ask her father for details of her financial resources if it meant enquiring into something that he regarded as deeply private.  It may seem odd to some of us, maybe most of us, that she was scared of asking him what she had in her name, one might think that that is something that she is automatically entitled to, but I sense that her father is somebody who would put things into his children&#8217;s name without them necessarily knowing and he may very well have reasons why he did not even want them to know.  I have no doubt at all that the relationship that the wife had with her father was complicated and, in many respects, one where there was a great imbalance of power.</p>

I am not for a moment suggesting that the wife tried to please her father for her own financial gain, I do not mean that at all; I think it is far more likely, and I so find, that the wife wanted to please her father because she wanted his love, and conducting the relationship on his terms was the only pragmatic way for her to achieve it.</p>

Again, I am not suggesting for a moment that this is why he married the wife, but he knew that she was wealthy and that he would, whilst in the family, be able to enjoy the trappings of significant wealth.  This included exceptionally lavish holidays.  I have even been given a holiday schedule as some sort of prop to a claim to support his asserted income needs, and I return to it later.  They had the use of various properties that belonged to the wife&#8217;s father or one of his nominees or companies.  One of them was a fabulously expensive and I dare say wonderful property in the South of France.  </p>

The husband said that he was handed a paper napkin on which the wife&#8217;s father had sketched out information relating to his business and company interests.  It is not completely clear what was said, and the husband&#8217;s recollection will doubtless be somewhat clouded by the fact, on his own admission, he and the wife&#8217;s father had had a considerable amount to drink on that occasion.

She did not like what she saw written on this napkin.  In cross-examination, the husband said that the napkin simply contained an organisational chart about the companies, rather than details of value.

I accept that the napkin contained evidence of who owned what within the family, or at least some evidence of it.

To be fair, I am not, here, blaming the husband because he had the information, I have no idea whether he asked for the information or it was volunteered to him, and I make no criticism of him about what was contained on that piece of paper or napkin.</p>

Although other figures have been put forward suggesting that this treatment could be secured at a lower amount, given the wealth available in this case, it seems to me that one of the most important things of all is to repair, if it can be done, the mental health of each of these parties, and I accept that that claim for &#163;22,000-odd to be spent on medical treatment is a reasonable and fair claim for the husband to be making.</p>

As I have said, in fact, if anything, Dubai is a lot cheaper because although the cost of living there is pretty similar if not a little bit less than London, of course there is no income tax, and that makes a vast difference for somebody earning good money as he expects again to do.</p>

I accept that, but the fact is that Dr McClintock could have been called to give evidence and be cross-examined and various items of expenditure incurred by the husband which were aired before me in court could have been put to him.  To my mind, proving that somebody went to a particular event or place or establishment for a drink does not prove that that person is lying when he says that he is depressed or unable to work.  It is, I suspect, to most people, easier to go to the pub and have a drink than it is to hold down an important job.</p>

However, in my judgment, the wife and her legal team made the correct decision in not calling Dr McClintock.  His report is there to see and I am not sure that cross-examination of him would have made a lot of difference.  It seems to me that I have to err on the side of caution in relation to the husband&#8217;s earning capacity and, in the absence of any cogent evidence to the contrary, I accept the report of Dr McClintock.

In circumstances where one party has immense wealth and the other does not, particularly if that immense wealth is pre-acquired, in other words before the relationship started, as here, or given to one of the spouses by somebody else, it may be a paradigm situation for there to be a prenuptial agreement, particularly anticipating, as happened here, the possibility that the parties&#8217; marriage might end after a short number of years and particularly if there were, as here, no children.  Of course, the situation is very different if a couple separate after decades of rearing children together and pulling their weight together in a partnership.</p>

In one sense, in circumstances where one party is substantially wealthier than the other, and that is probably more often the case than not in prenuptial agreement cases because why have one if neither of the parties have anything or indeed have about the same amount each, there is always pressure.  Generally, the person with less money would probably rather not have the prenuptial agreement.  </p>

He had the opportunity, did he not, of refusing to sign the agreement.  It might have ended the relationship, or they might have stayed living together and not married, but he made that choice.  There is no point in having these agreements, and I would be riding roughshod over the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Granatino v Radmacher</span> if I did not give regard to this prenuptial agreement.</p>

I am not going to allow myself to descend into claims and counterclaims of what went on in the marriage for to do so would be to fly in the face of the accepted wisdom to which I have already referred.  The court should do all that it can to avoid, in many cases, in most cases, descending into the arena of the day to day struggles of a couple&#8217;s relationship breakdown.  It is, however, abundantly clear to me that the relationship between these parties was at a desperately low ebb.  There was an atmosphere of mistrust, fear and despair.  The wife said she left the home because she was in fear and had to get out.  I am not making a finding that she was in fear, still less am I making a finding that the husband made her fearful, because the evidence did not address this issue, and properly so.  However, the wife said it and it is difficult to see how mediation could work in the face of a marriage which ended with the level of acrimony, mistrust and anxiety that both parties agree was present.  Even the most experienced mediators will say that there are some cases which are profoundly unsuited to mediation and it seems to me that this case may very well have been one of those.</p>

I cannot understand what possessed them to say that at the same time as they were trying to rely on the prenuptial agreement.  It was an inappropriate threat and it was a stupid threat and in my judgement it was wrong for them to make it.  But I have not heard from the wife&#8217;s Dubai solicitors.

It was, in my judgement, a perfectly proper attempt by an anxious, emotional and vulnerable person to say, &#8220;I would rather pay you this money than go to court; please take my offer, it is generous&#8221;, and I cannot align myself with Miss Bangay&#8217;s criticism of it as being a recognition by the wife that the agreement was in some way unfair.

You do not have to be a master chef to learn how to eat reasonably well.  In fairness, the husband ameliorated his claim here and I am not going to descend into the details of how or why or what he should cook each day, but I do suggest to lawyers who prepare these budgets that if you put something in the schedule which is absurd, it can discolour the whole case.  Of course I am not judging the whole case on the basis of this particular aspect of the schedule, but it is unhelpful I am afraid when people put their expenses forward in that kind of way.

I am not going to spend long on the argument as to whether that is a good, bad or indifferent type of property in Dubai.  In my judgment, I should not require the wife to provide the funds to enable the husband to purchase a house.  I am sure that it is wrong in the context of the prenuptial agreement.  But even without the prenuptial agreement, I think it is extremely unlikely that, after this short childless marriage, I would have been saying that the husband could walk out, after three years or marriage or five years of cohabitation, even six if you stretch it to the widest point put forward by Miss Bangay, which I have already rejected for the reasons stated, with a property of that sort of value.  I am going to delete altogether the cost of purchasing a house.  I have found that that is the wrong thing to do having regard to the terms of the prenuptial agreement which I am applying, albeit varying marginally to meet short term needs.

If I take Miss Bangay&#8217;s figure of &#163;1.75 million and I take 5 per cent of that, it is &#163;87,500 a year.  If I double that to make it for two years, it becomes &#163;175,000, and I am going to put that figure into my schedule.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband of course already has some liquid resources in his own name, and whilst I accept that the Spanish property is inaccessible, he still has at least &#163;300,000 in his own name, and it could be argued that he has actually got more than that when I deal with costs in the way that I have, because I have arrived at that figure because the husband has netted off his costs liability on his Form ES2.  There is room here for me to be generous, and I know the husband will not accept that this is generous, but generous in the context of what I have determined is the right way of approaching this case, and generous in terms of looking at the offers that have been made by the wife already, but, doing the best that I can and erring on the side of generosity to the husband, I am going to award the husband a lump sum of &#163;400,000, and that is the decision that I make, and that can be payable by the wife, I assume, within twenty-eight days.</p>
