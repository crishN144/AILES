Objectively, features of the regime <span style="font-style:italic">deprive</span> him of his liberty, contrary to his rights under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 5 ECHR</span>.

The Applicants therefore issued an application in the High Court, seeking (i) the court&#8217;s approval under the inherent jurisdiction for ensuring that DN&#8217;s need for care and support was delivered under a lawful framework, and (ii) authorisation for the deprivation of DN&#8217;s liberty for as long as he remains/remained at Stamford House.    </p>

He has been represented by Mr Neil Allen.

I heard the oral evidence of Dr Patrick Quinn, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist with a special responsibility for learning disability, at the Yorkshire Centre for Forensic Psychiatry; he had assessed DN on 2 April 2019. I also spoke at some length with DN himself on the telephone, by arrangement, prior to the hearing; we were in conversation for a little under an hour.  He was engaging, clear thinking and articulate. </p>

The significance in this context of the concept of a vulnerable adult is pragmatic and evidential: it is simply that an adult who is vulnerable is more likely to fall into the category of the incapacitated in relation to whom the inherent jurisdiction is exercisable than an adult who is not vulnerable. So it is likely to be easier to persuade the court that there is a case calling for investigation where the adult is apparently vulnerable than where the adult is not on the face of it vulnerable.

The establishment of a statutory scheme to bring the cases in this hinterland before the Court of Protection would &#8230; represent an almost impossible task, whereas the ability of the common law to develop and adapt its jurisdiction, on a case by case basis, as may be required, may meet this need more readily&#8221;.  </p>

While the comments at<span style="font-style:italic"/>para.[16] of that judgment at first blush may seem to give some support for the proposition that the inherent jurisdiction can be used to deprive an adult of their liberty, this paragraph must (I consider) be read together with [23] (ibid.) which significantly qualifies the earlier remarks:  </p>

He maintains that DN is not at Stamford House truly voluntarily, given that at the point when he made his election to reside there his only real alternative was/is imprisonment, or indefinite detention in a psychiatric hospital. Mr Davies referred to DN as having been &#8216;between the devil and the deep blue sea&#8217; in facing the &#8216;stark&#8217; prospect of custody, or a community order in supported living.  The pressure of this decision was/is exacerbated, in DN&#8217;s case, according to Mr Davies, by DN&#8217;s autistic traits, his general anxiety and his unstable personality disorder. </p>

The Applicants have designed the package to meet his needs, and believe that the package of care they provide is a <span style="font-style:italic">complete</span> package.  While they accept that there may be some scope for discussion/negotiation of some elements, there may well be &#8216;red lines&#8217;.  Mr Davies submits that the Applicants may take the view that they are not prepared to take the operational risk if DN does not accept key features of the regime.  In those circumstances, if no agreement can be reached, the placement would be terminated.  There are implications in the criminal process if the placement is terminated (see [55] below). </p>

The Respondents, while accepting that in many ways DN is a vulnerable person, do not agree that he is so vulnerable (or vulnerable in the <span style="font-style:italic">Re SA</span> sense) as to warrant the court&#8217;s protection; they say that the prospect of facing a custodial sentence or residence in supported living under a programme of mental health treatment does not <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> render an adult vulnerable.

In confirming this essentially fact-sensitive approach, I adopt the direction given by Stephen Brown LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Freeman v Home Office No.2</span> (see [33] above).  Having reviewed the written material, and received the oral and written evidence of Dr. Quinn, I have reached the conclusion that DN is not &#8216;vulnerable&#8217; as that term is understood in the context of <span style="font-style:italic">Re SA</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re DL</span>. While it is certainly true that DN is vulnerable in some ways, and particularly in some contexts which he finds challenging, I do not find as a question of fact that his decision-making in relation to his residence at Stamford House has been &#8220;vitiated&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="13">

I find that he was able to offer his consent to his residence and care arrangements at the Magistrates Court freely, and expressed his willingness, without coercion or constraint, to comply with the regime offered by the community order. While I accept that DN faced a &#8216;stark&#8217; choice in the criminal court when presented with the prospect of a custodial sentence if he had not accepted a community order with MHTR, I nonetheless do not consider that this disabled him from making a free choice.   </p>
