	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The proceedings have their genesis in a head injury sustained by S in June 2019. The local authority has wavered in respect of whether it seeks a finding in these proceedings regarding the causation of S&#8217;s head injury, initially deciding that, in light of the conclusions set out in the reports from Professor David and Dr Stoodley, there was no real evidential basis upon which an allegation that S sustained an inflicted injury could be maintained.  The local authority has now changed its position and has indicated definitively that it seeks a finding that the cause of S&#8217;s head injury is either intentional suffocation by one or other of the parents, or was caused by some undisclosed event or circumstance known to the parents, for example cosleeping/overlay but which is being withheld by them.  These allegations are firmly disputed by the parents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, the father now argues that the court has power, independent of the powers set out in the FPR 2010 and exercisable at this stage of the proceedings, to summarily dismiss disputed findings and that that power should be exercised in this case on the basis that the court can conclude now that the evidence filed cannot support those findings.  Further, the father and mother argue that, in any event, it is not necessary or proportionate for there to be a fact finding hearing in relation to the causation head injury sustained by S.  On 13 March 2020 I listed these issues for determination by way of a preliminary hearing.  Having heard submissions remotely over a video link I reserved judgment and now set out my decision.   </p>

Difficulties within the family are said to have included domestic violence, with the father alleged by the mother to have been controlling and abusive, inadequate housing provision, inconsistent engagement with professionals supporting the family, budgeting issues and lack of food.  As a result of these concerns the children were made subject of a Child in Need plan.  </p>

The parents provided an account stating that S was observed to have been awake in his Moses basket at 0010hrs and that when the parents next attended to L, who slept with her parents on an air bed, at approximately 0500hrs S was seen to be floppy and unresponsive and apparently not breathing.  S was blue and his eyes were rolled back. An ambulance was called and paramedics observed S to be pale, floppy and grunting with ineffective breathing.  S was stabilised in the Emergency Department and admitted to a High Dependency Cubicle.   </p>

On 6 June 2019 S underwent an ophthalmology review, an EEG and an MRI scan. The ophthalmology review revealed no evidence of retinal haemorrhage.  The EEG was reported as abnormal, with evidence of diffuse and cortical damage to S&#8217;s brain.  The MRI was reported as being grossly abnormal.  The consultant paediatric neurologist reporting on the MRI considered that the appearance was consistent with a metabolic or mitochondrial disorder, that the features were not those classical of non-accidental injury but that non-accidental injury could not be ruled out as a possible cause of the features seen on the MRI.  A CT scan showed no evidence of subdural haemorrhage. The results were discussed with the parents but the possibility of non-accidental injury was not raised with them.  </p>

The alleged incident was said by the parents to have involved a drunken friend of the father&#8217;s kicking over S&#8217;s Moses basket.  The hospital contends that this was the first time the parents made mention of this alleged incident although both parents stated in their police interviews that they mentioned the alleged incident to the doctor when S was received at the Emergency Department (as Professor David points out, the notes of the Emergency Department doctors are very brief).  Both parents accept that they failed to seek medical attention for S after the alleged incident with the Moses basket.  On 7 June 2019 the parents gave consent for L to be accommodated pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

Reports were provided by S&#8217;s treating clinicians dated 10 June 2029, 1 July 2019, 10 July 2019 and 27 August 2019.  The provisional report dated 10 June 2019 indicated that S&#8217;s treating clinicians were investigating the possibility of an underlying medical disorder but were unable at that stage to rule out non-accidental injury as a cause of the features seen on the MRI scan and in the EEG.

The subsequent reports indicate that genetic testing for mitochondrial disease has indicated no evidence of pathogenic variants that would confirm a diagnosis of mitochondrial disorder. Mitochondrial DNA disease results indicated no evidence of a mutation with further testing ongoing to screen the entire mitochondrial genome. Further, metabolic results received to date have returned as normal or with no evidence of an organic acid disorder.  The urine amino acid screen detected &#8220;several unknown compounds&#8221; which may have been drug/diet related metabolites.  A repeat urine sample indicated no abnormal purines or other endogenous compounds although the plasma / urine guanidinoacetate and creatine results were slightly unusual and repeat samples were taken.  </p>

It is true that very occasionally the episode &#8216;went wrong, when a mother, trying just a bit too hard to convince the treating team that there really was something seriously wrong with the baby, would suffocate the child for longer than necessary to cause apnoea and loss of consciousness.  The catastrophic end result of prolonged obstruction was brain damage resulting from lack of oxygen.  This was fortunately a rare occurrence, but I have vivid recollection of one such case occurring on the paediatric ward at the old St Mary&#8217;s Hospital in Manchester.  At the risk of serious oversimplification, for the sake of brevity, the motivation for this behaviour was not to harm the child but was believed to be a form of attention seeking behaviour, the mother deriving &#8216;support&#8217; from the extra medical attention given to a sick child&#8221;. </p>

The judge also has to decide what weight to attach to a witness's opinion by examining the internal consistency and logic of his evidence; his precision and accuracy of thought as demonstrated by his answers; how he responds to searching and informed cross-examination and in particular the extent to which a witness faces up to and accepts the logic and proposition put in cross-examination or is prepared to concede points that are seen to be correct; the extent to which a witness has conceived an opinion and is reluctant to re-examine it in light of later evidence, or demonstrates a flexibility of mind which may involve changing or modifying opinions previously held; whether or not a witness is biased or lacks independence.&#8221; </p>

Mr Garrido and Mr Steward submit that the court has a power within public law proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">independent</span> of its case management powers under the FPR 2010, to summarily dismiss disputed findings sought by a local authority at the case management stage.  Accordingly, the issue before the court is not whether a court has power to summarily dismiss public law proceedings as a <span style="font-style:italic">whole</span> but, rather, whether a court has power, independent of the FPR 2010, to decide summarily at the case management stage that a given disputed finding sought by a local authority is incapable of proof on the balance of probabilities.  Within this context, as I have noted, the father relies on the decision of Sir Mark Hedley in <span style="font-style:italic">VBC v AGM and Ors</span> as establishing that latter power. </p>

Within this context, in <span style="font-style:italic">VBC v AGM and Ors</span> Sir Mark was required to determine an application to dismiss the local authority&#8217;s case in a case concerning an alleged paedophile ring having heard the local authority&#8217;s evidence, including oral evidence from two of the three complainants at the final hearing.

First, Sir Mark Hedley was concerned with the question of the court&#8217;s power to summarily dismiss public proceedings as a whole prior to the conclusion of an ongoing final hearing and not the question of a power to summarily dismiss certain disputed findings at the case management stage.  Second, Sir Mark&#8217;s conclusions in <span style="font-style:italic">VBC v AGM and Ors </span>were reached by reference primarily to authorities dealing with the position in private law proceedings, rather than in public law proceedings concerning child protection.   </p>

Part 12 is supplemented by the Guide to Case Management contained in Practice Direction 12A, which itself incorporates the Public Law Outline. This is not the occasion for a full survey of those provisions, but two points are of relevance to this appeal: </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0.38in">The provisions are a self-contained code designed to assist the parties and the court to deal with care proceedings justly and efficiently. Part 12 is a specific application to care cases of Part 1 (the Overriding Objective) and Part 4 (General Case Management Powers) and contains detailed provisions reflecting the spirit of those earlier parts of the Rules. Part 12 is therefore likely to contain all the powers that the court needs, making it unlikely that recourse to the more general procedural provisions will be necessary; at all events, in a case to which Part 12 applies the earlier provisions do not represent an alternative procedural regime. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0.38in">Part 12 and the Public Law Outline are the most recent in a series of initiatives designed to achieve good, timely outcomes in care cases. They set out stages to the process, list matters to be considered at main hearings, promote judicial continuity and set timescales. The aim is to cut down on superfluous hearings, while maintaining some flexibility. So, r 12.25(1) provides for just one case management hearing with r 12.25(2) permitting a further case management hearing only where it is necessary. By r 12.25(4) the issues resolution hearing can itself be a final hearing, where it is possible for all the issues to be resolved. Extensions of time are closely controlled by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 32</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, which specifically states that extensions are not to be granted routinely and are to be seen as requiring specific justification; this is reflected in r 12.26A. Seen overall, the system encourages and empowers strategic thinking within a standardised framework; indeed, it requires it. It is a deliberate move away from ad hoc case management under which cases often developed organically and without structure. It places very considerable demands on all participants, but that is what Parliament has required for the benefit of the children and families concerned; moreover, experience shows that non-compliance usually causes even greater difficulties.&#8221; </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">A County Council v DP and Others</span> [2005] EWHC 1593, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 1031" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 1031</ref>, McFarlane J, at para [24], helpfully identified, by reference to previous authorities, nine matters which the court should bear in mind before deciding whether to conduct a particular fact-finding exercise. I have no doubt that, notwithstanding that in the present case a decision had been made in the exercise of such a discretion to arrange for the disputed facts, in relation in particular to the allegations against A, to be determined at the hearing fixed to begin on 7 April 2008, Her Honour Judge Hughes also even at that stage retained a discretion to decline to conduct it. Nevertheless in my view additional considerations fall to be weighed by a judge who is considering, at the outset of a prearranged fact-finding hearing, whether in effect to abort it. That judge should weigh, with appropriate respect, the previous decision that the exercise should be undertaken and should ask whether any fresh circumstances, or at least any circumstances freshly discovered, should lead her or him to depart from the chosen forensic course. Equally she or he should weigh the costs already incurred in the assembly of the case on all sides and the degree to which a refusal at that stage to conduct the hearing would waste them. Furthermore she or he should weigh any special features such as, in the present case, the facts that a girl then aged 16 had been shown the court room, that she had participated in discussions with the guardian as to the way in which she would prefer to give evidence and that she was thus expecting that she would imminently be giving oral evidence in some way or another, although the judge should not on the other hand ignore the girl's likely apprehension at that prospect. What needs, however, to be avoided at all costs is a sudden decision to abort the hearing in circumstances in which, later, the findings not then made might after all be considered to be necessary. So a judge in the position of Her Honour Judge Hughes on 8 April should in my view act most cautiously before putting the forensic programme into reverse.&#8221; </p>

The procedural framework provided by the FPR 2010 and the principles articulated in <span style="font-style:italic">A County Council v DP, RS, BS (By the Children&#8217;s Guardian) </span>are far better suited to deciding whether, in the context of public law proceedings, a disputed finding or set of findings should or should not be determined by the court.   </p>

Sir Mark Hedley was not concerned in <span style="font-style:italic">VBC v AGM and Ors</span> with the question of deciding, at the case management stage, whether a disputed finding or group of disputed findings should or should not be summarily determined.  Rather, he was concerned with the power of the court in public law proceedings to decide to bring the proceedings as a whole to an end prior to the conclusion of an ongoing final hearing.  It remains to be seen whether the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">VBC v AGM and Ors</span> can survive the later decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-L</span> but that is not a question for this court.

There is a marked difference in the consequence for the welfare evaluation as between a finding of inflicted injury, a finding of accidental injury and a finding that the injury remains unexplained.  Within this context, a decision as to whether the injury was deliberate, accidental or unexplained is not only relevant in that it will inform the care plan for the children and the welfare stage of these proceedings, but is also in each of the children&#8217;s interests in that it has the potential to mean the difference between a plan of rehabilitation and a plan of permanency.  Further, the determination of the disputed findings sought in respect of the causation of S&#8217;s head injury will inform the ability of the parents to care for any future children they may have.

I am not able to accept that characterisation having regard to the well-established case law I have set out above that articulates the process the court must adopt with respect to making findings of fact in public law proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.   </p>

Likewise, the fact that the experts jointly instructed in public law proceedings cannot identify, as between two or more possibilities, the cause of an injury to a child does not prevent the court making a finding on the <span style="font-style:italic">totality </span>of the evidence before it as to causation in an appropriate case.  Indeed, Professor David recognises this much in his report when he makes clear that by being able to take many other factors into account the Court may well be far better placed to complete the jigsaw than he is.  The approach articulated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re U; Re B (Serious Injury: Standard of Proof) </span>is particularly important where the cause contended for by the local authority may, in some cases, not be evidenced medically or not be capable of being so evidenced. For example, in this case Professor David makes clear that when considering the issue of suffocation there are rarely any other <span style="font-style:italic">medical</span> indicators to reach this as a safe and evidenced based conclusion for an infant&#8217;s sudden collapse.  </p>

This is not the position in law.  Rather, the authorities make abundantly clear that even where the only tenable conclusion on the medical evidence is that there is more than one possibility for the cause of the injuries or that the injuries are medically unexplained, the court may, having regard to the wider canvas and in an appropriate case, nonetheless conclude that parent was responsible for deliberately causing the injury. </p>

Within this context, in circumstances where the medical evidence is just one part of the evidential jigsaw and where there is a range of other relevant evidence that the court must consider alongside the medical evidence, until the court has undertaken the exercise of examining that evidence within the forensic crucible of a final hearing it would be entirely premature to conclude that the evidential result in respect of the disputed findings in this case will be that they will not be not made out to the requisite standard of proof.   </p>

Within this context, I accept Mr Spencer&#8217;s submission that the court will, in deciding what weight to attach to the expert medical evidence in this case within the context of the totality of the evidence before the court, need to examine carefully the reliance placed on research by Professor Sir Roy Meadow and Professor David Southall, whose professional integrity has been called into question in other contexts (as Professor David is at pains to acknowledge).

The court has also ensured that the parents have access to all of the evidence upon which the local authority relies to prove its case, the burden of proof at all times resting on the local authority.

Equally, where a child has not been deliberately injured, there is a public interest in the removal of unjustified speculation and suspicion that may have fallen wrongly on those who are not in fact culpable. These public interests belong to the children who are the subject of these proceedings as much as they do to the public at large, in addition to it being, as I have said, in each of the children&#8217;s interests to have an accurate account of their respective histories.  Further, this is not a case in which the local authority is seeking blindly, or by reason of malice, to pursue findings that have no evidential basis.  Rather, having regard to the background of this matter the local authority properly brings the disputed findings before the court for determination.
