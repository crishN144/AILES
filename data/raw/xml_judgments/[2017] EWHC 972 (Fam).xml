The answer is that, although the parents have parental responsibility, overriding control is by law vested in the court exercising its independent and objective judgment in the child&#8217;s best interests.  The Great Ormond Street Hospital has made an application and it is my duty to rule on it, given that the parents and the hospital cannot agree on the best way forward.  </span></p>

The judge must decide what is in the child's best interests. In making that decision, the welfare of the child is paramount, and the judge must look at the question from the assumed point of view of the child.  There is a strong presumption in favour of a course of action which will prolong life, but that presumption is not irrebuttable.  The term &#8216;best interests&#8217; encompasses medical, emotional, and all other welfare issues.&#8221;</span></p>

His case has also been considered by an expert team in Barcelona, which has reached the same conclusion.

As I have already said, funding in this case is not an issue.  The US doctor also confirmed during this telephone conversation that he had never treated with nucleoside therapy anyone who had encephalopathy.  Therefore, he was unable to indicate from any scientific basis whether a patient with encephalopathy would respond positively.  </span></p>

In mouse models, the benefit to TK2 patients was put at about 4% of life expectancy.  There is no evidence that nucleoside therapy can cross the blood/brain barrier which it must do to treat RRM2B, although the US doctor expressed the hope that it might cross that barrier.  </span></p>

Their evidence was that being ventilated, being suctioned, living as Charlie does, are all capable of causing pain.  Transporting Charlie to the USA would be problematic, but possible.  Subjecting him to nucleoside therapy is unknown territory - it has never even been tested on mouse models - but it may, or may not, subject the patient to pain, possibly even to mutations.  But if Charlie&#8217;s damaged brain function cannot be improved, as all seem to agree, then how can he be any better off than he is now, which is in a condition that his parents believe should not be sustained?  </span></p>

The judge must decide what is in the child's best interests.  In making that decision, the welfare of the child is paramount, and the judge must look at the question from the assumed point of view of the patient.  There is a strong presumption in favour of a course of action which will prolong life, but that presumption is not irrebuttable.  The term &#8216;best interests&#8217; encompasses medical, emotional, and all other welfare issues.  The court must conduct a balancing exercise in which all the relevant factors are weighed and a helpful way of undertaking this exercise is to draw up a balance sheet.&#8221;</span></p>

Professor A&#8217;s clear opinion is that this level will have progressively reduced since then.

He said that he is not certain that it is effective with RRM2B, but it should be in theory.  He confirmed that it was purely theoretical and that there was no clinical evidence to support the theory.  He also volunteered that TK2 does not generally affect the brain.  He said that there was no direct evidence that nucleoside therapy has had any beneficial effect on the brain of TK2 patients, although he thought that there is a high chance of some penetration to the brain but he could not say whether it would be sufficient.  He admitted that nucleoside therapy could not affect structural damage to the brain.  He also said that the drug was more likely to cross the brain barrier in a newborn baby than a baby over eight months old, such as Charlie.  </span></p>

The Guardian also reminds me that there is no direct evidence to suggest that nucleoside therapy has a positive effect in cases of RRM2B mutation.

This evidence was not, as the Guardian put it, obviously consistent with the view expressed a little later in Dr. I&#8217;s evidence that he thought that Charlie&#8217;s brain damage was to a large extent irreversible, nor to Dr. I&#8217;s acceptance of the fact that Charlie was not responsive prior to developing seizures and that that was suggestive of underlying irreversible brain damage.  </span></p>
