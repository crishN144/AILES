In my view correctly, no damages are sought on behalf of MB under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>.  </p>

Since her placement away from home at the end of February 2010 she has not returned home and she is now placed in a specialist EMI nursing care home with the agreement of her husband (the Second Respondent) and the court shares the view of the Official Solicitor that this is in her best interests.</p>

Concerns were raised as to his ability to continue caring for his wife and in particular as to four incidents between 8 December 2009 and 22 February 2010 when he accepted that in managing and caring for her, when she had become agitated, he had slapped, held or restrained her in a manner that left marks on her body.

Following her admission to the Residential Home Mrs B regularly demonstrated distress, appeared to have lost some functioning skills and her appetite had diminished significantly.

She did not however adopt the reason set out as an option - &#8220;that it was not necessary in order to prevent harm to the relevant person that they are a detained resident&#8221; -  which would have been the mirror of her first best interests assessment.

So far as I can see there was no material difference in the competing factors that were relevant to the best interests decision when it was made by Ms SP at the end of March and when it was made by the court on 13 April, none have been pointed out to me.</p>

Later in her reasoning she records that it was reported that Mrs B had hit out at co-residents on two occasions and that (and I agree) the likelihood that her husband will be able to respond appropriately without readily available support, given recent history, must be considered unlikely.  To my mind, this indicates that Ms SP (in my view correctly) had concluded that it was not in Mrs B&#8217;s best interests to return home absent  24 hour (or very significant) support and thus as her husband was not willing to have this level of support that it would not be in her best interests to return home.</p>

Ms SP says (and I agree) that wherever it was decided Mrs B resides in the future she would need a secure environment and supervision along with a supportive response from carers to ensure that her practical and emotional needs are appropriately met at all times.  Ms SP does not suggest how this could be provided in the short term without Mrs B being deprived of her liberty in the light of her acknowledgement of the risk of harm if she left the Residential Home of becoming anxious, disorientated, possibly getting lost or being vulnerable to exploitation from others outside the home, or otherwise.  Also she does not suggest where this secure environment would be, but her suggestions as to what the care team should consider (namely  whether she should be allowed to leave the Residential Home alone <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">in the future</span> (my emphasis) - whilst properly acknowledging the risks referred to above if she did -  and that they should continue to review the care plan <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and the restrictions in place</span> (my emphasis), it seems that she was envisaging that Mrs B should remain at the Residential Home at least whilst further investigations and assessments were made to see (a) whether she should move, and (b) as to the restrictions, if any, to her liberty at her place of residence whether it was a residential / care  home or at her own home were  appropriate.</p>

It was made under paragraph 76(2) (and so before the application was made) but it, and the request, do not indicate which of the second and third cases set out in paragraph 24 was thought to apply (but it seems that it was the third case because, it seems from the reasons given that the Residential Home thought that diversion therapy would not succeed in preventing Mrs B from going home as she was saying she wanted to do).</p>

In my view the language in which the relevant belief is expressed in paragraph 76(2) does not found this view.  This is because the timing relates to the making of the request and not to the actual start of the detention.  It would also be contrary to the scheme of the provisions, because (a) the relevant person could be detained on, or immediately after, being accommodated without the obligation under the first case having arisen prior to the start of that accommodation, and (b) in such a case the scheme of the provisions envisages that an urgent authorisation should be given.</p>

Once this was known to the Residential Home they also knew that the period to which an urgent authorisation is directed (i.e. the period until the request is disposed of &#8211; see paragraph 76(3)(b)) had come to an end.  Further, even if the second urgent authorisation could have been founded on the earlier obligation to request (and the request for) the second standard authorisation it would have ended pursuant to paragraph 89(4) by, at the latest, the receipt of the written notice dated 1 April 2010.</p>

In many cases this would be likely to involve the consideration of the impact of a move that might only be for a short time or which does not satisfy the identified needs of P.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But, it seems that the relevant domestic law in the Netherlands was to the effect that where a request has been made to the court for the  prolongation of an order authorising detention it remains valid from its expiry to the date that the court decides whether to extend it (see the second paragraph and the first sentence of the third paragraph within paragraph 49).  This is an equivalent provision to (a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 4</ref>B, if it applies, and (b) paragraph 63(3) of Schedule A1.</p>

Rather, it seems to me that this passage is referring to a possible argument that a long delay in obtaining the order of the court (and thus a long period of prolongation of the authorisation given by the earlier and time expired order) could render that prolonged period of extension of the authorisation of detention arbitrary, unreasonable or excessive.</p>
