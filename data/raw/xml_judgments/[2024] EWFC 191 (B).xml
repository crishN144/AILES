He has just completed his GCSEs at a Central London state school and is looking to move to another Central London state school for the sixth form. He has rather become caught between his battling parents in recent years and currently lives with the husband and is estranged from the wife. It is no part of my task to investigate why this has happened (each party, of course, blames the other), but the absence of contact is plainly and understandably a matter of great pain to the wife. I express the hope that, when the dust settles on this litigation, the relationship between mother and son will begin to heal and recover, but there is certainly work to be done here.        </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">At each stage in the proceedings the husband has sought adjournments. At the final hearing stage both parties sought an adjournment. Looking back on all these applications I observe that in my view the court was right to refuse an adjournment on each occasion it was requested. In the end the facts of the case have not proved to be very complicated and what was needed was a resolution of the parties&#8217; differences. Adjournments often have the unhappy consequence of achieving nothing apart from delaying resolution and increasing costs and stress and I am sure that would have been the case here. As well as that, asking for an adjournment of a three-day hearing a week or so before, without compelling reasons (and there were none here), runs the risk of wasting precious court resources at a time when these resources are highly stretched. Parties and lawyers allocated a slot in the court diary really should concentrate on getting themselves ready for it rather than becoming distracted by making unmeritorious adjournment applications. For avoidance of doubt, I did not observe in the husband&#8217;s presentation in court and in his oral evidence anything to suggest that he was too stressed to attend court.</p>

I suspended enforcement until the end of the proceedings. I do not intend to discharge this order and my order now will record that this costs order may now be enforced.</p>

In my view none of these allegations has been established and I have been satisfied by the denials, and the reasons for the denials, made by the party against whom the accusation was made. On a balance of probabilities I find that the wife no longer holds the small portions of arable land in the South American country that she once held (which were of insignificant value anyway), that the husband has long since sold the other house in the European Country (for which he received a modest amount of money, which has long since been spent) and that, whilst the husband did own a company called X Foundation LLC (&#8216;X&#8217;) registered in Panama and a company called Y Limited registered in Gibraltar, these companies have long since ceased trading and are dormant with no assets. In X&#8217;s case it has been struck off the company register. I accept the husband&#8217;s explanation that the companies were created in the context of his business career in the energy industry and that he has not worked in this field (or at all) for several years.      </span></p>

It is common ground that the loan was never repaid to X and, in theory, it could be pursued if X was restored to the company register, though this would require the husband to take active steps in this regard. To deal with this issue the husband has told me that he is prepared to give an undertaking to the court not to activate any steps in this regard and to indemnify the wife against any liabilities she may have to X. In my view, providing the undertaking is formally given in due course, this effectively neutralises this issue and I should not regard it as creating a real debt in the wife&#8217;s name which needs to be recorded in my asset schedule.    </span></p>

I accept that these are relatively soft debts and there is no great hurry to repay them, but I take the view that they remain liabilities which he will one day need to meet and that they should stay on the asset schedule.

He has acknowledged that the wife has a housing need which should be met by him, and he was prepared to contemplate selling (or borrowing against) 1 London Apartment and the property in a European country to fund such a settlement for the wife in the sum of &#163;365,300 (per his open offer dated 24</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">th</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> June 2024); but otherwise he declined to contemplate any plan different from his own proposal.</span></p>

Overall, however, I accept Ms Staunton&#8217;s observation that the husband&#8217;s plans really fall into the category of &#8216;wants&#8217; rather than &#8216;needs&#8217;. There is no &#8216;need&#8217;, for example, to think about buying a flat for A, however attractive a plan that may be. However much he regards the country cottage as his &#8216;spiritual home&#8217;, it cannot be regarded as a &#8216;need&#8217; for him to keep this and 2 London Apartment.</span></p>

I record also that the wife has made contributions to the marriage in the form of home-making and child-care over quite a number of years and the current difficult situation with A does not detract from that. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The husband&#8217;s case was that the wife could be suitably housed in a two-bedroom flat in East Dulwich or Forest Hill costing &#163;450,000 to &#163;500,000. The wife was unhappy about this geographical location and put forward a range of particulars of properties (also mostly two-bedroom flats) costing &#163;800,000 to &#163;850,000 in Notting Hill, Fulham, Maida Vale and Richmond. The difference between the two property selections mostly arises from their geographical area. As is often the case in these disputes, the property particulars produced to the court represent the poles of the argument, but it is possible to take judicial notice of the fact (manifest from a short period of Google searching) that there are a range of two-bedroom flats available in a range of places in London in the price space between the poles. </p>

I do not propose to dictate to her where she should live, or in what sort of accommodation, but I am satisfied that a fund of this size would give a reasonable opportunity of buying a reasonably suitable property in a reasonably suitable area of London.</p>

In assessing what would be reasonable here I must bear in mind that some of her income will be taken up with CMS payments for two years, that she has only recently started her present employment and mortgagees may be cautious about such a short track record and also, importantly, that she will need to make pension contributions to plan for her retirement, for which at the moment she has nothing but her state pension entitlement. In the circumstances I propose to assess her needs on the basis of a mortgage of &#163;75,000.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to this sum, I have given careful thought to the mechanics of how this family can move forward in the immediate future. At present the wife is living (for at least some of the time) in the flat immediately below the flat occupied by the husband and A &#8211; i.e. she occupies 1 London Apartment and the husband and A occupy 2 London Apartment, immediately above. It is clear from reading the judgment of DJ Jenkins from the FLA 1996 proceedings that this situation, which has subsisted to a greater or lesser extent since 2020, has produced a very undesirable tension between the parties and may well have contributed to the difficulties in the relationship between the wife and A. Whilst DJ Jenkins found that the wife often found somewhere else to stay to get away from this tense situation, he made no positive findings about an alternative full-time available home and I have not identified any other possibilities for her after hearing the evidence in the hearing before me. Further, the husband has expressly (sensibly and realistically) not sought a finding in the hearing before me that the wife has a cohabiting partner. My overall impression is that, until she has the means to secure alternative accommodation, the wife will need to occupy, and will occupy, 1 London Apartment for at least some of the time. Not only will this exacerbate the tension between the parties, it will also make it very much more difficult for the husband to make arrangements to fund a lump sum payment to the wife, as arranging the sale of 1 London Apartment, or an equity release in relation to it, will undoubtedly face real practical problems in the context of the acrimonious relationship which exists between the parties. I therefore propose to adopt the following solution to the problem. The husband will pay to the wife a lump sum of &#163;17,500 (designed to fund rental accommodation at &#163;2,500 for six months plus a deposit) on a date exactly 42 days after my order is approved on the basis that on payment of that sum the wife will simultaneously vacate 1 London Apartment (presumably to rental accommodation identified within that 42 days). This lump sum will be in addition to such other lump sum that I order him to pay. This additional order would not undermine my conclusions about the husband being able to meet his needs with what is left to him.   </p>

I have heard the parties tell me where they based themselves at different times and I have seen various documents. I have seen the information used in the CGT calculations. I have been told that the wife gained a spousal visa giving her a right to come to the UK for more than holidays in 2011, obtained permanent leave to remain in 2017 and obtained British citizenship in 2023. My conclusions on this are as follows. Between 2005 and 2011 the family home was predominantly in the Property in a European Country, though they did spend some holiday time in England, including at 2 London Apartment and the country cottage. Between 2011 and 2019 the family home was predominantly at the country cottage, though they did spend some time in the other properties. From Summer 2019 until the separation in Summer 2020 the family home was predominantly 2 London Apartment, although they did spend time at the other properties. Thus, I conclude:-</p>

Once brushed with the characterisation, even briefly, of being a family home, whatever else then happens makes no difference. She says that a pre-existing home in one party&#8217;s name at the time of the marriage, even when it remains in that party&#8217;s name, does not need to be a family home for very long to become matrimonial property and cites Lord Nicolls in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller v Miller; McFarlane v McFarlane</span> [2006] UKHL 24 in support of this proposition:<span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">The parties' matrimonial home, even if this was brought into the marriage at the outset by one of the parties, usually has a central place in any marriage.

As already noted, in principle the entitlement of each party to a share of the matrimonial property is the same however long or short the marriage may have been.&#8221; </span><span style="color:#000000">She says that there is no restriction on how many family homes can be so characterised, relying upon Roberts J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">WX v HX (Treatment of Matrimonial and Non-Matrimonial Property) </span><span style="color:#000000">[2021] EWFC 14 where, it appears, a London home and a country home were both simultaneously occupied by the family as family homes and both were treated as being matrimonial property. There is no reason why the same principle should not apply to sequential family homes as well as simultaneous family homes. Ms Staunton argues: </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF">I have not come across any case law to suggest that it is not possible to have multiple FMHs, or that property once matrimonialised can then un-matrimonialise.&#8221; </span><span style="color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF">It follows, says Ms Staunton, that the wife should have her half share of the properties which have been family homes, even if the outcome exceeds her needs.</span></p>
