D is at present subject to an interim care order (ICO) in favour of the local authority initially made by a Family Proceedings Court (the FPC) on 2 December 2011, and subsequently renewed. This followed the institution of proceeding on 29 November 2011.  D is currently living in a mother and baby foster placement in accordance with the local authority&#8217;s interim care plan. As will be apparent, the FPC acted promptly, and I have a copy of the justices&#8217; reasons for making an ICO in my papers. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In accordance with the Public Law Outline (the PLO), the local authority, undertook a number of pre-proceedings activities. In particular, it obtained a report by a consultant adult psychiatrist dated 8 November 2011, a detailed report from a registered clinical psychologist dated 12 November 2011 and what is described as an &#8220;Interim&#8221; report from an ISW (not the ISW whose report is the subject of prior authority) dated 18 November 2011. These were, in broad terms, hostile to the mother and it was essentially these documents which led the local authority to institute care proceedings. For the reasons I have already given, I do not propose to outline the nature of the proceedings, the contents of these reports or the allegations made by the local authority, save to say that they are currently contested. </p>

I was, accordingly, considerably surprised on 9 May that not only was the LSC not represented, but that no representative of the LSC was present. Instead, I received a letter from the LSC offering to deal with the matter by a telephone call with myself. This was manifestly unsatisfactory, and I copied the letter to myself for the parties to read. Eventually, and following a telephone call from the guardian&#8217;s counsel, a representative of the LSC appeared (the author of the letter to me) and informed me that the LSC received so many requests to attend court and explain themselves that, in effect, a policy decision had been taken not to attend court when asked. After some prompting from myself, the representative apologised for his non-attendance. </p>

It was an agreed letter (apart from, that is, from the agreement of the father, which was awaited). It set out the relevant dates; it sent the ISW the documents (including an indexed and paginated bundle of the court documents filed to date); it set out the local authority&#8217;s case and posed a total of some 18 questions &#8220;agreed with the parties&#8221;.  It is, on the whole, a perfectly good letter of instruction and warns the ISW against making findings of fact on disputed issues. However. it strikes me that the number of the questions posed is excessive, and some would appear to be out of the ambit of the ISW&#8217;s expertise. It is apparent that the court had little or no input into the letter and whilst it is not usually the court&#8217;s function to draft the letter of instruction, it is of the essence of good case management that the court should identify the issues on which it wants the expert to report.  </p>

It does not seem it is for me to attribute blame for the unhappy state of affairs in which the case finds itself. It remains the fact, however, that proceedings which were commenced in November 2011 remain unresolved &#8211; indeed have not even reached an IRH by May 2012. If cases are, in due course, to be completed in the time-scale envisaged by the Family Justice Review (FJR) and accepted by the Government, it is apparent that delays of the kind experienced by this case are unacceptable. </p>

To the mind of the lawyer it remains curious that an administrative body can effectively render nugatory a judicial decision taken in what the court perceives as the best interests of a child. Where the party or parties who seek to instruct an expert are publicly funded, however, there is no doubt that the LSC has the power, given to it by Parliament, to refuse to fund the instruction or to fund the instruction in part only. Moreover, the LSC undoubtedly has the power, deriving from the same source, to cap the level of fees which may be expended by the expert at a given level. That is undoubted the law. Lawyers may complain that this is an unfair state of affairs, or that they cannot find experts who will work at the rates laid down. Their remedy, if they take the view that the decision </p>

Secondly, additional material has emerged since the hearing before me, and the situation remains inchoate.

I see my function as providing guidance (if I can) both to the LSC and the parties, so that a decision can be taken by the DJ on the basis of that guidance.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">However, it needs to be said, I think, that in the High Court of the Family Division in London,  the pressure of work is such that the judge simply does not have the time (as things are at present) to master the details of  the documents  in each case. I anticipate that the same situation applies in the lower courts. In these circumstances, (notably in care proceedings in which the parties are usually all represented) it seems to me that it behoves the advocates to explain to the judge why a particular expert is required. The court is not a rubber stamp, although the pressures imposed are in danger of turning it into one.   </p>

The words do not bind the LSC or, for that matter anybody else. In addition, there must be doubt about the court&#8217;s power to make such an order. It is, in my judgment, far better to follow the words of the Regulations, particularly if the court is being asked to approve rates in excess of those allowed by the Funding Order. A copy of such an order is attached at the end of this judgment.  </p>

It is of the essence of good case management that the court should identify the issues on which it wants the expert to report. It would thus be helpful and important for the tribunal to be able to say - if it is the case and the hard pressed Tribunal with a long list has had the time - that it has read all the (relevant) papers. </p>

Once again, the reasons can be concise. Of course the solicitor seeking prior authority can go ahead regardless, and instruct the expert at the rates the expert demands, but such a suggestion, in reality, is unreal. The expert&#8217;s contract is with the solicitor, and if he or she does not recover the expert&#8217;s costs from the LSC, it is the solicitor who is liable. Given the exiguous rates of remuneration, this is a risk no solicitor is willing to take, particularly where the client is impecunious.  </p>

One of the golden rules, however, is that the instruction of an expert should not, unless it is unavoidable, hold up the progress of a case, and in particular should not abort the final hearing. If, therefore, for any reason, an expert is unavoidably instructed late in the day, he or she will need to be informed of the IRH and the likely final hearing date, with a view to his or her report being filed in advance of the latter, and, of course, preferably by the former.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It needs to be remembered. I think, that the LSC is a creature of Statute and that the rates of remuneration concerned have been laid down by Parliament. The LSC was at pains to remind me that the number of applications for prior authority had increased from 216 in November to 1,840 in March, and that the number of applications received in the period identified was 40% higher than for the same period in the previous year. I was also told that the LSC has set up a dedicated team in Cardiff to deal with all applications for prior authority for experts. It aims to process standard applications in 8 days and urgent application in 3 days. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As I have said several times in this judgment, there is no substitute for reasons. As I have said again, they need not be long or over-elaborate. For example, if the expert has to read 500 pages, all of which are relevant to his or her work, he or she should explain why they are relevant, and he or she can say that based on long experience on average he or she reads at the rate of one page a minute (or as the case may be), so that reading the papers is likely to take her a minimum of 8 hours. Similarly, if he or she needs to see the parent or the child more than once, he or she should explain <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">why</span> this is necessary in order to write a proper report. There is no substitute for reasons. It follows that if the expert&#8217;s time frame is rejected by the LSC; (a) there is a rational basis for a challenge; and (b) if the LSC&#8217;s refusal is manifestly unreasonable, there may be grounds for judicial review of the decision. </p>
