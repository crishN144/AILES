This is her fifth pregnancy. She has two daughters, H and L (now in their teens), both of whom were removed from her care. H was 10 years of age when removed and L, 9 years. The children&#8217;s social care records reveal that NR experienced difficulties with her mental health during the pregnancy with H. When NR was approximately four months pregnant with H, she attended the hospital on what is described as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;multiple occasions&#8221;,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> reporting self-harm. Following the birth of her second daughter, she was identified as suffering from post-natal depression. NR was, in this period, living with the father of the children, BG, who is a violent man who subjected her to repeated domestic violence. At the time, she was unable to understand or confront the effect of this violence on either her or the children. BG has had no contact with the children for several years. NR has experienced a miscarriage in the past and a termination of pregnancy prior to the birth of her daughters when she was 15 years of age.  </span></p>

The first, which is for the doctors, not this court, is whether the conditions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87" uk:canonical="1967 c. 87" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1967 Act</ref> are satisfied. If they are not, then that is that: the court cannot authorise, let alone direct, what, on this hypothesis, is unlawful. If, on the other hand, the conditions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87" uk:canonical="1967 c. 87" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1967 Act</ref> are satisfied, then the role of the court is to supply, on behalf of the mother, the consent which, as in the case of any other medical or surgical procedure, is a pre-requisite to the lawful performance of the procedure. In relation to this issue the ultimate determinant, as in all cases where the court is concerned with a child or an incapacitated adult, is the mother's best interests.</span></p>

In determining the mother's best interests this court is not concerned to examine those issues which, in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87" uk:canonical="1967 c. 87" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1967 Act</ref>, are a matter for doctors. But the point goes somewhat further. Since there can be no lawful termination unless the conditions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> are satisfied, and since it is a matter for the doctors to determine whether those conditions are satisfied, it follows that in addressing the question of the mother's best interests this court is entitled to proceed on the assumption that if there is to be a termination the statutory conditions are indeed satisfied. Two things flow from this. In the first place this court can proceed on the basis (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 1(1)</ref>(a) and (c)) that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, to the life of the pregnant woman or of injury to her physical or mental health or (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref>(b)) that the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to her physical or mental health. Secondly, if any of these conditions is satisfied the court is already at a position where, on the face of it, the interests of the mother may well be best served by the court authorising the termination."</span></p>

The discussion revolved around </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;termination of pregnancy&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> in its broadest and non-specific sense. NR understood what the word involved but she declined to hear anything as to what the procedure would entail at this stage for her. When I say declined to hear anything, I should emphasise that she was completely adamant that she did not want to know anything about what would actually be involved. She has, by and large, stuck to this view throughout these enquiries. This poses rather a challenge in assessing her capacity. As I have set out above, an understanding of what the termination procedures is a significant facet of evaluating P&#8217;s understanding. Of course, it is not axiomatic that a refusal to think about something infers an inability to do so. However, Dr A told me that it is the agitation caused by her mental health condition that prevents her from engaging in a consideration of what is involved in the termination. He told me that she was, in effect, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;unable&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;incapable of&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> participating.

If the treatment is not in his best interests, the court will not be able to give its consent on his behalf and it will follow that it will be lawful to withhold or withdraw it. Indeed, it will follow that it will not be lawful to give it. It also follows that (provided of course that they have acted reasonably and without negligence) the clinical team will not be in breach of any duty towards the patient if they withhold or withdraw it.&#8221;</span></p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;</span></p>

Evidentially, this is inevitably less cogent. I do not doubt that Ms F, the mental health social worker, has a good and constructive working relationship with NR. It is also clear that she likes her client, who she describes as, at times, witty, personable, loving (especially to her rescue bull terrier). She describes a person who is enthusiastic (particularly about shopping) and sometimes garrulous. However, Ms F&#8217;s file keeping is, if she will forgive me for saying so, not her strongest suit. Her statement, which was prepared with sight of the notes, did not help me achieve a real understanding of why it was that Ms F thought that NR&#8217;s strongest and most consistent view was in favour of the termination. In her statement, Ms F made the following observation: </span></p>

Whenever this was discussed prior to December 2023, she always stated that she wanted a termination, as she had not planned or wanted another baby. She has stated to me on several occasions that the pregnancy came as a complete shock to her, as she had previously tried to fall pregnant again with an ex-partner and this had not been successful. After that she was taking the oral contraceptive pill. NR told me that her medication, including her contraception, was stopped when she was discharged from mental health services in September 2023&#8221;. </span></p>

Recognising this, Ms F speculated that where the note read </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;December 2023&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">, it should have read January 2024. However, on checking the chronology of her statement, that could not possibly be right either. Mr Patel invited Ms F to check her digital case notes. She had not done so prior to giving evidence. When she interrogated the notes, she was unable to find anything of substance relating to the central issue here i.e., the termination or the continuation of the pregnancy. I emphasise that I consider Ms F to be an entirely honest witness. My view is that she had absorbed a general professional consensus, coupled with her own impressions, to arrive at the following conclusion in her report:</span></p>

Prior to the deterioration in her mental health, when I was working with her in the community, NR consistently stated that she wanted a termination. Although she has been more ambivalent since her admission to hospital, she also displays trauma from the removal of her first two children and it is evident that she is understandably very worried about this baby being removed from her care at or after the birth by Children&#8217;s Social Care. She has also expressed worry about the physical risks of giving birth. If the pregnancy was to continue, NR would be subject to parental assessments, which I do not think she could tolerate. I would also be concerned about the impact on NR&#8217;s mental health of giving birth and having another child removed&#8221;. </span></p>

She emphasises that NR depersonalises the pregnancy and has never referred to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;her baby&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> only </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;it&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">. She points to NR&#8217;s florid mental ill health at the time she made some of the reported contradictory comments. She submits that the views of the medical staff, social worker and family members are not merely that a termination is in her best interests but reflect what NR would choose for herself. Ms Hirst places very great weight on the cogency of the conversation with Ms Crow, which I have set out above.  Ms Scott is, broadly supportive of these submissions. Mr Patel has, to my mind, been rather more cautious and, if I may say so, reflective. Ultimately, and after giving the evidence a great deal of thought, I do not agree that the preponderant evidence, properly scrutinised, establishes evidence of sufficient cogency for me to conclude that NR&#8217;s wishes are for a termination. </span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Not all the reported statements by NR strike me as carrying the same weight and cogency. One that I have found particularly compelling is her remark that she loves babies and had wanted to be a midwife. I also note that when confronted with the fact of her termination at 15 years of age, she disavowed responsibility for the decision, blaming it on </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;that horrible family&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">. There is also, in my judgement, an underlaying consistency in her attitude to termination, variously characterised as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;killing&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;murder&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">. Moreover, it is important to remember that my obligation is to take account of not only NR&#8217;s expressed wishes but also of her feelings. These two are often conflated but they should not be. Evaluating the feelings of another human being, particularly one who suffers from serious mental health problems, is not and can never be easy. But it is not impossible. I note that NR told her youngest daughter, with whom she has a markedly closer relationship than the elder sibling, of the fact of the pregnancy. On 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> February 2024, NR received the scan of the baby. She kept it with her and showed it to her daughter. Miss F agreed that she did so joyfully. It is difficult to see why she would do it otherwise. She considers that she is carrying a boy and there is an underlying sense in the recordings that this is something that, in different circumstances, would cause her pleasure. What is striking to me is that all these remarks and behaviours fit seamlessly and coherently together. </span></p>

She clearly, and most probably correctly, apprehends that if she carries the baby full term, it will be removed from her at, or shortly after birth. This may even be her wish, though she plainly anticipates the possibility of  being ambushed her own emotions. Many of the notes set out above reflect NR, at very least contemplating these possibilities. Equally, she plainly contemplates a termination, even though that may not sit easily with her prevailing beliefs. Ultimately, I do not, as I have said, find that the evidence in this case supports a determined view either to terminate or to continue with the pregnancy. The evidence, in my judgement, reflects a woman who is paralysed by conflict, which is pervasive. I accept Dr A&#8217;s opinion that her unwillingness to confront the practical realities of the termination is also a facet of her mental ill health. However, NR certainly confronts the ethical and emotional aspects of both the termination and a continued pregnancy. Even if they are to be regarded as distorted by her condition, they are real for her and require to be afforded both weight and respect. I emphasise that I am entirely satisfied that it would be wrong and unsafe to draw a concluding view as to what NR&#8217;s wishes and feelings truly are. </span></p>

[Dr D] has confirmed that whilst the overarching ethos is that it is safer to terminate a pregnancy rather than force a pregnancy to term and deliver a baby against a patient&#8217;s wishes, should it not be a patient&#8217;s wish to proceed with the termination on the day, coercing and forcing a person to have a termination can do lasting harm to a patient&#8217;s mental health. Therefore, once the team have met with NR and assessed her wishes to proceed with the termination, they will begin the procedure. [Dr D] has confirmed that Homerton Hospital would be happy to have a telephone conversation with NR (supported by the RDASH team) on the evening before she travels down for the procedure in order to carry out an initial assessment of whether she wishes to go ahead with the procedure.</span></p>

She apologised to Ms Crow for blowing smoke over her. Ms Crow said that the smoke had not reached her and she could not smell the flavour. NR said that she had stopped smoking cigarettes for seven weeks.

I expressly decline to make that declaration. I do, however, approve the proposed care plan and confirm the lawfulness of it. Thus, I make a declaration that the care plan, setting out the arrangements for a termination of NR&#8217;s pregnancy is lawful. I go no further. So far, the options presented to NR have been uncoupled from the practical realities. There is now a finely structured plan where a decision, one way or the other, is unavoidable. It is important that NR knows that I am respecting her rights as an autonomous adult woman to make this decision for herself, with the help of those she chooses to be advised by. I should also like Ms Crow to explain to NR that whatever decision she takes, will have my fulsome support. As I discussed during the course of the hearing, a copy of this judgment is to be made available to all the key professionals involved in the plan in order that they know the reasoning behind the conclusions I have reached and what the objective of the plan is. </span></p>
