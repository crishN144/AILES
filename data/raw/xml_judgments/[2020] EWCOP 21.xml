What is required is that the person is able to employ the relevant information in the decision making process and determine what weight to give it relative to other information required to make the decision. Where a court is satisfied that a person is able to use and weigh the relevant information, the weight to be attached to that information in the decision making process is a matter for the decision maker. Thus, where a person is able to use and weigh the relevant information but chooses to give that information no weight when reaching the decision in question, the element of the functional test comprised by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s3(1)</ref>(c) will not be satisfied.

Ms. Dalton initially said that she was &#8220;feeling a bit lost&#8221;; then agreed with Mr. Patel&#8217;s analysis. After a somewhat confusing assertion that &#8220;I believe that in order for her to weigh up the options, [A] needs to understand why those things are being weighed up,&#8221; Ms. Dalton said that A &#8220;does understand the options, yes&#8221; but maintained her view that understanding the need for care was &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; to being able to make the choice between the options. </p>

He acknowledged the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">significant chance</span>&#8221; that A would drink alcohol again if she returned to live at home.
