	<level eId="lvl_1">
	  <heading><span style="font-style:italic">Introduction </span>There were several good reasons for arranging a three day hearing in these private law proceedings. First, to determine why, over so many years, there have been problems in achieving good quality or indeed any contact between the children and their father. Second, to establish whether there is a feasible way through the apparent deadlock between the two conflicting sides. And third to consider whether the time is right to make final orders so as to bring the litigation to a decisive end.</heading>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the case began, there was no proper basis for knowing how it would end. I had no preconceptions. As so often happens, clarity came as the case unfolded particularly when, over several hours, the parents gave their evidence. By the end of the process, it had become very straightforward indeed to identify the origins of the problems. In the result, there is no difficulty either in formulating welfare decisions for the children. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My only regret is that for what appeared to be justifiable reasons at the time, this hearing was not convened about a year ago, in the spring of 2013. The impact of the delay from the children&#8217;s perspective has been to protract an already onerous process almost beyond endurance. All I can say is that, with the benefit of hindsight, I should not have been enticed towards the model of therapeutic assessment and possible treatment. I should have set the matter down for hearing rather than pursue a process which would have been most unlikely to result in any kind of success within a timescale that was remotely acceptable from the children&#8217;s perspective.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue as to the orders which should be made at the end of the hearing is relatively narrow. It is as to whether the proceedings should be brought to an end by the making of an order for only indirect contact; or, instead, continued with provision for there to be a &#8216;family meeting&#8217; within a psychotherapeutic setting. In order to answer that question it has been altogether necessary to develop a good understanding of the reasons for the current as well as past difficulties.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The essential background is as follows &#8211; The parents married in 2000. Their children are L (a boy) who is nearly 13 years old and M (a girl) who is 9. At first the family lived in England, the mother&#8217;s home country. In August 2004, the father moved to his native Israel where he had found employment. The mother and children joined him there in November that year. The marriage was unhappy. The parents separated and then reconciled on several occasions in 2004, 2006 and 2007. In 2006, in Israel, the mother applied for a court order giving her temporary custody. Early in 2007, the father successfully applied for an injunction to prevent the mother from taking the children out of the country. In March of that year, when the parties again reconciled, the injunction was discharged.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In July 2007, the mother unilaterally removed the children from Israel and brought them here. An application for summary return under the Hague Convention was launched in June 2008. The proceedings were contested on a number of bases &#8211; habitual residence, consent, acquiescence, grave risk of psychological harm or other intolerability and the older child&#8217;s objections. Both parents were represented by specialist Counsel. In late September, at the first &#8216;final&#8217; hearing, evidence was heard from Mr Reilly of the CAFCASS High Court team. There was then an adjournment at the judge&#8217;s suggestion for the parties to consider mediation. No consensus emerged. When the application was re-listed in mid October, oral evidence was heard to elucidate the habitual residence, consent and acquiescence questions. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Macur J (as she then was) found the father to be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">impulsive, highly emotional and hot-headed with little self restraint&#8230;unreliable in his evidence in that he denies, mitigates or otherwise seeks to excuse various incidents of domestic violence. &#8220; </span>She also found that his evidence on other issues was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">largely credible and supported by extraneous facts and documents.&#8221; </span>Macur J found the mother &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">was demonstrably willing to obfuscate, lie and manipulate the evidence to her own ends; sufficiently intelligent to &#8216;see what was coming&#8217; and ameliorate her response accordingly. In that she did so &#8230; it was an act of desperation with a view to maintaining the status quo and does not or should not necessarily mark her evidence on all matters as unreliable in future proceedings.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In that part of her judgment which dealt with the &#8216;child&#8217;s objections&#8217; exception, Macur J referred to two occasions of contact &#8211; the first between the children and their father in over 12 months. A Mrs Clasby who was said to know the children and had supervised the contact, commented to Mr Reilly that the children were being damaged by both their parents and were the recipients of stories from both. The judgment relates that the children who had expressed an intense dislike of their father and had been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unable to make any positive comment or recall, quickly became relaxed in his company and enjoyed it.&#8221; </span></p>

This, suggests parental alienation at the hands of the mother or her parents. It is reprehensible behaviour. I note that the mother has amassed support for her cause from the ranks of many friends and acquaintances. There is a danger that the father becomes demonised in the child&#8217;s eye to his / her ultimate detriment.&#8221;</span></p>

The making of this decision gives the father little incentive to mediate. (He) may wish to reflect that the vindication of his action does not necessarily mean that a return to Israel will promote the overall best interests of these children. For good reason or bad they are now settled in the United Kingdom. The children remain fragile and vulnerable to events around them regardless that it is not evidenced to the extent as to engage the Article 13B exception. His relationship with them is important but his protection of welfare should be his paramount consideration.&#8221;</span> Macur J reiterated her invitation to the father to once again &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">consider his position in relation to the forum which will determine the remedy he seeks, bearing in mind the present circumstances in which the children &#8230; find themselves.&#8221;</span></p>

He was distressed, apparently depressed and had expressed a death wish claiming he was not meant to be born. In May 2009, L was examined by a child and adolescent psychiatrist in Tel Aviv; she concluded her report by saying that he was suffering from an adjustment disorder with depressional reaction. She recommended individual therapy and an end to the legal dispute, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">as soon as possible in order to provide stable surroundings for the boy</span>.&#8221;</p>

L&#8217;s emotional state did not improve. Israeli Social Services&#8217; records show that by mid December 2009, L was on the brink and was believed capable of committing suicide. Because of the children&#8217;s difficult and deteriorating condition, if there had been no agreement between the parents as to relocation, the Social Services department would have applied to the court, asking for an order as to how to protect the children&#8217;s safety. The child and adolescent psychiatrist is reported as saying that had the children remained in Israel, both would have ended up in a psychiatric ward. </p>

There was provision for extensive indirect as well as staying contact on three occasions each year in Israel. The children&#8217;s school holidays were to have been divided. If the father were to be in England, then he would see them here twice a week. It was the mother&#8217;s obligation under the agreement to present a translated version of the Israeli consensus to the English court for recognition and enforcement purposes. </p>

A direction was made for family assessment by a consultant family therapist, Dr Honig. His comprehensive report of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2013 recommended a coordinated therapeutic programme. In May 2013, I agreed to the course of counselling and therapy as suggested by the parties. The father had agreed to pay half the costs and was exploring charitable means for the balance. In October, there was a meeting with the nominated therapist, someone other than Mr Honig, who said she was unable to assist them and that he would be better placed to do so. </p>

Given that the information at this hearing has been that only &#163;1,800 is available to underwrite the cost of any such programme, it is obvious that such a scheme was not viable for anything other than an extremely short term intervention. The mother, who works only part time in relatively lowly paid employment, is quite simply unable to afford to contribute. The father who, similarly, only works part time cannot afford more than the sum already mentioned. </p>

The consequence for the litigation would be a review; and even if it takes some weeks or months that would be justified, he argues, in the children&#8217;s long term interests. </p>

All the blame, as he sees it, rests fairly and squarely with the mother for whom he had not one good word to say.

He is used to getting his own way and reacts badly when thwarted. Clearly he did not welcome the process of cross examination. Even before Miss Hughes began her questions, the father had folded his arms in a defensive action.

L, quite obviously, is a sensitive young person and has been highly anxious about the prospect of having to see his father. His psychological problems stem from the time when he was only 8 years old and in Israel against his wishes. M may have a slightly more outgoing, confident personality than L but she, too, becomes introverted and anxious when speaking of her father. L attributes the improvement in his anxiety symptoms to the absence of any contact with his father and is extremely concerned that if contact were ordered his symptoms would return.  M has recently been receiving professional support for nervous tics, experienced by her as embarrassing and stressful. Her mother described M as having had problems recently with breathing properly and an increased heart rate. It seems her symptoms are related to panic at the prospect that she might be made to see her father. Since November and in the lead up to this hearing, both children have been in a heightened state of anxiety.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In answer to the question as to whether the mother has manipulated the children and thereby alienated them from their father, I am entirely confident she has not. Whatever the situation which confronted Macur J in the autumn of 2008, there is no basis, other than in the father&#8217;s imagination, for concluding that the mother has set about a process of seeking to influence the children against their father. The reality of the situation is that by his actions over the years, as they have grown to appreciate the way in which he has sought to control events in their lives, the children have come to their own conclusions about their father&#8217;s behaviour. </p>

It is not the case that they have heard others talk about events which they have then related. </p>

They have also told Mrs Warren that their mother asks them if they would like to phone or email their father and she has said that if they wanted to see him, she would be OK about that.</p>

The mother was also very interested in Mr Honig&#8217;s view about the power of her parents&#8217; silence in relation to the father. I gained the distinct impression that she intended to go home and begin the process of enabling her own parents to talk positively and freely about the father because she now realises how beneficial that would be for the children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also significant, when considering whether there is any basis for believing the mother has been any kind of toxic influence that during the course of her evidence there were moments when she expressed spontaneous warmth towards the father. She talked about his &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">beautiful handwriting</span>,&#8221; how &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">brilliant he is at Maths which is why the children are good at it too</span>.&#8221; Likewise, as to M&#8217;s language ability which is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">thanks to her Dad</span>.&#8221; A little later on the mother spoke about how she tells the children of their father&#8217;s love for them and that he really does have a lot to offer them. She hopes that, in the future, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">things will improve and believes that birthday presents and cards would be a really good start</span>.&#8221; She also said she would &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">love to be able to discuss the children&#8217;s schools, work, religion</span>&#8221; and would value the father&#8217;s input if there could only be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">two way respect; no threats at all</span>.&#8221; </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have considered but ultimately rejected the idea of directing there should be such a meeting because, in my assessment, the children would be strongly averse to participating. In addition, they would be exposed almost certainly to more of the father&#8217;s impulsive behaviour. He may not be able to prevent himself once more denigrating the mother, openly accusing her of alienation or &#8216;brainwashing.&#8217; There would be, in all probability, nothing positive for the children as the result of such a meeting. Rather they would be caused further emotional harm and at a stage in their recovery when they are simply too vulnerable to be exposed to that risk.</p>

Ordinarily, it is very much in children&#8217;s welfare interests to be able to know their absent parent and consolidate that relationship by regular, liberal and flexible direct contact. Here there are compelling reasons for concluding that their relationship with their father should be limited to indirect contact by occasional cards, letters and presents. </p>

The nominated officer will be Mrs Warren; and it is immensely beneficial, from the children&#8217;s perspective, that CAFCASS has agreed to Mrs Warren&#8217;s appointment. I would hope that she will be able to assist the father in the exercise of writing suitable letters to the children. He needs help to make his messages appropriate and &#8216;child friendly.&#8217; There&#8217;s nothing worse than an email suggestive that the sender is shouting at you. Neither L nor M deserves to feel they are being placed under any kind of pressure to do what their father would want them to do. He has to allow them to feel they have autonomy. He must respect them and, crucially, he must show them that he respects their mother. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Writing to children of these ages is not difficult. It&#8217;s very straightforward to concentrate on those areas which will be of most interest to them. It&#8217;s been most unhelpful that in 2012 the father sought to occupy M by showing her photographs from the past. Children live in the present. They have absorbing lives filled with activities of many kinds. The father should be concentrating upon those things which interest the children rather than his own agenda. Most of all, the requirement should be for light rather than emotionally laden messages.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Lastly, just this. I&#8217;m very conscious that this judgment, in many respects, is strongly critical of the father. It has been necessary to investigate the causes of the problems and it is in that context the criticisms of him have arisen. In other circumstances, doubtless the father can be very charming. I am sure there is a softer side to his nature; and that he can be an entertaining companion both with other adults and children. Mrs Warren&#8217;s role, in part, will be to enable the father to bring those parts of his personality to the fore and to relinquish, or at least manage, his anger.</p>

There are several small acts of kindness which the father may wish to consider. He could provide the mother with occasional financial assistance for the children enabling her to purchase items she would otherwise struggle to afford. He could send the mother messages wishing her happiness at the times of Jewish holidays &#8211; Rosh Hashanah, Succot, Hannukkah and Passover. It should be straightforward for some dialogue to begin between them centred upon the children&#8217;s achievements. </p>
