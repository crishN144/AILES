His rationale for this was that the previous plan, to prevent AB from having access to sharp objects, was not workable. The new plan was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11.5pt">not</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11.5pt"> to remove razor blades (and other sharp objects) from AB, but to provide emotional support to her and use de-escalation techniques when she was using them. However, AB has used the sharp objects in attempts to sever significant vessels, including the jugular vein. The RMN therefore instructed the other mental health nurses proving care and support to AB to use restraint in circumstances when AB attempted to self-harm in significant ways such as this and on high-risk areas such as the neck, wrists and old deep wounds where there was a significant amount of blood loss. During cross examination by counsel, the RMN accepted that this change in AB&#8217;s care and support required the involvement of the MDT including a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist. </span></p>
