E is now 4 years old.  Her mother, CA, is the applicant in these proceedings.  Her father, DR, is the respondent.  The parties were in a relationship from 2012 and shared a home together from 2014 when DR&#8217;s previous marriage ended.  E was born in December 2016.  Their relationship ended in April 2019 at which point CA and E moved into separate accommodation on the site of the property they had been sharing.  In order to respect the private nature of these proceedings, I propose to refer to the parties in this judgment as &#8220;the mother&#8221; and &#8220;the father&#8221;.  In so doing, I would want each of them to know that I have had the opportunity over the course of two days to see and hear each of them as individuals and as parents.  The anonymity which I seek to confer on the family does not detract at all from the central role each has played in this hearing, nor the importance which I have attached to the evidence which I heard.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">These proceedings were issued in August 2019.  Following an unsuccessful attempt to settle matters at a private FDR, the matter was allocated to a High Court Judge for final hearing.  That step was taken by order of District Judge Hudd at a hearing on 13 March 2020.  Her order records her reasons for that allocation in these terms:- </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">That allocation has inevitably led to delay in listing this final hearing.  The parties have been unable to agree the appropriate level of financial provision which should be made available for E&#8217;s benefit.  In addition, Mr Mitchell QC, who appears for the mother, seeks as part of that raft of provision an uplift in her budget which will enable her to make provision for her retirement in the form of a private pension.  On her proposal, the father will be required to make a financial contribution to that pension fund over the course of the next 14 or 17 years through the periodical payments which he makes for E.  Mr Leech QC, who represents the father, maintains that the court has no jurisdiction to make such an order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">It is unfortunate that there has been further delay in achieving a resolution for these parties.  Their relationship as parents has been severely compromised by the acrimony amidst which their personal relationship broke down.  There appears to be little effective communication between them since these proceedings were issued.  Of much greater concern is the fact that E has not had any meaningful contact with her father during the entire course of these proceedings.  The time has now come to put in place the financial arrangements which will enable E and her mother to move to a home of their own where they can begin to put down roots for their future.  It is agreed for these purposes that they should move back to the Kent area where the mother has family and friends. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The father is now 49.  He has two children from a previous marriage who are now 15 and 10 years old (B and I).  He has played a very full role in caring for those children over the years as a result of their mother&#8217;s fragile health.  He describes himself as a &#8220;hands on&#8221; father and that was certainly the impression I formed as I listened to his oral evidence.  He has had the great good fortune to have generated considerable wealth as the result of his entrepreneurial activities as a younger man.  Whilst he has a number of commercial activities, he is now free to organise his life as he wishes.  In addition to the philanthropic causes which he espouses, he has a lifelong passion for motorsport and racing.  He travels regularly to Europe to take part in races and has built up a collection of vehicles which is now worth tens of millions.  His wealth, now put at c. &#163;190 million, and the income which it generates has enabled him in these proceedings to run the socalled &#8220;millionaire&#8217;s defence&#8221;.  Whilst he has provided a significant amount of disclosure during the course of these proceedings, he accepts in terms that he can afford to meet any reasonable order which this court might make. </p>

She had a significant amount of involvement with B and I when she was living with the father and she describes them as &#8220;lovely children&#8221;.  When she started her relationship with the father, she owned a business which supplied staff for events, principally within the motor sports industry.  She has not worked since she moved in with the father.  Since E&#8217;s birth, she has been a full-time carer for their child.  She is a devoted mother who appears to have made a very significant investment in E&#8217;s upbringing to date. E was a planned and much wanted child although it is clear from the parties&#8217; evidence that her birth created a distance between them which eventually led to the breakdown of their relationship. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">It is the mother&#8217;s case that there were few, if any, financial constraints upon their spending and the lifestyle choices which they made.  She points to international travel by private jet with holidays in top-end villas or the most expensive hotel suites.  The father&#8217;s chosen means of transport is his helicopter which he uses to get around the country and beyond for the purposes of his racing commitments.  The home which they shared whilst they lived together is a substantial and impressive property in the middle of what has been described as &#8216;Cheshire&#8217;s &#8220;Golden Triangle&#8221;&#8217;.  It is a Grade II-listed property which sits in about one and a half acres in the middle of a local town. It has a value of some &#163;4.36 million and is currently the subject of a major building project which is costing somewhere in the region of &#163;2.5 million.  As a result, the father, with his two children, are currently living in a rented property, the details of which have been put before the court.  He appears to be paying &#163;12,500 per month (&#163;150,000 per annum) for that property. </p>

Up to that point, it had been used as an &#8220;overspill&#8221; for the main house.  It has bedroom accommodation and kitchen facilities but it appears that one of its main functions was the amenity value of the separate gym.  It has not been ideal accommodation for either the mother or E and both parties agree that it will be essential to find and buy a property in Kent by the end of this summer so that E can start at her new school in the September term of this year. </p>

She is, in reality, entirely dependent upon the father to provide financially for her and E for the foreseeable future.  He accepts that obligation in principle.  I propose to defer any consideration of her future earning capacity to a later stage of my judgment.  At this stage I need only say that the father accepts that she should be entitled to earn in future without that income having any impact on his financial obligations to provide child support for E. </p>

Thus, where resources permit, there is likely to be some correlation between a paying party&#8217;s standard of living and the level of financial provision which the other parent, as carer, can expect to receive.

In order to discharge this responsibility, the carer must have control of a budget that reflects her position and the position of the father, both social and financial.  On the one hand she should not be burdened with unnecessary financial anxiety or have to resort to parsimony when the other parent chooses to live lavishly.  On the other hand whatever is provided is there to be spent at the expiration of the year for which it is provided.  There can be no slack to enable the recipient to fund a pension or an endowment policy or otherwise to put money away for a rainy day. &#8230;.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Those judges sitting in the Family Division who deal with these cases on a regular basis are well-equipped to exercise the statutory discretion entrusted to them by Schedule 1 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.  Over the years since <span style="font-style:italic">Re P</span>, cases involving very significant financial resources have been determined on a regular basis.  This father has accumulated significant wealth at a relatively young age and his current lifestyle clearly reflects the absence of any real financial constraint on the choices which he makes.  That said, this case is not unusual in terms of the extent of that wealth.  I heard evidence from each of these parties in relation to the lifestyle which they shared during the period in which they lived together both before and after E was born.  There is a clear divide between them as to the extent to which the father embraced the lifestyle which the mother describes.  They are different people with different aspirations.  He has the financial resources to devote much of his time to his passion for racing and motorsport.  That lifestyle brings with it many of the trappings of glamour and wealth.  He finds it easier to fly himself to race venues, both here and abroad, in his private helicopter.  He has employees who do what might be described as the &#8216;leg-work&#8217; of ensuring that his vehicles are transported to wherever they need to be at any given time.  He is accommodated at these races in a </p>

I am told that it cost between &#8364;800,000 and &#8364;900,000.  He employs a personal assistant who looks after all the arrangements for his travel and accommodation.  When he is not travelling in his helicopter, he accepts that the demands of his business life mean that travel by private jet is the most convenient form of transport.  He has taken his elder two children on occasions to race meetings.  They have been a part of this lifestyle and they share the home in which this father lives for half (possibly more) of their day-to-day existence. </p>

He owns what appears to be a very modest holiday home in Wales.  It had been his grandmother&#8217;s home and he acquired it on her death in order to preserve the simple childhood memories he had experienced growing up in those surroundings.  He told me that he and his elder children frequently make the hour-or-so drive to the property at weekends in order to enjoy time there.  These weekends are more often than not spent riding bicycles in the surrounding countryside. </p>

He described their life with him as being &#8216;grounded and ordinary&#8217;.  He regularly cooks for them and, if they eat out, they visit local Thai and Indian restaurants.  The children had not been on a long-haul holiday with him for over six years.  They move perfectly happily between their own parents&#8217; two homes and I had the clear impression from the father&#8217;s evidence that he provided excellent &#8216;hands-on&#8217; care for them.  He has full responsibility for the children during the time they spend in his care.  He takes them to school and he supervises homework and the like when their school day ends.  He prioritises healthy outdoor activities when they share leisure time together.  I accept what he told me: he is not a man who would choose to spend time in the shops of Bond Street or to eat regularly in Michelin-starred restaurants.  He has a beautiful home into which he is investing significant sums of money in order to provide additional storage facilities for his car collection and underground sports facilities.  In many respects, he is a man of contrasts albeit one who enjoys the significant privilege of choice in terms of the life he leads.  </p>

The property in which the father lives is clearly an impressive and lovely home as I have acknowledged.  However, I do not accept that it had some of the separate bespoke facilities which the mother described (a separate art room, an in-built climbing wall and a designated music room).  All of these activities were undertaken in the house, I have no doubt but I felt at times that there was a degree of overlay in the mother&#8217;s attempts to impress upon me quite how extraordinary her life with the father had been. </p>

I felt that he had given me a clear view of how he lives his life in each of its spheres.  He is passionate about his motor racing and accepts that this aspect of his life, and its cost to maintain, is both a privilege and a luxury.  His life at home with his children is lived at a different pace.  He is careful not to spoil them.  He wants them to understand the value of money.  He is alive to the need to make appropriate financial provision for E and her mother.  He sees his offer of &#163;1 million for housing as a significant sum of money given the type of accommodation which would be available to her in Kent.  He accepts that E needs a comfortable home with at least four bedrooms with decent outside space in a location where she can easily travel to school without a long commute. </p>

It is common ground in line with previous authorities and the guidance from higher courts that any property purchased by the father for the occupation of the mother and E will remain his property.   Her rights of occupation in that home will be protected throughout the duration of E&#8217;s dependency.  It is agreed in this case that the property will remain available to them both as a home until E completes her first degree at university if that is the path which she chooses in life.

The mother provided examples of five separate properties in February 2020 at the same time as she indicated she wished to relocate to Kent.  These range in price from &#163;1.2 million to her preferred choice at the time which was a property costing &#163;2 million.  Two of her other properties were being offered for sale at &#163;1.45 million and &#163;1.75 million.  In terms of size, they appear to be between 3,000 and 5,000 square feet.  Some have more than 4 bedrooms.  Some have land, equestrian facilities (of sorts), outbuildings and/or a swimming pool.  In the main they are village-based or in the countryside away from the main towns in the county.  Each appears to be a solid, comfortable family home although the style of building varies from contemporary to traditional. </p>

At the time when the parties physically separated in April 2019, the mother identified a home in the Alderley Edge area of Cheshire which she wished to purchase as a separate home for herself and E.  The property was called Broome House.  The property was on the market for &#163;2.15 million in 2019.  It was a substantial property which appeared to be under development.  The plans provided for the addition of a separate complex housing a swimming pool and a gym.  The property had five double bedrooms (three of which had en-suite bathrooms).  In addition to the usual reception rooms, there was a separate study and media room.  The property appeared to be fitted out to a high specification. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">At that point in time, the mother was asking the father to buy the property for her and E outright.  In other words, she sought outright ownership of the legal title.  There were clearly discussions between them at the time.  The father maintains that, such was the atmosphere within their home at that point, he was desperate to achieve a physical separation.  I know not what was discussed between them.  He told me during the course of his oral evidence that he had not seen the house.  He did not at any stage give his consent to an arrangement that the property would be acquired or transferred into the mother&#8217;s sole name.  What is clear from the evidence before the court is that the mother instructed a conveyancing solicitor.  An email from that solicitor dated 9 April 2019 confirms that she was instructed to act in connection with the purchase of Broome House in the mother&#8217;s sole name.  To this end, it appears that the father did indeed provide a sum of &#163;50,000 to secure that property.  A draft Deed of Gift was prepared by the solicitor on the mother&#8217;s instructions.  That transaction did not proceed but the father&#8217;s apparent acceptance that this was a suitable home for them both has no doubt created a certain level of expectation in this mother&#8217;s mind.  As the father points out, there is a significant difference in the price of property between this particular area of Cheshire and South-East Kent. </p>

In my judgment, a property like St Quentin, the new-build which the mother described to me in some detail following her inspection, meets most, if not all, of the requirements which the parties have between them identified.  It is likely to be fairly low-maintenance and is covered in any event by a 10-year warranty.  It is an attractive home which has all the accommodation which the mother requires.  It has the outside space which E needs and I had the distinct impression that the mother would be happy to live there. With an asking price of &#163;1.6 million, it exceeds the upper limit of the father&#8217;s bracket by some &#163;400,000 and falls below the mother&#8217;s stated target by a similar amount.

Depending on the purchase price which the parties are able to negotiate, the tax may be less with a corresponding reduction in the likely conveyancing costs.

He will wish to satisfy himself that it has all the appropriate amenities which she will need.  That said, at the end of the day this property will be the mother&#8217;s home for a number of years to come.  It will not be the father&#8217;s home.  The process of choosing her home will be an important part of the mother&#8217;s future happiness in that home.  I have every confidence in her as E&#8217;s mother to make that choice with their daughter&#8217;s needs much to the forefront of her decision.  The father has every right to object if there are genuine issues with the property which are likely to persuade the court that her choice represents a poor investment in financial terms.  He must, of course, be kept informed in relation to the property search but I regard the prospect of a <span style="font-style:italic">joint </span>search, even on the basis that one of the father&#8217;s representatives acts as his agent for these purposes, to be a recipe for discord and delay.  Accordingly, subject to that caveat, I propose to leave the identification and choice of the new property to the mother although nothing would please me more than to think they might, as parents, be able to communicate effectively about that choice.   </p>

In the normal course of events, the capital settlement which he will be making will come to an end on E&#8217;s attaining the age of 18 years or completing her tertiary education.  The mother has asked him to agree to extend her rights of occupation for a full year after E completes her full-time education.  The father has agreed that she should be entitled to stay at the property until the September in the year when E finishes fulltime education, whether school or university.  On her behalf, Mr Mitchell QC seeks to argue that she will at that stage have to seek some form of employment which is likely to include a period of probation and/or training.  I take the view that her path to work and a degree of financial independence is likely to start in one form or another long before that point in time.  I shall come to the mother&#8217;s evidence about the future shortly.  However, for these purposes I have reached the conclusion that there is nothing exceptional about this case.  The father&#8217;s obligation is to maintain a home for E and her mother whilst she remains a minor and/or in full-time education.  Knowing what I do about the nurture this child is likely to receive in her formative years, it may well be that she will wish to continue in some form of education beyond her first degree.  That possibility alone does not propel this case into the realms of exceptionality.  I take the view that the father&#8217;s offer of a period of three months after her graduation is a reasonable one.  The sale of the property will be postponed until that point in time. </p>

The parties are agreed that the father should provide, or pay for, a suitable vehicle and that a replacement will be required every four years during the course of E&#8217;s dependency.  The mother wants a Range Rover at a cost of &#163;110,000.  The father suggests something more modest in the region of &#163;50,000 to &#163;60,000. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The father maintains that the most cost-efficient means of providing the mother with a car is to lease a new vehicle every four years thereby avoiding the financial impact of depreciation and ensuring that all maintenance and service charges are met.  I agree that this is a sensible means of financing the vehicle.  I was not provided with any evidence in relation to what the annual cost of this type of arrangement might be.  Given that the father himself owns a number of Range Rovers (not all of them new) and given the investment which he has made over the years in his car collection, I do not consider it unreasonable for the mother to seek provision for a Range Rover or a similar vehicle for herself.  If this is provided through the mechanism of a leasing arrangement, it will not involve a significant capital outlay for the father.  Rather it is an annual or monthly expense which can be met from his very substantial income resources.  I consider it entirely reasonable that he should be required to meet these leasing costs for the sort of vehicle which the mother seeks up to a value of &#163;110,000 (index-linked every four years).  Whether he meets these costs separately or as part of his maintenance obligations will depend to an extent on whether she is able to set up an appropriate leasing arrangement in her sole name.  I see no reason why she should not given that she will be living in a mortgage free home with a substantial level of income through the periodical payments which the father will be making for E&#8217;s benefit.  However, if she cannot procure the necessary leasing contract in her sole name, the obligation will lie with the father to take on that obligation for her benefit.  Since neither will own the car, it matters not in my view in whose name the lease is taken out.  The choice and specification of the vehicle up to the prescribed limit will be the mother&#8217;s. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In terms of the last vehicle, the father&#8217;s proposal is that it should be acquired on hire purchase in order that, if she wishes, the mother can take over the cost (and the final balloon payment) at the end of E&#8217;s dependency if she so wishes.  On behalf of his client, Mr Mitchell QC asks me to consider making a separate lump sum order to cover any outstanding finance on the last car when E&#8217;s maintenance terminates.  We are looking many years ahead at this point in time.  I cannot know now what the mother&#8217;s financial position might be at that stage but I am satisfied that she is not a woman who will enter this new stage of her life without having put in place a plan for her own financial selfsufficiency.  The father&#8217;s legal obligation is to support her and E financially until such time as their child attains her majority or ceases full-time education to the end of her first degree.  I do not consider it appropriate to require him now to perpetuate his financial support beyond that point in time.  Whilst it will be a matter for the parties to decide how the final vehicle is to be provided (i.e. whether on a lease or hire purchase agreement and in whose name), I am not going to require him to pay a further lump sum to extract the vehicle from that financial arrangement.  I hope and expect that the arrangements which the mother will have made by that point in time will give her the opportunity, if she wishes, to keep the vehicle or acquire another. </p>

Given the generous allowance I have made for the provision of her main vehicle, this is unnecessary expenditure which is not for the father&#8217;s account.

It includes just under &#163;14,500 per annum for private tuition in French, swimming, ballet, horse riding and singing.  With some justification, the father has queried the need for this amount of extra-curricular activity once E is at full-time school given the opportunities which will arise for her there.  The mother seeks to spend a further &#163;8,200 each year on eating out, going to cinemas, museums and the like and visiting attractions.  It seems to me that each of these two elements of her budget for E is excessive.  No one would wish to prevent this little girl from taking every opportunity available to her to expand her horizons and learn new skills but, as the father points out, there are only so many waking hours in her day.  She will have a very full life at her new school and the father will be making provision for extras on the school bill in any event.

It is agreed that the discretion which I exercise in the context of an appropriate budget for their joint household is wide and that I should paint with a broad brush.  I have reached a clear conclusion that a budget of &#163;12,500 per month or &#163;150,000 per annum in mortgage free accommodation will provide the mother and E with a good standard of living without penalising the father for some of her more excessive requirements.  Even making full allowance for the ongoing cost of E&#8217;s private education, it is an expense which he can easily meet from a gross income which he accepts to be &#163;3.8 million.  He will, in addition, be meeting the costs of providing her with a car on an annual rolling basis.  In my judgment, this package of financial provision will ensure that E enjoys a standard of living which reflects his own lifestyle choices and the manner in which he has chosen to live with his other two children whilst acknowledging, as I must, that these are not matrimonial claims but Schedule 1 claims advanced on behalf of a child whose parents chose not to undertake the commitment of marriage. </p>

Whilst it is true that her written evidence is focussed upon her ongoing commitment to E and her wish to be available to her without the additional demands of paid employment, she acknowledges that she will inevitably need to look to her own future when E is a little older and more independent.

I do not know what this mother might eventually earn or whether that income will come from employment or some form of business enterprise.  She strikes me as a capable and resourceful woman and I suspect that in time, with this litigation behind her, she will want to engage in some form of financially remunerative activity if only for her own satisfaction.  E is going to be at school on a full-time basis within a year or two and, however committed the mother may be to becoming part of her school community, she is going to have time on her hands.  I accept that she has not worked for several years and may need some form of retraining in future.  I cannot predict at this stage whether or not she will have become financially independent by the time the support she receives from the father for E comes to an end.  That support will provide her with a secure platform from which to think about, and plan for, her own future.  The father has agreed, quite properly, that he will not seek to reduce the level of support he provides for E in the event that the mother starts to earn an income of her own. </p>
