At all material times, therefore, he has been habitually resident there.  It is the mother&#8217;s case that the parties&#8217; marriage was marked by episodes of domestic violence perpetrated on her by the father.

In August 2016, the mother brought D to the United Kingdom ostensibly for a two week holiday.  The father agreed to the trip on that basis and even drove the mother and D to the airport.  On 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August 2016, however, the mother sent a text message to the father telling him that she was not returning.

His hope was that D would be returned to Cyprus before the start of the school term on 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2016, but that did not happen.

At the same hearing, the District Judge made a prohibited steps order preventing the father from removing D from the care of the mother.  </span></p>

However, each case has to be considered on its circumstances and welfare is the paramount consideration. For the purposes of this assessment, I take the mother&#8217;s reports of violence at their highest.  The father has subjected the mother to threatening communications here which necessitated the intervention of the police who have a statutory duty to protect, to intervene, and have classified the risk of harm as &#8216;high&#8217;.

The most that can be said is that the Judge may find it convenient to start from the proposition that it is likely to be better for a child to return to his own country for any disputes to be decided there.  The case against that has to remain that the weight which can or should be given to that starting point varies enormously depending on the context and the specific nature of the case.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">On behalf of the mother, Ms. Lanson submits that it is clear that, whilst it is clear that the child misses his life in Northern Cyprus, that is not enough to justify an order for return.  The court needs to balance the risk to the child in experiencing harm coming to his mother or the stress of anxiety that she would experience if ordered to return against the benefits of a return.  The court in Northern Cyprus has already adjudicated on the matter of the child&#8217;s residence determining that he should live with the mother with visiting contact to the father.  In the event that no order for return is made, the child will benefit from a closer relationship with his maternal family in this country whilst still being able to maintain a relationship with his father who is a man of means and able to afford to fly over to see him.  </span></p>

However, as </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt">Re J</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> confirms, the court does have power under the inherent jurisdiction, applying the welfare principle, to order the immediate return of a child without a full welfare investigation.  This court has carried out what I hope has been a swift, realistic and unsentimental assessment of the child&#8217;s best interests starting from the proposition that it is likely to be in his best interests to be returned to Northern Cyprus so that disputes about his future can be resolved there.  </span></p>
