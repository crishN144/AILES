Separately, Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division, has made welfare decisions on disputed issues over medical treatment in July 2021; for a brief period, Zoe was a Ward of the English High Court but the wardship was discharged in October 2022.</p>

He initially instructed solicitors, Mills &amp; Reeve, then in 2022 moved his instructions to Hughes Fowler Carruthers.  Throughout this period, he has been represented at hearings by experienced counsel, all experts in the field, including Alexis Campbell KC and Marina Faggionato.  He has filed extensive evidence and a reasonably detailed Form E.  He was legally represented by solicitors and counsel at the pre-trial review only a little over four weeks ago.  I have found his contributions &#8211; evidentially and through counsel &#8211; to be extremely helpful.</p>

My main priority is the well-being of [Zoe], and I want our daughter to have a safe, secure life surrounded by both of us and her loving families. I am saddened and disappointed that you have kept [Zoe] from me and her family in the United States. I feel that you have used [Zoe] as a pawn to extract money from me while denying [Zoe] the opportunity to have a meaningful relationship with me.  In the interim, I will continue paying maintenance at the current level until further notice. I understand that you must give notice by March 10 whether to renew your lease. The flat was always unaffordable and I will not fund rent at that level. If you chose to rent a less expensive flat, I will provide a moving fund.</p>

He must appreciate that I have been denied the benefit of true forensic engagement on the important issues raised by this application.  By virtue of the fact that the mother alone attended for the hearing, with her assemblage of lawyers, the presentation of the material has been inevitably one-sided.  Having heard oral argument, and brief evidence from the mother, and having reviewed the documentary material filed, I reserved judgment and here set out my reasoning fully.

The starting point for the judge should be to decide, at least generically, the home that the respondent must provide for the child. The value, the size, and the location of the home all bear upon the reasonable capital cost of furnishing and equipping it as well as upon future income needs, directly in the case of outgoings but also indirectly in the case of external expenditure such as travel, education, and perhaps even holidays. The home will ordinarily be transiently required during the child's minority or until further order. The appropriate legal mechanism is therefore a settlement of property order. Since the respondent is entitled to the reversion, which in certain circumstances may fall in before the child's majority, the respondent must have some right to veto an unsuitable investment.</span></p>

Invariably the applicant's budget hovers somewhere between the generous and the extravagant. Invariably the respondent's budget expresses parsimony. These arts have been developed in Matrimonial Causes Act claims, particularly where the budget is advanced to found the calculation of the price of the clean break. But it is worth emphasising the trite point that, by contrast, an order for periodical payments is always variable and will generally have to be revisited to reflect both relevant changes of circumstance and also the factor of inflation. Therefore in my judgment the court should discourage undue bickering over budgets. What is required is a broad common-sense assessment. What the court first ordains may have a comparatively brief life before a review is claimed by one or other party.&#8221;</span></p>

The respondent will often accept with equanimity elements within the claim that are incapable of benefiting the applicant (for instance school fees or children's clothing) but payments which the respondent may see as more for the benefit of the applicant than the child are likely to be bitterly resisted. Thus there is an inevitable tension between the two propositions, both correct in law, first that the applicant has no personal entitlement, second that she is entitled to an allowance as the child's primary carer. Balancing this tension may be difficult in individual cases. In my judgment the mother's entitlement to an allowance as the primary carer (an expression which I stress) </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">may be checked but not diminished by the absence of any direct claim in law</span><span style="color:#000000">.</span></p>

In order to discharge this responsibility the carer must have control of a budget that reflects her position and the position of the father, both social and financial. On the one hand she should not be burdened with unnecessary financial anxiety or have to resort to parsimony when the other parent chooses to live lavishly. On the other hand whatever is provided is there to be spent at the expiration of the year for which it is provided. There can be no slack to enable the recipient to fund a pension or an endowment policy or otherwise to put money away for a rainy day. In some cases it may be appropriate for the court to expect the mother to keep relatively detailed accounts of her outgoings and expenditure in the first and then in succeeding years of receipt. Such evidence would obviously be highly relevant to the determination of any application for either upward or downward variation.&#8221;</span></p>

However, that is not to say that the court may dispense with any budget and sanction an award supportive of a lavish lifestyle devoid of context to the relevant child&#8217;s circumstances as is argued on behalf of this appellant. The court is responsible for ensuring appropriate financial support for the child and must confine the aspect of the carer&#8217;s allowance within the award to its legitimate purpose. The most casual analysis of a proposed budgetary allowance for a five-year-old child which includes membership of Annabel&#8217;s nightclub reveals the exaggeration of the claim to compensate or benefit the previous partner in their own right and not as carer for the child.</p>

Children who suffer from Williams Syndrome may have a range of medical issues which can impact on their development and wellbeing: renal and cardiac problems, raised blood pressure, high calcium levels, joint and muscle problems (including hernias) and/or dental abnormalities.  Features may include a distinctive facial appearance.  Most children have mild to moderate learning difficulties with general IQ scores between 40-60 (Martens et al., 2008), although there is significant variation in the results of IQ subtests.  People with Williams Syndrome are said to have sociable personalities, characteristic behavioural traits and variable degrees of learning disability.</span></p>

She continues to present her case unapologetically high and in so doing she heavily relies upon the extreme wealth of the father and his standard of living.

She has produced many photographs of the luxurious home where he lives in the USA; the Form E reveals that it is worth more than $35m, but I note that it is/was subject to sizeable mortgage.  The mother references the father&#8217;s use of a private jet, his lavish entertaining, his staff support including &#8220;world-class&#8221; chefs and a butler reputedly earning $250,000pa.  She points to the fact that his monthly &#8216;housekeeping&#8217; budget for himself and his staff/guests is &#163;78,007.52 (per the father&#8217;s Form E: December 2020); his monthly outgoings (ibid.) overall are c.&#163;180,000.

In support of her claim for Zoe, the mother further points, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, to a package of financial support which the parties were negotiating as a form of pre-nuptial settlement, in the event that she and (the yet unborn Zoe) had returned to and/or remained living in the USA.

In conducting the discretionary exercise under Schedule 1 in this case, I can confirm that Zoe&#8217;s welfare is and has been my &#8216;constant influence&#8217; (per </span><span class="para2text1" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">Re P </span><span class="para2text1" style="color:initial">above).   As I hope that I have made clear through my judgment (see in particular &#167;31 to &#167;38 above), Zoe is a very special little girl in so many ways.  Her medical condition (Williams Syndrome) will be a life-long condition for her; the syndrome will affect, and in all likelihood materially inhibit, her development in many ways as she progresses through childhood.  I am satisfied from all I have read &#8211; both generically about the condition and specifically about Zoe &#8211; that Zoe will require particularly special care over the course of her childhood in the home and at school.  It is reasonable to assume that the condition will further limit Zoe&#8217;s choices in life, and her facility for independence, as an adult.    These are all difficult issues for both parents to absorb.  </span></p>

I can reassure him that I have been so careful.  That said, picking through the mother&#8217;s budget has been a complex exercise (see &#167;72-75 below); in this case, as in many of its type, it has not been easy, nor would it have been altogether appropriate, strictly to apportion the budget in such a way as to isolate only those matters which are referable to expenditure on the child.</span></p>

I found in 2020 that she had launched her claim for Zoe with unrealistic expectations and disproportionate and inflated figures in her proposed interim budget and said so (see [45] [<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2020/80" uk:canonical="[2020] EWFC 80" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">2020 EWFC 80</ref>)<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="10">

In this respect I explicitly reject his case that the mother and Zoe should rent long-term.   As it happens, it seems to me that the mother might well have sought to present a case that Zoe is so overwhelmingly likely to be long-term dependent, given her special needs, that she should therefore receive a lump sum in her own right now as a housing fund.  The mother has not presented the case in this way, perhaps because of Zoe&#8217;s very young age and uncertain prognosis.  </span></p>

It is accepted, of course, that the property </span><span style="color:#000000">will not become the mother's home. It is proposed, in this particular case, that the property would be purchased and owned by the father with an arrangement providing for the terms of occupation by Zoe and the mother governed by trust deed, or lease.  In this way, the mother would have the benefit of living there during Zoe&#8217;s childhood and for as long as she is Zoe&#8217;s carer, but it would be settled for the benefit of Zoe.  It will be apparent that the father can fully expect to regain his capital asset at the end of the period, probably enhanced in value; it is in this sense merely a loan of resources by the father for the benefit of Zoe rather than an outright payment.</span></p>

Both parties did so.   The mother has presented particulars of several properties in the St John&#8217;s Wood area; she has chosen this area as it is close to where she is currently living, and close to Zoe&#8217;s school.  At this hearing, Mr Thorpe and the mother have talked me through the properties.  The mother says that she needs &#8220;approximately &#163;4m&#8221;; all of the properties are in this financial territory.  The father&#8217;s proposed properties (in the region of &#163;1.6m), are in the main apartments and are of a different calibre altogether. The mother has viewed the properties proposed by the father, and has taken photographs which I have seen.  I am satisfied that the father has significantly underestimated the proper provision for Zoe in this regard; he will require little persuading, I apprehend, that his proposed accommodation for Zoe was not just &#8216;out of kilter&#8217; with his own home but several leagues different.</span></p>

The mother currently says that she needs &#163;4m or &#8220;approximately&#8221; &#163;4m to purchase suitable accommodation for herself and Zoe.  At the conclusion of her evidence and argument I was left unpersuaded of this.  The mother and her lawyers chose to show me only properties at the &#163;4m mark, and none cheaper so that I could make any comparison; for sure, the &#163;4m properties were luxurious and not at all out of kilter with the father&#8217;s standard of living.  To be clear, I was equally unpersuaded by the father&#8217;s proposal as I have already indicated (see &#167;47 and &#167;61 above).  Although I have no details of properties priced in between the figures proposed by the mother and those proposed by the father, I have reached the conclusion that the sum which the mother </span><span class="para2text1" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">initially</span><span class="para2text1" style="color:initial"> proposed in her open letter a year ago, namely &#163;3.5m would in fact be likely to purchase an entirely suitable property which will amply meet Zoe&#8217;s needs.  I am fortified in this approach by reference to the fact that she then contemplated spending the sum &#8220;within 24 months&#8221; of her proposal (i.e., still within the next 12 months).   She had also proposed that the final sum awarded should be </span>linked to any changes in the Savills Prime London Index applicable to North West London.  Accepting this, for present purposes, as a reasonable qualification to her proposal, I shall simply increase the budget she proposed 12 months ago by &#163;150,000.  Thus, &#163;3.65m is <span class="para2text1" style="color:initial">my award under this head.  If she finds that this is insufficient to buy a suitable 3 or 4 bedroom property in St John&#8217;s Wood, I am nonetheless sure that this sum will be sufficient to enable her to buy a suitable property in a desirable part of North West London which still meets the criteria which I laid out at &#167;62 above.</span></p>

Thus, I could not help, for example, but flinch at the claim of &#163;4,800pa for toys for Zoe; &#163;2,000pa for photos of Zoe; &#163;6,000pa gym membership/yoga/massage for the mother; a salary of &#163;15,360pa for a cleaner (for a 3-4 bedroom property, where there is also a nanny working a 72hr week, who could reasonably be expected to take on some light domestic duties).  I recognise that I should not take a nit-picking approach to the budget, but instead apply a broad brush, as Bodey J exhorted in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P</span> and Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic">Collardeau-Fuchs.</span></p>

However, I am also of the view that Zoe can reasonably expect to be educated privately if the specific privately funded provision is &#8211; in the particular circumstances as they obtain from time to time &#8211; in her best interests; the father, in my judgment, ought to make funds available for this.  </span></p>

The mother&#8217;s application for an order for payment of 1:1 teacher assistant support was adjourned at the PTR to this final hearing on the basis that pending the final hearing, the father&#8217;s proposal [i.e., that he pay the costs of the 1:1 support to be employed by the nursery for the spring term 2023] was endorsed by the court.  As I earlier mentioned (&#167;43(v)) it is possible that the local education authority will make a payment from its SENIF (Special Educational Needs Inclusion Fund), but if not, I shall direct that the father augment his provision of funds for education to include the costs of 1:1 support in the schools.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be remembered that even by the First Appointment, the sum of &#163;500,000 had been spent by the parties collectively (see &#167;5 of <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2021/72" uk:canonical="[2021] EWFC 72" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWFC 72</ref>).  At this final hearing, the mother has incurred costs overall of over &#163;600,000.  At the point at which the father withdrew from the proceedings he had incurred costs of over &#163;500,000.  By the final hearing, the global value of the legal costs therefore stands at &#163;1.2m.  It is too depressing to imagine how that enormous sum of money could have been applied to benefit Zoe directly now or in the future.</p>

Thus, ordinarily, costs will follow the event; the system laid out in Part 44 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 applies.  I have made orders throughout these proceedings which have required the father to make payments to the mother for her legal costs; I am advised that the sums ordered would cover the mother&#8217;s costs.  Accordingly, I shall make no further order in relation to the mother&#8217;s costs of the proceedings.  That said, the mother must account to the father for the sum of &#163;5,000 pursuant to a costs order which I made at an interim stage of the proceedings. </p>

Judges in this jurisdiction have not been slow to make orders which will have the effect of bringing to account the defaulting father &#8211; see for instance the recent decision of Moor J in <span style="font-style:italic">Stacey v McNicholas </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2022/278" uk:canonical="[2022] EWHC 278 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWHC 278 (Fam)</ref> (a series of monthly lump sums were ordered to cover rent for the property occupied by mother and child in a CMS case where the respondent had appealed the housing order and there was therefore delay), and I should make it clear that in principle I will have little hesitation in following suit.</p>
