	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with Child A, who was born on [a date in] 2017 and is now just under 6 months old. Child A is the mother&#8217;s third child and the father&#8217;s fourth child.  The mother has a daughter Child C living with her mother in Romania and her son, Child B, who was fathered by the father, was made subject to care and placement orders.  Father has a child in Norfolk Child D and, in addition, he is the father of Child B.  Neither parent cares for any of these children.</p>

This is the local authority&#8217;s application for a care order in relation to Child A issued on 22 June 2017.  The local authority&#8217;s plan is that Child A be placed for adoption.  In summary, the local authority alleges that neither parent is capable of caring for Child A without exposing him to a realistic risk of suffering significant harm.  </p>

She is alleged to engage in prostitution, use illicit drugs, participate in criminal activities, and is in a relationship with the father which is characterised by domestic violence, a lack of stable housing, and at times homeless.  It is said that she failed to make preparations for Child A&#8217;s birth and refused to engage in antenatal care for Child A, missing all eight appointments offered to her by the UCLH midwife team.  It is alleged that she and the father deliberately sought to avoid engagement with professionals during the pregnancy.  </p>

The parents dispute some aspects of the final threshold document but accept that threshold is crossed.  The parents oppose the applications and seek the return of Child A to the care of the mother and failing that, seek placement of Child A with the father&#8217;s aunt, Mrs X, in Egypt. The guardian&#8217;s final analysis report dated 1 December 2017 is supportive of the position of the local authority for care orders and placement for Child A.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the legal framework.  The burden lies on the local authority to prove the allegations which it makes.  The appropriate standard of proof is the civil standard of the simple balance of probabilities.  I have reminded myself of <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2008/35" uk:canonical="[2008] UKHL 35" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] UKHL 35</ref> and particularly the speech of Baroness Hale.  The threshold criteria, as I have stated already, are not completely agreed but the parents accept that threshold is passed.  I therefore find that the threshold criteria set out at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> are met.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to welfare.  The next issue that I have to decide in relation to Child A&#8217;s future is whether I should approve the local authority&#8217;s care plan for him to be placed for adoption or whether there is any realistic route by which he may safely be placed in the care of his mother or anyone else.  In determining this issue, I bear firmly in mind that Child A&#8217;s welfare is my paramount concern.  I have reminded myself of the provisions of the welfare checklist which is set out at s.1(3) of the Children Act and also what is known as the &#8216;no delay&#8217; principle set out at s.1(2).  I approach the local authority&#8217;s applications on the basis that the best place for any child is within his family of origin unless there are clear welfare grounds to prefer an alternative.  My task is to consider whether Child A can be cared for by a member of his family to a satisfactory standard within an appropriate timescale and not whether he might be better off being adopted. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In analysing the local authority&#8217;s plan for Child A&#8217;s and the placement order application, I am obliged to consider whether it would accord with his welfare throughout his life to be made the subject of a placement order.  In that exercise, I am guided by the welfare checklist at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref>(c) the likely effect upon the child of having ceased to be a member of his natural birth family; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref>(e) the harm he has suffered and is at risk of suffering; and s.(4)(f) the relationship which he has with relatives and the capacity of relatives to provide him with a secure environment in which he can develop and otherwise to meet his needs.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">If I conclude that placement order accords with Child A&#8217;s welfare, I will then have to determine whether his welfare requires me to dispense with the consent of his parents to the making of such an order.  In addressing that issue, I have reminded myself of the guidance set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (Placement Orders: Parental Consent)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2008/535" uk:canonical="[2008] EWCA Civ 535" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWCA Civ 535</ref>.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I must be satisfied that any orders I make are a lawful, necessary, proportionate and reasonable response to Child A&#8217;s sad predicament.  The granting of a care order, let alone endorsing a plan for adoption, would represent a drastic curtailment of the rights of the parents and Child A under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which can only be justified by pressing concerns for the welfare of the children.  However, in construing both the Convention and also domestic law, I now have the assistance of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref>, followed by the decisions of the Court of Appeal, particularly in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1146" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1146" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1146</ref>, but also <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/963" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 963" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 963</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/965" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 965" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 965</ref>.  All of those cases re-emphasise that a placement for adoption is a very extreme thing and a last resort to be approved only when nothing else will do.  Both domestic and Convention law do require a high degree of justification before adoption can be endorsed as necessary (the term in the Convention) or required by the Adoption and Children Act.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to consider the evidence and my impression of the witnesses.  I start with MH from  the local authority&#8217;s family finding team.  He provided a statement dated 9&#160;November 2017.  In that statement, he said that, at present, there were no suitable families for Child A inhouse and investigations would need to be made to see if there were any suitable families in the north London consortium although, at that time, he understood there were not any.  He proposed to refer to the Adoption Match, which was previously known as the Adoption Register, for a full list of potential adopters.  A search that was carried out on 7&#160;November 2017 revealed 25 possible matches and a similar search with adoption link had revealed two possible families.  In his statement, he said that the local authority sought to place children for adoption within four months and would make every effort to place Child A within that timescale but accepted that in order to match him suitably with prospective adopters, this might take a little longer than that.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In his oral evidence, he explained that a prospective family for Child A had, in fact, been identified.  The prospective adoptive parents were both aged about 40 and were both professionals, both being doctors.  Their heritage was mixed, part Egyptian and Muslims, and they were open to possible indirect contact with siblings.  He said, however, that the search for adoptive parents may have to extend beyond London and outside of Child A's ethnicity, but that placing Child A for adoption had good prospects due to his very young age.  I found him to be a straightforward, honest, and clear witness.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The next witness was JH, the allocated social worker.  In her first written statement dated 21 June 2017, she set out the history of the parents and their background.  She explained that her investigations determined that the father had started to misuse drugs in or about 2008 having come to the UK in 2002, and that his drug use had continued.  He was recorded as using cocaine, heroin, crack cocaine, cannabis, steroids, and diazepam.  She noted that there was a reported history of domestic violence between the father and his previous partner, and that the father had a criminal history.  In relation to the mother, she noted that she had moved to the United Kingdom in or about January 2015 and very shortly after that was arrested for loitering with the purpose of prostitution.  There have been many further incidents of domestic violence and violence by the father.</p>

The father had been arrested on 28 September 2017 and on 19 October 2017, had pleaded guilty to one charge of burglary and not guilty to another.  She noted that the parents had not had any contact at that time with Child B since 21 August 2017 but contact was being arranged to take place on 8 November 2017.  She said the parents had not shown any development in their parenting skills and had little commitment to meeting the concerns expressed by the local authority.  They had also not made sufficient if any changes to their lifestyles and, if anything, the local authority&#8217;s concerns has heightened.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">She noted that on 13 September 2017, the parents were evicted from a council property that had been given to the mother.  The reason for this was that they had caused significant damage to the property.  They were formally evicted on 7 September 2017 but had forced entry and were evicted again on 13 September 2017.  She reported that on 28 September 2017, the father had been arrested and remanded in custody for the offences of burglary and possession of class A drugs.  She had visited the father in prison on 18&#160;October 2017 and he had spoken negatively of the mother saying they had been smoking drugs together and that she had been sex working.  In the statement, JH confirmed that the agency decision-maker at the local authority had endorsed the care plan of adoption for Child A.</p>

They only attended two of the nine appointments offered despite consistent and repeated attempts made by JH to meet with them.  She was unable to assess them on occasions when they failed to attend contact sessions with Child A.  As well as detailing thoroughly the personal histories of both parents, JH noted in her observations the way in which the father dominated their relationship and whereas the mother spoke very positively about the father, he did not speak positively about her.  </p>

She detailed the very different and conflicting explanations given by the parents for the extensive damage found at an unannounced inspection by a housing officer at the accommodation the local authority had provided to the mother.  These explanations included: looking for rats; searching for the mother&#8217;s engagement ring; and others entering the property and causing the damage.</p>

There have been a multitude of serious concerns about the ability of the parents to safely care for a child since before Child B was born which they did not address then and have not done since despite the birth of both children.  The parents have failed to demonstrate any real intention to engage in the future with professionals, to seek advice and help, and act on it.  The parents&#8217; relationship is one in which there is domestic violence between them.  The father controls and dominates the mother and is abusive to her.  The parents have and given that there is no evidence of change are likely to continue to become embroiled in violent and aggressive confrontations with others.  The parents&#8217; relationship has been one in which they have failed to secure stable accommodation and their destructive behaviour has led to them being evicted and becoming homeless.  On the balance of probabilities, I find this is likely to continue.  Neither parent currently has or is likely to have suitable accommodation in which they can safely rear and look after a child.</p>

The father has recently sought to withdraw from drugs whilst in the controlled environment of a prison, but given his longstanding and extensive use of drugs, combined with his lifestyle choices, I sadly find that, on the balance of probabilities, on his eventual release from prison, he will relapse back into drug use.  The mother is also a consistent drug user of both cocaine, cannabis, and heroin as evidenced by numerous drug tests.  I find her evidence that she has not used drugs, save for a recent one and a half to two-month period of crack cocaine use, to be deliberately untruthful.  Her refusal to be honest about her drug use means that she will not seek to address it and has no intention of doing so.</p>

The parents&#8217; failures to engage properly in these proceedings by, amongst other matters, failing to attend parenting assessment meetings, failing to meet with The Child A&#8217;s guardian, failing to attend court hearings, and failure to comply with orders to have hair strand tests has yet further demonstrated their lack of any real interest let alone commitment to Child A.  Neither parent has demonstrated any real or genuine interest in Child A&#8217;s physical or emotional needs.  They do not seek in any way to give any consideration to his needs.  Rather, they are absorbed in their own lives and prioritise their relationship over Child A.  This is perhaps poignantly demonstrated by the fact that since the father has been incarcerated, the mother has visited him three times per week, whereas throughout this period she has only been to see Child A once.</p>

Against that, he will of course, if adopted, lose direct contact with his parents and other family members.  I accept that there is a risk that if placed for adoption the placement may break down, but I consider those risks to be small.

I am satisfied that adoption offers the best way of meeting Child A&#8217;s pressing needs for permanence and security, and that the granting of a placement order will promote his welfare throughout his life.  I accept the evidence of the local authority and the guardian that this is genuinely a case where nothing else will do for Child A.</p>

Adoption will provide him with the welfare that he will need throughout his life and that his welfare requires that the requirement for the consent of the parents for Child A to be placed for adoption be dispensed with.  I accept that the effect of Child A being adopted will mean that this will lead to him losing ties with his parents but hope that he may, if possible, in the future be able to have some contact with his siblings.</p>

There will then be a final moving on contact.  Post-adoption contact will be indirect twice a year letterbox contact.

I do, however, hope that in time they will appreciate perhaps, but they have not done so yet, that the decision that I have made is not one that in ideal circumstances I would have wished to have made, but it is one that, for all the reasons I have given, I have been driven to conclude is the only viable option for Child A.  I therefore approve the final care plan of the local authority for Child A and its application that he be placed for adoption.  I therefore make both care and placement orders.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">MS GEDDES:  Sir, there was one matter that the-- on behalf of the local authority I asked you to specifically find or-- or not find.  I-- I recall you made reference to the mother&#8217;s drug use and you found that she had used drugs and you mentioned, I think, cannabis and cocaine.  I didn&#8217;t hear a mention of heroin.</p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">THE DISTRICT JUDGE:  Sorry, I correct that paragraph and ask that the transcribers, in that paragraph, add the word &#8216;heroin&#8217; as well.</p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">MS GEDDES:  Thank you.  Also, the father didn&#8217;t accept the threshold document of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>November.  It was with respect to - I don&#8217;t have the paragraph number in front of me - with respect to harm, potential harm caused to Child A through mother not attending antenatal appointments and therefore I asked for your finding as to whether or not you accepted that Child A had been harmed in utero by not being-- by mother not attending antenatal.</p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">THE DISTRICT JUDGE:  I&#8217;ve not made a specific finding on that issue because I&#8217;ve not been provided with any evidence that, on the balance of probabilities, demonstrates that he did suffer actual harm as a consequence of non-attendance by his mother at those appointments.</p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">MS GEDDES:  I&#8217;m grateful.  Thank you.  Also, during the course of the proceedings, the court and the advocates heard the father urging the mother to go to Romania with her unborn baby and I asked the court to make a note of that.  I didn&#8217;t hear mention of that and whether you would like to record in your judgment that you-- you observed and heard those comments.</p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">THE DISTRICT JUDGE:  I confirm that during the course of this final hearing that, on more than one occasion, the father said that the mother should go with her unborn baby to Romania and that he had also said that she had planned to go to Romania when pregnant with Child A but alleged that they had been persuaded that she should stay by JH.  He was consistent in saying that they had been tricked and was encouraging her, even when he was not giving evidence and was interrupting the course of proceedings, to encourage her, in effect, to abscond now.</p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in">MS GEDDES:  I&#8217;m very grateful.</p>
