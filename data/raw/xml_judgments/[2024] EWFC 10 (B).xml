She says that this was a forced marriage to which she consented only under duress. They lived together briefly in the UK but separated in 1997 or 1998.

She says that when they met the respondent knew she remained married to her first husband, and that he offered to and did support her with the paperwork for her divorce.  By the time the parties married in Bangladesh in December 2001 she believed herself to be divorced. She did not, therefore, commit bigamy (an offence which requires <span style="font-style:italic">mens rea</span>/ intent). </p>

For purely practical reasons, I declined to take that course. Three days had been set aside for this hearing, a day of which was lost due to the late arrival of relevant documents. I took the view that if I were to hear submissions on the legal issues first, and give a reasoned judgment, there would be insufficient time left to hear the evidence and make findings if that turned out to be necessary. </p>

This line of authority is connected to the legal principle that a person should not be permitted to benefit from their crime (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">ex turpi causa non oritur actio</span>&#8221;).

I observe at this point however that the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in 1995 was still firmly founded on a concept encapsulated in the term &#8220;ancillary relief&#8221;, formerly used as a shorthand for all forms of financial provision on divorce. That is, that an applicant (typically a wife) would have to come to court asking for financial provision (&#8220;relief&#8221;) to be made for her out of assets that had been generated by, and were held in the name of, her husband. As society has evolved, that concept has disappeared from the case law, to be replaced by a concept of equal sharing of &#8220;the fruits of the matrimonial partnership&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Miller v Miller; McFarlane v McFarlane</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2006/24" uk:canonical="[2006] UKHL 24" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] UKHL 24</ref>).

She had therefore to be 100% blameless in order to be sure of her conventional one-third share of his income. In theory, if she were 50% to blame, her share might be halved, although in practice the divorce courts were more flexible than that (but see, for example, the approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Ackerman v Ackerman</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1972] Fam 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1972">[1972] Fam 1</ref>, where a wife who was assessed as 25% to blame for the breakdown of the marriage was subject to a 25% discount from what she would otherwise have received). But once the assets are seen as a pool, and the couple as equal partners, then it is only equitable to take their conduct into account if one has been very much more to blame than the other.&#8221;</p>

The court has abundant discretion conferred by the statute itself and particularly s 25(2)(g), requiring the court in particular to have regard to the conduct of each of the parties if that conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it. In the case of a statutory claim that is obviously dishonourable, modern practice enables the judge to curtail the claim at an early stage in the exercise of discretion under s 25 rather than on the application of any rule of public policy.</p>

It may be said that the court&#8217;s preference to reduce the applicant&#8217;s lump sum to zero, not in the exercise of discretion and particularly the application of s 25(2)(g), but on the grounds of public policy, is in itself significant. But whilst the decision enables a strike-out application to be launched against a comparably culpable bigamist, and is indeed binding on us in such a case, I do not conclude that, as Mr Bellamy effectively decided, it establishes a rule that no bigamist is entitled to apply for ancillary relief<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span> I will endeavour to summarise my reasons for that conclusion: </p>

In particular, the rule did not permit an assessment of the merits of the application: the Court of Appeal had been wrong &#8220;to insinuate into the concept of abuse of process in Rule 4.4(1)(b) of the family rules an application for a financial order which has no real prospect of success&#8221; [per Lord Wilson at para 27]. Instead, the &#8220;touchstone&#8221; for an application to strike out was whether the application was &#8220;legally recognisable&#8221;.

There has always been an inherent jurisdiction, at any rate in the High Court, to protect the court by striking out material abusive of its process; but there is no value in today considering its extent. Paragraph (4) of r 4.4 provides that para (1) does not limit any other power of the court to strike out a statement of case but no one suggests that the deputy judge had an inherent jurisdiction to strike out which went wider than that set by para (1). In my view family courts may, like civil courts, now safely proceed on the footing that, were their power under the rules not to go so far as to enable them to strike out the statement, their inherent jurisdiction, if any, would go no further: <span style="font-style:italic">Summers v Fairclough Homes Ltd</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2012/26" uk:canonical="[2012] UKSC 26" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] UKSC 26</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 4 All ER 317" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 4 All ER 317</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 1 WLR 2004" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 1 WLR 2004</ref> at [42].&#8221;</p>

It was the respondent&#8217;s family who arranged the marriage, and the suggestion that the applicant was behind the arrangements is fanciful. I think it is unlikely that the respondent&#8217;s parents had known the parties were not yet married, although his brothers must have done &#8211; at least those who were present at the ceremony. It seems likely to me that the respondent felt very uncomfortable about bringing the applicant to the 40-day prayers without being married to her: as I have said, these parties both had respect for their families and their cultural heritage and the respondent would, I think, have felt that to act in such a way would be a betrayal of his parents at an emotional and sensitive time. The opportunity to marry in Bangladesh, where the ceremony could take place quickly and where the formalities were limited (there was, for example, no need to produce a copy of the applicant&#8217;s decree absolute) must have been tempting. </p>

I am also of the view, because it is frankly quite obvious, that the differences in the way the applicant&#8217;s name and other details appear on various pieces of official documentation are due to a combination of human error and different naming or recording conventions, and that neither party has sought to create false documents or false identities. </p>

Of course any strike-out application would have to accommodate a counter-argument that in the circumstances of the particular case an exception to the rule should be applied.

But if those arguments failed and the court determined that the public policy rule should have full effect, I am of the view that this could &#8211; in principle &#8211; result in the claim being struck out as an abuse of process, and without further consideration of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> factors.</p>

In 1995, it seems, bigamy was sufficiently grave to trigger the operation of the <span style="font-style:italic">ex turpi causa</span> rule, although the Court of Appeal did acknowledge that attitudes towards bigamy had moved on since 1603, when the penalty for the offence was death. It is not for me to express a view as to whether social attitudes to bigamy have evolved further since <span style="font-style:italic">Whiston</span> was decided and, provided that I proceed on the basis that the heart of the decision is the <span style="font-style:italic">ex turpi causa </span>principle and not this particular instance of it<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>I can decide this case without doing so. </p>
