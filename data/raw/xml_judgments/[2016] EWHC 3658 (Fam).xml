He is an Afghan national who came to the attention of the Local&#160;Authority when he was discovered at Heathrow&#160;Airport as an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child in&#160;November&#160;2015.  The Local&#160;Authority made arrangements for his care and he has been with his current foster placement since 8&#160;January&#160;2016. Care proceedings were issued on 28&#160;April&#160;2016.</span></p>

Although there is no corroborative evidence of that, the Local&#160;Authority and the Guardian have proceeded on the basis of this account.  As a result of what occurred to his father and possibly his brother, his mother, according to SK, made arrangements for him to leave Afghanistan to be able to come to this jurisdiction, which resulted in him arriving, as I have said, at Heathrow in November&#160;2015.  </span></p>

He has given some limited information in relation to people who may have assisted, but the Local&#160;Authority have been unable to pursue any of those names or details given to assist in getting any further information.  It appears that it was as a result of the mother paying an agent arranged by her to assist SK leaving Afghanistan that he was able to arrive here.</span></p>

On the information that has been provided to the court, the only method by which that could be done would be through the enquiries made by the Red&#160;Cross.  However, it is clear from the information that I have seen that even embarking on that course could place the mother in grave danger of physical harm.</span></p>

He has clearly established a good relationship with his carers and their extended family members and reports that he is able to talk to his foster carers, and enjoys the company of the older looked-after child in the placement, who is also from Afghanistan.  Therefore, he has a family environment in the foster care placement and has developed friendship groups within the local area through, in particular, his attendance at school and the friendships and integration that he has been able to have there.</span></p>

SK&#8217;s welfare is the court&#8217;s paramount consideration, bearing in mind the matters set out in the welfare&#160;checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

If the court did not make an order securing his welfare and enabling the Local&#160;Authority to exercise parental responsibility, it is very likely that he would suffer significant harm because there would be nobody to be able to make the necessary decisions for him.</span></p>
