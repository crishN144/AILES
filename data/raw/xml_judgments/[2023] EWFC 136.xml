		<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;As regards Mr Baker&#8217;s mental capacity in relation to both his finances and his capacity to represent himself in Court, I am inclined, with the benefit of the additional information now made available, to draw his broader mental capacity into greater question. It is evident from these records that when he becomes physically ill, Mr Baker&#8217;s state of mind renders him very clearly incapacitous in respect to all his responsibilities, suggesting that at best he should now be viewed as being at risk of having only &#8220;fluctuating capacity&#8221;. </p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Given the evolution of his medical conditions over the past year and its impact on his mental functioning, I am now of the opinion it would be unsafe to assume that Mr Baker&#8217;s cognitive abilities are sufficiently intact and stable at any given time for it to be assumed he is able to retain sole responsibility for his complex financial and legal affairs, to litigate current proceedings in person or as a party represented by solicitors and counsel or himself, or to give evidence in these proceedings. </p>
	      </content>
	    </subparagraph>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Mr Baker has clearly retained the ability to communicate verbally, but even though he is now relatively physically well, given the dramatic fluctuations that can occur in his cognitive abilities if he becomes ill, I think it would be in his best interest for it to be assumed he requires some oversight in respect to both his finances and his legal affairs. Such precautions, I think, are made particularly essential given the fact that Mr Baker had, two months prior to my initial assessment in December 2022, been referred to a memory clinic for diagnosis of a suspected dementia process. This, combined with his hospitalisation and associated episode of delirium less than one month prior to my initial assessment, serves to illustrate the likely trajectory. </p>
	      </content>
	    </subparagraph>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The periods of ill-health are unpredictable in terms of exact timing, but reflect systemic, dynamic problems that compromise his cognitive functioning. There is also no strong evidence he is choosing to modify life-style behaviours, such as his use of alcohol, that render him more vulnerable to mind-altering conditions such hyponatremia. As such, one could predict that the frequency and duration of incapacitous periods are likely to increase, rendering the practicalities of managing his position at any given point in the future very challenging. Whilst I cannot conclude he lacks capacity at the present time, I do believe he falls in that difficult category of individuals who have &#8220;fluctuating capacity.&#8221; This is particularly relevant if he is expected to represent himself in Court on any particular day. Such a &#8220;discrete demand&#8221; at any given time necessitates a &#8220;continuity of capacity,&#8221; as effective preparation might require several weeks of clarity prior to the event. There can be no guarantee that his thinking abilities would not fluctuate during the period in which such continuity would be essential.&#8221;</p>

	    </subparagraph>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The finding of fluctuating capacity meant that when looking at the matter &#8220;longitudinally&#8221; the husband could not be said to have capacity to conduct these proceedings, as that requires continuous capacity over a prolonged period. Whether he had the capacity to give oral evidence would depend on his state at the time. In the event, it was not suggested that he lacked capacity to give oral evidence before me, and he did so. However, when assessing his evidence I must keep in mind the findings of Dr Rogers.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties were married in 1986. There are no children of the marriage. The husband says that they separated and the marriage was over by 2000. The wife says that it endured on an intermittent basis until 2013. The parties executed a separation agreement in New York in November 2015. The wife petitioned for divorce here in May 2021, and Decree Nisi was pronounced on 27 January 2022. It has not been made absolute. Her Form A seeking financial remedies following divorce was issued on 4 June 2021.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife seeks the award of a lump sum of &#163;9.34 million. That is the sum she calculates is due to her under the separation agreement executed by the parties, following full legal advice, in New York in November 2015. The husband&#8217;s stance is that the parties&#8217;  mutual claims should all be dismissed, but that there should be no repayment to him of the maintenance pending suit paid by him.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Were such a lump sum to be awarded in favour of the wife, and were the husband to have no other assets, the result would be to leave him insolvent to the tune of &#163;3.8m. But Mr Bishop KC says that such an award would not have that effect as the husband has at least $35 million secreted. Mr Bishop KC does not pull his punches. He does not argue that the husband should be &#8220;treated&#8221; as having $35 million (&#163;27.4 million) which he has recklessly dissipated. While such a judicial add-back finding is not unknown, it is essentially fictive as it is not real money. Lady Justice King, when a puisne judge, once memorably referred to such money as &#8220;pixie money&#8221; &#8211; i.e. money that is at the bottom of the garden with the pixies.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Bishop KC strenuously rejects any suggestion that the $35 million he says should be brought into account is pixie money. He asks the court to find that it definitely exists. Where it is held, and by whom, in what shape and in what currency, may be unknown, but, he says, it definitely exists.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If that be so, then the total assets would be &#163;39 million and the award to the wife would leave her with &#163;15.2 million or 39% of the total, which is fair enough, argues Mr Bishop KC. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are no real issues of law in this case. The wife&#8217;s case stands and falls on the primary issue of fact, namely whether the husband has squirrelled away at least $35 million. If he has not, then the issue is simply what award should justly be made to the wife from the husband&#8217;s visible assets having regard to the terms of the separation agreement. That is a very straightforward exercise, and I did not hear much evidence or argument about it. The evidence and argument almost entirely revolved around the primary issue of fact. This judgment is dominated by my findings of fact on the primary issue.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence supporting the wife&#8217;s case includes some contemporaneous documents, extracted compulsorily from third parties both here and in the USA, which are at variance with the husband&#8217;s case about what assets he held, and at what values, at various historical points in time. In addition, the wife can rely on the abysmal quality of the husband&#8217;s written and oral evidence which was a combination of bluster, avoidance and dishonesty. Further, she can rely on the failure by the husband to call a key witness, Mr Neal Rotenberg, who acted as the husband&#8217;s accountant for years. If there were skeletons buried, he would have known where they were. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As against that, the husband relies on the extensive, very carefully prepared, and highly credible sworn written and oral evidence of Mr Andrew Fink, which went to the very heart of the wife&#8217;s case of non-disclosure. Mr Fink is a qualified attorney but has worked for years as an investment financier. While I do not generally place much emphasis on the quality, in terms of demeanour, of oral evidence, Mr Fink&#8217;s testimony was not only forthright, but indignantly so. It was obvious that he has no allegiance to the husband. More importantly, Mr Fink, a qualified legal professional and practising financier, had absolutely no motive to lie and to expose himself to the consequences of perjury. His evidence is in a number of respects irreconcilable with some of the key contemporaneous documents, making the court&#8217;s task when determining the primary issue of fact less than straightforward.</p>

Her evidence was generally clear and given in reasonable tones. She generally answered questions directly. In contrast the quality of the evidence of the husband was poor. He was combative, evasive, rhetorical, strident and in some respects obviously untruthful. For example, he flatly denied that the wife had a key to his home in Belgravia. Yet there is a WhatsApp message from him in which he expressly states that she has the keys to his house.</p>

		<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">However, this case is a good example of the perils of placing emphasis on the demeanour of a witness, or placing too great a reliance on a witness&#8217;s irrelevant lies or other low conduct, when finding facts or exercising a discretion. In my judgment, the demeanour of a witness when giving evidence is unlikely to be a reliable aid either to finding facts, or exercising a discretion on uncontested facts. It is not just that a dishonest witness may have a very persuasive demeanour - that is of course, the first trick in a conman&#8217;s repertoire. But the opposite side of the coin is equally problematic in that a truthful witness may unfortunately have a classically dishonest demeanour. It is obvious to me that over-reliance on the &#8220;quality&#8221; of the evidence of a witness, good or bad, can lead to facts being found, or discretion exercised, by reference to influences that are irrelevant.&#8221;</p>

		</authorialNote>, I consider demeanour to be a highly unreliable method of judging veracity. The court has to decide the case on the evidence, and the evidence comprises the documentary material and the spoken words of the witnesses. I cannot accept that, in any material way, the evidence includes the thespian performance with which witnesses speak the words of their oral testimony. Thus, in  <span style="font-style:italic">Cazalet v Abu-Zalaf</span>, although that wife was by far the better witness in terms of demeanour, I found on the evidence of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">both</span> parties that (a) the court had correctly found that the wife could not reasonably be expected to live with the husband and had therefore rightly pronounced decree nisi on her behaviour petition, and (b) the fact that over a year later they chose to resume their dismal, toxic, cohabitation did not undermine in the slightest the objective judgment enshrined in the decree that they could not reasonably be expected to live together.</p>

If the court is not on its guard, the influence of demeanour may insinuate itself into a trial judge&#8217;s subconscious and contribute to the formation of an adverse perception of the witness as an unworthy person who does not deserve to succeed in the litigation. The formation of such a perception would be a form of bias. It is for this reason that I constantly remind myself when, in terms of demeanour, a witness is giving oral evidence very poorly, to put thoughts of annoyance and irritation out of my mind.</p>

As far as I understood the situation to be, the Raymond James margin loan was required to be paid off at the closing of the LBO. Andrew Baker raised the funds to repay the loan through the sale of 589,541 shares of JSA at $8.50 a share (equating to $5m).

However, the husband did receive on the buy-out $4 million in respect of his LTIP and as a severance payment. That payment is discussed under &#8220;Lediba&#8221; below.

Mr Fink had produced at least one contemporaneous document showing that the husband&#8217;s shareholding had shrunk to 689,823 shares (page 977; page 970 cannot be seen to be contemporaneous, for the reason I have given above).  However, Mr Rotenberg&#8217;s file obtained in the USA under subpoena had a document in it which also had the hallmark of being contemporaneous (page 1047). It is also entitled <span style="font-weight:bold">Project Lion Capitalization Tables, Members Schedule</span> and shows the husband having 1,279,364 shares (&#8220;the Rotenberg version&#8221;).

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Bojarski rightly submitted that there would be no point of nomineeship of these shares where the Rotenberg version proclaims direct ownership by the husband of 1,279,364 shares (and the Fink version of 689,823 shares). I agree, and I note that the Rotenberg version itself suggests otherwise (as does the Fink version). It shows that the remaining LSR shares acquired by JSA were paid for by investors in three family groups: the Stephens Group, the Knafel Group and the Kaufman Group. One of the investors within the Stephens Group was Andrew Stafford-Deitsch. Duncanson was listed under the heading &#8220;ASD Affiliates&#8221; along with a number of other investors. ASD is a cipher for Andrew Stafford-Deitsch. This does not suggest that Duncanson BV was a nominee for the husband. In his re-examination Mr Fink explained:</p>

		<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Stephens is one of the largest and wealthiest families in the United States. They have invested. They were investors in Envigo as well before we did the LBO in 2009. There is no way that they have anything to do with Andrew Baker. TFO is a Middle Eastern family office that came in with us. ASD affiliates are Andrew Stafford Deitch who is one of the principals of the Stephens group and those are all his family members and friends that he brought in and Cub Holdings was healthcare research analyst from DLJ, who followed the company and who had been an investor before the LBO and requested that they be allowed to stay in and we allowed them to stay in. So no. And then Knafel  are again one of the larger family offices in the United States.&#8221;</p>

In February 2014, 20% would have amounted to 2,972,587 shares; 9.9% would have amounted to 1,471,431. As he had at that time 494,701 visible shares he would have to have hidden somewhere 976,730 (at 9.9%) or 2,477,886 (at 20%)  shares. Where? In my judgment it is inconceivable that if there were some kind of nominee arrangement involving that many shares, Mr Fink would not have known about it.

Further, it values his business interests at $10.5m - $13m, irreconcilable with the $70m referred to in the preceding paragraph from only 18 months before. But what it does say is that, as at November 2015, the husband owned 17.5997% of JSA. This is a most particular and detailed number, in no sense a rough figure. Of course, the husband knew exactly how much of this company he owned and formally disclosed it. There was no reason to overstate his interest, quite the reverse. </p>

The total consideration was $595 million from which was deducted $514m of debt, expenses, working capital adjustments and escrow payments resulting in $24m of proceeds going to shareholders. According to Mr Fink, the husband received $534,735 for his share of the cash proceeds. By this stage his percentage shareholding of the issued Envigo shares was 2.32%. Mr Bishop KC did not dispute that if the husband had only 443,826 Envigo shares then $534,735 is an approximately correct figure for his share of the proceeds (2.32% of $24 million is $557,778).</p>

That is all the more important in the circumstances of this case given that it is now known that &#8220;when he becomes physically ill, Mr Baker&#8217;s state of mind renders him very clearly incapacitous in respect to all his responsibilities&#8221; and that over the course of 2022 &#8220;it would be unsafe to assume that Mr Baker&#8217;s cognitive abilities are sufficiently intact and stable at any given time for it to be assumed he is able to retain sole responsibility for his complex financial and legal affairs, to litigate current proceedings..., or to give evidence in these proceedings. He has also been diagnosed with early-stage dementia. It is not uncommon for individuals suffering with problems such as the husband to disguise them out of shame and embarrassment; continuing to answer questions and provide information even though their powers of memory and comprehension are unreliable. The court cannot be sure how long it is since the husband last had full cognitive capacity. It is very likely that it was impaired long before the actual diagnosis by Dr Rogers in early 2023. &#8230;</p>

		<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Far more significantly, and recently, the husband should have received 9.9% of the $210m cash and $270m shares in Inotiv under the 2021 sale. This equates to $20.8m in cash and about 1,148,000 shares in Inotiv (29m shares in Envigo x 0.4 conversion to Inotiv stock x 9.9%). These would be worth about $5.7m today. The husband has disclosed receiving cash of $2.3m and 177,695 shares so there is $18.5m and about $4.9m worth of shares missing.&#8221;</p>

Items (a), (e) and (f) are representations made by the husband to his bankers for the purposes of gaining credit. In my opinion, given that he is an inveterate liar, very little, if any, weight should be attributed to such representations. The court sometimes has to find in relation to evidence from a dishonest witness, that nothing will be accepted from that witness unless it is corroborated by other evidence. That is the case here and I would extend that caution to anything that the husband has said about his means to anybody unless it is absolutely clear that he would have no motive to lie whatsoever. I placed no weight at all on his supposed admission to Mr Bishop KC that his representation to Coutts of owning 9.9% of Invigo was correct. This was a classic &#8220;if you say so&#8221; answer given by a witness who had no interest in speaking the truth about anything. It was meaningless.</p>

		<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It was also very illuminating when he gave evidence in response to questions from the Bench on Friday 21 July. He stated that he had hoped to get $100m from Envigo. This only makes sense if he had 9.9% of it. If he had 1% or 2 %, the company would have had to sell for $10-20bn to generate $100m for H and it was never going to do that. Further, H said it all went wrong in the company and he got peanuts; but we know that in fact the first sale washed out the debt and the second sale of $485m was practically all equity. On this basis H&#8217;s 9.9% was worth $48m which is not far different from the $40m he was telling Coutts in 2019. It is, of course, irreconcilable with what H has said in these proceedings.&#8221;</p>

Until 2017 he was providing W with support and until 2020 he was paying the CPW mortgage. He has supported [his current partner] and their children (although he told Coutts and this court that she was successful in her own right and had an income from her wedding event business). </p>

		<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">H says that he has only two bank accounts and that whilst living in Monaco he paid for all his expenses (save for the apartment, which he says was paid for by Envigo) in cash. The Societe Generale bank statements attached to H&#8217;s Form E show very few cash withdrawals (similarly, his Coutts current account). It is inconceivable that on all fronts H was spending more than $1m p/a in addition to all of his company benefits and paid accommodation. That would account for depletion of $14m, leaving &#163;12.5m unaccounted for. 94. We submit that H must have no less than $10m of accrued income held offshore. This is probably very conservative. </p>

The Docklands flat was purchased in December 1997 in the joint names of the husband and his partner, unbeknown to the wife, by means of a deposit provided, and a mortgage paid, by the husband. Parish&#8217;s House was purchased in the sole name of the husband&#8217;s partner in March 2007 again by means of a deposit provided, and a mortgage paid, by the husband. In Mr Rotenberg&#8217;s emails to Coutts and the Bank of Montreal in February and March 2014 he (Mr Rotenberg) stated that both of these properties were owned by &#8220;[Mr Baker] and his spouse and related trusts&#8221;. The husband has recorded in his Form E the full value of the mortgage on Parish&#8217;s House (&#163;2.4 million) as his sole liability. In my judgment, for the purposes of the dispute between the husband and the wife, the presumption of resulting trust in the husband&#8217;s favour is not displaced, and it is therefore entirely appropriate to attribute the values of these two properties to him.</p>

The idea is that maintenance should be used for immediate expenditure and if it is not paid, and if the default is not enforced promptly, then the entitlement lapses, as the accumulation of arrears is not to be seen as a type of savings plan. </p>

I can discern no change in the circumstances in the light of which the capital terms were made, which would make those terms manifestly unjust. On the contrary, it is my clear finding that it would be manifestly just for those capital terms to be enforced now, including those terms which provide for capital to be paid by the husband&#8217;s estate upon him predeceasing the wife. This is because I have no confidence that the husband will make arrangements for his estate to discharge those obligations or that, in that event, the wife would find it easy to enforce them.</p>

Costs should be dealt with in accordance with our own lights. Although the wife has not succeeded in her claim for &#163;9.4 million, or even come close to it, it would not be just having regard to the husband&#8217;s conduct for her to have to bear any of his costs. On the contrary, the terms of FPR 28.3(6) require me specifically to consider the conduct of the parties. I cannot say that the wife&#8217;s litigation conduct was unreasonable. In my opinion, even when she had received Mr Fink&#8217;s affidavit it was not unreasonable in the light of the husband&#8217;s persistent delinquency for her to carry on making further forensic investigation. I am of the clear view that the point at which the landscape became sufficiently clear for her to have to realise that her forensic investigation was running up a cul-de-sac, was when Mr Fink gave his extremely impressive evidence. By then, of course, all the costs had been incurred.</p>

In contrast, the Lediba theory uses an audit period of 14 years (although many items of data do not cover that exact term); there are for many data items an absence of any documentation; and for the larger items the figures advanced are pure subjective guesswork. The technique, the data and the process of proof are all so crude and arbitrary that I was never going to conclude, on the balance of probability, the husband had $10 million squirrelled away which derived from the activities of Lediba.</p>

Unfortunately for her, it became completely untenable when Mr Fink gave his evidence. In judging that evidence to be compellingly and decisively truthful I am not, of course, placing any material weight on the way he gave his evidence. His indignation at the suggestion that he was not merely wrong, but was deliberately and knowingly purveying false evidence, had all the hallmarks of being authentic and honest; but, for all I know, Mr Fink may be a very good actor. What I am placing decisive weight on, is the clarity of his account, its internal consistency, and the absence of any motive by Mr Fink to tell lies on oath. The quality of that evidence, in that sense, was very powerful, and as it progressed I could see the wife&#8217;s case dissolving before my very eyes.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Bishop KC refers to the fact that in the draft judgment at para 103(iii) I omitted to refer to the mortgage repayments on CPW as an income obligation. He argues that my  omission was entirely correct as the obligation is properly to be treated as being of a capital nature entitling the wife to an additional $1.6 million. It was for this reason that, in the table at para 105 above (which sets out the wife&#8217;s calculation of what she says is due to her under the separation agreement) she includes in the Duxbury capitalisation the sums payable under Schedule A, which in turn includes the CPW mortgage payments. Accordingly, Mr Bishop KC seeks that I &#8220;clarify&#8221; my draft judgment to include an augmentation to the lump sum of $1.6 million, and should I refuse to do so, to grant the wife permission to appeal that decision.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I firmly reject this submission. The omission in para 103(iii) of an explicit reference to the CPW mortgage payments in Schedule A was an oversight by me. Those mortgage payments are spelled out as an obligation in Schedule A, and the husband&#8217;s obligation to make the Schedule A payments is found in Article IV which is headed &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;. This obligation was therefore plainly agreed between the parties to be a constituent of the wife&#8217;s maintenance. Further, the agreement stated that if the wife should sell CPW, and buy another property as her primary residence, the husband would make the payments on a new mortgage up to $2.3 million (which he would guarantee, if that were required) as well as meeting the outgoings on the new property. The agreement did not require him at any point during his lifetime to pay off the CPW mortgage. In contrast, the agreement stated that if the Carmel property were sold while the husband was still living he &#8220;shall satisfy 100% of the remaining Carmel Mortgage, not to exceed $550,000.00, upon the sale of  the Carmel Property.&#8221; </p>

He says the agreement was a factor to be weighed among all the other <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18 s. 25" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> factors, and a factor which ought to have been given limited weight in view of the deterioration in the husband&#8217;s financial position since the agreement had been entered into.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree that formally the agreement falls to be weighed as one of the circumstances of the case under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/1" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18 s. 25" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. However, having regard to the test for weighing separation agreements approved by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Radmacher v Granatino</span> at [64] &#8211; [65], which I have set out above, an obvious comparison, in my judgment, is an application to vary an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18 s. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 31</ref>. Obviously, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18 s. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 31</ref> does not apply literally, but the way the court would approach an agreement incorporated in a consent order is, in seems to me, an obvious analogue for an  agreement incorporated in a separation deed. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Third, Mr Bojarski says that the court failed to carry out an assessment of the respective needs and financial  responsibilities of the husband and the wife, and in particular to take into account the husband&#8217;s responsibilities to his two dependent sons, resulting in a division of the assets which provided an unfairly large share of the assets to the wife and an unfairly small one to the husband.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although Mr Bojarski touched on the husband&#8217;s needs in his opening skeleton I heard no oral evidence or argument about them. It was obvious to me that with resources of a little under &#163;4 million the husband and his partner would not suffer undue hardship, and it would therefore not be manifestly unjust, were the capital terms of the solemnly made agreement to be enforced. </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I end by applauding the  skill, assiduity, and diligence of all the lawyers involved in this complex case. The written and oral work from the Bar has been of the highest quality. The attention to detail from counsel has been outstanding. Mr and Mrs Baker should understand that their interests were represented fearlessly by counsel and that no stone was left unturned in their representation. It was a pleasure to conclude my judicial career with the receipt of such skilful advocacy.</p>
