PC was born on 11 March 1989 in Turkey and moved to the UK in about September 1993.  Her parents separated when PC was 6 and after that she lived with her mother, MC, and her sister.  She has half-siblings on her father&#8217;s side of the family. There was a period of estrangement from them, until the death of a close relative in 2014 when they began to see each other.  After leaving school PC studied and worked. By 2020, PC had decided to return to university with a view to a change in her career.</span><span> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">She was careful with her health, enjoying exercise, walking and healthy eating.  She is described by her mother as having been &#8220;full of life&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On 28 July 2020, when she was aged just 31, PC suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest and collapsed at home. A lack of cardiac output for about 30 minutes led to her brain being deprived of oxygen, which caused a severe hypoxic ischaemic injury. She has been left in what has been assessed as a Prolonged Disorder of Consciousness (&#8216;PDOC&#8217;), at the low end of the spectrum of awareness: her condition is described as a Minimally Conscious State minus (MCS-). She is now aged 35. She is cared for at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-Disability (&#8216;RHN&#8217;), which has been joined as a party to these proceedings. Her placement there is commissioned by the NHS North Central London Integrated Care Board (&#8216;the ICB&#8217;) who is the applicant in the proceedings. The other parties are PC&#8217;s mother, MC, and PC herself, through her litigation friend, the Official Solicitor.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The ICB made its application to the Court of Protection on 2 February 2024, seeking determinations under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (&#8216;MCA 2005&#8217;). They seek a declaration that PC lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings, and to make decisions regarding her medical care and treatment (s.15(1)(a) MCA 2005); and further that it is not lawful, and not in her best interests, to continue to receive the life-sustaining clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (&#8216;CANH&#8217;) that she is currently relying on from RHN (s.15(1)(c)). They seek an order under s.16(1)(a)/(2)(a), and s.17(1)(d) of the MCA 2005 that it would be in her best interests to refuse to consent to the continuation of CANH and other life-saving treatment, and to consent to palliative care only.</span></p>

She was transferred to </span>a specialist nursing home, which is part of the RHN<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> where she remains, on 15 March 2021. The process of making a best interests decision about her CANH was initiated on 8 March 2023, and the case was then referred to the ICB on 10 July 2023. I shall not in this judgment deal with the question of the time that this matter has taken to come before the court, about which separate evidence has been filed, but which has not been the subject of dedicated submissions before me. My focus in this judgment is solely an assessment of PC&#8217;s best interests.</span></p>

PC&#8217;s mother had not been joined as a party, and had only recently been served with the papers in the case. She indicated to me that she wished to become a party and have the opportunity to address the court. She does not speak English well, but wished to oppose the declarations being sought. I therefore made an order joining her. I also joined the RHN, in circumstances where the questions of timing and decision making in PC&#8217;s case appeared to remain live. Although adjournment was opposed by the ICB and by the Official Solicitor, I granted a short adjournment of just under 1 month, and the matter has come back before me for determination over 3 days from 24 April 2024.</span></p>

That said, they will rarely, if ever, be determinative of P's 'best interests'. Respecting individual autonomy does not always require P's wishes to be afforded predominant weight. Sometimes it will be right to do so, sometimes it will not. The factors that fall to be considered in this intensely complex process are infinitely variable e.g. the nature of the contemplated treatment, how intrusive such treatment might be and crucially what the outcome of that treatment maybe for the individual patient. Into that complex matrix the appropriate weight to be given to P's wishes will vary. What must be stressed is the obligation imposed by statute to inquire into these matters and for the decision maker fully to consider them. Finally, I would observe that an assessment of P's wishes, views and attitudes are not to be confined within the narrow parameters of what P may have said. Strong feelings are often expressed non-verbally, sometimes in contradistinction to what is actually said. Evaluating the wider canvass may involve deriving an understanding of P's views from what he may have done in the past in circumstances which may cast light on the strength of his views on the contemplated treatment&#8230; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">recent case law&#8230; has emphasised the importance of giving proper weight to P's wishes, feelings, beliefs and values&#8230;</span></p>

He recorded that it was by then nearly 3 years since the original episode of hypoxic brain damage, with no detectable change, whereas almost all recovery occurs within 12 weeks. He opines that PC will never have any autonomy or control, be able to undertake any functional activity or participate in helping a carer, or to communicate or interact socially. He was satisfied then that the conclusion from a best interests meeting held on 13 April 2023 &#8211; that it was in PC&#8217;s best interests not to continue the treatment &#8211; was the right one, and he recorded that he had come to the same conclusion.</span></p>

In her statement dated 19 April 2024, MC, who speaks little English and gave evidence to me through an interpreter, explains that she did not fully understand the purpose of the first meeting on 14 March 2023, but that by a later meeting on 6 June, and having considered the matter with PC&#8217;s cousin, MK, she was clear that she did not want CANH to be withdrawn. She said that she was not aware of a letter written earlier by SO, PC&#8217;s half-sister, confirming the family&#8217;s decision to agree to discontinue the treatment. Accepting the genuineness of the currently held views of MC, MK and AO, no questions were put to them about their earlier position.

Over a further 10 months there had been no substantial or consistent observations to suggest any significant level of awareness &#8211; he concluded that PC is unaware of herself or her environment. He considered the prospect of any improvement in her condition &#8216;non-existent&#8217;, and explained that references by Dr A to PC being &#8216;alert&#8217; meant no more than that her eyes were open. There would be no significant sustained improvement in her clinical state affecting her autonomy, ability to function or communicate, social interaction or need for care or institutional living. Her increasing spasticity would only worsen, and would not get better. He determined that the views now expressed by the majority of the family could not be determinative, and contrasted them with the different views which had been understood as expressed by the family at the original meeting in March 2023.</span></p>

I consider that any attempt to place an interpretation on those words now, either positive or negative, is unsafe, given the position being articulated by MC and supported by others in her family, that she did not then fully understand the purpose of the meeting. It is clear that both of PC&#8217;s parents now are very firmly opposed to the cessation of CANH, and I accept that that is their genuine position at this time.

He noted reports of some increase in behaviours associated with pain, sufficient to distress treating nurses. He also noted that increasing a morphine-based medication for her seemed to lessen the pain behaviours. He considered the challenge of balancing increased sedation against apparent pain and distress. He suggested that because pain is arguably a more basic phenomenon than consciousness, the pain matrix may be more resistant to degradation. He concluded that the possibility that PC is conscious of pain was unlikely, but should not be discounted. </span></p>

He rejected any suggestion that the assessments carried out had been inadequate, and pointed out that whilst more intensive tests were appropriate in the early stages after a brain injury, these were no longer required 4 years after the injury has been sustained. He commented that recommendations in papers from the United States had to be seen in the context of a much quicker likely assessment of condition being carried out in that jurisdiction.

Professor Wade went as far as to express the view that it would be a &#8216;waste of time&#8217;. </span></p>

Firstly, and sadly, it is very clear that there is no prospect that PC will ever herself have capacity in relation to this decision, nor can she participate in the decision-making process in any meaningful way. The quality of PC&#8217;s care has been uniformly praised by her family. No-one involved with her, and certainly not this court, is motivated by a desire to bring about her death. </span></p>

Given her young age, it is not surprising that PC had not had any meaningful conversations with her friends or family about her attitudes to the continuation of life in the sad situation in which she now finds herself. This is not a case where any element of powerfully held religious belief has to be taken into account. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Her family make it clear that PC was a strong hopeful person, and a fighter. That of course may cut both ways, for here there is no real hope of recovery. She was evidently a thoughtful and ambitious person, who envisaged (as many of her age would) a long and healthy life. Her family&#8217;s very understandable reason for hope is that she might find a way to recover; but the evidence is that such an outcome is not even a remote prospect. I have little evidence which might help me interpret how PC might have felt had she known what would befall her, aside from SO&#8217;s letter. I take that into account, but only alongside the views also expressed to me by MC, MK and AO. In the absence of a clear steer from her family about her own likely position, I have to consider the other factors in light of what I do know of her personality. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">What then of other factors that PC would be likely to consider, were she able to do so? I have no doubt that she would be concerned at her family&#8217;s upset and suffering at her condition, and would want to avoid that for them if she could. She had lived with her mother for all of her life before her illness, and would want to do all that she could to protect her. I have no doubt that she would be very concerned about her mother&#8217;s reaction to her death. Equally too, I have no doubt that she would be greatly distressed by the evident turmoil afflicting both her mother and her cousin MK. I&#8217;m sure that both her father and her sister SO are also suffering, which PC would wish to bring to an end. I&#8217;m sure too that other family members are equally distressed. Considering the competing arguments it is impossible to form a conclusive view about PC&#8217;s likely attitude here &#8211; whether she would choose to remain in her current state, and so leave her family, desolate as they are, continuing to visit her perhaps for another decade; or whether to enable an ending now which might prove the start of a healing process, but having first brought to a head their building grief. I must conclude that she could form either view as to the best course for her family, so I am left to look primarily at her personal best interests.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I also have to take into account the views of PC&#8217;s carers. Whilst the suggestion that PC&#8217;s condition is actively deteriorating is not made out on the evidence, I accept that there is no prospect of any tangible improvement in her condition. It is striking that there have been no observations of any comfort or pleasure reactions in her, and that the staff at the RHN have been themselves upset by the distress that her daily life can cause her. Whilst her suffering can evidently be alleviated by increasing doses of morphine, or anti-depressants to control her night-time crying, this increasing sedation as a substitute for some remote consciousness afflicted by unknowable pain and discomfort appears to offer little upside for her. The prospect that there may be elements of consciousness left to her of course strikes deep with her family. However, it is unavoidable that there is simply no evidence that PC&#8217;s experiences offer her any positives. There is no evidence of any enjoyment of life. The only evidence is of her exhibiting discomfort and pain. This is therefore a very different case from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">W v M</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.</span></p>

It is however sad to note that just the everyday functions of caring for her are seen to cause her distress by the nursing staff, which distress is only partially masked by medication. I accept Mr Lawson&#8217;s point that for much of the time in the medical notes, PC is recorded as being &#8216;stable&#8217;, but that appears for the most part to be stability generated by sedation, and not equivalent to any element of comfort.</span></p>

I agree with the observation of Jonathan Baker J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">W v M</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, to the effect that there is dignity in being well cared for and being kept comfortable and free from pain.

The evidence is clear that any progression which she does experience going forward, nearly 4 years on from her initial brain injury, will be negative rather than positive.

Prior to the withdrawal of CANH, there could first be a trip home for PC, although not to a property which she has visited before - so certain checks would have to be carried out first. Then, the clinical team at the RHN have identified a hospice as a suitable facility, to which a transfer could be secured subject to space at the point when it is required.  This move would be supported by the ICB as well as the RHN, if requested by PC&#8217;s family. If not, then there is what Dr A describes as &#8216;ample&#8217; provision for palliative care on site at the RHN.  Whilst the discontinuance of CANH may of course itself lead to the prospect of some discomfort and pain, Dr A describes that this would be &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">carefully managed with a robust terminal care plan, and active monitoring by care staff</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;.

However, in trying to interpret the value to her of her current existence, I cannot avoid the conclusion that her life has not since 2020 and will not going forward be one that affords her any measurable degree of pleasure or even contentment. Further years of life may be of value to anyone, however disabled, if they are able to derive some positives from their existence. Very sadly, the only evidence that I have of PC&#8217;s condition and mood, when not sufficiently regulated by medication, is of discomfort and the experience of pain. Those who care for her are clearly worried for her. Her family look to her reactions as signs of consciousness, but what they describe does not amount to more than the appearance of suffering. It is very clear to me from all that I have read and heard that the burden of her condition on PC is a heavy one.</span></p>

Any additional pain will be ameliorated by medication and experienced end of life care, and be limited in time. There is no evidence that PC is deriving any positive experience from her current life to which she might ascribe value, or which might render more time in her current state as any sort of benefit for her. She will, if CANH is withdrawn, be freed from the pain and discomfort which she is currently suffering in her day to day life, which are unlikely to lessen for her to any degree for as long as she remains alive. She will be spared the burden of living a life which does not obviously bring her anything other than pain. Her death will bring great sadness for her family, but it will be sadness not augmented by further years of her suffering before it arrives.</span></p>

I am entirely satisfied from all that I have read and heard about PC that she would not wish to continue with life in her current condition. I am reluctantly satisfied that it is not in PC&#8217;s best interests to continue to administer to her life-sustaining medical treatment in the form of CANH, but rather that, with great sadness, it is in her best interests to begin to implement for her a palliative care regime the consequence of which (but not the aim) will be the end of her life.</span></p>
