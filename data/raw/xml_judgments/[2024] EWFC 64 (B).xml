However, pending sale of the FMH the respondent seeks &#8216;bridging&#8217; maintenance at a rate of &#163;750pcm. The applicant opposes the same and seeks an immediate clean break.</span></p>

Children proceedings were issued and this concluded by consent in March 2020 with an agreement that the children would live with each parent on a 50/50 shared basis. However, the planned separation was then impacted by the covid pandemic and the parties reconciled their relationship in about May 2020. This reconciliation appears to have held until about April 2022 when the parties once again separated. They have not reconciled since.</span></p>

She has remained in rented property to date. The children lived with both parents in line with the consent order reached following the first separation. However, in January 2023, S, and then in April 2023, L, stopped spending time with the applicant. R has continued to live with each according to the shared care plan. As a result of this the applicant has issued further children proceedings and the case is currently awaiting an ISW report with a DRA listed in August 2024. The applicant issued his Form A in September 2022 following a process of mediation and exchange of voluntary Form&#8217;s E. I do not intend to detail the stages of the financial proceedings. All relevant orders can be found in section B of the bundle.</span></p>

He is concerned a snapshot of circumstances today which determines the finances and fixes each parties&#8217; available resources may prevent later reconciliation with the children and a return to the previous 50/50 care plan. He accepts the older children are not seeing him although he sees some signs of thawing in that S has accepted a present from him and L is communicating with him. He accepts any future orders will not include L given his age. He thinks in the foreseeable future L will return to staying with him whether or not this is on a shared care basis. He hopes there will be a return to shared care for all children. In any event R is happy with how things are.</span></p>

When asked she appeared to accept there was a potential for L returning to spend time with his father although not on a shared care basis. She felt L had wanted a single stable base and the shared care was not permitting this with a weekly change of residence. She was more cautious with regards to S who she told me is more opposed to her father and is not communicating with him. The sense was that within the foreseeable future both R and L might be spending meaningful time with their father but she would be providing the &#8216;lion&#8217;s share&#8217; of caring duties. I of course bear in mind that these matters will be determined in separate proceedings later this year.</span></p>

In 2023 he received a net global bonus of c.&#163;15,000. He made clear this bonus is discretionary in form and there is no guarantee as to future receipt or levels. He told me a new manager is less supportive of bonuses and he indicates his work levels have suffered with the litigation and recent events.

Her current benefits including child benefit total c&#163;34,000 per annum although the universal credit cap will apply from July 2024 reducing this closer to c&#163;28,000. Until September 2023 the applicant was employed as a lawyer and had a gross income of &#163;92k per annum. She left this post by mutual consent and argues this was due to reduced work within her department meaning she could not meet her billable hours set by her employer. In any event she told me that it was proving difficult to maintain this employment given its demands together with the demands of caring for the children. The respondent accepts, indeed bases her case on a return to work within the year. She argues this will likely see her income levels reduce (when compared to previous employment) as she is unable to maintain the level of commitment and work levels required in the sector in which she was previously employed. She contends this will likely be at a gross income of c.&#163;70k per annum, equating to a net monthly income of about &#163;4,200. The applicant questions this and argues the respondent can and should return to work at a level similar to that previously held by her. Separate to the above the applicant pays child support to the respondent for the older children at a rate of &#163;12,843 per annum. This would change if the children were to return to their previous arrangements. No sum is payable with respect to R.</span></p>

Notwithstanding this having been done the parties are surprisingly apart as to the appropriate figure to be used. This is because the applicant has used the sums provided as to achievable sale price and has reached an average of c.&#163;501k (or c.&#163;486k after costs at 3%). The respondent has used the marketing price sums leading to an average of &#163;520k (which would be c.&#163;504k after 3% costs). It seems clear to me applying the Court direction, and indeed given my duty is to assess the likely sale price not the price it will be marketed at, the lower sum is the appropriate one. However, this means I must apply the same logic when looking at the costs of replacement property.</span></p>

The parties have come to focus substantially on properties between &#163;400-500k but particularly at the upper end of this range. These are 3-bedroom properties and it is important to note this is the format of the FMH. Both parties contend for a necessary 3-bedroom property. The applicant argues the parties have equivalent needs and their housing should be assessed equally. The consequence is that he identifies a need for properties around the &#163;475k mark. The respondent challenges the suggestion of equality of housing given her primary role in housing the children. Whilst she does not object to the applicant having a 3-bedroom property she would argue if &#8216;push came to shove&#8217; then he could be housed in a 2-bedroom property. In any event she submits his housing need is lower than her need. In the bundle the lowest valued property is at &#163;430k, although I note all prices are marketing prices and some discount should be applied to create parity with the calculations at &#167;16 above. I note for the FMH this is a discount of about 3.7%. I note this would amount to a &#163;475k property achieving a sale price of c.&#163;457k with a property at &#163;430k reducing to c.&#163;414k.</span></p>

The advice provides a range of possible outcomes based on (a) the parties&#8217; gross incomes taking the respondent at her previous income of &#163;92k and the applicant on basic income only; (b) with or without the child maintenance continuing, and; (c) with or without existing liabilities being settled prior to mortgage. This creates four permutations. It is premised on mortgage until retirement age. For the applicant the maximum mortgage is c.&#163;194k. The real issue for the applicant is the short period over which the mortgage would have to be repaid (7 years). There is also a significant potential issue as to recent ill-health as shown on payslips (see below). This level of mortgage would be associated with monthly repayments of &#163;2,800. For the respondent given her age there are a broader range of options. The available mortgages range from &#163;199k (based on debts unpaid and maintenance stopping) to &#163;399k (debts settled and maintenance continuing). I note for debts paid and maintenance not continuing the suggested figure is c.&#163;341k. At &#163;92k income this equates to a multiple of 3.7 x income. I make this point as I am asked to reassess income at &#163;70,000. I also note that the maintenance payment appears to increase mortgage by &#163;58,000 whether or not debts are paid. There was limited questioning directly on this point. The questioning was on the related issue as to earning capacity (see above).</span></p>

It transpired that whereas the documents referenced this being at around &#163;60k it was in fact closer to &#163;100k. The respondent suggested this was unaccounted for by the applicant with the suggestion it had been wrongly used or perhaps even remained available. The applicant gave a detailed account of how the funds had been used to include on legal costs and renovating the family bathroom. The funds had been drawn down around a period of unemployment and had been used on the family whilst the parties remained in a relationship. I was puzzled as to the fact of a &#163;100k draw down given the normal principle of a 25% maximum tax-free lump sum and the fact the remaining fund is around &#163;216k not &#163;300k. However, the applicant explained he had incurred a tax charge and when this was considered the figures made sense. It seems (at &#163;216k) the maximum lump sum would be &#163;72,000. The sum taken was about &#163;28,000 in excess of this. A tax charge of &#163;10,000 was incurred. This is about right if this excess was taxed at 40% as it likely would be.</span></p>

She explained this by reference to her excess of needs over income at this time and with particular regard to her housing costs. She drew attention to the fact the applicant remains in the FMH which is mortgage free. She was questioned as to the inter-relationship between the payments and sale of the property and re-employment. What would happen if the property sold before she obtained employment and how she would then manage with maintenance ceasing? I acknowledge at this point the applicant would be incurring housing costs which currently do not arise. The sense of her answer was that this had not been fully considered. Alternatively, I enquired as to why maintenance should continue if she in fact obtained re-employment prior to sale (whether at &#163;70k or &#163;92k). I noted the increase in her net income would be significantly greater than either the &#163;750pm or the suggested monthly deficit of about &#163;1,000. Her answer was somewhat unclear but again appeared to suggest her needs exceeded even her previous level of income whilst paying rent.</span></p>

However, the final position will be shaped by the respective needs of the parties. The parties have agreed an outcome on pensions. I do not feel the need to revisit this agreement notwithstanding the point made as to the accrual of these rights in part pre-dating the relationship.</span></p>

Having regard to the central issue in the case the relevant resources include the equity in the FMH; the earning capacity of the parties and their respective mortgage raising capacity. As in any case consideration as to future property purchase is speculative with the Court simply identifying the reasonable housing needs, the available resources, and the consequent implications for the case. The Court does not select the appropriate property or compel a party to use the provided funds in a specified manner. It is inevitable that as the assessed cost of a property is increased so the purchase of the same requires either an enhanced mortgage (other things being equal) or a greater deposit. In a case involving two parties each seeking replacement property the Court has to be astute to the fact that increasing the take by one party has an opposite impact on the other. Ultimately the Court will have regard to the global resources available; the global housing needs and the global borrowing capacity. The aim must be to find a fair way in which the global equity plus the global borrowing permits a fair outcome for both parties. </span></p>

In the case of the respondent, I have to bear in mind my reduced assessment of her likely gross income.

In the case of housing, I accept this is a case with similar but not exact housing needs. On the information available to me at this time the respondent needs a 3-bedroom property for three children who live with her. The applicant has a need for a 3-bedroom property to accommodate three children when they may come to spend time with him. He continues to have R half of the time. I consider this may come to be reflected in the ultimate balancing equation in a search for fairness where the resources cannot provide equality of housing.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In the course of the hearing both parties appeared to concede an acceptance that their actual housing might cost &#163;475,000 before any costs. This was a realistic concession given their reference to properties on offer at &#163;500,000 (see &#167;17 above). However, applying a discount to asking price I observe a property with an asking price of &#163;475,000 would discount closer to &#163;450,000 on sale. I appreciate this is far from scientific but I must reflect this factor given I am doing the same with the FMH. I accept these properties (which are all 3-bedroom) are basic in nature but I assume the same applies to the FMH given its value. There is a range of properties (as will always be the case) and I accept the bottom of that range is around the level of the property at &#163;430k found in the bundle. Applying the same discount that property would sell at about &#163;414,000. I my judgment the reasonable housing need range in this case is a relatively narrow one between &#163;415,000 - &#163;455,000 (properties marketed at &#163;430-475k).</span></p>

Thankfully I was spared any consideration of these budgets. I note each has a now and future approach to spending. The now schedule totals almost &#163;12,500pm (&#163;5,333 applicant / &#163;7,140 respondent). The future schedule totals &#163;13,700 (&#163;6,288 applicant / &#163;7,413 respondent). I remind myself the global resource in this case is &#163;12,000 in the future. Something will plainly have to give. This is accepted to be the case. The respondent was clear in accepting maintenance will end on sale of the property. At this point her income (see above) will be &#163;5,770pm and she will have to cut her budget by about &#163;1,650pm to return to balance. The applicant would have an income of &#163;6,317 and would have an excess of income over claimed needs of about &#163;50pm.</span></p>

I accept the respondent&#8217;s liabilities are at about &#163;48k and I agree she will look to settle these by way of mortgage to reduce the monthly costs. They cost her about &#163;1,000pm. The applicant&#8217;s debts are at about &#163;25k. He does not propose to settle the same although I note they cost him a suggested &#163;450pm.</span></p>

By way of illustration, the respondent argues for a mortgage of &#163;250,000 costing around &#163;1,600pm yet she allows &#163;2,400pm for the same in her budget. The applicant increases his balance by about &#163;1,000 between now and the future whilst including a new item for mortgage of &#163;2,400. Plainly in doing so he saves about &#163;1,400 (the difference between the two) from his current budget to enable this to be the case.</span></p>

This is not a conduct case whatever may have been put in statement evidence. I have not been provided with any live evidence supporting such a contention. This is a significant relationship with ongoing responsibilities. The contributions are equal albeit they will have been different from time to time. I have noted the applicant&#8217;s health situation and the parties&#8217; ages. The losses on divorce will be met by the agreed pension order. I consider the parties enjoyed a middle-class standard of living commensurate with both being high earners (when compared to the general population). However, they will both have to adjust to their straitened circumstances.</span></p>

But this does not change my duty to make the right decision on the available information carrying out reasonable assessments of  what the future holds based on the available evidence.</span></p>

I agree the interim situation is different. Pending employment, the financial position for the respondent is much harder whereas in simple terms the applicant is benefitting from no mortgage costs until sale. It would be most unfortunate if the ability of the respondent to re-house the children on sale was stifled due to her debts escalating whilst she waited for sale due to a lack of income. In my assessment the request for maintenance until sale is well made and justifies a payment of &#163;750pm. I note in the interim the applicant is not paying the future mortgage of &#163;2,800pm but is managing his debts (&#163;450pm). In simple terms he is better off by about &#163;2,400pm compared to the situation after sale. He can plainly afford this request until sale. In contrast the respondent has similar needs to that which she will have in the future but is living on benefits. I consider she needs &#163;750pm and order accordingly. I do not consider this should end on employment but should continue until sale. On employment whilst the position for the respondent will improve it will differ from post-sale due to the costs of servicing debt. The applicant&#8217;s position will remain positive as above. It should continue to sale irrespective of employment.</span></p>
