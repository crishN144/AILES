	    <intro>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case is a cautionary tale about the consequences for a child and for a same-sex couple of both deceit as to how that child came to be conceived and the unreliability of informal arrangements for artificial insemination. The fallout from this couple&#8217;s separation has been devastating for each of them and for their named sperm donor. In due course, the child concerned will need an age-appropriate explanation of what happened when she was conceived and why it is that she now has a different birth-certificate. As Peter Jackson J put it in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">M v F &amp; H (Legal Paternity)</span> [2013] EWHC 1901 (Fam):</p>

Some births follow treatment at licensed clinics and others originate from informal arrangements. Either way, those involved must often be confronted by profound feelings and powerful forces. These include, relevantly to this case, a yearning for children, a need for friendship and a hunger for sex, forces that can overpower and defeat routine social conventions.</span></p>

She asks the court to declare that a man called F is the legal parent of X and that her former wife, Q, is not a legal parent of X. Q was married to P at the time X was both conceived and born and she is named on X&#8217;s birth certificate as a parent. She has parental responsibility for X by reason of those circumstances even though she is not a biological parent. There is no dispute that F is the biological father of X for he acted as the sperm donor for P and Q. F supports P&#8217;s application, but it is vehemently opposed by Q. On behalf of X, her guardian recognises that X may benefit from certainty about her parentage and that the truth about what happened is almost always in a child&#8217;s best interests, no matter how painful the adult emotions presently are.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue at the heart of this application is whether X was conceived by artificial insemination (AI) or by natural insemination (NI). If it is the latter, the implications for Q are profound for it is asserted by P and F that Q has no right to be registered on X&#8217;s birth certificate and does not have parental responsibility for her. For her part, Q assets that X was conceived by AI but P and F maintain that they had NI during the conception window and thus that it is uncertain by what method X was conceived. Q, at no stage, consented to P and F having NI but only consented to AI. If uncertainty exists, P asserts that Q cannot have properly acquired legal status for X if the relevant provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> (&#8220;the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>&#8221;) have not been strictly complied with. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P and Q began their relationship in 2011 and by 2015/2016, they began to research how they might become parents. It was agreed between them that P would bear any child of their relationship and that they would not use the services of a licensed clinic. Both agreed in their oral evidence that P was the driving force behind the joint effort to conceive a child. They chose to conceive by using AI. P and Q married in August 2016 and undertook their first attempt at AI in October 2016, using sperm imported from a clinic in Denmark. This method was both unsuccessful and expensive, so the couple sought a known donor and found F through placing an advert on the internet. In November/December 2016, P and Q met F at a pub and formed a favourable impression of him. On 10 December 2016, all three signed a document entitled <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Sperm Donor Agreement&#8221;</span>, obtained from the internet, by which F agreed not to demand or seek any parental rights in respect of any child born as a result of the AI process. This document has no legal force whatsoever.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There were two attempts at AI using F&#8217;s sperm which were unsuccessful despite the couple using an app designed to predict when a woman was at her most fertile so that conception might take place following insemination. The failure to become pregnant left P feeling unhappy and desperate and placed her relationship with Q under great strain though P hid this from Q. Reaching out for comfort, P on her case contacted F and arranged to meet him at her parents&#8217; home whilst they were out of the country. She found him friendly and sympathetic and, whilst at her parents&#8217; home, P initiated sexual intercourse with him. P and F had sex - NI - and P said that they had spoken about how NI would increase the chances of her getting pregnant. In total, P says that she and F met three times at her parents&#8217; home and had NI on each occasion. Q was not told either about the meetings or about the sexual intercourse. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third and final attempt at AI took place a day or two after P says that she and F last had sex. F was summoned to the couple&#8217;s home and donated sperm which was placed inside P. There is some dispute as to how this occurred, but P found out that she was pregnant a couple of weeks later.  F was not told about the pregnancy but, in January 2018, he was told that X had been born. X was in fact born in late 2017 and her birth was registered by both P and Q. X&#8217;s birth certificate shows P to be her mother and Q to be a parent. By arrangement with P and Q, F saw X once before P and Q separated: this was a brief occasion and he did not pick her up or hold her.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In early 2021, P and Q separated and subsequently divorced. Following their separation, P began communicating reasonably regularly with F. At P&#8217;s invitation, F saw X at her birthday parties in 2021, 2022 and 2023. It is accepted that X knows F is her biological father, but he has had little meaningful involvement in her life since birth. </p>

In April 2021, Q made an application for a child arrangements order and the litigation about X has been ongoing since then. None of that litigation was focussed on X&#8217;s conception until P and Q fell out about the involvement of F in X&#8217;s life in late 2022. This led to P claiming that she had had sexual intercourse with F during the time she and Q had been using AI to get pregnant. P asserted her belief that X had been conceived as a result of sexual intercourse or NI rather than by AI. P issued her application for declarations on 19 September 2023.</p>

Therefore, where two women are married to each other and one of the parties to that marriage gives birth to a child, the other party will not be presumed to be the parent of that child by virtue of the common law presumption. There may be other ways in which the party to the marriage who does not give birth to the child is treated in law as the parent (for example, if that woman is treated as a parent as a result of the amendment made by paragraph 40 of Schedule 7 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/30" uk:canonical="2013 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref> to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2013/30/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref>), but in all such cases it is not the common law presumption that treats her as the parent of that child.</span></p>

The new scientific techniques which have developed since the birth of the first IVF baby in 1978 open up the possibility of creating human life in ways and circumstances quite different from anything experienced before then. These possibilities bring with them huge practical and ethical difficulties. These have to be balanced against the strength and depth of the feelings of people who desperately long for the children which only these techniques can give them, as well as the natural desire of clinicians and scientists to use their skills to fulfil those wishes. Parliament has devised a legislative scheme and a statutory authority for regulating assisted reproduction in a way which tries to strike a fair balance between the various interests and concerns. Centres, the HFEA and the courts have to respect that scheme, however great their sympathy for the plight of particular individuals caught up in it.&#8221;</span></p>

From the outset of their treatment, it was their intention that the woman not carrying the child would be the child&#8217;s legal parent. They believed that they had signed the required forms and done all that was necessary for them both to be legal parents. They registered the birth of the child showing them both as legal parents as they believe themselves to be. Subsequently, it transpired that the required forms had not been signed. Following their separation, the biological mother sought a declaration that her former partner was not the child&#8217;s legal parent.

P told me that the moon cup felt uncomfortable so, when Q left the room, she had taken it out but had not told Q she had done so.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of P, Mr Turner KC put the conundrum faced by the court starkly: if X had been conceived by AI as Q believed, X&#8217;s birth certificate recording Q as a parent would have been correct by reason of the effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.42</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>. However, if X&#8217;s conception resulted from sexual intercourse between P and F or if it could not be shown that P had become pregnant as a result of the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;placing in her&#8221;</span> of F&#8217;s sperm, X&#8217;s birth certificate would not be correct in that F would be her parent both in fact and in law. Law and caselaw about the effect of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref> made clear that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>&#8217;s intention was to create certainty so, unless the court could be satisfied that its conditions had been complied with in full, Q could not be a legal parent of X. There was no presumption of parenthood simply from the fact Q was married to P at the time X was conceived and born. Mr Turner KC contended that the starting point was the common law presumption that F, as the undoubted biological father, was also the legal father and declarations reflecting that should be made, unless that presumption be displaced by proof on a balance of probabilities that the conception had resulted from AI, thus engaging <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/34" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 34</ref> and 42 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>.

If the court could not be satisfied on a balance of probabilities how X had been conceived, it would be required to have recourse to common law and make a declaration of paternity in favour of F. </p>

Further, once the court had determined the facts, there was no public policy considerations which made a declaration of parentage in favour of F manifestly contrary to public policy. Clarity as to legal parentage was part of a person&#8217;s right to private and family life and had lifelong significance for the individual and their wider family. F was X&#8217;s biological father and it was difficult to see how a declaration of paternity in relation to him could positively be against X&#8217;s best interests, let alone manifestly contrary to public policy. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of Q, Ms Weston KC submitted that the burden of establishing that X was born via NI lay on P. Q&#8217;s current status as X&#8217;s legal parent was the starting position. Any other approach would undermine the certainty of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref> by encouraging any applicant seeking to exclude a wife or former partner from parenthood to raise questions regarding the conception of the child and place the burden of proving AI on the non-biological parent in circumstances where proving which method of conception resulted in a birth was almost impossible to ascertain. Ms Weston KC submitted that there was no reason in law to depart from the principle that the burden of proof lay on those who assert. She relied on paragraphs 36-44 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In re S (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2023/897" uk:canonical="[2023] EWCA Civ 897" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWCA Civ 897</ref> to maintain Q&#8217;s status as a parent.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Weston KC submitted that the court should not permit the application to be heard because (a) the evidence was weak; (b) there was no clear positive benefit for X&#8217;s sense of her identity; and (c) P sought to oust Q from X&#8217;s life by ending any parental responsibility she might have for X. If the court permitted the application to be heard, Ms Weston KC questioned the reliability of P and F&#8217;s evidence which was unsupported by any WhatsApp messages from the relevant conception window. Both were keen to say whatever was necessary to achieve their objective of ousting Q from X&#8217;s life. Ms Weston KC submitted that there was no reason in law to depart from the principle that the burden of proof lay on those who assert. It was manifestly contrary to public policy to make the declarations sought because any disaffected parent could throw a child&#8217;s life into chaos by making unfounded allegations.

The common law was the starting point unless compliance with the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref> had been proved by Q. Here, the fundamental truth of biological parenthood had been established so the burden lay on Q to displace the common law principle that F was also the legal parent of X. X&#8217;s birth certificate was no more than prima facie evidence of parentage and could not be determinative. Once a dispute arose as to the method of X&#8217;s conception, the court had to determine this as a matter of fact. If the court could not make a positive finding about the circumstances of X&#8217;s conception, Miss MacLynn asserted that the court had to fall back upon the common law to establish X&#8217;s parentage &#8211; F would be both her biological and legal father.</p>

This is not a case where, as in almost all of the other cases involving same-sex couples, the threat to Q&#8217;s status as a legal parent arises from the mistake of a clinic as to whether or not the relevant consents to AI were obtained.

Thus, in this case, Q consented to assisted reproduction using F&#8217;s sperm by the placing of that inside P using a means other than a penis. She did not consent to natural intercourse between P and F as this was not assisted reproduction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to recognise that some births follow treatment at licensed clinics and others originate from informal arrangements, as Peter Jackson J (as he then was) acknowledged in para 8 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">M v F &amp; H (Legal Paternity)</span> (see above). Informal arrangements which amount to assisted reproduction involve the placing of sperm inside a gestational mother by means other than sexual intercourse (as conventionally understood between a man and a woman). If a child is conceived and born as a result of such an informal arrangement, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.42</ref> &#8211; without challenge - operates to clothe the non-gestational parent with legal status as a parent to that child. Of course, it would be unrealistic not to recognise that informal and consensual arrangements might also involve sexual intercourse between a sperm donor and the gestational mother but this would not be assisted reproduction. In those circumstances, where two women are married or in a civil partnership and a child was conceived and born as a result of sexual intercourse, the legal parenthood of the non-gestational parent conferred by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.42</ref> of the HFEA would remain intact if there was no challenge by either the sperm donor and/or the gestational mother. It is, however, a status more apparent than real and built on shaky foundations.  Unsurprisingly, it is capable of being displaced if the sperm donor and the gestational mother come forward at a later date to attest to natural intercourse or a lack of consent at the time the child was conceived. This is why informal and consensual arrangements resulting in the birth of a child are often not straightforward in their legal effect and, when relationships between the adults break down, can render a non-gestational parent vulnerable to status challenges just like the one mounted in this case.</p>

Determination of the facts will provide clarity as to X&#8217;s legal parentage which will be to her benefit throughout childhood and adulthood. I draw a distinction between that clarity about legal parentage and X&#8217;s lived reality as a child brought up by her biological mother and by Q who is also her parent, psychologically and emotionally speaking. That reality will not change for X even though the words on her birth certificate might. This lived reality is often forgotten in the focus on legal parentage which is but one aspect of a child&#8217;s identity. I thus find that determination will be of benefit to X&#8217;s identity legally speaking yet it will be unlikely to change her lived experience to date or in the future given that P states unequivocally that she wishes Q to remain involved in X&#8217;s life. </p>

It is common ground that P was desperate to conceive and have a child and that both she and Q intended to be parents to that child. Both agreed that P should become pregnant using assisted reproduction &#8211; here, artificial insemination &#8211; rather than that she should have natural intercourse with a sperm donor. It was this means of conception to which Q consented. P had researched and discovered that, because they were married, Q would be deemed to be a parent of that child by operation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.42</ref> of the HFEA. Both P and Q agreed that P had become depressed after the first two attempts at AI had failed. Q also knew about P&#8217;s earlier pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse with a man and that, when in a state of emotional turmoil, P had been unfaithful to her. Both confirmed that P&#8217;s parents were abroad at the relevant time and that P would visit and look after their property during this time. </p>

Q was more reliable because she candidly admitted facts which went against her own interests. The differences between the respective accounts of P and Q as to what happened during the third attempt at AI were telling and made me prefer Q&#8217;s evidence as to what had occurred. P could not really account for discrepancies between her written and oral evidence on this matter and, taken as a whole, her evidence about this event was tainted by her eagerness to downplay the significance of the last attempt at AI. I concluded this was so because P thought it would boost her case that X had been conceived by NI rather than AI. Additionally, the conditions in which P might be unfaithful  to Q and be so in an attempt to conceive were established on the evidence. P had sought relief from emotional turmoil in the past by seeking sexual relief from others and she knew she had conceived a child from sexual intercourse with a previous male partner. Further, there was a convenient and private location in which P and F could be sexually intimate. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Weston KC came close to suggesting that the account of sexual intimacy between P and F had been fabricated by both of them to excise Q from X&#8217;s life.

P explained why it was she had not raised this issue before the end of 2022: put simply, she did not appreciate its significance and had every reason not to tell Q because of the huge distress this revelation would cause. P raised it at the end of 2022 with her lawyers and was then referred to specialist lawyers who advised her as to the making of an application. </p>

He has played almost no role in X&#8217;s life and seen her on less than 5 occasions. Though he was evasive about his knowledge of the legal proceedings and almost dismissive of Q&#8217;s role in X&#8217;s life, F had not previously involved himself in X&#8217;s life and was consistent in saying he did not want to be drawn into the battle between P and Q. Despite poor recall of minor detail, F was very clear that he had had sexual intercourse with P each time they had met in her parents&#8217; home. His account tallies with and reinforces P&#8217;s own account which is entirely in keeping with the undisputed evidence about her emotional state and beliefs at the relevant time. </p>

The occasions on which they had sexual intercourse were within the conception window identified by the menstrual tracker used by P and Q to determine when insemination might best achieve conception. P found out she was pregnant two weeks after the last occasion of AI but I am unable to find, on the balance of probabilities, whether X was conceived by AI or by NI. Q did not consent to natural intercourse between P and F but only to artificial insemination using F&#8217;s sperm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was much debate in oral submissions about the burden of proof though I found much of what was said did not illuminate that particular issue. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S. 42</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref> creates a rebuttable presumption that consent exists in cases of marriage and civil partnership and, on any analysis, that assisted reproduction is the method of conception. The presumption can be rebutted by evidence which shows that consent has not been given and/or, on my analysis, that assisted reproduction may not have occurred. In this case, the burden of proof lay on P to produce that evidence. This is straightforward, entirely conventional, and in accordance with the Court of Appeal&#8217;s decision in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In re S (Children)</span> (see above). In this case, I have found, on the balance of probabilities, that Q did not consent to anything other than assisted reproduction but the method of X&#8217;s conception was unclear because P and F had natural intercourse during the relevant conception window. In those circumstances, the presumption of Q&#8217;s legal parenthood is rebutted and the common law position applies. </p>

The evidential burden on P and, to a lesser extent, on F in this case does not equate, as Miss MacLynn KC suggested, to an impermissible presumption of legitimacy or parentage for same-sex couples such as P and Q.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">The situation under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref> is different. The wording of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref> is that &#8220;the other party to the civil partnership or marriage is to be treated as a parent of the child unless it is shown that she did not consent to the placing in W (etc)&#8221;. This provision creates a status of parenthood, with a presumption that is similar in nature to the common law presumption of legitimacy but it does not create a presumption of consent. The rebuttal does not take the form of showing that the spouse or civil partner is not the biological parent, as is the case under section 26, but of showing that she has not consented to the procedure undertaken. The presumption and the means of rebutting it are therefore not symmetrical, as they are in the case of common law legitimacy, and it would therefore be wrong to construe <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref> as if the presumption of parentage falls away as soon as any evidence of absence of consent, however weak, is led. Further, the section does not refer, as section 26 does, to the possibility of the presumption being rebutted by &#8220;evidence which shows that it is more probable than not (etc)&#8221;, a description that is particularly apt for scientific test results. The true position therefore is that the presumption of parentage under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref> will prevail unless and until it is proved the spouse or civil partner did not consent to the procedure undertaken. In practice, as Lord Reid said, the court is likely to be able to determine the issue (here, consent) on the evidence, but it will only be where absence of consent is proved on the balance of probabilities that the statutory presumption of parentage will lose its important effect.&#8221;</span></p>
