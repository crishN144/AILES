	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 29 May 2015 I heard an urgent application relating to the medical treatment of a gravely ill 10-month old child. Because the matter arose during the vacation, was urgent and was not, in the event, contentious, the hearing, which lasted for about 90 minutes, took place by telephone conference call. In accordance with the usual arrangements, the hearing was recorded and the proceedings have subsequently been transcribed, though only after some delay. At the end of the hearing, I indicated that, subject to certain amendments, which in the event were agreed, I proposed to make an order in the terms sought. The precise terms of the order were finalised later the same day. It is set out in an Annex. I now give my reasons for making that order.</p>

He is the much loved child of his parents, who are devoted to him and understandably deeply distressed by their son&#8217;s condition and the agonising situation in which they all find themselves. Both parents have their own difficulties, each having a diagnosed learning disability. Father&#8217;s FS IQ is assessed at 61, mother&#8217;s at 60. Father has capacity to litigate, the mother does not. </p>

An interim care order was made at the case management hearing a few days later. The only relevance of this for present purposes is to explain the involvement of the local authority in the proceedings before me. For the effect of the interim care order is, of course, that the local authority shares parental responsibility for Jake in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

He remained in hospital until 11 December 2014, when he was discharged into the care of foster carers. On 2 March 2015, he was unresponsive when his foster carer tried to wake him, although his breathing appeared normal. On waking, he had a prolonged seizure. He was admitted to hospital again. Nine days later, on 11 March 2015, he was transferred to the London Teaching Hospital where he had spent much of the time the previous year and where he remains. Since October 2014 Dr W has been the consultant paediatric neurologist there responsible for his care. She has 12 years consultant experience. She works mainly in the complex epilepsy service, investigating and managing the medical needs and epilepsy of children like Jake.  </p>

A large number of tests have been done to try and find the cause of Jake&#8217;s epilepsy and other problems. So far many results have been normal. I have this week received a genetic result which may be important but which needs some further exploration (I have asked blood from both parents to be tested) in order to understand what it may mean for Jake and his parents. I have also made a referral to Dr J, Consultant Clinical Geneticist, who will help to interpret the results from Jake and both parents when they become available in a few weeks time.&#8221;</p>

It is unlikely that Jake will be able to manage without the help of a gastrostomy tube in the long term.</p>

He does not smile but is comforted with cuddles and physical contact.&#8221;</p>

As time goes on, his developmental potential will become easier to predict.

In my view, the severity of Jake&#8217;s epilepsy and neuro-developmental status is such that a prediction of life expectancy is likely to fall somewhere between Dravet and Ohtahara syndromes.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Goals of treatment are to minimise the impact of the epileptic seizures and movement disorder so that Jake is not distressed by them, is able to maintain his airway, blood pressure and blood oxygen levels as well as possible, and to minimise any harm or side effects caused by medication or other treatments.  A number of different epilepsy medications have been tried without success to date and dietary treatment started last week in an effort to improve seizure control and be able to reduce Jake&#8217;s medication. Further medications may be tried in the future. Jake&#8217;s father has requested I ask for a second opinion from my neurology colleagues at Great Ormond Street Hospital with regard to diagnosis, prognosis and treatment plans. I have made the referral.</p>

However if after review by the medical team and discussion with multidisciplinary colleagues and those with parental responsibility, it is considered that further intervention would be futile or harmful, such medical interventions may be limited. Treatment decisions are discussed in an ongoing way with those holding parental responsibility and as far as possible the views of Jake&#8217;s parents and all carers are considered.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Jake has continued to have seizures and abnormal movements episodically many times per day. He is currently being nursed in a high dependency environment next to the nurses&#8217; station on our children&#8217;s neurology ward. When he is settled and asleep, he has pink lips, his breathing is regular and his heart rate and blood pressure are normal. When he is disturbed or wakes, Jake wriggles immediately and the movements of his arms and legs are uncontrolled and involuntary. He seems to be comforted when his parents speak to him or stroke him. He often has more violent movements with twitching of his face which we think are probably seizures. Over the past 5 days Jake has stopped breathing with these sometimes. He has also had pauses in his breathing without obvious seizures. At the beginning of this week, these episodes would recover quickly with some extra oxygen given through a mask and some tickling or gentle poking. Yesterday Jake needed extra help when his breathing stopped and his lips turned blue &#8211; he needed bag and mask ventilation on several occasions. Today he has again needed this help but his heart rate has also been very slow at times with these seizures.  </p>

Medication is likely to be adjusted from time to time. It is extremely unlikely that involuntary movements or seizures can be controlled, given the drug resistant nature of these symptoms to date. The goal of medical treatment is therefore to provide symptom control as far as possible, limiting the impact of seizures/movement disorder on Jake&#8217;s wellbeing.&#8221;</p>

From a diagnostic perspective he had no additional investigations to suggest apart from considering a repeat Brain MRI. This is likely to require a general anaesthetic and since then Jake has been too medically unstable for this. We are currently exploring the option of performing a very limited Brain MRI without the need for GA. It was Prof S&#8217;s view that further imaging was unlikely to offer diagnostic information but may provide additional information regarding brain growth (or lack of) which would possibly help the family to understand the progressive nature of Jake&#8217;s underlying condition. From a management perspective, Prof S felt that regular epilepsy medication should be minimised in order to reduce potential side effects, and that seizures should not be aggressively managed unless life-threatening.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Since preparing my initial report &#8230; , Jake&#8217;s condition has deteriorated. I refer to my medical report dated 21 May 2015 which sets out how this deterioration originally manifested itself. Since that time there has been further deterioration in Jake&#8217;s condition. On Saturday 23 May a Midazolam infusion was started because of seizures which were becoming more frequent, more prolonged and often associated with apnoea requiring bag and mask ventilation for short periods. Jake was also vomiting frequently and his gastrostomy feeds were discontinued. His medications were adjusted to be given intravenously (necessitating the insertion of a peripheral cannula) so that he is now receiving both Midazolam and Clonidine (a movement disorder and sedative drug) via continuous infusions.&#8221;</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The Trust is concerned that Jake has a progressive underlying condition because of his increasing symptoms and an increasing burden of medical treatment (more medications at higher doses and given more invasively) at a very young age. His life expectancy is further reduced in the light of this continued clinical deterioration, in particular the need for bag and mask ventilation at times. Although seizures and abnormal movements have settled over the past three days, this is very unlikely to be sustained in the longer term. Jake&#8217;s condition is unpredictable and an acute deterioration could occur at anytime necessitating escalating treatment that the team believe would not be in Jake&#8217;s best interests because it would be invasive, potentially painful, burdensome and is not going to cure Jake&#8217;s underlying condition or improve his quality of life. As a result, and due to the fact that there could be an imminent deterioration at any time, the clinical team believes that it is necessary to make this application as a matter of urgency.&#8221;</p>

All appropriate measures to treat and relieve the child&#8217;s pain and distress should be taken.

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;the fact that, sadly, both the father and, to a greater extent, the mother have their own difficulties is absolutely no reason at all why their views, their wishes, their feelings should not be taken fully into account by everybody involved in the process, whether treating clinicians or lawyers. Of course they have been fully involved in the process throughout, very properly, by the treating clinicians. [I emphasise] the point that the fact that the parents may lack capacity does not in any way &#8230; reduce the importance of listening to &#8211; whether it is the lawyers listening to or the doctors listening to &#8211; the views of the parents.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The fact is, on the fundamentals, these parents, faced with this dreadful situation, very much understand the fundamental dilemmas and the fundamental problems. In relation to the fundamentals, they are, so far as I am aware, in just as good a position as any other parent to have views and to express those views. I would be very concerned if the thought &#8230; got about that somehow one pays less attention in these terrible and tragic circumstances to the views, wishes and feelings of parents just because they may have limitations than one would to other parents.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;forgive me, I cannot remember, but I think it was the father, but forgive me if I have got it wrong and it was the mother, in effect said at one point that he could not come to a decision.  That, if I may say so, is a very human and very understandable feeling for him to have. It has got nothing to do with his capacity. It is simply a reflection of the tragic situation in which he finds himself as a parent. There are, I suspect, many parents in this situation who, even if they did not have the difficulties which the father has, would find themselves in exactly the same situation. Indeed those of us who have been involved in these cases for as long as some of us have been will be familiar, from memory or anecdote, of many cases where parents facing these tragic circumstances in effect say &#8220;We cannot bring ourselves to decide. We want to leave it to others.&#8221;</p>

It is a terrible position for any parent to be in. It is a tragic position, and, as I say, my heart goes out, not only to Jake but also to the parents.  I have no doubt at all that all that either the father or the mother want to do is to do the very best for their much beloved son.  The tragedy is that, even with all the miracles of modern medical science, there is distressingly little we can do.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In some children, continuing treatment may prolong life significantly. Yet it may be in their best interests to consider limiting it if there is no overall benefit in prolonging life because of the adverse impact entailed. In entering discussions about treatment limitation it is important to acknowledge the importance of the value that the child and his/her parents place upon their life and their view of its quality for that child, regardless of disability. These discussions may arise in the context of the burdens imposed by a child&#8217;s illness and/or the treatments that the child is already receiving or that are proposed, their inability to benefit from treatments, or a combination of all three.</p>

However if such treatment can only be delivered at the expense of compromising the child&#8217;s consciousness, for example, by deep sedation, its potential benefit may be significantly reduced. Other examples of particularly high impact treatments include ECMO, renal dialysis and, sometimes, intensive chemotherapy.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Here the severity and impact of the child&#8217;s underlying condition is in itself sufficient to produce such pain and distress as to overcome the potential or actual overall benefits in sustaining life. Some children have such severe degrees of illness associated with pain, discomfort and distress that life is judged by them (or on their behalf if they are unable to express their wishes and views) to be intolerable. All appropriate measures to treat and relieve the child&#8217;s pain and distress should be taken. If, despite these measures, it is genuinely believed that there is no overall benefit in continued life, further LST should not be provided, for example, in advanced treatment-resistant malignancy, severe epidermolysis bullosa.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In other children the nature and severity of the child&#8217;s underlying condition may make it difficult or impossible for them to enjoy the benefits that continued life brings. Examples include children in Persistent Vegetative State (PVS), Minimally Conscious State, or those with such severe cognitive impairment that they lack demonstrable or recorded awareness of themselves or their surroundings and have no meaningful interaction with them, as determined by rigorous and prolonged observations. Even in the absence of demonstrable pain or suffering, continuation of LST may not be in their best interests because it cannot provide overall benefit to them. Individuals and families may differ in their perception of benefit to the child and some may view even severely limited awareness in a child as sufficient grounds to continue LST. It is important, here as elsewhere, that due account of parental views wishes and preferences is taken and due regard given to the acute clinical situation in the context of the child&#8217;s overall situation.</p>

For example, a child or infant in intensive care may have sustained such significant brain injury that future life may provide little benefit, while both intensive treatment and future life are likely to cause the child substantial pain and distress.&#8221;</p>
