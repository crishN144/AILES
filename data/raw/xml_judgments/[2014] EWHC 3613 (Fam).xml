They were married in France on 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 1997 having, in the month beforehand, signed a conventional French marriage contract adopting the regime of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">separation de biens</span><span style="font-size:14pt">.    Two of their children who I have mentioned, were born shortly before the parties moved to London in 2000.  In the year 2000 the parties came to this country where the husband&#8217;s work had taken him.  Their third child, who I have mentioned, was born in 2001.  In June 2010 the husband moved out of the former matrimonial home to a rented flat in West London.  There is some dispute as to whether that signified an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, but the parties were, in factual terms, separated from that point.  Nine months after the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">de facto</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> separation, the husband issued judicial separation proceedings in Nanterre in France.  He did this on 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March 2011.</span></p>

These proceedings sought an order under that section declaring the nature, extent and realisation of his interest in the former matrimonial home in London.   This act by the husband in commencing property proceedings here only serves to demonstrate the most unhappy state of affairs where there are competing proceedings both in England and France, but in relation to the proceedings that had been begun in England, one of the sets of proceedings has been begun by the husband himself, notwithstanding his strong wish that the parties should be divorced in France and there should be a French judicial allocation following such divorce of their resources.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I return to the French proceedings. On 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2012 the husband, without having procured the discontinuance of his French judicial separation proceedings, issued proceedings for divorce there.

The reason, from which Mr. Cook did not demur  when I put it to him, that the husband sought to issue the French divorce petition during the pendency of the judicial separation proceedings rather than following the discontinuance of the French judicial separation proceedings, was to avoid a hiatus between the end of the judicial separation proceedings and the issue of French divorce proceedings during which hiatus the wife might have been able to have &#8220;nipped in&#8221;, if I might use that phrase, and issued a valid English divorce petition.  Such is the nature of the manoeuvres that have bedevilled this case over more than four years. </span></p>

All that took place within those judicial separation proceedings was an extremely leisurely engagement with the French notary who had been directed to produce his report, as I have mentioned, on 15</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2012.  It is obvious from the chronology that the husband took an extremely relaxed view about the progress of the French judicial separation proceedings.  The reason for this is again not difficult to understand because for as long as the judicial separation proceedings were in being, the wife was prevented from issuing any divorce proceedings here in England, or at least so he believed.  That of course was the very reason why the wife had consented to the dismissal of her first English divorce petition by King J. on 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2012.</span></p>

The week before that, on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2014 the wife applied ex parte to Moor J., to seek to obtain some kind of proleptic decree or declaration that her divorce petition when issued would only take effect at one minute past midnight on 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2014.  Mr. Justice Moor was not prepared to make such an innovative and, to my mind, unprecedented order which would have been in all respects counter-factual, providing for something to happen in the future that had not in fact happened in the future.  The reason for the wife seeking this imaginative order is obvious.  It was again to avoid the possibility of being a victim of a hiatus - a hiatus that would have been created against her interests by virtue of the United Kingdom being in the western most time zone in the European Union.</span></p>

This the husband did in France at 8.20 a.m. (local time).  That was of course 7.20 a.m. British Summer Time, a time of day when it would have been impossible for the wife to have filed a divorce petition in this country.  So it can be seen that the husband was very well aware of the perils, as he saw it, of a hiatus arising, and was extremely astute to ensure that his petition was filed first.  In fact at that time the wife had an outstanding petition on the court file here, as I have explained.  It is debatable whether she would have needed permission to have filed a yet further petition - I have not researched that - but the chronology I have set out demonstrates that the husband was at all times extremely aware of the advantage of the French time-zone, and that he took advantage of it so as to ensure that any petition filed following the expiry of the judicial separation proceedings would be his and would be in France. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">This is a sorry tale of manoeuvring in the face of the seemingly inflexible jurisdiction rules in relation to divorces which are contained in Brussels II Revised.  It is a remarkable and regrettable fact that Brussels II Revised contains within Article 15 a procedure which allows a court which has jurisdiction to transfer the case in question to another court within the European Union if it is better placed to hear it, but that power is available only in relation to children&#8217;s cases.  There is no comparable provision within Brussels II Revised which allows a court to transfer a divorce to the courts of another member state on the basis that the courts of that latter member state would be best placed to hear the case. Nor to my knowledge are there any proposals to alter Brussels II Revised to incorporate such a power, notwithstanding that the new Judgments Regulation No.1215/2012, which will take effect on 10</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January 2015, contains, by virtue of Recitals 23 and 24 and Articles 33 and 34, a comparable provision to Article 15 of Brussels II Revised enabling the court to stay proceedings on the basis that another jurisdiction was better placed to hear the case.  So one can see that in relation to divorce cases the anomalous situation arises that there are no powers, in contrast to civil claims and children claims, to achieve a transfer to a court which is better placed to hear the case or otherwise is a more convenient forum.  It is in the face of this iron inflexibility that the parties in divorce cases engage in such extensive, expensive and futile manoeuvres as have been demonstrated in this case. </span></p>

Unless such a principle were maintained, then it would be possible to issue proceedings otherwise than in good faith solely for the purposes of creating a legal filibuster.  In this regard Mr. Amos draws support from the decision of Hedley J. in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">C v S</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> [2011] 2 FLR, 19.  In that case the Italian husband had filed for judicial separation proceedings but had, in effect, shelved them. Hedley J. decided that in such circumstances there were no effective established Italian proceedings which vested in the Italian Court exclusive jurisdiction.  He also determined that in fact there had not been proper service and therefore the Italian court had never in fact been seised for the purposes of Article 16 of Brussels II Revised. </span></p>

Certainly, I have come to the conclusion that Art 19 must be read purposively and, in my judgment, for a court to remain seised of a matter, there must in fact be existing proceedings before it. To construe the Article in any other way is potentially to make a nonsense of it by a court being seised of a matter about which it can do nothing unless a party revives it. If one took a jurisdiction like England and Wales, where strike-outs are not the subject of time limits, it could have an entirely absurd effect. For Art 19 to bear real meaning, in my judgment, it is essential that there be proceedings which can be properly described as &#8216;existing&#8217; before the court at the relevant date.&#8221;</span></p>

Can it be properly argued that the jurisdiction of the French court has been &#8220;established&#8221;?         Mr. Amos argues that the verb &#8220;established&#8221; must mean more than the simple filing of proceedings in the other court.  It must surely import, he argues, an obligation to progress those proceedings with due diligence, and expedition, particularly given that the subject matter of the proceedings, divorce, is so personally and emotionally taxing on the litigants concerned.   He says that any other interpretation would enable people in divorce proceedings to file the equivalent of the notorious Italian torpedo and in effect prevent the necessary expeditious resolution of the disputes between the parties in circumstances where the avoidance of delay is one of the pillars on which Brussels II was originally erected. </span></p>

In those circumstances I am clearly of the view that it would not be appropriate for this court to take any steps to advance the progress of the main suit or the ancillary claim made within it for equitable distribution or spousal support.  The stay must extend to a prohibition on giving directions as to the progress of the ancillary claim, and also prevents me, in my view, from directing that there should be an FDR which is a species of judicial mediation.  I say that with a certain amount of regret because, as must be obvious from what I have said hitherto, this is a case that is crying out for a consensual and, if necessary, mediated solution.  Mrs. Justice King begged the parties to resolve their differences and similar sentiments have been expressed recently by Moor J.
