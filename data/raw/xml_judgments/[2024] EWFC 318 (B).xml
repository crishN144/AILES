The entire focus of this hearing has been on the allegations that C, during 2023, when she was six years old, was sexually abused by either her mother (&#8220;M&#8221;), her uncle (&#8220;P&#8221;) or both. The evidence in support of this allegation is that on 8 June 2023 C tested positive for gonorrhoea. C contracted gonorrhoea when she was living with her grandmother and her partner. C was having some contact with her mother during this period. C&#8217;s uncle, P, was also living in C&#8217;s household. The uncle was notified that he had tested positive for gonorrhoea by text message on 25 May 2023 and the mother received a positive result on 14 June 2023. It is alleged that C had contracted the infection as a result of having been sexually abused.</span></p>

The father was convicted of criminal damage in 2020 and the same year was convicted of battery. C&#8217;s parents separated in 2021. As a result of the mother struggling with her mental health both children moved to stay with their maternal grandmother and her partner on 5 May 2023. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">C has made no allegation, of having been sexually abused, against either her mother or her uncle. There is no evidence to suggest that C has made any comment or suggestion that either adult has done anything that could be construed as sexual abuse. C refused a detailed examination and there are limited results from the attempt to achieve one. The evidence the local authority seeks to rely on is that it asks the court to draw an inference that C has been sexually abused because she has tested positive for gonorrhoea. Any abuse must have occurred between 5 May 2023 and prior to the incubation period for the infection, 18 to 28 May 2023.</span></p>

Inevitably, within the home environment, there are unlikely to be witnesses. The investigative process must track down ascertainable facts from the broadest canvas available and, where possible, draw such inferences as those facts will support. It is frequently a difficult tasks, but it is not one that can be shirked. The danger in failing to confront it is that an innocent individual may be tainted by a finding that has a direct impact, both on her and on the child. A finding which leaves a parent in a pool of perpetrators is likely to adversely influence the nature and extent of the contact arrangements or indeed, on where and with whom the child will live in the future. Of course, the imperative of child protection must not generate a reason to burden unsatisfactory evidence with a greater weight than it can legitimately support. That would create an injustice to all, not least the subject children, but neither does it absolve the Judge of the responsibility to confront the findings that the evidence properly establishes. The same obligation for forensic rigour applies to the lawyers.&#8221;</span></p>

He says in his statement that he is unclear the exact dates things happened in June, but he was sure that it was a Wednesday that he noticed a symptom of gonorrhoea which he described as a small amount of green gunk around his penis. During his evidence he said he noticed this during the day when he was drinking in his room with his mate whilst his friend had gone downstairs to get glasses. He does not amplify in his statement what he then did. When he gave evidence, he said he discovered it in the bathroom when he was sitting on the toilet. He says that he sat down on the toilet to urinate and wiped his penis with a tissue or something and threw it into the toilet. He said he then had a shower and cleaned himself again when the discharge continued. He said he shouted to his mother to inform her that he had got green gunk on his &#8220;dick.&#8221;</span></p>

It is significant that this story only became part of P&#8217;s evidence after he would have been aware of the expert evidence. It did not form part of P&#8217;s evidence up to the date of the final hearing as there was no mention of it in his statement. If he is to be believed, he was drinking in his room with his friend, he left the room at some point to use the toilet upon which he sat down to urinate. He discovered green discharge and used a tissue to wipe his penis clean. He then shouted, through the house, that he had green gunk on his, &#8220;dick&#8221;. He initially said that he returned to his friend but then said he showered while his friend waited for him in the bedroom. Despite the discharge continuing he failed to attend the walk-in until the following day on his way home from work. No documentary evidence has been produced to support this account. The friend has not provided evidence. Most importantly, there is evidence (accepted by P) that he was informed by text that he had the infection on 25 May which contradicts his timeline.  The fact that P discovered his infection in May, not June, is supported by the maternal grandmother who said in her evidence that her son told her he had discharge from his penis in mid May. </span></p>

In my view it is likely that P has created a narrative which he thinks would tie in with the timings of the discovery of symptoms in C. P would be unlikely to understand the flaw in this explanation which is that it is most unlikely that C could have incubated the infection in this short period, sufficiently to show symptoms simultaneously with himself, so if this was his plan, it was destined to fail.

The collective evidence supports that the germ can survive on a surface for up to 12 hours in moist conditions. A damp towel located within a bathroom which is poorly ventilated and in which condensation forms, and is visible, is such a moist environment. For C to have contracted the infection from a fomite source, the germ must have been deposited on a surface and survived for a long enough period for C to come into contact with it. The germ must then have been conveyed to one of her mucus membranes for the infection to enter her body. This could be achieved directly by the object having been inserted into the body with such depth that it touches the membrane. In the case of the eye, this could be achieved by wiping the eye with an infected towel or by self infection from touching an infected part of the body and then touching the eye. In the case of the vulva, the infection would have had to have entered C&#8217;s vestibule area. It has been suggested that the germ could have survived on the toilet seat and then conveyed to C. If C had sat on the toilet seat within such proximity for the germ to have survived, it would still have had to enter her body. This is imaginable in the case of the eye. For the germ to be found in the vulva it would have had to be digitally inserted into the body. The evidence does not exclude the possibility of C&#8217;s eye and her vulva having been infected at the same time. Alternatively, either could have been infected before the other.</span></p>

The local authority points to aspects of P&#8217;s profile which it says paints a picture of someone who may commit sexual abuse against a young child. This is pure conjecture. The evidence in this case paints a picture of P as a person with low sexual standards. The manner in which P has conducted himself throughout the proceedings evidence someone who has little or no respect for authority: someone who admits to dealing drugs and collecting drug debts by stealing. Accepting P&#8217;s explanation as to how the infection passed is to accept that P continued to live in house with young children when he knew he was infectious with a sexual disease. While living in the house, P took few if any precautions not to pass the infection onto others. In fact, he continued with his usual low standards of hygiene of carelessly using towels and leaving infected clothing and bedding lying around.</span></p>

She is the mother of two children who have been placed in care in circumstances where one is thought to have been sexually abused by the mother&#8217;s brother. It is possible that a mother in those circumstances would want the truth to be established, for the sake of her children, unless she was afraid of that truth. The mother&#8217;s conduct is at best reprehensible and at worse an attempt to prevent this court from establishing what has happened to her daughter. I have regard to the fact that the timing is such that C </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">could</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> have caught gonorrhoea from her mother. I note that the mother&#8217;s contact with the children has been limited and there is no evidence to suggest the mother has a sexual interest in young children. The mother is, however, sexually promiscuous. The mother attended court on the final day of the hearing no doubt assuming that she would not be called to give evidence. It was only after she was told that her attendance meant that she would be called to give evidence that she left the court building without excuse or explanation. </span></p>

As I have stated above, it would not serve the welfare of either child for a finding to be made purely on the basis the mother refused to give evidence.
