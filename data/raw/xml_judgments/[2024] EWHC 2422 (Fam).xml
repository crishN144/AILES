In other words, applying the Article 15 BIIA ratio in <span style="font-style:italic">Child and Family Agency v D (R intervening) (ECJ)</span> [2017] 2 WLR 949 any proposed transfer will provide a genuine added value on the specific facts of the case. </p>

In summary, the father is both a Canadian and British national. V who was born in London similarly holds a Canadian and British Nationality.

Subsequently in May 2019 they moved to Malta. As was found by McDonald J in the aforementioned judgment, the father travelled to London with V in December 2021 and wrongfully retained him in England until the court ordered his summary return to Malta under the provisions of 1980 Hague Convention at the conclusion of the said hearing.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">V returned to Malta with his mother in April 2022. By June of the same year the parties were engaged in litigation about V&#8217;s welfare interests in the courts of Malta. The litigation has since continued involving a number of applications by the parties including the father&#8217;s application for V to live with the father in the UK. The mother has since settled in a relationship with a Maltese nation and has a two year child. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings in Malta have suffered a most regrettable delay that are in part due the sad personal circumstances of the learned judge who is allocated to the case. Until now, there have been at least five hearings or decisions that have included measures for the interim arrangements were V regularly sees his father and a recent decision in July that was to adjourn an application on considering the papers. The case is now listed for a hearing in October of this year, where the father is expected to adduce his evidence in support of his applications. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The father issued his application to this court in July when it first came before Morgan J who gave directions including a request for information from the Maltese court to be sought by way of judicial liaison between the respective courts. Unfortunately that information has not yet been requested due to some procedural issues, but neither party seeks an adjournment of this hearing pending the provision of that information. Indeed, they each make a positive case for the resolution of the father&#8217;s application. I agree with their approach and have proceeded to hear submissions on behalf each of the parties. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is no dispute between the parties that the case in Malta have suffered a most regrettable delay and neither party appears to have sought to address this. The father&#8217;s application is borne out of concern for even further delay. In a letter from the firm of lawyers representing him in Malta, it is stated that the proceedings in Malta are likely to continue for  a further two to three years from May 2024. This includes any appeal following the first instance decision of the court in circumstances where there are no requirements to first obtain the court&#8217;s permission to appeal. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The father argues that there has been little progress in the Maltese proceedings and it would be unconscionable and manifestly contrary to V&#8217;s welfare should the proceedings continue for another two or three years. V has expressed a wish to move back to the UK and he is suffering by expecting him to integrate in school where he does not speak the language. He is suffering emotionally and the unresolved applications continue to contribute to the same.  In this context he explains that he has not applied for a transfer from the Maltese courts to those of England and Wales given that it may also be delayed or cause further delay. He argues that even with the pressures on the courts of England and Wales together with the fact that the mother and V live in Malta, the Family Court in this jurisdiction is likely to reach a final decision by the middle of 2025.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother argues that the court is not tasked with making a judgment about the competency of the Maltese courts. There is a hearing that the parties will be shortly attending. The father&#8217;s application hides his real motivation which is to seek an advantage by the transfer of the proceedings, which in the circumstances could have been made to the Maltese courts. She argues that for a significant period V has been living in Malta and any transfer of these proceedings is likely to cause her a disadvantage and she may not be able to obtain legal aid and cannot privately fund ongoing proceedings in the courts of England and Wales. By contrast she has the benefit of legal aid and can properly engage in the proceedings in Malta. She further argues that the  time estimate about the length of proceedings in Malta by the father&#8217;s lawyers are to be treated cautiously and any proceedings in England and Wales are likely to suffer more delay than stated given where mother and child reside.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As part of the proceedings in Malta, the court has commissioned a psychological report of V that in some respects chimes with the father&#8217;s concerns about his behaviour and continuing issues. However in the concluding paragraphs, it is opined that V is suffering with seeking to protect both of his parents and in so doing, he is suffering harm that may have dire consequences for him in the future. His school reports also raise some concern about his degree of integration, the language barriers and his behaviour. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although these issues are most concerning and the delay in the resolution of the proceedings is a significant factor that runs through the father&#8217;s arguments, it is not the function of this court to undertake a welfare analysis of the child but rather to assess if the courts of this jurisdiction can add real value or in Convention terms are better placed to hear the applications.  I am not satisfied that this jurisdiction is better placed to hear the case. Arguably there is some prospect of the courts of this jurisdiction reaching an earlier decision, but this is speculative given the challenges that this would entail. Further, in light of the parties expressed concerns about delay, I am staggered that neither appears to have made any attempts to resolve the proceedings more expeditiously or to adduce any evidence as to why this would not be possible. There is no evidence before the court that the current listed hearing in October is at jeopardy and I strongly encourage the parties to reflect on the conclusions of the psychological report and take all necessary steps to resolve their differences as soon possible. </p>
