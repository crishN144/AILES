I have long considered this to be a confusing and unfortunate approach. Family lawyers would be better served by a freestanding all-encompassing rule within the FPR obviating the need to cross- refer to the CPR. I do urge that this can be considered by Rules Committee and revisited. </p>

He submits that in this case very unusually in the context of an application for leave the applicant finds herself at risk of an order for costs been made against her. He explains that he considers this unusual because in the &#8220;vast majority of cases in this sphere&#8221; applications for leave are determined &#8220;administratively&#8221; without any notice to the respondent whatsoever, still less with their active involvement at the leave stage. Whilst he accepts that the Court had an overall discretion to list the hearing of the leave application on notice he urges me to take into account that the Applicant had no influence over my decision and yet the consequences are that she is now exposed on costs in a manner which she would not have been had her application for the been dealt with administratively.</p>

He urges that this was a straightforward Part III application in Leeds and did not justify the retention of London lawyers and further that attendances at hearings did not require the support of instructing solicitors given the seniority of Counsel employed. He also drew a direct comparison between Mr Sirikanda&#8217;s and Miss Baronns&#8217; fees and his own which in each case was broadly double.</p>
