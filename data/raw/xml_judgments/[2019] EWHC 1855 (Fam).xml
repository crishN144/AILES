They have provided him with loving, stable and consistent care of a very high standard. The local authority proposed that AA should remain in their care for the remainder of his minority subject to a special guardianship order made in favour of Mr and Mrs C. This plan was supported by the foster carers and the children&#8217;s guardian. AA is very keen to remain living with them. </p>

Similarly in her final analysis the guardian had changed her provisional view in favour of a special guardianship order. She advised the court there were clear child welfare reasons for not making a special guardianship order and there were powerful reasons in AA&#8217;s best interests for the court to make him subject of a care order. </p>

The disagreements about the way forward in the welfare best interests of AA between Mr and Mrs C and the guardian, on the one hand, and the local authority, on the other, had been resolved. The foster carers were content for a SGO to be made in their favour and the guardian now considered this order, underpinned by the agreed SGSP, was in AA&#8217;s best interest. I agreed and made the SGO. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">&#8220;In March 2017 local authorities in England were looking after 72,670 children, a figure which has been rising steadily for the past nine years. They do so either as part of a range of services provided for children in need or under a variety of powers to intervene compulsorily in the family to protect children from harm. 50,470 of those 72,670 children were the subject of care orders, up 10% from the previous year; 16,470 were accommodated without any court order; the balance were subject to various other compulsory powers. In practice, the distinction between these categories is not always clear cut. Some accommodated children in need may also be at risk of harm if they are left at or returned home. In law, however, the distinction is clear. Compulsory intervention in the lives of children and their families requires the sanction of a court process. Providing them with a service does not. This case is about the limits of a local authority&#8217;s powers and duties to provide accommodation for children in need under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>&#8221;) without the sanction of a court order&#8230;.&#8221; </p>

They also illustrate the dilemma posed to the local authority: something has to be done to look after the child but there are serious doubts about whether the parent can validly delegate the exercise of her responsibility. Equally, they illustrate the dangers if the local authority proceed without such delegation or obtain it in circumstances where the parents feel that they have little choice. There are none of the safeguards and protections for both the child and the parents which attend the compulsory procedures under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.

They involve a rigorous scrutiny of the risk of harm to her health and development if an order is not made, of the assessment of her needs and of the plans for her future. Her interests are safeguarded by an expert children&#8217;s guardian. If an order is made, it means that the local authority have parental responsibility for her and can put their plans into effect. But, as pointed out by Judge Rowe QC in <span style="font-style:italic">In re AS </span>(para 30 above) there are also advantages for the parents and for the wider family. The parents are entitled to legal aid. Their rights are safeguarded in the proceedings. Even if a care order is made, the court may make orders about their continued contact with the child. Hence it is scarcely surprising that the President and other judges have deplored the delay in bringing care proceedings in cases where it was obvious that they should have been brought. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 20</ref> must not be used in a coercive way: if the state is to intervene compulsorily in family life, it must seek legal authority to do so. </p>

Notwithstanding the close scrutiny which has been undertaken by senior managers of the local authority and by the director, it has still not been possible to explain why these decisions were not put into action.  It is extremely concerning that when this local authority recognised, as it did on repeated occasions, that it was not acting in the welfare best interests of either these children, it did nothing.  The complete inertia is inexplicable.  Such gross failings by a local authority are intolerable.  EF and GH were denied a voice in the determination of their future care.  The same may be said about their parents.  The boys were both denied the opportunity for clear and focussed planning about their respective futures to be undertaken and for the same to be endorsed by a court.  The early issue of care proceedings would have enabled a decision to be made about their legal status and their future in a structured and timelimited manner.&#8221; </p>

The poor quality of service through this time period is well evidenced by the Ofsted Safeguarding Inspection of October 2016. The "widespread and serious failures" identified not only led to an &#8220;inadequate&#8221; judgment but to the appointment of a Commissioner and a direction for an Alternative Delivery Model to be established. This latter action has been implemented against authorities identified to have had poor services for five years or more. Whilst a comprehensive service improvement plan has been in place since Ofsted&#8217;s report there was no "quick fix" to the longstanding and entrenched problems within the service. High caseloads, poor quality leadership and management and significant challenges in staff recruitment and retention all being key factors of concern.  </p>

It has been suggested to Mr and Mrs [C] that agreement for the downstairs facilities will not be passed unless they sign the Special Guardianship Plan which is outrageous. [AA] is a child who has a deep-rooted fear of the bath owing to his early life experiences. Having to use the bath causes [AA] to become distressed to the point he requires his carers to be with him, which given his age is not something they are comfortable with and they desperately seek for him to gain independence within this area.  </p>

In the event [AA] does not engage with educational provisions post eighteen it is suggested by the Local Authority that financial support and services he may require will need to be paid for by the sum of money he is likely to be awarded from his &#8216;Human Rights Claim&#8217;. This is unacceptable, [AA] is a child who has significant difficulties as a consequence of the Local Authority failing him. The notion of suggesting he should use any compensation money to top up his care between eighteen and twenty-five is improper and raises question to the true empathy and responsibility this Local Authority hold for this particular child </p>

These are now recognised by the local authority. The SGSP provides for these needs to be met now and in the longer term. </p>
