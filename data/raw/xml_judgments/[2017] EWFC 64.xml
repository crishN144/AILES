	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The proceedings are about an eight-month-old baby girl, who I shall call Holly.  She was removed from her mother at birth but returned to her care at the age of six weeks under supervision and since July has lived with her mother at home.  It is now agreed that although the threshold for intervention is crossed on the basis of the past history and future risk, Holly will remain in her mother&#8217;s care with support provided by the local authority, by other agencies and by her father and maternal grandmother.  The only legal issue is whether the arrangement should be underpinned by a care order or a supervision order.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The reason why this hearing has involved five days of evidence is because there is also an underlying factual issue.  Has the mother been using drugs, albeit at a low level, during the past two years?  She adamantly denies doing so and, with one significant exception, the other evidence supports her.  The exception is a body of scientific information from hair strand tests taken over the two-year period, which are interpreted by the testing organisations as showing low-level cocaine use for at least some of the time.  That has been challenged by the mother and I have heard from five expert witnesses: one from each of the three testing organisations, one on behalf of the mother, and one jointly instructed.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Although the issues are now relatively narrow, it was not always so.  Holly was removed at birth because of a positive hair strand test which, set against the background history, led the local authority to argue that she would not be safe in her mother&#8217;s care.  Even after she was returned home, the local authority&#8217;s final case was that she should be removed again and placed for adoption: this plan only changed two days before the hearing began.  It is therefore necessary to consider how this sequence of events came about.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The mother, now in her early 30s, has a long history of drug abuse.  She spent time in local authority care as a teenager, left school without qualifications and by the age of 21 was using heroin and crack cocaine.  In 2007, she underwent detoxification and a 26-week therapeutic rehabilitation programme, but in 2009 she relapsed and by 2011, she was again receiving treatment for use of cannabis, crack cocaine and cocaine.  Predictably, this drug use contributed to her life being chaotic and her parenting unreliable.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Holly is the mother&#8217;s fourth child from three different fathers.  The oldest, a girl, now aged seven, was made the subject of a special guardianship order in favour of her maternal grandmother in 2012.  This child knows her mother and sees her regularly.  The second child, a boy now aged five, was born from an abusive relationship between the mother and a man with drug and alcohol problems.  In his first weeks, the child became the subject of care proceedings that ended with the making of a supervision order in July 2012.  In June 2014, these parents had a second son.  He and his brother, now aged three, were removed from the mother&#8217;s care in July 2015 under a police protection order after she was found with them in the street, incapable after taking cannabis, alcohol and cocaine.  Home conditions were squalid.  New care proceedings were taken and in May 2016, the court heard a substantial amount of evidence, including from Holly&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Guardian, who then acted for the boys and advocated their return to their mother.  The magistrates accepted that the mother had kept off drugs since January 2016, but they did not accept that she was honest about her use in the later part of 2015 and found that the risk of relapse was too high.   The boys were made the subject of care and placement orders, and in October 2016 they were placed together for adoption.  Adoption proceedings, recently issued, will continue in the local court.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Between the removal of the boys and the hearing in May 2016, the mother had undergone hair strand testing carried out by Alere Toxicology in August 2015 (covering the previous three months when she had admittedly been taking drugs), in February 2016 (covering the previous three months), and in May 2016 (covering the previous two months).  The first two tests produced several positive results for cocaine and BE at low or very low levels.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The mother has always accepted using cannabis regularly in the period before the boys were removed.  By that stage, it had become her drug of choice, which she supplemented from time to time with alcohol and cocaine, particularly when under stress.  The 2015 Alere tests showed low to medium quantities of cannabis derivative, and the December 2016 Lextox test showed low findings of cannabinol for just two months (April/May 2016), but all other tests have been negative for cannabis.</span></p>

He has participated in these proceedings, and sees Holly two or three times a week with the mother&#8217;s support.  They remain friends, and his involvement is seen by all as a good thing.</span></p>

She was fully cooperative with the health services and with the local authority.  Information from the antenatal services, from the drug support project WDP, and from Narcotics Anonymous was strongly positive. The mother places particular value on her advanced progress in the 12-step recovery programme.</span></p>

However, on 7 December, the mother underwent a hair strand test approximately covering the period April&#8211;November.  On 16 December, this test was reported as showing the presence of cocaine and a metabolite of cocaine (benzoylecgonine or BE) at a low or very low level.  On the same day, the social worker visited and found the house to be clean and the mother to look well and healthy.  </span></p>

However, following further communications from Lextox, she amended this view, stating that the changes that had been made were superficial and that the mother&#8217;s lack of honesty would make it difficult to monitor the baby&#8217;s needs and leave it at risk of significant harm.</span></p>

Four days after Holly was born, an interim care order was made by the magistrates and she was removed into foster care on the basis that she was at imminent risk of harm.

It is now accepted that she has turned her life around to the point that she is now capable of looking after one child with support.  She says that she has achieved this by avoiding damaging relationships and by complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol.  The local authority argues that the hair strand testing shows that complete abstinence has not been achieved, which raises the level of risk that Holly will get caught up in future drug use of the kind seen in the past.  It also argues that the hair strand tests show that the mother has not been telling the truth and consequently that she cannot be fully trusted.</span></p>

Holly has been making progress with significant support being given to the mother.  That support will be continued until local authority is sure that progress will be sustained: in the past, support was given with the boys, but it was not sustained.  The local authority cannot ignore the history of how the mother struggled with her older children.  A care order is the most appropriate outcome.  If the mother had taken drugs in 2016, that would be very significant and would provide further evidence of the need for the local authority to share parental responsibility, and to give Holly the resources and priority that would result, particularly if the mother moved to live nearer to her own mother.  Ms TB said that the change of care plan was a matter of fine balance, and accepted that they had not been a professionals meeting or liaison with the drugs counsellor Ms LB before the original care plan was formed in August.  She presented a detailed support plan that, she said, would have effect whether the court made a care order or a supervision order.</span></p>

She was happy in most ways with the proposed support plan, but said that there were times in the recent past when she had felt burdened with assistance.  She was anxious about the consequences of a care order, given the local authority&#8217;s past planning.  While she described herself as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;fighting for the boys&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:12pt">, she realistically accepted that it&#8217;s </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;all about [Holly]</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221;.  She described her drug habit up to July 2015 as involving daily use of cannabis with much less frequent use of cocaine.  She had not knowingly taken cocaine since becoming pregnant with Holly.  In May 2016, she had twice slept with a man that she met through NA, but did not continue with this when she realised that he showed signs of using himself.  She confirmed her written evidence about the possibility of contamination through her home furnishings and through the level of contact she had with known users as a support worker at NA.  She said that she felt proud of herself and the people around her for the progress that she made in coming off drugs.  It is frustrating that her account is not accepted on the basis of the hair strand tests.  She can&#8217;t explain them and doesn&#8217;t understand why she has traces in her hair; she is not happy with it and does not think the tests are reliable.  She accepted that in the past she had gone downhill when faced with difficult life events, but in the last two years she had withstood a family bereavement, the orders in relation to the boys, the removal of Holly and the local authority&#8217;s original adoption plan, and kept strong through all of that.  When she felt tempted, she contacted her NA sponsor.  She agreed that it was a risky decision to have taken up with someone with a drug habit, but said that she wanted to feel loved, not just part of a programme.  She also accepted that she should have been more frank with the local authority about an occasion on which a friend had been meant to stay the night, but did not.  She said it would be stupid to go back to drugs as she would risk losing Holly; but, she said, she knew she would not lose her for </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;one blip&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> and that she would admit that if it had happened.

She considered the mother to be is a very good stage in her recovery and, but these proceedings, ready for discharge from the service.  Her level of engagement was absolutely excellent and she now fully recognise the effect of parental substance misuse.  She often visited the mother at home to administer urine tests and had seen an excellent mother/child relationship and nothing untoward.  She had been very shocked by the result of the hair strand tests, given that her own very frequent screenings, many of which were at short notice, had all been negative.  The mother was able to discuss her issues with her, and what most makes her feel low is not being believed.  Ms LB expressed some concern about the turnover of social workers that the mother had experienced since the later stages of her pregnancy, and also about the unusual lack of consultation on the part of the local authority.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Simmonds is a very experienced Guardian, who has also known the mother through the proceedings about the boys.  In these proceedings, he takes a similarly positive view.  Since he first met her in 2015, she has become a changed person.  She has shown him that she can sustain change, not get involved in an abusive relationship, reflect on her failings with her older children and appear to remain clear of drugs.  She has done this despite a number of difficult recent events in her life and has built a good support network around her.  On a fine balance, he favours the making of a supervision order.  A care order with placement at home is unusual for a child of this age, and there might be issues about it running on unnecessarily.  He is also concerned about the message that a care order sends to the mother, who he described as being in many ways a remarkable woman.  If there is a supervision order, the local authority should methodically plan reviews in order to decide whether it needs to be renewed.  He further considers that a high turnover of social workers may lead to inconsistent planning, even though the mother herself can be worked with and is able to be reflective.  Finally, the Guardian accepted that the court had yet to make a decision about the mother&#8217;s more recent drug use or abstinence, but believes that the decision about the legal order should take account of all the aspects of the situation, and not be decided by that matter alone.</span></p>

That will be the case when scientific investigations such as hair strand tests are carried out.  These tests can provide important information, but in order for that to be of real use, the expert must (a) describe the process, (b) record the results, and (c) explain their possible significance, all in a way that can be clearly understood by those likely to rely on the information.

Developments in analytical methodology have proceeded faster than the ability to accurately interpret the findings.  Although it is now possible to detect extremely low levels of drugs in hair, this has raised problems because the lower the drug level, the more difficult it becomes to distinguish whether it has arisen from ingestion or exposure.  This has been a particular issue with cocaine.&#8221;</span></p>

Notably, the DNA Legal results for 2016 were in some cases two or three times higher than those found by the other organisations.  This is then reflected in the fact that DNA Legal reported findings in the low to medium range, while the others reported only low findings.  However, direct comparison between the test results is to some extent confounded by the fact that hair was taken at different times, and that the assumed 1 cm growth rate may not be correct.  It is also important to remember that the results may be affected by differences in laboratory equipment and differences in the way the hair is washed before analysis.</span></p>

For example, the July test results covering three months found cocaine to be present below the cut-off in all but one case, and BE at or above the cut-off in all cases.  Dr McKinnon considered that the differences could be due to analytical variation, timing and methodology.  He shared Dr Rushton&#8217;s concerns to some extent, but regarded them as a fact of life.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In my view, the variability of findings from hair strand testing does not call into question the underlying science, but underlines the need to treat numerical data with proper caution.  The extraction of chemicals from a solid matrix such as human hair is inevitably accompanied by margins of variability.  No doubt our understanding will increase with developments in science but, as matters stand, the evidence in this case satisfies me that these testing organisations approach their task conscientiously.  Also, as previous decisions remind us, a test result is only part of the evidence.  A very high result may amount to compelling evidence, but in the lower range numerical information must be set alongside evidence of other kinds.  Once this is appreciated, the significance of variability between one low figure and another falls into perspective.  I therefore accept the approach of the testing experts and of Dr McKinnon in preference to that of Dr Rushton on this issue.  His approach requires an exactitude that can never be achieved in practice in the present day.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I must say something about the reporting of test results as being within the high/medium/low range.  In fairness to the testing organisations, this practice has developed at the request of clients wishing to understand the results more easily.  The danger is that the report is too easily taken to be conclusive proof of high/medium/low use, when in fact the actual level of use may be lower or higher than the description.  You cannot read back from the result to the suspected use.  Two people can consume the same amount of cocaine and give quite different test results.  Two people can give the same test result and have consumed quite different amounts of cocaine.  This is the consequence of physiology: there are variables in relation to hair colour, race, hair condition (bleaching and straightening damages hair), pregnancy and body size.  Then there are the variables inherent in the testing process.  Dr McKinnon explained that there is therefore only a broad correlation between the test results and the conclusions that can be drawn about likely use and that it should be recognised that in some cases (of which this is in his opinion, one) there will be scope for reasonable disagreement between experts.</span></p>

DNA adopts the figures set out in the relevant studies, while the two other organisations divide their own historic positive laboratory results into thirds (Alere) or use the interquartile range for medium (Lextox). </span></p>

While Ms John, Mr Poulton and Dr Breidi have enormous experience of giving opinions on hair strand tests in their professional life, and Dr McKinnon at least some, Dr Rushton has never done so, and has only been asked for his opinion in a few cases as an expert witness.  He was markedly unwilling to entertain one obvious explanation for the test results, namely that the mother may have been taking cocaine.  In particular, under examination by Ms Cook QC for Alere, he was prepared to accept that the test results from samples obtained in August 2015 suggested use, but unwilling to say the same for comparable results obtained in December 2016; the difference being that the mother had admitted use in the first case, but not in the second.  He was also prepared to express the view that the 2017 results positively excluded the use of cocaine.  Nor did he acknowledge that the testing organisations are operating within recognised industry standards, which are set in order to minimise so far as possible both false positives and false negatives.  </span></p>

It is also important to stress the responsibility for making proper use of scientific evidence falls both on the writer and the reader.  The writer must make sure as far as possible that the true significance of the data is explained in a way that reduces the risk of it becoming lost in translation.

The evidence as a whole drives me to the conclusion that the mother regrettably used cocaine at a relatively low and infrequent level during the latter part of 2015 and during 2016 and that she has not told the truth about that.  As to C(ii), there is much weaker scientific evidence of continuing limited cocaine use after Holly&#8217;s birth.  Given my finding in relation to earlier use, I cannot discount the possibility that the mother is not telling the truth about that either, but taking the evidence as a whole, I am not satisfied the local authority has proved its case in respect of that period. </span></p>

Although there is considerable evidence of the mother&#8217;s attempts to get help and to rid herself of drug use, the almost continuous array of test results showing cocaine and BE significantly above the threshold cannot adequately be explained by inadvertent exposure.  In addition, the wash samples were either negative or produced a minimal cocaine reading far below the amount that would suggest that the much higher readings from inside the hair matrix arose from exposure.  I accept the evidence on behalf of the interveners that this pattern is much more consistent with use than exposure, although exposure (including perhaps from knowing drug use) may also have been a contributor.  I also note, though it cannot be conclusive, that the readings are not in some cases dissimilar to those found in the August 2015 testing that covered a period when the mother was admittedly using cocaine.  Finally, with regard to the scientific evidence on this issue, I find that the conclusions of the interveners&#8217; witnesses tip the scales against the arguments of Dr Rushton and the uncertainty of Dr McKinnon.  </span></p>

There were many appealing aspects of her evidence, and I do not doubt her good intentions when it comes to kicking drugs.  However, the undoubted presence of cocaine and its metabolites can only come from use or exposure, and none of the possibilities for innocent exposure in this case can be accepted as producing these readings.  Much though I would wish to take the mother at her word, I regret that I cannot do so and I find that on the balance of probabilities she found herself falling into occasional but repeated low level cocaine use during the later part of 2015 and through 2016.</span></p>

Following Holly&#8217;s birth, there has been very regular urine testing and continuous face-to-face contact between the mother and a wide range of professionals and others concerned for Holly&#8217;s welfare.  Scarcely a day will have passed without contact of this kind and no one has noticed the slightest suggestion of drug use.  The results of the July testing are with one marginal exception below or far below the cut-off limit for cocaine.  The interpretations of the toxicologists vary: Mr Poulton thought the results in isolation represented likely use, Dr Breidi considered them to be the residual results of earlier use in 2016, while Ms John and Dr McKinnon could not choose between these possibilities.  The local authority has put the arguments very fairly when seeking a finding on this issue and, taking the evidence as a whole, I am not satisfied that it has made out its case in relation to recent use of cocaine.  It follows that on balance I am prepared to accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that she has been free of drugs since Holly was born.</span></p>

The closing submissions of Mr Parker and Mr Lamb for the Guardian contain a useful summary of the practical considerations regarding monitoring, support and duration.  As to the wider considerations, it is common ground that in Holly&#8217;s case we are not dealing with harm in the past, but with the risk of future harm, and that the situation is well contained under the current interim supervision order.</span></p>

Each has advantages and disadvantages.  Holly&#8217;s placement with her mother will not succeed if the mother at some point and for some reason slips back into her old ways.  Everyone in this courtroom sincerely hopes that she doesn&#8217;t, and if she can remain abstinent there is every chance that she won&#8217;t.  Against a background of this kind, the opportunity for a child to be brought up by her mother is a precious thing and the best order in my view is the one that gives this outcome the best chance.  Where the glass can fairly be seen as being half empty or half full, the court order should tell the mother that Holly&#8217;s future is her responsibility and that, while help is available on all sides, this is only going to work if she makes it work.</span></p>

The care planning in this case has been suboptimal, with a high turnover of social workers and poor consultation.  I think that the mother&#8217;s self-confidence needs to be built up and that this is more likely to happen if she no longer has to share parental responsibility with the local authority.  The local authority commendably says that its support services will be essentially the same, whether or not there is a care order.  The making of a supervision order is time-limited, for one or for three years.  In practice, </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">either</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> good progress will continue to be made and statutory intervention will reduce and cease </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">or</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> the mother will relapse, there will be further proceedings, and Holly will almost inevitably be removed from her care for good and all.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">On the facts of this case, I do not see a care order as conferring benefits that outweigh those arising under a supervision order.  I will therefore make a supervision order in favour of the local authority for 12 months, trusting that it will be reviewed in 9 months to decide whether an extension will be necessary.  </span></p>

I am aware that a final decision remains to be made about the future of the boys.  That decision will be taken by HH Judge Mayer, based on the evidence before her.  Nothing in this judgment is intended to influence her decision; in particular, the fact that the mother is retaining Holly under the lesser form of statutory order does not in any way imply a view on the part of this court that she is presently capable of looking after more than one child.</span></p>
