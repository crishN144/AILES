After almost a month and in the absence of any contact from the respondents, an order was issued without a further hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The legal framework in relation to revocation of adoption orders is well known.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I could not improve upon Bodey J&#8217;s analysis. He observed it was common ground that &#8220;the only possible vehicle for revocation would be the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court &#8230; but only in exceptional circumstances.&#8221; Bodey J cited a passage from <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (supra) </span>where Swinton Thomas LJ said this &#8211; &#8220;To allow considerations such as those put forward in this case to invalidate an otherwise properly made Adoption Order would in my view undermine the whole basis on which Adoption Orders are made, namely that they are final and for life, as regards the adopters, the natural parents and the child. In my judgment, (Counsel) is right when he submits that it will gravely damage the lifelong commitment of adopters to their adoptive children if there is the possibility of the child, or indeed the parents, subsequently challenging the validity of the Order.&#8221;</p>

The scope for the exercise of judicial discretion is severely curtailed. Once Orders for Adoption have been lawfully and properly made, it is only in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances that the court will permit them to be set aside.&#8221;</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also relevant to consider this extract from the leading judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Minors) (Adoption) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 1 FLR 458" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 1 FLR 458</ref> </span>referred to by Wall LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Webster v Norfolk County Council. </span>Glidewell LJ emphasised the highly unusual nature of the case at <span style="font-style:italic">459 F-G: </span>&#8220;In my view, this is &#8230; a classic case of mistake. It is quite clear that the present appellant was wholly ignorant of his former wife&#8217;s condition and, had he known of it, he obviously would not have consented to the adoption. That ignorance vitiates his consent and means that it was of no effect. In the absence of that consent it is very doubtful whether the adoption order would have been made. Since it is clearly in the best interests of the children that the adoption order should be set aside, I would extend the time for both these appeals &#8230; and allow both appeals. I should say, as a postscript, that this is, if not unique, at the very least a wholly exceptional case. I say that because I do not want the setting aside of this adoption order in these circumstances to be thought of as being some kind of precedent for any related set of facts in some other case.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the <span style="font-style:italic">Re W </span>case, having weighed the advantages and disadvantages, Bodey J came to the clear conclusion that he should refuse to invoke the inherent jurisdiction. He said this &#8211; &#8220;It is far less likely than likely that a revocation order would ultimately come to be made and the &#8216;process&#8217; would stir up all the sorts of potential problems at the human level which I have tried to envisage. In short, it is a Pandora&#8217;s box and the court should, in my view, only go there if it seems proportionate, necessary and reasonably likely to be ultimately successful. I do not think the application fulfils those prerequisites.&#8221;</p>

Each case must be decided on its own facts with the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration and all of the relevant factors weighed in the balance.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The facts of this case are central to any determination. As relevant, they are as follows. PK was almost 4 years old when, in May 2004, an adoption order was made in favour of Mr and Mrs K. About two years later, in 2006, PK was sent to live in Ghana with members of Mr and Mrs K&#8217;s extended family. According to PK, she was subjected to significant abuse from those who had responsibility for looking after her in Ghana.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All the signs are that Mr and Mrs K have relinquished responsibility for PK. They did attend court early on in the wardship proceedings accompanied by their son and others. PK felt intimidated by their presence. They raised no objection to the application that PK should live with her natural mother. Thereafter, Mr and Mrs K have played no part in the proceedings. Significantly, they have failed to respond to all attempts made by PK&#8217;s Solicitors to elicit a response to the applications (i) that the adoption order be revoked and (ii) that PK&#8217;s last name be changed back to that of her natural mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two obvious inferences to be drawn from the history combined with the lack of engagement on the part of Mr and Mrs K. The first is that they relinquished actual responsibility for looking after PK nine years ago. The second is that they have no intention to oppose her applications which will have the effect of breaking the legal links between them and PK.</p>

It might have been thought that when, aged almost four, she became an adopted child her future was assured. Almost certainly, the expectation of the judge who made the adoption order was that PK would enjoy stability, consistency and security as the adopted child of Mr and Mrs K. No professional involved with PK at the time she was adopted could have envisaged that within two years she would be cast out from the home of Mr and Mrs K and sent to live with extended family members in Ghana. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no potential difficulty, as there was in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W</span>, Bodey J&#8217;s case, arising out of the need to notify PK&#8217;s natural parents or for that matter her adoptive parents. In this instance, all of those adults who should be aware of the application have been served. There is no prospective trouble. Mr and Mrs K, by their inaction, have signified their lack of interest in PK&#8217;s future. It is probably fair to assume their position is one of tacit acceptance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If I were to decline to revoke the adoption order and refuse to allow PK to change her name back to that of her natural mother, it seems to me that there would be profound disadvantages in terms of her welfare needs. PK would continue to be, in law, the child of Mr and Mrs K. They would have parental responsibility and the legal rights to make decisions about and for her. But there would be considerable, maybe even insuperable, obstacles in the way of them exercising parental responsibility for PK given that they play no part in her life and she wishes to have nothing to do with them.</p>
