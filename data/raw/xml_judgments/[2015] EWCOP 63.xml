The room door was wedged open, the lady was naked, not covered, lying in urine and faeces which was also on the bed rails and on the carpet. After 50 minutes and several requests and seeing that the faeces on the carpet had been stood in, I took a photograph of the footprint in the faeces as I intended to make a formal complaint. I did not take a photograph of any part of the lady&#8217;s body.&#8221;</p>

The deputy said that he would not know where to start with his sister. The deputy said that he did not think mediation would work but would try if requested by the judge. The deputy said that he knows there is 1 of 4 outcomes: (1) he remains sole deputy; (2) his sister is appointed sole deputy; (3) they are made joint deputies, or (4) a panel deputy is appointed. The deputy said that the client&#8217;s assets were in a better shape than when he took on the deputyship; that he had secured reimbursement from the NHS; the client&#8217;s debt is under control and will be paid within the agreed timescales, and the client was safe. The deputy hoped the judge would rule in his favour and, if it was deemed appropriate to appoint a panel deputy, he would work with that person as directed.&#8221;</p>

In essence, he held that an application for the removal of a deputy does not invoke quite the same discretion as the initial appointment of a deputy. As with any application, it is necessary forensically for the party seeking a change in the status quo to show some reason why the court should make such an order. The abiding rule in the exercise of powers under the legislation is the achievement of best interests of the protected person and, where it is shown that a deputy is incompetent or has acted improperly or unlawfully, the court may terminate his appointment and appoint another deputy.</p>
