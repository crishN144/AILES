The standard of proof is the criminal standard of proof.  In other words, to find the contempt allegations proved, I have to be sure that they are true.  In the old days that was called being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.  If there is anything less than that, then the allegations must be dismissed.  The respondent to the application, Mr Mayze, does not have to prove anything.  He is entitled to put the court to proof.  He did not have to give evidence.  I made it clear to him that he did not have to do so but, nevertheless, he decided voluntarily to give oral evidence about the allegations.    </p>

I recognise that such matters do give rise to strong emotions on both sides but that, of course, is true in many cases proceeding in the Family Court and it does not excuse bad behaviour in the face of the court, if I find that to be proved.   </p>

He then ran out of money.  Following that, he and the mother acted in person and, in April 2019, they came to an agreement.  The agreement involved him having contact to his son including staying contact every other weekend from Friday to Sunday and I am told that the social worker actively endorsed the agreement.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is his case that the mother then reneged on the agreement and broke it, refusing him contact.  He applied to enforce the order.  The mother then raised allegations of domestic abuse including coercive control as well as domestic violence.  I make it clear that Mr Mayze denies those allegations completely.  Although the mother does not accept this, he says that the main allegations against him are very historical.  He assert that the mother has only raised them to give her an excuse for stopping the contact.  It is of course right that, </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">once serious allegations are raised as here, Practice Direction 12J applies. The court has to investigate and may have to make findings as to the allegations.  Indeed, in consequence of that, on 5 November 2019, District Judge Suh sitting in the Family Court at Dartford made various directions including that a guardian was to be appointed to represent Z.  It is clear that this order was never drawn up by the court and was not properly served on Cafcass.  In consequence, the guardian was never appointed.  The case came back for hearing before District Judge Suh on 16 December 2019 on a pre-trial review prior to what was intended to be a fact-finding hearing on 14 January 2020.  The District Judge discovered on the morning that the order had not been perfected and had not been sent to Cafcass and therefore a Rule 16.4 guardian had not been appointed.  She said that this was quite unacceptable and that the court had let these parties, and in particular Z, down.  She apologised but recognised that there was nothing that she could do about it. She formed the view that the fact finding hearing would have to be adjourned. </p>

Initially the hearing proceeded relatively amicably but it is quite clear that, by the end, both parents had become quite agitated and at times they raised their voices and they talked over each other.  There are no allegations before me in relation to that part of the hearing but I was invited by counsel for Mr Mayze to listen to that tape and therefore I did so.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">After the matter became heated, the District Judge asked the parties to leave court while she drafted an order.  She then called them back in and attempted to read the order to them.  I think it is fair to say that the need for the adjournment had, by now, annoyed Mr Mayze considerably.  He was frustrated that the case could not proceed quickly and he viewed this as being a further impediment to him seeing his son.  I have listened to the tape both in court and before the hearing commenced.  Again, the hearing started off in a relatively calm manner and, on this occasion, it is fair to say that Mr Mayze did not raise his voice as much as on the previous tape but it is not the issue of raised voices that has led to these proceedings.  Instead, it is what he said.   </p>

I interpolate at that point to say that when reading that as a transcript, it does sound as though it could be threatening of the judge&#8217;s children.  That would be an extremely serious matter.  I have listened to the tape with great care.  I am satisfied that it was not a threat to the judge&#8217;s children.  It was, instead, a comparison between the judge enjoying Christmas with her children whilst he would not be seeing his son.  It was a very ill-advised thing to say but I do not take the view that it was a threat.  At this point, the court staff were asked to escort Mr Mayze from the court.  He made a further comment about photographs of the Mother that I have decided not to quote in this judgment as it is not relevant to my decision.   </p>

Therefore, when he said it was not a threat, it was a promise, he was referring to the legal agreement and to doing this in a legal or proper way.  He said he meant that he was going to use a solicitor.  He accepted he did not say that in court but relied on his dyslexia particularly when he gets upset saying this is the result. </p>

During that time, he accused the mother&#8217;s partner of being a sex offender and that this was intended to ensure that his threats were taken seriously because he did not withdraw them or apologise when the judge invited him to reflect.  He said that this was all part of the story.  Outside court, the new partner of the mother had walked in.  He viewed that as inflammatory.  He said that, at one point, the mother had a disagreement and split up temporarily with her new partner.  At that time, she said on Facebook that he (the new partner) had slept with a 14 year old so that was merely what he was repeating.  He says that she said the same thing about him when they split up.  He said it as, &#8220;You&#8217;re a sex offender as well.&#8221; He did not mean it in a harmful way.  It was said in jest as a joke.  He said that he was particularly upset that he was not going to be seeing Z over Christmas because, in particular, he wanted </p>

I must be sure before I find any of these allegations true.  In some respects, I am not sure and I will be making amendments to the particulars of those allegations but, in others, I am quite sure and I do find that there was contempt in the face of the court.  I cannot accept Mr Mayze&#8217;s explanation in relation to the first allegation, namely that he was not making a threat but was just intending to go back to see his former solicitor.  That is the opposite of what he is conveying in the passages because in the passages he says that he has spent &#163;21,000 but had run out of money and he, &#8216;Can&#8217;t keep doing that no more&#8217;.  It is quite clear to me that he was, in fact, saying that he was going to leave the court process because it was getting nowhere, that he tried doing it the right way but would no longer be doing that.  This can only mean that, if he is not going to be doing it the right way, he would be doing it a wrong way.  He even, at that point, was asking the judge to arrest him if she wanted to do so, which is not what you would be saying if you simply meant you were going to re-instruct your solicitor and get on with the litigation.   </p>

It is a threat to take action himself and it is a common statement to say, &#8216;It&#8217;s not a threat, it&#8217;s a promise&#8217; to reinforce that you intend to do what you are saying that you will do.

It is inconceivable that he was referring to going back to see his solicitor.  It would not make any sense whatsoever.  He was saying, if you are getting accused of things, you might as well do them and the things he was being accused of are indeed domestic violence, controlling behaviour and damaging cars.  I am going to delete &#8216;throwing acid or some other corrosive fluid at people&#8217;.  He has satisfied me that he was not convicted of such a crime.  It may well be that the mother is in fact making allegations that he has done that to her partners but it is not clear to me whether that was the case as opposed to the allegation that he had done it in relation to this criminal offence.  He has satisfied me that that was not what he pleaded guilty to and, therefore, I am going to delete that as one of the matters that he was accused of.  That is clearly an extremely serious matter and I therefore am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to that, but I am so far as the first three allegations are concerned.  I am not saying that I find that he has done those things, far from it.  I am merely saying that he was making a threat that he would do the things of which he was accused of and those are the three things that I find he was accused of.   </p>

She has been asked to come to court and, therefore, she has told me that she feared for her safety.  It follows that I cannot be satisfied so that I am sure that he succeeded in doing that.  I delete the last six words from that allegation, but I am satisfied that he was making threats in court and in the presence of the judge and he did intend to cause the mother to fear for her safety.   </p>

During that time, he undoubtedly accused the mother&#8217;s current partner of being a sex offender.  I am going to delete the next few words that refer to the judge&#8217;s Christmas with her children as I am not satisfied that this was a threat.
