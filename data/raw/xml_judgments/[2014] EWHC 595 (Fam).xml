The mother had had a child by an earlier relationship but had undergone an hysterectomy and was therefore unable to conceive a child with the father. The couple decided that they would attempt to conceive through &#8216;partial&#8217; surrogacy, that us to say a form of conception where the surrogate mother&#8217;s egg is inseminated using the commissioning male, (here the father&#8217;s), sperm. </p>

This can cause serious difficulties to hospital where babies are born as a result of surrogacy agreements. Some health areas have multi agency surrogacy protocols in place to provide for all aspects of a surrogate birth taking place in their hospital; this includes the &#8216;hand over&#8217; of the baby and any welfare issues which may arise. Such protocols unfortunately are by no means universal. </p>

The Mother signed the application form on 28 July 2010 but did not lodge it with the court as agreed. The application was finally issued on 19 October 2010 by which time CP was 33 weeks or 7 &#189; months old.  The application was out of time, the statutory time limit for such an application being 6 months from the date of birth. </p>

The matter came in front of HHJ Lea on 24 March 2011 for further directions. The shared residence order was confirmed and the mother and father undertook to reissue their application for a parental order in respect of CP; no one involved appreciated that the statutory time limit for such an application had now expired.
