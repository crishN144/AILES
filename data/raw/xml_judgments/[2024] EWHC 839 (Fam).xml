The order made by the learned Recorder provided for the younger child&#8217;s contact with their father to move to unsupervised contact in the community and to progress through stages of unsupervised contact in the community, to visits to the father&#8217;s home to ultimately phase 4 (as it is described) overnight staying contact which would increase in duration over time.  The older child was not subject to an order, but the order recorded that they may attend the contact if they so wished. </p>

The task facing a judge is not to pass an examination, or to prepare a detailed legal or factual analysis of all the evidence and submissions he has heard. Essentially, the judicial task is twofold: to enable the parties to understand why they have won or lost; and to provide sufficient detail and analysis to enable an appellate court to decide whether or not the judgment is sustainable. The judge need not slavishly restate either the facts, the arguments or the law. To adopt the striking metaphor of Mostyn J in SP v EB and KP [2014] EWHC 3964 (Fam), [2016] 1 FLR 228, para 29, there is no need for the judge to "incant mechanically" passages from the authorities, the evidence or the submissions, as if he were "a pilot going through the pre-flight checklist</span>."</p>

The judgment had been handed down a little more than three months before the 7 July hearing and had attracted significant attention, unsurprisingly, both amongst the profession and the judiciary. So, its omission from the recorded thinking of HHJ Dodd on 7 July 2021 is surprising even within a busy court.</span></p>

But whilst again that provides some sympathy for the situation the judge finds himself in, it does not relieve him, I regret to say, of the obligation to give consideration to PD12J, not just at the earliest opportunity but to keep the matter under review throughout the court process, and explicitly by PD12J s.14, to make it clear in his order that he has done so.</span>&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent in the skeleton argument filed on his behalf accepts that Grounds 1-3 are made out.

There is no explanation placed before me as to why the issue of protective measures for the Appellant was not raised with the Recorder by the advocate for the Appellant or the Respondent. However, the stark fact is they were not. Nevertheless, the court has a mandatory duty (a) to ascertain if a party/witness is vulnerable and (b) to ensure that there are participatory directions in force to assist that person to give their best evidence.&#160;Despite that mandatory duty, Recorder Peacock failed to address or apply Part 3 FPR 2010 and PD3AA in circumstances when he clearly should.&#160;It is accepted on behalf of the Respondent that this omission was wrong and/or a serious procedural irregularity. Ground 5 is also accepted in part. The part that is accepted is that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the judge was wrong in making a child arrangements order without applying PD12J given the father&#8217;s&#8217; admission that he threatened to slit the mother&#8217;s throat</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>That acceptance is put on the following basis, with which I agree:</p>

PD12J s.17 directs the court that in determining whether a fact-finding hearing is necessary, a court must consider, amongst other things, whether the nature and extent of the allegations, if proved, would be relevant to the issues before the court. I cannot see anywhere here the court&#8217;s consideration of this or an explanation of any conclusions reached. The closest that it comes to is the reliance on the views of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, as expressed in her analysis, that the allegations are mainly &#8216;historic&#8217; and that they do not prevent self-arrangements for the child being made, which, as I will come onto, I regard with some disquiet also.</span></p>

The court is directed that it should make an order for contact only if it is satisfied that the physical and emotional safety of the child and the parent with whom the child is living can, as far as possible, be secured before, during and after contact, and the parent will not be subjected to further abuse.</span>&#8221;</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">The courts had already determined what allegations it was necessary for the court to determine in order to make a welfare determination. The first Schedule of Allegations presented to the court by the Appellant is dated 3 September 2021. The Lay Magistrates considered the necessity for a fact-finding hearing in relation to that schedule at the FHDRA on 26 October 2021. They determined that the Respondent&#8217;s acceptance that he had said to the Appellant in the presence of the older child was sufficient and that it was not necessary to hold a fact-findings hearing in relation to the other allegations raised. At a FLA hearing three months later, a District Judge listed a fact-finding hearing but limited the hearing to a consideration of the context in which the Respondent has stated &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I will slit your throat&#8221;.</span> Against that background it is said the Appellant produced a second schedule of allegations which included the same allegations as had been considered by the lay bench. She did this without the prior permission of the court. On 24 November 2022, the fact find set down at the FLA hearing came before a District Judge for hearing. At that hearing the Appellant, who was represented, did not seek any findings of fact against the Respondent over and above the admission. A way forward in relation to contact was agreed. No appeal has ever been made against the Lay Bench&#8217;s decision or the order of 24 November 2022.</p>

Earlier in the Children Act proceedings the mother made allegations of domestic abuse against the father and set out a series of allegations in a schedule, pursuant to an order of the court. The court decided that it would be disproportionate to carry out any fact-finding hearing. The father, although he initially denied the threat that was made, subsequently admitted it and the court found that, given the father&#8217;s admission and the nature of the other allegations in the mother&#8217;s schedule, which were, I think it is fair to say, less serious than the threat, it will be disproportionate to hold a fact-finding hearing.&#160;</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the grounds in dispute, namely <span style="color:#000000">Ground 4 that the judge was wrong in failing to determine the mother&#8217;s wider allegations of domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour which were relevant to the welfare decisions for the children and Ground 5, that the judge was wrong in making child arrangements orders without applying PD12J given the Appellant&#8217;s wider allegations of domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour. I conclude that the Recorder should have considered the issue of whether to make findings of fact in relation to coercive and controlling behaviours alleged by the Appellant and should not have relied upon any prior determination either in November 2022 or earlier by the Lay Bench. He should have kept the matter under continuous review. The issue of the determination of the allegations was clearly on the facts of this case a matter before him. At paragraph 10 of his judgment the Recorder sets out that no application for a fact-finding hearing was made before him on behalf of the Appellant. Given the Appellant&#8217;s expressed unhappiness at the first instance hearing, it is regrettable that no application for a fact-finding hearing was made on her behalf before the Recorder. However, that failure did not absolve the Recorder of his obligation to consider whether a fact- find was necessary to resolve the allegations in this case.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">That the Recorder should have considered whether or not a fact-find was necessary independent of any application before him is apparent from paragraphs 17 and 18 of his judgment. Those paragraphs refer to the older child&#8217;s mental health difficulties and the Appellant&#8217;s case that that child&#8217;s difficulties are not simply as a result of witnessing the admitted threat to the Appellant by the Respondent but also as a result of prior abusive behaviours by the Respondent which the Appellant asserts occurred.  In that context the Recorder states: &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic">As I said, the court has decided that no fact finding should take place and I cannot proceed on the basis that there was any such abusive behaviour. But what I can proceed on the basis of, and which both parties are agreed about, is that the relationship had become increasingly toxic prior to the final breakdown</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">. </span><span style="color:#000000">Those two sentences in my judgment illustrate the difficulty the Recorder got himself into by not considering whether or not he should determine the facts. On the one hand he says he cannot determine the allegations and then on the other he proceeds to conclude the parental relationship was &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">toxic</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000">which implies blame on both sides and thus is implicitly a determination on the facts. Later in his judgment, the Recorder proceeds to consider the Appellant&#8217;s allegations that the Respondent was emotionally manipulative of the younger child in contact. The Appellant&#8217;s case is that the court should have considered that aspect of the case in the wider context of allegations made by the Appellant of controlling and manipulative behaviour by the Respondent towards the children in the past. Nowhere within the judgment did the Recorder consider the potential nexus between the allegations about behaviour in contact and past alleged behaviours of controlling and coercive behaviour. Nowhere in his judgment did he consider whether determining the allegations of past behaviour was relevant to the establishment of the facts or whether they established a pattern of behaviour relevant to welfare. I thus consider that the learned Recorder was wrong not to consider whether or not to have a fact-finding hearing in relation to the allegations the Appellant made. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances of this case, I thus conclude that the learned Recorder erred in that he failed to consider whether the nature and extent of the allegations, if proved, would be relevant to any issue before the court - PD12J(17)(g) applied. Accordingly, I find that the learned Recorder was wrong not to consider whether or not a fact-find was necessary. However, I do not go so far as to say that he should have decided to have a fact-find. I do not go that far because I do not need to do so for the purposes of this appeal and because I am conscious that it will be for the judge who rehears the case to decide on the facts and arguments presented to them whether or not a fact-find is necessary.</p>
