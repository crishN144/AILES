I was able to establish that the first care company, Bluebird Care, were put in by Health when Roy&#8217;s wife returned home for palliative care. I am not clear at what point Loga Care took over but, after her death, the CHC funding ceased and Roy became responsible for the full cost. Sue was insistent on talking about her mother&#8217;s care and telling me how her brother was never interested in his parents. &#8220;My brother wanted my dad in a nursing home. They are embarrassed by him.&#8221; She said &#8220;until mum died I dealt with it all.&#8221; She was very critical of her brother and in particular of his wife who she said was &#8216;unbelievable&#8217; and who her mother never liked.</span></p>

She was on her feet a lot, waving her arms around and shouting. I told her that in my opinion the property and finance LPA was unworkable because there appeared to be no way in which she could work jointly with her brother in best interests. She asked what would happen and I said it was possible that the judge of the Court of Protection would see deputyship as the best option for managing the donor&#8217;s affairs. She asked if the deputy would be her brother, and I said it was possible, but equally the judge could decide to involve an independent. She reacted quickly, saying it was offensive for me to say that she would not be considered, and I pointed out to her that was not what I had said. On the issue of the health and welfare LPA I told her that I had concerns about her willingness to work with the professionals involved in her father&#8217;s care. She would not agree she was at any way at fault, saying she had been denied access to her father&#8217;s care plan and the capacity assessment. Again she referred to [GP&#8217;s name], saying &#8220;he calls me abusive&#8221;. She said she wanted to talk only with the carer and her supervisor and did not want to include the manager of the agency.</span></p>

When I said that I did not feel I needed any more information and had enough to complete my report, she marched to the front door, gestured me through it, and slammed the door behind me.</span></p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">It was clear to me from my meeting with Sue that she is a very emotional lady. She was obsessive about her brother and sister in law, returning again and again to their &#8216;harassment&#8217; of her. She kept referring to her love for her parents and telling me that she was the one who cared about them and how her brother never cared. She blames them for all the problems of recent months and for making it impossible to be with her mother in her last days. I am not qualified to give a diagnosis of Sue&#8217;s mental condition, but I found her to be in a high state of agitation throughout, to be irrational and unwilling to accept information I gave her, and to be obsessive about her brother and his wife and the carer who was living with and supporting Roy.</span></p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In my opinion her continued involvement in her father&#8217;s financial affairs is not workable because of her poor relationship with her brother. I also have doubts about her ability to make decisions in best interest for her father in relation to his health and welfare. She does not accept that he lacks capacity and she is not working with the professionals, seeing conspiracies against her by the GP, the care agency and her brother.&#8221;</span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;I have read the statement from the Office of the Public Guardian. I agree with their recommendations to the court that the joint LPA for financial affairs either be revoked or that Sue&#8217;s name is removed from it. They are also recommending that the sole LPA for H&amp;W be revoked and a deputy appointed. I think that the decisions that will need to be made about father&#8217;s health need a dispassionate and professional approach and that this would be better coming from a court appointed deputy. I think Sue finds the responsibilities of holding the LPA for H&amp;W for our father difficult. She has been in denial about our parents&#8217; condition and she is now in denial of our father&#8217;s. He is scared stiff if he thinks he is alone for more than 5 minutes. He is also scared of the dark. I think being in denial is at the root of my sister&#8217;s problems with the health professionals, the carers and me and my wife.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">I also think that Sue would have trouble managing our father&#8217;s financial affairs as the sums involved in providing father&#8217;s essential 7 day a week, 24 hour a day care are large. However I am willing to accept the court&#8217;s ruling on this. There are some practical problems. I support the carer with the weekly shopping, a trip on which I take my father, and I am owed money for this and other expenses for which I will need reimbursement. As an aside, we still need to sort out probate for my mother&#8217;s estate as my father is the first named executor with myself and Sue jointly named as second if my father cannot act.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not want to go into all the accusations, but as regards the charge of harassment, we have only seen Sue three times since just before our mother died. The first was when my wife. Nicola, drove to Sue&#8217;s house to tell her that mother was dying, and was told to get off her land and never return. We have complied fully with this request. The second was when Sue came to our parents&#8217; house to visit Mother. We had been on the point of leaving (as requested so that Sue could visit when we were not in the house) but Sue was early and Nicola happened to be in the hall when she arrived. On seeing Nicola she screamed and ran away.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third was when I went down to father&#8217;s house because the heating had failed. I met Sue at the front door by accident and said, &#8220;Hello, Sue, nice to see you. We need to talk&#8221;, as I had been asked to do so by [Roy&#8217;s GP]. Sue just ran away shaking to her car and drove off. Later she shouted at the carer that she should have told her that I was coming.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am worried about Sue&#8217;s health because many of the people she has come in touch with have expressed their concern about her mental condition. Sue appears to be constantly tense and anxious, with a hair trigger. If she disagrees with something she starts screaming at people, stamps her feet in front of them, bites her knuckles and slams doors. The problem has now become so acute with the carer that she (the carer) starts trembling when she knows Sue is coming. I am not sure that Sue is aware of her own actions. I did make some enquiries to see if anything could be done to help Sue. However it appears that both I and Nicola are part of the problem.</p>

She stated that she would have nothing more to do with things if I got involved. I had heard that she wanted to revoke her LPA for H&amp;W. During this period I arranged mother&#8217;s funeral, arranged the weekly shopping.&#8221;</p>

Inevitably, these events affected her social and emotional functioning, at least temporarily. Sue&#8217;s conduct at the hearing on 27 April 2016 was not as remarkable as her behaviour described by the Court of Protection General Visitor on 1 October 2015, approximately six weeks after her mother&#8217;s death.</p>

It is the &#8216;factor of magnetic importance&#8217; that compels me to let her continue to act as her father&#8217;s attorney for health and welfare.</p>

The distinction was clearly relevant and it should be treated with respect.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">There are several differences between an LPA for health and welfare and an LPA for property and financial affairs. One is that an attorney for health and welfare has no authority to make decisions in circumstances other than those where the donor lacks, or the attorney reasonably believes that the donor lacks, capacity: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/11/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11(7)</ref>(a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>.

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">Another difference between the two types of LPA is that the vast majority of personal welfare decisions can be taken informally under section 5 of the MCA, and collaboratively, whereas decisions relating to property and financial affairs tend to be more formal and generally do not require the same degree of collaboration with third parties, such as healthcare and social care professionals. So, whereas Sue&#8217;s dereliction of her duties for eight weeks after her mother&#8217;s death actually made little or no difference as far as decisions regarding Roy&#8217;s health and welfare are concerned (either because he could have made the decision himself or because others could have made the decision for him pursuant to section 5), it could have had a detrimental effect on the administration of his estate, if she had been his only attorney for property and financial affairs.</p>
