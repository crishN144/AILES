The Husband came to this country in approximately 2000 initially to study economics at University.  On graduation, he spent a year abroad but he then returned to this country to work as a banker.  He has remained in this country ever since.  There is no doubt that the existence of a wealth tax in his Scandinavian country has been a relevant factor in his deciding to remain here rather than return to his country of birth.  </p>

The Deed of Gift valued the assets at 374 million kroner.  The shares were held by a company.  At the time, the Deed indicated that the assets had been given to the Husband and his mother, but it appears that his mother was, in effect, acting as protector of the assets until the Husband's 30th birthday in 2010. The Deed states that the assets transferred are to remain the "<span style="font-style:italic">separate property</span>" of the Husband.</p>

It seems that the purchase price was funded by a loan from a bank which was guaranteed by his mother.

I am satisfied that a significant number of the Husband's family entered such Settlements prior to their marriages, including his parents.  The Husband indicated to the Wife that such a Settlement was required between them prior to their marriage.  He contacted his family's solicitors, who also recommended a firm to the Wife. The Wife accepted the recommendation and was subsequently advised by Mr B. Both sets of solicitors practised in the parties' country of origin.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The Wife first spoke to Mr B on 11th April.  Negotiations took place between the lawyers.  The exact course that these negotiations took is not, in my view, material to this judgment save to say that the figure that was to be provided for the Wife as her separate property was agreed at a relatively early stage.  The drafting, however, proved problematic.  Some doubt was expressed by Mr B as early as 11th May as to whether a marriage settlement that regulated future assets/inheritance would be approved for registration in the marriage settlement registry.  He clearly took the view that the wording could be changed to rectify the problem. Indeed, the wording was changed more than once by the Husband's solicitor.  </p>

I am satisfied that the fact that it was signed the day before the marriage is, of itself, immaterial given that the terms had been agreed some time earlier.  The Settlement was prepared on a standard "tick box" form.  The parties elected partial separation of property.  There was brief supplementary text, the material parts of which were as follows:- </p>

It follows that the Settlement was predicated on the basis that the Wife would be residing in Scandinavia.  The Wife's evidence to me was clear.  She had only agreed to live in this country for four years.  She said that the parties had agreed that the children would be educated in Scandinavia.  I accept her evidence in this regard.  Indeed, although I find that the Husband did not share her commitment to a return there in four years, he knew that this was her position.</p>

The Husband had indicated in an email from his solicitor dated 13th June 2007 that he did not want "<span style="font-style:italic">to tie up/limit his opportunities to dispose of the apartment&#8230;This must not be interpreted as reluctance toward wanting to offer the gift should the occasion arise&#8230;but due to business related considerations, he wants to have the most room for negotiation possible.</span>"</p>

In January 2008, there was a suggestion by Mr B that the property might be sold and, if so, whatever was acquired should go directly into the marriage settlement.  It was suggested that the new document could be signed at Easter, when the parties returned to Scandinavia. By then, the Wife was pregnant again with the parties' second child.  It appears that signing a fresh Settlement was "<span style="font-style:italic">put on the back burner</span>".  There is no further correspondence between the solicitors and no further action was taken by either spouse.   </p>

The Wife moved with the children to reside in another rented property.  She can remain there until August 2013 but must then vacate as the owners wish to return.  The Husband also vacated 'F2' following the breakdown of the marriage.  He is also living in rented accommodation which is very close to the Wife's accommodation.  It is a very encouraging feature of the case that, as parents, they remain on cordial terms and have worked together for the benefit of the children.  Indeed, the Husband on occasions has his supper with the Wife and children.  Although he sees the children regularly, their primary carer remains the Wife.   </p>

It is obviously important to have the broad outline of wealth to know whether the court is dealing with a case involving millions of pounds, ten of millions, hundreds of millions or even billions of pounds but there is absolutely no need to go further. The approach adopted by both parties in this case is not only sensible but also proportionate and cost effective.  It complies with the law and I commend it to any other litigants in a similar position.   I also make it completely clear that the concession made by the Husband was absolutely appropriate.  Given the factual matrix of this case, the court was bound to come to the conclusion that he could, indeed, meet any reasonable order.

In late 2007, his mother gave him what was then a modest wooden seaside summerhouse.  At the time, it was worth only about &#163;320,000 but he has since spent a considerable sum of money on it such that, by the time of his Form E, he valued it at &#163;1,320,000 although it was subject to a mortgage of (&#163;360,000).   </p>

As the Wife puts it in her section 25 statement, "<span style="font-style:italic">there was no need to have any concern about the amount we spent</span>". The Husband said in his Replies to Questionnaire that the family had spent approximately &#163;400,000 per annum net for the last three years.  It is quite clear that this is far too conservative a figure.  The Wife's counsel compiled a schedule of expenditure between November 2010 and January 2012.  It was not significantly disputed by the Husband.  On an annualised basis, it showed spending, excluding rent, business expenditure and legal costs, of &#163;784,972.  Whilst I accept that part of this may have been capital expenditure, I am satisfied that this broadly reflects overall spending during the marriage.  It may be that the Husband's family was somewhat concerned as the Husband and the Wife were summoned to a meeting in August 2010, for which the Husband had to prepare a budget for discussion.  The meeting, however, does not seem to have led to any noticeable reduction in spending.</p>

She revised the budget in her most recent section 25 statement to &#163;27,269 per month for herself and the children.  The Husband's budget for himself and the children was far lower.  Although the total is &#163;203,552 per annum, this includes rent at &#163;52,000, interest on the loan for his Summer House of &#163;18,200, the HMRC "non-dom" payment of &#163;30,000 and school fees of &#163;24,000. To compare like for like, these items need to be excluded.  This reduces his budget to &#163;79,352 pa.  I will obviously have to return to this aspect of the case later.  </p>

The Husband agreed to pay the Wife's rent of &#163;13,000 per quarter and the children's school fees.  He also made payments towards the Wife's legal costs.  In terms of general maintenance, he initially offered &#163;7,855 per month on an interim basis.  The Wife sought &#163;9,935 per month plus payment for a summer holiday.  The Husband suggested they split the difference at &#163;8,910 per month.  This was agreed but it soon became clear that it was not nearly sufficient.  The Husband agreed to increase the payments to &#163;10,000 per month but this was not sufficient either.

There is no doubt that, in this jurisdiction, when dealing with an application for financial remedies in English divorce proceedings, the court will normally apply English law, irrespective of the domicile of the parties, or any foreign connection (see Paragraph 103 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Radmacher v Granatino</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2010/42" uk:canonical="[2010] UKSC 42" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] UKSC 42</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 2 FLR 1900" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 2 FLR 1900</ref>).  Nevertheless, Paragraph 108 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Radmacher</span> makes it clear that issues of foreign law are relevant to the intentions of the parties (eg whether or not they intended that the Marriage Settlement should be binding upon them).   </p>

I accept that it might be said that this is unfair on the Husband.  The Wife's counsel's response was to say that the Husband had come to this country to take significant advantage of the tax regime here and has saved a very large amount of tax in consequence.  He cannot therefore complain that the quid pro quo is that he also has to abide by our divorce laws and, in particular, our approach to claims by wives for financial remedies.  There is, in my view, considerable force in this point.</p>

In essence, I must come to a fair solution.  Although it is now enshrined in our law that there are three different strands to applications for financial remedies, namely sharing, needs and compensation for relationship generated disadvantage, it is not suggested by anyone that this is a sharing case.  All the assets are "non-matrimonial", given that they were inherited by the Husband prior to the marriage.  There was a suggestion from Mr Balcombe for the Wife in cross-examination that there may have been some marital acquest but I am satisfied that it would be inappropriate for me to venture down that road.  There was an agreement between the parties.  The Husband accepted that he could meet any reasonable order on the basis that the Wife accepted this was a needs based claim only.  In any event, from the limited evidence I heard, I was by no means convinced that there was any significant marital acquest.  </p>

Mr Balcombe submits, and I accept, that to enable a party to be fully aware of the implications of a nuptial agreement, he or she should have all the information that is material to his or her decision whether or not to enter into it.  He further submits, and again I accept his submission, that where a party is not fully aware of the implications of the agreement because he or she lacks all the information that is material to his or her decision, it will invariably be unfair to hold the parties to the agreement.  Where I part company with his submissions is that he adds that, in such circumstances, the court, in the exercise of its discretion, should not afford the agreement any weight.

The existence of the Marriage Settlement is undoubtedly one of the circumstances of this case.  Prior to the decision in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Radmacher</span>, there were a number of authorities in this jurisdiction to the effect that the very fact that an agreement was signed prior to a marriage could be relevant to the quantum of the award.

It would be very odd indeed if the effect of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Radmacher</span> was to prevent a non-binding agreement having any weight at all in the exercise of the court's discretion when it might have been given appropriate weight prior to the Supreme Court's decision.

She was, of course, right to be so worried given the uncontested evidence of the two Scandinavian lawyers that the Settlement would not be upheld for different reasons.

I have come to the conclusion that it would not be fair to the Husband to cherry pick that part of the Settlement and say that the Wife is entitled to a Scandinavian property just because the Settlement effectively provides for that.

I heard a great deal of evidence as to the cost of appropriate property in Kensington &amp; Chelsea.  Whilst the general population would be amazed by the figures involved, I have to deal with the reality of the housing market.  It was, after all, accepted by the Husband that the Wife and children should live relatively close to their school, to their friends and to his likely accommodation.   I have come to the conclusion that she needs a five bedroom property.  She requires a bedroom for herself; one for each child; one for guests and finally one for a live-in nanny.  I might not have considered the latter essential were it not for the Husband's evidence as to the need for a nanny.  I am quite sure that, if there is to be a nanny, it should be a live-in nanny. This is the current position.  It is considerably cheaper than having a live-out nanny.  It was also accepted that the Wife needed a garden, or at the very least, access to communal gardens.  Finally, it is important that the property bears some relation to the quality of accommodation that the Husband is himself likely to occupy, even if he does decide, for fiscal reasons, to rent.</p>

It is right that, with one exception, the Husband's properties were only 4 bedrooms.  Indeed, the one that had five bedrooms was his most expensive property.  I did not consider that property satisfactory.  The fifth bedroom was extremely small.  The house only had one main bathroom.  I accept the Wife's evidence that it would also have required an "<span style="font-style:italic">upgrade</span>" to be suitable. I note that this property was 2,036 square feet.

She will require some furniture and/or a refurbishment fund.  There was also some evidence as to whether or not she needs a new car.  I consider I should apply a broad brush to this and award a figure of &#163;150,000.  I make it clear, however, that is entirely up to the Wife how she allocates her overall resources.   </p>

I accept entirely that the children should be able to return regularly, to see both the Wife's family and the Husband's family.  I do not, however, consider this requires the acquisition of a property there.  First, I have already made a reference to the Wife and children spending their summer holidays in Ibiza for the last two or three years.  This was a perfectly valid and reasonable decision for the Wife to take but it is not consistent with an overriding wish to spend holiday periods in Scandinavia.  When the family go there to visit, they can either stay with the Wife's family (parents or sister) or, possibly, with the Husband's mother.  I will be allocating a considerable sum for holidays for the Wife and children.  They can, if they wish, rent a house or even stay in a hotel.  I have already indicated that it is up to the Wife how she allocates her overall resources.  She could, if she chose, only allocate &#163;4 million to a London property and buy a second property for &#163;1 million.  That is a matter for her.</p>

The charge should be for such percentage of the purchase price as would give the Husband &#163;2 million.  The Husband is not to be disadvantaged should she decide to buy for only &#163;4 million and acquire a second Scandinavian property.  In other words, if the Wife buys for &#163;5 million, the charge will be for 40%.  If she buys for only &#163;4 million, it will be for 50%.  The parties can, if they wish, agree a different percentage, if for example, the Wife wants to spend money on improving a property that she has purchased at a lower figure but this can only be done by agreement.   </p>

I consider this is right, as the Wife will not, at that point, need such a large valuable property.  I would make it clear that it should be the completion by both children of tertiary education, to the end of a first degree.  I do not consider that it should include sale on remarriage or cohabitation although it would be exercisable on further order in the meantime.  I do, however, consider that it should be exercisable were the Wife to relocate either by agreement or court order.  The reason she needs the London property is because she is going to be living here. I accept that this is her genuine intention.  I hope this intention will not change but, if it did, and she convinced either the Husband or a court to permit her to relocate, it would only be right for the charge to be exercisable. </p>

On exercise of the charge, the Wife will, in round figures at today's prices, be left with &#163;3 million.  This will be sufficient for her to buy a suitable Scandinavian property (currently put at around &#163;1 million) and a home here. This would probably be a flat.  &#163;2 million would, in my estimation, be the appropriate figure.  She can either live in a smaller property in a more expensive area or in a larger property further out from the Centre.  I am quite sure it is reasonable for her to have such a property.  She has made a significant commitment in agreeing to remain here.  By the time the children complete full-time education, she will have been here for around twenty five years.  This will have become her home.  Her children may well remain here.  She should have the ability to be here as well. </p>

I am satisfied that this award is appropriate given the length of the marriage, the ages of the parties, the fact that the assets are all inherited and non-matrimonial and the facts as I found them to be surrounding the Marriage Settlement.  </p>

It does follow that, until he has paid in full, he must maintain the Wife and children.  I consider the correct approach is for him to pay the Wife's rent and the sum of &#163;240,000 per annum until payment.  In addition, he must pay the school fees and one-half of the nanny's costs including tax and national insurance.    </p>
