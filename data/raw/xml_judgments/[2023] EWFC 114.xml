	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Andrew and Beatrice did not do a very good job in their internet research about the time limits and other conditions set out above. They got the idea that the adoption application could be made after Charlie turned 18. They only found out that that this was wrong very late in the day. As stated above, Andrew only made the adoption application two days before Charlie&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. The local authority was told about the application at the same time. Section 44(2) and (3) was therefore not complied with. The question I have to decide is whether this non-compliance vitiates Andrew&#8217;s adoption application. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A preliminary issue has been formulated by Morgan J. That issue is whether the notice requirement in s. 44(2) and (3) is, in the words of Lord Penzance in <span style="font-style:italic">Howard v Bodington</span> (1877) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="2 PD 203" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">2 PD 203</ref> at 211, &#8220;imperative or directory&#8221;.  If it is imperative, then compliance with it is a strict and unyielding condition of the exercise by the court of its power to make an adoption order. By contrast, if it is directory then partial compliance, or even total non-compliance, will not necessarily prevent the court from exercising that power. In such a case the court has a discretion whether to allow the application to proceed. In deciding on which side of the line the non-compliance falls, the court looks at the underlying purpose of the requirement. Lord Penzance stated at 210: </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, if the minimum notice period of three months is imperative then the upshot will be that an adoption order cannot be made. This is because Charlie has now turned 18 and so a new application (preceded by three months&#8217; notice to the local authority) is barred by s. 49(2).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The minimum three months&#8217; notice requirement exists for reasons of administrative efficiency. It is to enable the local authority to have enough time to prepare thoroughly the vital Annex A and Suitability reports. This of itself strongly suggests that the requirement is directory rather than imperative.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A well-known technique for testing a logical proposition is to apply to it an extreme set of facts. Let us assume that a trust exists, the terms of which provide that on the death of the life tenant the valuable trust funds will vest in his children absolutely in remainder; but if the life tenant has no children, then on his death the funds will go to charity. The life tenant has no children, but he does have a 10-year-old stepdaughter, who he has brought up and treated as his own child from infancy. He therefore wishes to adopt her so that she might become the remainderman. To this end he has just given the local authority notice of his intention to adopt with the intention of issuing the adoption application in three months&#8217; time. However, on a routine visit to his doctor last week he is found to have a terminal illness. Tests establish that he has only a month left to live. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Is it seriously to be suggested that in such circumstances the court would not have the power to abridge the notice requirement, and to dispense with all other formalities, so as to accelerate the process to enable an adoption order to be made before his death? </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I suggest that in such circumstances the court would find a way to do so. It is unthinkable that the court would allow a literal, black-letter, interpretation of the statutory provisions to shut the door on an adoption and thereby to mete out such injustice. The solution would, of course, treat the notice requirement as directory rather than imperative.</p>
