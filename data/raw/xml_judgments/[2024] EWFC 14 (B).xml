The father was permitted to live in the upstairs loft-conversion bedroom, which had an en suite bathroom, on the basis that he undertook not to enter the wife&#8217;s part of the home.  It is common ground that he broke that undertaking on one occasion by going into the forbidden part of the house, albeit when the wife was not in.  Apart from that the parties appeared to have been able to live in the same house without incident.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband sought to appeal and Her Honour Judge Suk gave directions for him to obtain a transcript of the judgment of the learned district judge.  It seems that, because the hearing was heard remotely, the district judge was inaudible on the recording.  The Court has a backup recording, but this too was inaudible.  The unavailability of any recording was only finally determined on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2024.  Since then investigations have been made as to whether any full note of the judgment was made.  It transpires that Ms Bassiri-Dezfouli had not made a useable note.  Despite efforts by the wife&#8217;s counsel and messages sent to her chambers and indeed via her head of chambers, it has not been possible to ascertain whether Ms McIntosh took a full note of evidence.  I proceed on the basis that she did not.  So far as the judge is concerned, it is not reasonable to expect a judge, nearly four months after delivering an extempore judgment, to recall precisely what she said without assistance from a contemporaneous note taken by the parties&#8217; representatives.</p>

With the advent of audio-recording, however, I have not found any reference in the Bar Code of Conduct to counsel having such a duty in cases where an audio-recording is normally made.  Para 5.25 could be read as putting such a duty on counsel, but an alternative reading is that, in cases where there is no audio-recording, counsel cannot charge separately for a preparing a full note of the judgment.</p>

Making a full note of a judgment is onerous.  In my judgment it is a matter for counsel how full a note they should make of a judgment.  It is only in cases where they know no recording will be made of a judgment that an exception should be made, so that counsel are under a duty to make a full note.</p>

The Order states that the husband subjected the wife to domestic abuse.  The difficulty here is that the Order does not state the severity of the abuse.  Her Honour Judge Vincent in <span style="font-style:italic">Re R (A child) </span>[2020] EWFC B57 at [98] in my judgment accurately summarised the law when she held:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Case law suggests I should consider the severity of the domestic abuse.  The father argues that it is minor and took place a long time ago, and after which the parties reconciled.  The mother would say this was serious abuse and has had long-standing consequences.  In my judgement the focus of the Court should be on the consequences of the abuse.  The evidence is that the <span style="font-style:italic">impact </span>of the abusive relationship continues to impact the mother in a significant way and this is only exacerbated by the father&#8217;s continuing attitude towards the mother.  It is not an attractive argument to have caused harm to the mother in the way I have found the father did and then to criticise her for failing to be robust enough or failing to have found a way to recover herself so as to be in a position to deal with her abuser.&#8221; (The judge&#8217;s emphasis.)</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, it is not necessary for the Family Court to determine whether (in this case) a father demonstrates 2015 behaviour.  Nonetheless, if the Court is satisfied on balance of probabilities that the father has behaved that way, the Court will necessarily consider that that behaviour is very serious.  Although a finding of 2015 behaviour will not inevitably result in a refusal of contact, it may well be that, unless remedied, 2015 behaviour will be such that the risk to the children is so serious that direct contract is contra-indicated.  A similar conclusion is likely in relation to 12J behaviour, unless the perpetrator can show significant improvement in his or her behaviour.</p>

The husband says, however, that this was a very old incident.  It is not clear to what extent that was common ground.  The husband says one incident dated to 2008.  The husband points to the fact that the parties continued to live under the same roof between February and October 2023.  His case is that the abuse was at the lesser end of the spectrum.</p>

He was left homeless and has been sleeping rough in the back of a van.  He says that his health has suffered.  Secondly, the family had another house in London E1.  No consideration appears to have been given to giving notice to the tenants living there, so that the husband could be rehoused.  Neither of these matters are mentioned in the recitals to the Order.</p>
