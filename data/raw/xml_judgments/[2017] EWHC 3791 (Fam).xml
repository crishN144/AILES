	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">At the hearing on 12 December 2016 the mother was represented by counsel and she accepted that she had published all of the material complained of on her Facebook page, but it was contended on her behalf that she was entitled to publish the material, for 3 reasons.  Firstly, she believed that the injunction had come to an end at the conclusion of the care proceedings.  Counsel for her conceded that there had been a misunderstanding on the part of Ms Root as to when the final order was made. In her statement, Ms Root, at Paragraph 8, said that the proceedings concluded with the making of final care orders in May or June 2010.  That was wrong, because the final care orders were made on 24 May 2011 and her counsel acknowledged that the paragraphs in the statement did not make a great deal of sense as the injunction order was not made until 13 December 2011, i.e. after the care proceedings had concluded.  Her position was amended to argue that the proceedings did not really come to an end until 11 September 2014, when HHJ Scarratt refused her final application for contact pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 34</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The second point that Ms Root was relying on was that she was entitled to publish the material because she was pursuing a complaint about the conduct of the Local&#160;Authority and that  was action permitted by Rule 12.73(1)(a) and (c) and Rule 12.75 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 and the Practice Direction 12(g).</span></p>

It had only been listed for the morning on that occasion, on the understanding that Ms Root was legally represented and that the issues were going to be fairly narrow.  At the hearing on 2 March 2017, Ms Root appeared in person.  She confirmed that she wanted to act in person, without the benefit of legal advice, because she felt that she had a better knowledge of the matter and its history than any solicitors or counsel could have.</span></p>

Starting off with Rule 12.73 that deals with communication of information (general) and makes it clear that, for the purposes of the law in relation to contempt, information relating to proceedings held in private may be communicated to a party, their legal representative, a professional advisor, an officer of Cafcass or Director of Legal Aid casework, an expert instructed in the proceedings, a professional and an independent reviewing officer, or where the court gives permission.  There is therefore provision under the rules for information to be communicated.  None of that in Rule 12.73 applies in the particular circumstances of this case, but it is necessary then to look at the provision of 12.75 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 which deals with communication of information for purposes connected within the proceedings, and provides:</span></p>
