The parents married in 2009 and are now in their 30s.  In 2013 the father came over to England with the possibility that the family would join him, D having been born in 2012, but instead he formed another relationship and the marriage ended in&#160;April&#160;2014.</span></p>

Those consisted of several months of negotiation leading to an agreement on 14th&#160;October&#160;2014, which was endorsed by an order of the Romanian court on 12th&#160;November&#160;2014.  That order placed D in the joint custody of her parents, provided for her to reside with her mother and to have regular contact with her father, including in England.  In&#160;December&#160;2014 the father remarried. </span></p>

It is apparent that the parents' relationship, which is not an easy one, included at various times discussions about the possibility that the mother and D would move to England.  In&#160;October&#160;2016, for example, the mother came over for four days and stayed in the father's home, that being, as I&#160;see it, in the nature of a reconnaissance.  The father says that the initiative for this came from the mother; the mother says that she was under continuous pressure from the father.  It is not necessary to resolve that matter.</span></p>

He therefore claims that the mother has consented within the meaning of Art. 13(a) of the Convention and that on that ground her summons should be dismissed.  </span></p>

I&#160;then proceed to the point where it is apparent that the mother contemplated moving with D to England.  I&#160;next come to a document which, in translation, appears at page C39A.  It is a statement made by the mother before a notary public in Romania agreeing and consenting to D travelling to the United Kingdom by any means as a tourist and returning to Romania between&#160;May&#160;2016 and&#160;May&#160;2017.  </span></p>

D's travel documents were, as I&#160;understand it, due to run out at the end of&#160;January&#160;2017.  There was some question as to which parent should renew them.  It was first intended that the mother should renew them and the father had given her money to do it.  On 19th&#160;December she signed another notarial agreement providing her consent to D being issued an individual passport.  Since the existing passport expired at the end of&#160;January the father says that this shows the mother knew that the child would not be back by the end of&#160;January.  The document might bear that interpretation, but it might, in my view, more easily bear the interpretation placed upon it by the mother, which is that one or other parent had to renew the document so that the child had a future passport, and this was simply a step taken to enable the father to do it rather than herself.  I&#160;regard that as being a neutral piece of evidence.</span></p>

It is to be noted, however, that on 21st&#160;November the mother said, in effect, that D is not to stay away from her for too long because that had affected her on previous visits, that she could go to her father for the holidays but not for one month, and suggested 24th December&#160;to&#160;2nd January being suggested.  In a text conversation on that occasion she says, &#8220;I&#160;will never give up my child&#8221;, to which the father replies:</span></p>

On 12th&#160;January the father issued proceedings in Romania to vary the order of 2014.  It should not be overlooked that in order to issue those proceedings it must be presupposed that the child is habitually resident there.  There is no evidence that the father told the mother and she was not served with the proceedings until the middle of&#160;February.  Instead there is a lengthy exchange lasting for some two pages on 12th&#160;January along these lines: </span></p>

On that occasion he tried to persuade the judge that he had the right to have D with him until&#160;May&#160;2017 on the basis of the travel pass that the mother had agreed to.  Against that background the father and his wife had filed evidence in support of the contention that the mother agreed to an indefinite move.  They say that on 25th&#160;November the mother said she was still fine with such a move (para.&#160;34) and that she said something similar on 19th&#160;December.</span></p>

As I&#160;said before the submissions were concluded, I&#160;do not think it appropriate to receive oral evidence.  Miss&#160;Harding accepted that not only is there no agreement evidenced in the contemporaneous documents, but that they in fact differ from any contention that there was agreement.  </span></p>

The true picture here, on the information available to this court, is that the father has been dissatisfied with the arrangements for D for a long time and has wanted to change them in favour of an arrangement where he takes care of her.  In that respect, looking at it from his point of view, he made some progress towards the end of 2016 in that the mother was prepared to consider coming to England with D.  As Miss&#160;Harding put it, by the end of the year the father felt that he was being &#8220;messed around&#8221; by the mother in a deliberate attempt on her part to get a better financial deal and arrangements that suited her better.  </span></p>

However, I&#160;am perfectly clear that her consent to D coming to England over Christmas was for a short time limited holiday period with a view to her return to her normal existence in Romania.  What happened after that was a matter for the future.  I&#160;am afraid here the father has exploited the situation in his impatience to achieve what he wanted.  I&#160;am drawn to that conclusion, firstly, by the mother's contemporaneous responses in the email, secondly, by her very swift legal action to seek the return of the child, and thirdly, by the father's responses to the situation, which included taking legal action in Romania, and his entire failure to give the obvious response to the mother's open protests.</span></p>

In particular, at paras.&#160;65 to 70 he touches upon sexual matters.  As I&#160;said during the hearing, I&#160;do not decide on these matters, I&#160;take them at their highest for the purpose of this exercise, and I do not&#160;disrespect the concerns of any caring parent.  What I&#160;do say is that these matters do not come close to reaching the threshold required by the Convention.  They are all matters that are properly dealt with by the Romanian court if they need to be dealt with by a court at all, and could conveniently be dealt with perhaps during the proceedings brought by the father himself.  </span></p>

Although there is no specific offer so far made on behalf of the mother, I&#160;am perfectly satisfied that the issues that the father wishes to raise are ones that would quite normally fall within the power of the Romanian authorities to regulate.  The mother and the father are both intelligent persons who have fair knowledge of the systems in Romania.  Romania is the country of this child's habitual residence.  Romania is the country in which it is said that these matters arose.  From every point of view, it is more appropriate that the matter be dealt with there if it needs to be pursued.  That defence is also without substance.</span></p>

The mother, who has travelled from Romania for this hearing, says that she should be the parent who brings D back.  I&#160;agree.  The mother is the parent who has been entrusted with the care of this child under Romanian law.  The father has been found responsible for her wrongful removal.  The idea that he should be allowed to continue to detain the child from her mother's care, no doubt for as long as he can manage in Romania, is, in my view, plainly contrary to D's interests.  The child will return as soon as possible with her mother.  The time for the return shall be as early as travel documents can be made available, it being a feature of the matter that although the father was put in the position to get her a travel document he did not do so.</span></p>
