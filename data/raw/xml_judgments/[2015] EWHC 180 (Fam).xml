	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">This case has a lengthy litigation history. That is always sad where the welfare of a child is involved.  It is particularly so where two highly committed and instinctively skilful parents, who otherwise have an enormous amount to offer a child, fallout and misdirect their energies into the litigation process.  On this, the second day of the hearing, the parties have been able to agree on some very significant issues.  Firstly, on the principle of contact. Secondly, on the arrangements for contact until the child starts school. Thirdly, on the expansion of contact from supervised to unsupervised. Fourthly, on the regime of contact in school holidays in the future.  This is a framework which may see this child throughout the remainder of his minority without the parties having to come back to litigate in a court room. That they should achieve such a significant step forward in such a short time in court is,  I have no doubt, due in part to the fact that they have had extremely experienced counsel assisting them.  Mr. Vater, Queen&#8217;s Counsel, and Miss Davey on behalf of the father and Mr. Khan on behalf of the mother.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">But valuable though that assistance has doubtless been, it is, in my judgment, the parties themselves who have moved forward during the course of this hearing.  Quite why it is they have been able to do so at this stage and not earlier in the process is difficult for me to understand, save that I have experienced over the years that the preparation for, and the experience of, a contested hearing in the High Court when both parties are finally allowed to speak and to be listened to by the court as well as by each other can sometimes prove to be a significantly cathartic process.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As I have observed in exchanges with Mr. Vater, what has struck me most as I have listened to each of the parties give evidence is that, notwithstanding that they have at times expressed some dramatically different perspectives on what has happened in the past, views in which each had become entrenched, they have nonetheless been able to relate their history in a way where each has shown a powerful and almost palpable core respect for the other.  Too often these cases are fraught with rancour.  In my judgment, the reason why that core respect has survived the pressure of this process lies in the quite remarkable journey that these two wayfarers have been on together.  I will set out the key landmarks of that journey below, because they are ultimately foundations upon which today&#8217;s orders are secured.  At this stage, it is only necessary for me to observe that after much effort and disappointment ultimately the mother gave birth to a son, E, who is now aged four.  He will be anonymised in this judgment and I do not, in order to protect his privacy for the future, propose to set out his date of birth either.  </span></p>

Rather, I should like to begin by describing something of what I have learnt about E himself.  I do so to return him to his proper place in this process, namely at the centre of it, but also to signal to the parents that which they have both, in their different ways and, despite their strengths, at times sadly forgotten.  This case is not about them, not about their past, not about their relationship, it is all about E, his needs, his future happiness and the realisation of his potential.</span></p>

There is, depressingly, little about him in the papers in the case.  Notwithstanding that, his personality has forced its way through into this court room.  He is a strikingly bright little boy, full of fun, full of mischief and he has the confidence which is often vouchsafed to much wanted children delivered to their parents late in life, when hope has started to fade.  He enjoys football and sports and a vast range of other activities.  He has also shown himself to be full of emotional intelligence and empathy.  </span></p>

He recognised that JB was his Dad.  Why should he not do?  He lives in the same world as the rest of us.  He sees other dads.  He had no doubt even by that stage begun to wonder where his was and he found an answer.  JB, I am entirely satisfied, did not for a moment even begin to press his case.  He did not want to announce himself to E as his father, but E could not have failed to respond to the intensity of his father&#8217;s love and his inherent, unthinking and instinctive communication of it.  That is how he made the discovery, as the mother herself recognises.</span></p>

Her aspirations for him know no bounds. She delights both in his personality, the gift of his presence and the extent of the opportunities that life holds for him.  In this she is joined with equal vigour and force by the father.  He recognises that the mother is certainly more educated than he is, probably he regards her as more intelligent.  Certainly, she is a more assertive and organised individual than he is.  Father does not for a moment doubt the significant contribution that the mother has to make to E&#8217;s life and, to my mind, he is glad of it.</span></p>

This couple met on a website: CoParentMatch.com.  The mother describes herself as a &#8220;gay lady&#8221;.  The father, I note, uses that phrase , and I conclude out of respect to her, describes her in exactly that way, both in his evidence and in his statements.  She told me that she had long wanted a child.  The mother&#8217;s desire to be a parent was a burning biological imperative an almost physical need.  Certainly, the mother had thought about being a mother for many years prior to joining CoParentMatch.com.   She had read very widely about the options available to her as a single lesbian parent.  She brought to her own analysis not only the benefit of her professional experience as a senior nurse, but also a great deal of research and reading.  </span></p>

He is an essentially passive man, in my assessment, who told me with disarming candour that he found it difficult to meet women and to develop relationships and that he had not been in a relationship for at least a decade. He told me that he saw some opportunity to parent a child opened up by this particular website.  It seems to me, listening to him give evidence, that, like so many interactions by people on the internet, part of his aspirations were grounded in reality whilst others were mere fantasy.  </span></p>

I need only say, in order to preserve anonymity, that they were both living in the south of England at the time they met.  On their very first meeting they spent several hours together at a coffee shop.  They both recalled having quite a number of cups of coffee together at that first meeting.  On some level they plainly felt that they could identify in each other a basis for moving forward with their respective aspirations.  Moreover, I am entirely satisfied that in recognition of each other&#8217;s strengths there was flexibility in both their objectives.  This was, in my judgment, not an arrangement that ever crystallised into a strict and tightly controlled plan.  That, in my view, was its strength, though also, as it proved, its weakness.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The story that followed reveals determination on behalf of both of these adults.  Mr. Khan, who appears on behalf of the mother, has talked of her &#8216;relationship&#8217; with the father and how it grew over the years.  He is right to say so, for a relationship there undoubtedly was, equally certainly, it grew and developed.  How could it not do?  For month after month, year after year, even when the mother relocated to a different part of the country, the father, at the relevant time of the month, travelled to the mother&#8217;s home and was able to provide semen with which she was able to try and impregnate herself.  It often involved the father staying overnight.  The couple were courteous to each other.  They spoke to each other respectfully.  They shared meals together. They watched television together in the mother&#8217;s sitting room.  For this, I suspect, essentially lonely man, the comfort of that arrangement took hold in his thoughts and he began to dream of some idealised family unit in which he was a part.  When, as certainly happened on one occasion, he alluded to such a future together, the mother showed no hesitation in refocusing his thoughts on a rather more prosaic reality. There was, sadly, in February 2009 a miscarriage.  I cannot begin to imagine the pain that would have caused this mother.  I am quite clear that JB would have been entirely incapable of consoling her.  I suspect nobody would, man or woman, at that stage.  She thought, and certainly until this hearing still thinks, that he was unfeeling at that time, but having heard from both of them, there was only one person in the world who came close to mourning the loss of that potential life more than the mother and that was the father.  His grief, as he told me about it, was alive and manifestly genuine.  That he could not reach or console the mother in those circumstances is no failing on his part, I find him to be, as I have mentioned, a gentle and kind man.  It has occurred to me that E gets his energy, enthusiasm and assertiveness from his mother, but his emotional intelligence from his father.  I am pretty sure that the mother would not accept that speculative analysis.  </span></p>

There were in addition obstacles of geography; these were two people from entirely different lives with different sexualities but they persevered to see if they could produce a baby.  Following the miscarriage, throughout the summer of 2009 into 2010 there were careful, planned, minutely orchestrated efforts to get the mother pregnant, almost all of which involved the father staying over regularly at the mother&#8217;s home.  There was in these arrangements, continuing as they did over years, an intimacy as well as a relentless commitment.  They were rewarded in April 2010 when the mother fell pregnant again.  </span></p>

I have not the slightest doubt that both parents were delighted by the pregnancy.  I have been told that the father attended at least one antenatal appointment, with the mother&#8217;s encouragement, in which he saw the ultrasound scan.  I have been told too that he attended a one day new parenting course at the St. Mary&#8217;s Hospital in Paddington on the mother&#8217;s recommendation.  The details, it seems to me, matter not, for what is beyond doubt is that this was a delight bordering upon euphoria in both of the adults.  That communicates itself both through the papers and in their oral evidence.  </span></p>

At or around the time of E&#8217;s birth there is no doubt at all in my mind that fact and fantasy blurred in the father&#8217;s mind.  The mother should, if I may say so, be more understanding and more forgiving about this period.  The end of the journey for her was to have the pleasure and the privilege of caring for E night and day.  The father simply went home.  That he embellished the facts and that he had to tell somebody something of what he was experiencing seems to me to be only human.  He was proud of his son.  He needed to share that pride.  He presented to the world a conventional heterosexual relationship.  I do not doubt that he did so in the most superficial of terms, but that single lie begot others when questions followed and so it was that this mother found herself in the situation, which I have described as being as of almost comedic proportions, visiting her &#8220;in laws&#8221; and being passed off as the father&#8217;s girlfriend.  I struggle to see how that could, if I may say so, ever have been a convincing performance by either.  It enraged the mother.  It communicated to her finally that the father had moved not only away from the flexible structure of what they had contemplated for the future, but, to her mind, and in my judgment rightly, he had moved for a while bag and baggage into his own fantasy world.</span></p>

He must guard against doing so.  For him not to do so, in my view, requires communication between the adults not as an optional extra, but as an essential, because the circumstances of E&#8217;s birth will need to be unfolded to him slowly and revisited in the light of his developing age and understanding.  He has a story which is really rather wonderful.  He should not be deprived of the truth of it and the extent of his parents commitment to him.  He was and is a very much wanted and loved little boy by both his parents.</span></p>

There were communications between the parties&#8217; respective solicitors, a cessation of contact for something approaching two years.  I have absolutely no doubt that contrary to the mother&#8217;s analysis of this period, that did not in any way show a lack of commitment to this child by the father.  I dismiss this as cheap forensic opportunism.  What this period really revealed was, I find, a profound determination by the father to keep the case out of the court room and a real effort to move forward by compromise, cooperation, negotiation.  It did not succeed.  His patience was not rewarded and the case came to court. At court the mother agreed to an extensive regime of contact.  She has told me that she felt pressurised into consenting to such an agreement by the father&#8217;s solicitor, the Cafcass officer and, indeed, the District Judge.</span></p>

I have given that thought repeated and careful consideration, but I have come to the clear view that the mother&#8217;s ambivalence towards the contact the District Judge ordered (by consent) really reflects the ambivalence that she has always felt about contact.   In her evidence she told me that she was very aware that there were less personal options for acquiring semen donation in organisations regulated by the HFEA in which she would not have to run the gauntlet of potential future disagreements.  She told me that she wanted to identify a father who would be a &#8216;real&#8217; and &#8216;physical presence&#8217; at stages throughout the child&#8217;s life rather than &#8216;just a name&#8217; that her son would be entitled to know when he reached his majority.  </span></p>

Once the &#8216;contact&#8217; bottle is opened it cannot easily be re-corked.  The child at some stage will inevitably influence the evolution of the relationship.  It was this realisation which, in my judgment, unnerved the mother.  As E&#8217;s relationship with his father developed so quickly and instinctively, despite the constrained nature of the contact venue she realised that in some way the child she regarded solely as hers would have to be shared not evenly, not even prescriptively but shared nonetheless.   This was frightening to the mother and impeded any logical or child focused thinking about how contact should progress.</span></p>

Of that I do not have the slightest doubt.  Ultimately, I take the view that, after E&#8217;s birth, the mother wanted to establish herself not as the primary carer but in effect as his sole carer.  She saw in her own mind the father playing a very peripheral role in E&#8217;s life. There is an inherent tension here between her wish to establish E&#8217;s relationship with his father and her desire to keep that relationship within a narrow constraint.  She did not contemplate him being involved in any of the major decisions relating to his welfare, but she was less than candid about that agenda to the father.  As time went by and week after week he visited to endeavour to bring the child into the world for both of them, I believe that she could simply not manage to communicate to him her true feelings about the extent of his involvement in the future.  More than that, I think she was inconsistent and unclear in her own mind as to what his role should be. They were united in their joint endeavour, committed to conceiving a child and inevitably, particularly, it seems to me, after the tragedy of the miscarriage, unclear about what the future would hold when and if a baby was ultimately born.  After such a long time trying to conceive, this couple simply did not dare to plan they were unable to see beyond conception itself for reasons which are so obvious as to require no explanation. </span></p>

The notes of the contact sessions are of a very high quality.  I am not sure how, but the mother managed to prevail on the contact centre to let her sit in and take notes. That was unkind to the father and to E but it has ultimately reassured the mother that contact is a relaxed and enjoyable experience for her son.  She can make no sensible criticism of the father at all and I have to say that had there been material I feel she would have been quick to alight on it.   This is a facet of the mother&#8217;s deep seated anxiety about contact, it is not driven by simple hostility.</span></p>

He gave evidence first.  It was he who was asked first to describe his son&#8217;s personality and it was strikingly similar to that offered by the mother later.  That he should know his son so well from what is still relatively limited contact sends a powerful signal to her that he is in fact a man who is capable of understanding his son&#8217;s needs.  He understands his personality.  He understands how to entertain and stimulate him and how to let him have fun.  He knows the importance of planning for contact and he has shown complete fidelity throughout the whole of those contact sessions to the mother&#8217;s wish that he should not luxuriate in any openly paternal role.  That must require for him, as it would for any father, incredible self-discipline and personal restraint.  That he can make that kind of sacrifice should reassure the mother when she contemplates what she perceives as his limitations to manage contact.</span></p>

I had contemplated continuing supervised contact, not because I thought it was necessary, but because I hoped that it would enable the mother to progress in her understanding of its quality and importance.  But, as the Guardian rightly says, there have now been15 sessions over 18 months evidencing precisely that point.  In effect, she says, to keep contact within the privations of a supervised contact centre would be to elevate, at this stage, the mother&#8217;s needs above those of the child and I would be losing my focus.  She was right to refocus me. Her compromise was sensitive and creative. She suggested that there should be supervision of handover, initial supervision of contact, unsupervised contact, followed thereafter by supervision of return.  I doubt any of that is necessary, but it involves relatively little intrusion into E&#8217;s life and strikes the balance for a short period, appropriately.  Before the evidence was concluded the advocates requested a short adjournment which produced an agreement.  A contact plan was drawn up which can be annexed to this judgment and which I need not set out here.  </span></p>

To recap, contact is agreed, unsupervised contact is agreed, expansion of unsupervised contact is agreed.  The father&#8217;s name will go on the birth certificate, this is automatic following the making of a declaration of parentage consequent on the fact of the &#8216;home donation&#8217; and as such it will be re-registered by the Registrar General.  Despite having come so far, ultimately the parties faltered on this last issue.  That it has been given such importance by both the parents is largely emotional and without logical basis.  Throughout the process I have observed the father repeatedly to yield to the mother&#8217;s wishes, in part because he thinks that she is usually right and, indeed, usually she is, but also because he is, in my mind, temperamentally passive.  The mother said as much in her own evidence.  Rather oddly, she told me that she wished, at times, he had been more assertive. I found that remark to be as genuine as it is difficult to understand, I draw from it only that the adults relationship here is complicated, perhaps inevitably so.</span></p>

Firstly, he submits that to grant a parental responsibility order would elevate rather than diminish the potential for conflict between the parties.  Secondly, he says, that however nebulous the court considers the plans were for the child&#8217;s future there has never been any real evidence to suggest that a Parental Responsibility Order was truly contemplated by either parent.  As he puts it, it was not &#8216;part of the deal&#8217;.  Thirdly, in a submission that Mr Khan recognises does not sit entirely comfortably with his first point, he contends that if I were to conclude that the father would not, in effect, use his Parental Responsibility Order at all, it is wholly unnecessary and therefore, conversely, should not be granted.  </span></p>

I cannot help but think that, with respect to Mr. Khan&#8217;s submissions, this also weighs heavily with the mother too, for her exhaustion with this process is every bit as great as the father&#8217;s.

It suffices to know that a man provided sperm to a female couple who were civil partners. The first child was born prior to the 2008 Act and the father had not infrequent contact.  The second child was born after the 2008 Act came into force.  The father had contact with that child too.  He was entitled to apply for section 8 orders in relation to the first child as of right but the 2008 Act provisions meant that he was not considered the legal father of the younger child and he therefore required leave to apply for section 8 orders in relation to that child, which he sought from Baker J.  He wished to apply for contact but also, as he could only acquire parental responsibility through a residence order, for 'parental responsibility/joint residence'.  The decision is of importance because it was thought to be the first involving an application for leave to apply for section 8 orders by men who were the biological fathers but, by virtue of the 2008 Act, not the legal fathers of their children. The issues requiring determination exposed the tension between the legal position as to fatherhood and the biological reality.&#160;</span></p>

He observed (&#167;116) that as a matter of law, it was right to describe the father as a &#8216;stranger&#8217; to the child but that in another sense, he was not a stranger.  He had been chosen by the lesbian couple to father their children, they had involved him in the preparations for birth and allowed him regular and frequent contact thereafter.  Baker J said that whilst the 2008 Act denied the biological father the status of legal parent it did not prevent the lesbian couple, in whom legal parenthood was vested, encouraging or enabling the biological father to become a psychological parent. So, he accepted the submission that &#8216;the potential importance of genetic and psychological parenthood is not automatically extinguished by the removal of the status of legal parenthood, and that social and psychological relationships amounting to parenthood can and often do co-exist with legal </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">parenthood&#8217; (&#167;119).&#160;</span></p>

Neither this court nor the Court of Appeal, has felt able to offer guidance as to how to approach welfare issues such as &#8216;parental responsibility&#8217; and &#8216;contact&#8217; in families where children are conceived by adult arrangement outside sexual intercourse.  </span></p>

But there was a relationship, it was respectful, it was inevitably intimate and it was enduring.  This was not a brief commercial encounter, far from it.  I also think it entirely unlikely, as Mr. Khan has said, that the father will use his Parental Responsibility Order in any way to undermine the mother.  For a start, as I have said, he shares so many of her objectives and feels her to be far better placed to pursue them.  I believe that ultimately he seeks the order so that his status as a father can be properly reflected in law.</span></p>

The grant of the application declares the status of the applicant as the father of that child.  It has important implications for a father whose child might for example be the subject of an adoption application or a Hague Convention application.  In each of those examples, a father with parental responsibility would have the right to be heard on the application.  He would have the right to be consulted on schooling, serious medical problems, and other important occurrences in a child&#8217;s life&#8221;.</span></p>

Of course, this father should be consulted if there are serious medical issues for E in the future, nor do I doubt that the mother will deny that.  He has the right to be consulted in schooling, not for his views to be determinative, but merely to be consulted.  The legal framework is predicated not on empowering anybody but ultimately in signalling responsibility for the child.  If ever two people took their responsibilities to a child seriously, it is this couple sitting before me this afternoon and the legal framework should merely reflect that achievement.</span></p>
