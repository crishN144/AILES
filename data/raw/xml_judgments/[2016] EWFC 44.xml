The court is respectful of the rights of the parents and will reunite parents and children wherever possible, and also of the position of Hungarian law, but in the end the children&#8217;s welfare must come first.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.16in"><span style="font-size:12pt">There are three legal ways in which the children could stay with the foster carers: a care order, a special guardianship order (SGO), or an adoption order.  Adoption can only be allowed if there is no other way of meeting a child&#8217;s needs.  That is the position here.  The advantages of an adoption order for the children are far stronger than the disadvantages.  The children&#8217;s welfare requires adoption.  I will therefore dispense with the requirement for parental consent and make a placement order allowing Janetta and Ella to be adopted in due course.</span></p>

The plan is for reports to be sent to the parents and for the parents to be able to write and receive replies.  The local authority will act as a post-box.  Once the children are adopted, the adopters will decide what is sent and received.  Until then, I direct that reports should be sent to the parents each March and September.  These can include photographs of the girls if the prospective adopters agree.  The parents can send messages to the children in April and October.  I hope that this arrangement will be regular, but even if the parents do not communicate I would expect the adopters to send them a report once a year as a minimum.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.16in"><span style="font-size:12pt">These proceedings have taken far, far too long.  They were slow to start and have now been going on for two years nine months.  The delay has caused problems for the children and their carers, for the parents and the wider family, and for the professionals.  What has happened in this case is not typical of good practice in our family justice system.  Nowadays, decisions for such young children are normally taken within six months.  This case could have taken a little longer because of the international aspect, but it should certainly have been completed within a year.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian rightly said that the children have been let down by the judicial system.  The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> (&#8216;the ACA &#8217;) states at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(3)</ref> that the court must at all times bear in mind that, in general, any delay in coming to a decision is likely to prejudice the child&#8217;s welfare.  This case is a sorry reminder of the importance of that general principle.</span></p>

For some time he had contact and saw that the children were not being well cared for by their mother. She then put them in a home. Despite this, he moved to England in 2011 and saw nothing more of those children, nor did he play any part in the adoption process, which took place about six months after Janetta and Ella were removed. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">These parents met and began their relationship in 2010. In July 2011, when the mother was pregnant with the older of the two children in this case, whom I shall call Janetta, they travelled to this country. Janetta was born here in January 2012. The family had some contact with the local authority in April and May 2012, because of their accommodation problems, and both the local authority and the Hungarian embassy offered to support their return to Hungary, but in fact they stayed here. </span></p>

Before beginning the proceedings, the local authority had commissioned assessments of the children&#8217;s maternal grandmother and great-grandmother in Hungary from Children and Families Across Borders (CFAB). The maternal grandmother was unable to offer a home but the great-grandmother had suitable accommodation and was willing to offer the mother and children a home, provided that the father played no part in their lives. At that stage the father did not want his own mother to be assessed as a possible carer. The local authority had also been in touch with the Hungarian Central Authority (&#8220;HCA&#8221;), which had, in January 2014, suggested that the solution was for the Hungarian authorities to bring the children back to Hungary, as they were Hungarian citizens and their relatives could keep in contact with them there. Also, if they were to be adopted, &#8220;only the Hungarian authorities have the right to adopt Hungarian citizen minors&#8221;.

The father&#8217;s whereabouts were unknown but the mother had been in touch with her solicitor by telephone. At that stage she accepted 11 of the findings sought by the local authority. Five of these related to the circumstances in which the family were living and the lack of medical attention when Ella was born. Two related to the risk of harm stemming from domestic abuse in the parents&#8217; relationship and the father&#8217;s aggressive and volatile personality.

In August, the social worker discovered that the mother, father and the new baby were all living with the paternal grandmother. The social worker&#8217;s assessment of the paternal grandmother (over the telephone) was negative. There being no viable family placement in Hungary, the local authority&#8217;s final care plan, supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, was that the girls should be adopted. Their current foster parents were being given active consideration as their adopters (and have since been approved as such). Accordingly the local authority issued a further application for a placement order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>. This authorises the authority to place a child for adoption without parental consent (it is a separate question whether parental consent to the actual adoption order should be dispensed with).

It was relisted for November 2014. The mother&#8217;s position was that she wanted to look after the children in Hungary; failing that, she wanted them to live with the paternal grandmother in Hungary; failing that, she wanted them to live with the maternal great-grandmother in Hungary; and failing that, for them to be placed in a children&#8217;s home in Hungary. The father wanted to look after them with the mother in the paternal grandmother&#8217;s home; if the parents&#8217; cohabitation was not acceptable, the children should live with the mother in the maternal great-grandmother&#8217;s home and he would stay in England; in his oral evidence he said that he would stay and work in England, but spend holidays living with the mother and children at the maternal great-grandmother&#8217;s home. The HCA now took the view, apparently based on the CFAB and English social worker&#8217;s assessments, that there was no suitable family member in Hungary; so the children should be placed with a foster parent there, so that they could keep the connection with their parents. The local competent authority would make a decree appointing a guardian and foster parent for them. Two professional colleagues would come to England to escort the children to their foster placement in Hungary. Only the Hungarian authorities had the right to adopt them.&#8221;</span></p>

She reached the firm conclusion that the children could not live with their parents because of the continuing risk of violence from the father, because the mother is a vulnerable person who is controlled and intimidated by the father, because the parents do not recognise the girls&#8217; very great needs and their own difficulties, and because there is a very high risk of neglect.  The great-grandmother said that she would only offer help to the mother and could not care for the children on her own.  In later discussion, she was critical of the parents, said that she could not care for the children and that they should remain where they are in England.  During this visit, the paternal grandmother withdrew from the assessment process altogether and signed a statement to this effect.</span></p>

The father spends a lot of the time playing physical games, such as throwing the girls in the air or encouraging them to climb on furniture and jump into his arms.  There is not much communication of other kinds, but at least he makes an effort.  In contrast, the mother, even though she had not seen the children for over a year, simply sits and watches, making very little effort to communicate with the children.

It must also respect the family life of the parents and the children under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  This duty is consistent with the legislation and a number of appeal court decisions emphasise that adoption against the wishes of parents can only be approved if it is found to be necessary for the welfare of the children after a fully balanced comparison of all the realistic options.  That principle has been fully explained by the President in his judgment in these proceedings at paragraphs 27-40, and I apply it.  I emphasise that the court is not engaged in a comparison between the relative abilities of the parents and the foster carers.  Children are not removed from their parents because others might be able to look after them better.  They are only removed because the parents cannot look after them properly.</span></p>

The first, which is not of immediate effect, is achieved by the adopted person personally petitioning once she has become an adult: Act No. 13 of 1979 on International Private Law (&#8216;the IPL Act&#8217;) at clauses 70/A(1) &amp; (2).  The second arises under IPL Act clause 43 which provides that a non-Hungarian national may adopt a Hungarian national with the consent of the Hungarian guardianship authorities, which can only be given if the adoption complies with the conditions as prescribed by Hungarian law.  Those conditions are set out in Title XI of the Hungary and civil code, which at Section 4:124 requires that the parents have failed to keep in regular contact for a year or any contact for half a year.  </span></p>

This case was promptly transferred to High Court level in February 2014.  However, it was not allocated to one judge and instead during 2014 hearings took place in front of five judges of the Division and three deputy judges.  This was described by the President as wholly unacceptable (paragraph 172).

This made it harder for it to make its earlier assessments and plans.  There was then an unreasonably long appeal period that lasted for 18 months, during which nothing could be done.  </span></p>

Her conclusion, consistent with the views of Dr Kovacs and Dr Bailly, was that the parents have fixed ideas and cannot understand how difficult it would be for the children to move.  Managing that level of emotional need would require the most exceptional parenting.  Any parent would struggle, and it is impossible that a transfer to the care of these parents would work.  The girls have their own different needs and attachments.  There is an ever-present risk of violence from the father.  The parents are living hand-to-mouth.  Their relationship is unstable and any promise to separate could not be relied on.  Their plans for the children constantly change (see the summary provided by Mr Twomey for the local authority, showing how many different plans they have put forward).  They have housing difficulties.  The mother is passive and does not engage in even basic play at contact; she could not care for four children.  No effective therapy would be available.</span></p>

At the moment, contact is very difficult, with Janetta being very challenging about having to attend, and Ella getting upset in consequence.  Like all prospective adopters, they know they would have to consider the issue once the children are older, but at the moment they do not believe direct contact is in their best interests.  </span></p>

However, the adoption should proceed even if indirect contact proved to be unreliable for practical reasons.  If, contrary to her views, direct contact was to continue, the level of support, supervision and assessment would be so high that it could only be provided under a care order.</span></p>

This cannot now be verified, but there is a network of elements suggesting neglect.  Her behaviour was not normal.  Her attachment was disrupted at a critical stage, but she has now recovered to the point where her attachment to her foster carer is almost secure.  For Ella, the foster carers have always been her psychological parents.  Both children use the English language as their mother tongue.  They and their carers have a common emotional language.  The effect of removal on the children would be </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;an emotional catastrophe of traumatic proportions&#8221;, </span><span style="font-size:12pt">even more so for Ella than Janetta, although she might have somewhat greater powers of recovery.  It is not possible to know how the children might react, but they would undoubtedly suffer grief and, as with any bereavement, might become stuck in that process and experience depression.  They would experience a total loss of their familiar relationships and environment, affecting their ability to trust adults.  The losses would be aggravated by the different cultural expectations and language.  There are layers of difficulty in proposals for a move.  In the first place, it would be against the children&#8217;s wishes.  Every child reacts differently.  Some rebel and fight, others submit and may become depressed.  Given their different ages and stages, these children might react very differently from each other.  Where such changes are forced upon children, they have to adjust, but the outcomes are not predictable.</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s behaviour at contact in July, the first time she had seen the children in over a year, was so striking that it suggests that she might have psychological difficulties of her own.  Dr Bailly had never seen a parent react like that: this frozen behaviour would be bound to make a child question what the parent thought of them.  In the father&#8217;s case, he was trying very hard but his strategy was not best for the children and there was no meaningful exchange between them.  The notes of the next contact occasion were almost a carbon copy of the contact that Dr Bailly observed.</span></p>

A move to a &#8220;bridging&#8221; foster placement in Hungary would be particularly bad solution, involving the prospect of a series of broken attachments. </span></p>

The parties were relying on judges to provide a steer, but there was no continuity and different judges gave opposite steers.  The judicial system has in her view failed these children by not taking responsibility for them.  On three occasions, the family has been prepared for the girls to be &#8220;going back&#8221;: March 2014, November 2014 and November 2015.  As a result, Janetta has been wondering what is going to happen to her next.  </span></p>

It is important that the girls are not different to their siblings.  Even the possibility of future litigation under an SGO would have an impact on the girls&#8217; emotional well-being.

There is a richness in the foster home.  There are other adopted children.  Further, these are not callow adopters, but experienced foster parents with children of their own.  They have the capacity to love children regardless, and they have a strong support network, including through their local church.  They have been trained to sustain a child&#8217;s sense of identity and have worked hard to nourish the children&#8217;s Hungarian links.  There is no fear that they would eliminate the children&#8217;s past.  The children will need life story work, and their interest in the birth family may increase as they approach adolescence, when they will need support.  In this regard, Ms Lain noted that for the children to continue to meet the parents might be a double-edged sword, because they would not get a positive view of them if they were not enjoying contact.  She did not consider that stopping contact would be a loss to the children at this stage.  The relevance was to the children&#8217;s identity in later life.</span></p>

Hungarian and Roma by birth, but British by life experience.  As emphasised by the President (paragraph 104 onwards) and by Baroness Hale (paragraph 61) the court must give the most careful consideration to the children&#8217;s national, cultural, linguistic, ethnic and religious background.  In this case, the children&#8217;s Hungarian and Roma heritage are of great importance and will be part of their mental make-up throughout their lives.  However, that heritage is not at the centre of their lived experience.  These children have never been to Hungary and it was not their parents&#8217; intention that they should grow up there.  Culturally and linguistically, these children&#8217;s characteristics are British and they are growing in a very different emotional atmosphere to the one they would have experienced if their parents had not left their home country.  Consequently, Janetta and Ella&#8217;s Hungarian Roma background is of long-term importance for their future lives, but it is of less significance for their immediate needs because there is no way in which that life could be created for them without destroying everything that they know and love.  In considering this important aspect of the matter, I therefore have full regard to the children&#8217;s Hungarian background, but also to the lifetime that they have spent in this country.</span></p>

As Baroness Hale notes (paragraph 61) the court has to consider the disadvantages of a &#8220;limping&#8221; adoption order which might make it difficult for them ever to visit Hungary.  This, she says might tell in favour of finding other ways of giving the children the security and stability they need.  In fact, the expert evidence is that the most obvious &#8220;other way&#8221; &#8211; an SGO &#8211; might well also face problems of recognition.  Be that as it may, the disadvantages arising from the different legal positions are not likely to be of such practical effect in this particular case that they speak strongly against the making of adoption orders.  There will be other cases where it is of the first importance that the children can come and go in their country of origin, but this is not such a case.  I naturally hope that if an adoption takes place, the Hungarian authorities will consider whether it can be recognised, taking account of the children&#8217;s welfare, but that is of course entirely a matter for them.</span></p>

If this took place in England, they would remain under a care order, requiring them to have social work supervision until the end of their childhoods.  Their carers would not acquire parental responsibility for them and the children would stand out as different in the family home.  This is an option that is not realistic in my opinion as it completely fails to meet the children&#8217;s needs for a feeling of stability and belonging.  Long-term foster care can hardly ever be appropriate for such young children and the only situation in which it could begin to be considered in this case is if it was going to be in the children&#8217;s interests to have ongoing direct contact, because a care order would be the only way in which this could be effectively managed.</span></p>

It is theoretically possible for the court to order contact to take place after adoption, but this is very rarely done.  If the adopters agree to contact, an order is not necessary.  If they do not, it is not likely to be appropriate.  For the reasons given by the social worker and the Guardian, continuing contact is not in the children&#8217;s interests and is likely to be more and more disturbing to them; in fact, it is likely to break down.  The parents unfortunately do not have the insight and capacity to support the children through face-to-face contact, and contact would instead create feelings of resentment and insecurity with no balancing benefits.</span></p>

Each of these differences speaks in favour of adoption in the present case.  It is not in the children&#8217;s interests for them to have anything short of full membership of a family that they can call their own.  An SGO would not, with respect to Mr Macdonald&#8217;s submission, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;reflect the reality of the children&#8217;s experience as members of two families&#8221;.  </span><span style="font-size:12pt">That is not the children&#8217;s experience, and nor is it in their interests to be members of two families.  It is not in their interests for the adults they know as their parents to have to negotiate with anybody else.  It is not in their interests for the legal arrangement to come to an end when they are 18 &#8211; they need a family for life.  Even if the parents had difficulty in making an effective contact application from Hungary, it is the psychological uncertainty that matters as much as the outcome.</span></p>

It meets the children&#8217;s needs in a way that special guardianship cannot.  Although it is the strongest order that the court can make, it is the only one that meets the needs of Janetta and Ella throughout their lifetimes.  Their welfare demands it, and the consent of the parents to a placement order must be dispensed with.  The interference with the parents&#8217; rights is necessary and proportionate.</span></p>

The father makes no such application.  In this respect, it should be noted that in May 2013 the court endorsed the parties&#8217; agreement at a time when all were legally represented.  I make no further comment in relation to that claim.  There were times during the hearing when questioning appeared to focus on this period, even though it was not of direct relevance to the outcome, and as I will be the judge determining that application, I have avoided making reference to that issue.  </span></p>
