He was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation by his family and then by paramedics but for at least 18 minutes no oxygen was being carried to his brain.

On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022 an order for the instruction of a jointly instructed expert was made.  The expert Dr Hanrahan reported on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2022.  Discussions then took place between the parties, and it was agreed that mediation should be attempted.  The mediation took place on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2022, but it did not result in agreement.

I have been provided with statements from family members but also from friends. Mr B&#8217;s wife and all three daughters attended the hearing remotely.  I heard really moving evidence from his second oldest daughter, SB, and a close friend of her father&#8217;s, AM.  Neither found it easy to talk about this very special man.  It made it clear how difficult Mr B&#8217;s situation is for his family and friends.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The descriptions they gave in evidence overlapped.  They speak of the same qualities which define the person he is.  He is a family man but also a man who is at the heart of the local community.  He is a very hard worker, his work spills over from his job building and doing car repairs into his support for his large family and anyone in the local community who needs his help.  He takes their children to school, collects children from work, assists his wife with the shopping and until these awful events he had not spent more than one night away from his wife of 34 years.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He is described as a strong man, not particularly tall, a doer who could lift one end of a grand piano whilst four men were lifting the other end.  He had a sense of humour, was fun to live with and told stories.  He laughed a lot and I have seen some photographs of his family life with some of his wonderful children.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The tragedy is that he was middle-aged, very active and had a whole life in front of him with his family and now he will not be able to see his children as they grow older and perhaps have families of their own. He has 13-year-old twins and they will miss the guidance of this really rather extraordinary father, perhaps at the time they need it most. His considerable support for his wife M is now removed and she will have to make her way without him although I have no doubt, she will have the support of her daughters and sons. </p>

He supported them fully, they all lived together in the same house and he was at the heart of the house along with M. They are extremely fortunate to have this wonderful man as their husband and father.  Just in the way he has supported them throughout their lives, they now want to support him at his time of need.</p>

Professor Wade provided an independent opinion on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2022 and having examined Mr B, met the family and the clinicians and read the notes, said that there was &#8220;no consistent and repeated evidence of any behaviour suggesting awareness&#8221;. The treating team had assessed him occasionally using an observational tool which was designed to measure awareness and responsiveness. Mr B had three reflex responses only.  All the behaviours Professor Wade observed such as eye movement and other sensory pathways were automatic and there were few of them.  The clinical team had noted he often did not respond to pain.  He still retained a startle response to sudden noise.  His eyes were closed but if open he stared ahead.  The only noise he made was coughing.</p>

Purposeful movement is something else that is considered.  Unfortunately Mr B had shown no evidence of either discriminating between stimuli or of purposive behaviours.

Dr Hanrahan described him as being in a vegetative state.  Mr B has no awareness of the world around him and any movements he makes are reflexive and automatic.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">First, I am to consider Mr B&#8217;s previously stated views on life-support and sustaining life artificially.  Unfortunately, the family have made it clear that Mr B had not stated his views about what he would like to happen in the circumstances in which he now finds himself to be in.  At his fairly young age it is not surprising that he had not given it any thought.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Second, I am to consider Mr B&#8217;s enjoyment of his life as it is now.  There is no evidence that he enjoys his current life.  All the evidence is that he has no awareness of where he is or who is with him or what has happened to him.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Third, another consideration is Mr B&#8217;s prognosis if clinically assisted nutrition and hydration were to continue.  The consensus is that he would live for approximately seven years.  There would be no prospect of recovery of any of his functions.  His quality of life would remain as it is currently.  At best his minimally conscious state may improve such that he would remain at the very lowest end of the minimally conscious state but that would mean he may feel pain and discomfort.  There is no suggestion that even at best, he will ever recognise his family again.  His physical presentation would get worse.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Fourth, I must consider the prognosis for Mr B if clinically assisted nutrition and hydration were discontinued.  He would die within a few weeks.  A palliative care package has been developed and was provided to Dr Hanrahan who had no suggestions to make which would have improved it.  Understandably the family have not been able to consider it in any detail.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Having considered the plan with care, it seems thorough, well thought through and sensitive involving a hospice and a continuing high standard of care.  Significantly it takes into account Mr B&#8217;s cultural and religious needs.  I asked whether the six children and their mother would be allowed to visit their father together.  I am assured that this will be considered with sensitivity by the hospice.  </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Sixth, I must take into account the significant issue of the views of the family and of the medical professionals caring for Mr B.  The views of the clinicians caring for Mr B are to be found in the bundle of evidence I have been provided with. Their views are supported by the independent evidence of Professor Wade and Dr Hanrahan which I have summarised above.  </p>
	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">The family&#8217;s views have been set out in a compelling way in their statements and in the evidence of SB.  Their feelings of loss and bewilderment about what has befallen this close family are palpable.  They say this strong man with a fighting spirit would fight to remain with his family as long as he is able to.  They may wish for more time to be given to their father to see if recovery is possible, but the medical professionals are clear that he will never recover.  The best that can be expected is a lesser minimally conscious state where he might feel pain.  That is not the recovery the family wish for.  </p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">In terms of the time in which may have recovered, he has been in this vegetative state for just under 15 months.  Sadly, there have been no first signs of recovery but there have been reflexive responses.  These have had the effect of providing hope to a family watching and wishing for any sign of recovery but he will never return home and the greatest sadness is that he will never recognise his family again.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Seventh, dignity, it is hard to see how Mr B has any dignity in his current state.  He has all his needs taken care of and is punctured by tubes which bring him nutrition, hydration and medication, they help his breathing and carry away any waste products.  He is prone to serious infections and has bed sores which are being managed.  There is very little dignity in his circumstances.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Eighth, is the sanctity of life generally.  Mr B is a practising Muslim, he celebrated the important festivals and went to the mosque regularly.  I noted his values and beliefs are reflected in the way he has lived his life with its emphasis on family, hard wark and charity in the community.   The family is concerned that taking away nutrition and hydration is speeding up the process of his death which his daughters say is &#8220;stopping what God has written for our dad&#8221;.  Another witness speaks about his concern that Mr B would suffer spiritually if clinically assisted nutrition and hydration was withdrawn.  </p>
	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">In my judgment, it could be said that the life sustaining treatment delivered to Mr B thus far has already interfered with what God had written for their father.  By refusing to permit the continuation of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration the Court will not be determining when Mr B will die, the time of death in those circumstances will depend on factors which have nothing to do with the Court&#8217;s decision, nature will take its course.</p>

Mr B did not say what his views would be if he were placed in the situation he finds himself in.  He never had to consider whether he would want to continue in a vegetative state being visited by his family on a daily basis.  He was an active man who never sat still, who was the heart of his family and deeply involved in the local community and never had to think what it would be like to be utterly powerless with all his needs taken care of and with no awareness of his family let alone being able to communicate with them.</p>
