	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I heard this case on 6 July 2010. On that day I gave the local authority, unconditional permission to withdraw care proceedings relating to the 5 children of the B family, whose ages range from 12 to 5. I made no other order. I reserved my reasons, however,  because I refused; (1)  an application by the local authority under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>) for leave to invoke the inherent jurisdiction in relation to one of the children, MB, alternatively for permission to make an application for a specific issue order in relation to MB; (2) an application by the children&#8217;s father for the permission to the local authority to be granted only on terms; and (3) an application by MB&#8217;s guardian&#8211; which would itself have required an adjournment -  for permission to instruct an expert to give a second opinion on MB&#8217;s treatment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event, the case has centred on MB, a boy, who is now six. Although the local authority had taken care proceedings in relation to the other B children, three of whom have particular difficulties, it acknowledged that, in their cases, its entirely proper concerns had abated, and that proceedings in relation to them were no longer appropriate. They are, accordingly, cared for by their parents at home. This has always been the position, and it will remain.</p>

They set out the serious and life-threatening nature of MB&#8217;s seizures and expressed significant concerns about the parents&#8217; lack of co-operation in considering treatment options, including the mother&#8217;s failure to bring MB to a two day assessment programme fixed for 14 and 15 November 2009. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The care proceedings  relating to MB came before me on 27 May 2010 as a review hearing for MB and as the adjourned case management conference in respect of his siblings. At the point I had a report  from MB&#8217;s hospital treating team  signed by his Paediatric Neurologist Dr.SV and dated 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">h</span> May 2010. This report was prepared following a multi-disciplinary assessment on MB in April 2010. The report recommended epilepsy surgery as &#8220;the most optimal way forward in MB&#8217;s management&#8221;. </p>

This is  because obstructive apnoea during seizures deprives MB&#8217;s brain of oxygen. The report stated clearly that surgery was recommended. Surgery, it was said, had an 85% chance of seizure freedom, and a further 10% chance of &#8220;significant improvement&#8221;.</p>

This, it was stated, posed a <span style="font-size:10pt"/>severe danger to MB in view of the risk of harm from seizures and the risk of furthe<span style="font-size:10pt">r</span> neuro- developmental problems. </p>

However, it was stated  that any benefit was likely to be transient and temporary.<span style="font-size:10pt"> A </span>trial of steroids did not change the recommendation for surgery. Steroids were not a long-term option. Immunotherapies  such as azathioprine, it was said, had  been discussed before, and the team did not  think them likely to be helpful at this advanced stage of the disease. In short, the team&#8217;s view was that MB had reached the stage where the effect of any anti-epileptic drug was temporary, and further drugs were not expected to be helpful. Dr. SV had apparently indicated orally to the local authority  that surgery could take place within 2 months of  this being agreed or authorised.</p>

The father made it clear that he did not agree that MB had reached the stage where any anti-epileptic drug effect was temporary. He supported further treatment by medication and further investigation into the  types of medication that could be used. The father had consistently rejected the use of steroids. The father set out his concerns that surgery was irreversible and that it might affect MB&#8217;s current level of mobility. The father also raised concerns at his lack of inclusion in discussions with the hospital over MB&#8217;s treatment.</p>

The mother had previously indicated that she thought immuno-modulatory drugs should be given a chance to work before surgery was considered. Unfortunately, the mother only had an opportunity to see Dr. SV&#8217;s report for the first time at the hearing on  27 May 2010. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At that hearing, I ascertained from the local authority that it was not its intention to remove MB from his parents&#8217; care under a care order. The local authority, however, took the view that surgery was in MB&#8217;s best interests, and invited me to determine the question of surgery at the hearing fixed for  6 July 2010.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I made it clear in argument that I did not regard the care proceedings relating to MB as a proper process for such a decision. The local authority was not seeking a care order with a care plan for surgery: it simply took the view that surgery was in MB&#8217;s best interests and should be ordered by the court. I therefore took the view that if I was being asked to make a decision  that surgery was in MB&#8217;s best interests that issue had to be properly formulated. In the normal course of events the &#8220;lis&#8221; underlying such an issue would be between the hospital and the parents.  Care proceedings were not the appropriate forum for such a &#8220;lis&#8221;, since a care order involved broader welfare considerations of which surgery was only a part.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I therefore gave a short judgment on 27 May 2010,  in which I invited the hospital treating MB either to intervene in the proceedings or to issue a summons in respect of the proposed surgical treatment for MB, so that the court could decide on a properly constituted summons whether I should order surgery as being in MB&#8217;s best interests.  I also gave directions  requiring the local authority to notify the parties and the court as to the  orders it was seeking in respect of MB and further whether they were proposing to withdraw the proceedings in respect of his siblings.</p>

On the first day at court, she said,  the mother had signed a written agreement.  Thereafter at later court hearings the mother agreed to and did facilitate MB attending the two day comprehensive assessment at the hospital in April 2010. Both parents had now agreed to MB receiving treatment for his precocious puberty.

The reasons why drug treatment was no longer being recommended for MB were clearly set out in this report. The second report dated 21 June 2010 stated that other treatments were available for MB but none of the treatments outlined were in fact recommended for him. Dr.SV stated that at her recent meeting with the parents it had become clear to her that &#8220; both parents and certainly the mother, had not appreciated just how life-threatening the frequent seizures MB has are for him&#8221;.

Both involved the  use of  blood or blood products in operations on children whose parents were Jehovah&#8217;s witnesses. In the former case, the local authority applied for a care order in relation to the child, on the ground that  there was an urgent and continuing need for medical treatment which included blood transfusions.  Johnson J had to decide two issues: (1) whether the court should override the sincerely held beliefs of the parents; and (2) the legal framework in which the question was best decided. The judge decided that his duty to the child required him to ensure that whenever the need arose the child would receive the transfusion of blood or blood products that medical advice dictated. On the second question, the judge&#8217;s view was that the correct route was to make an order under the High Court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.12in">I am in complete agreement with the essential premise of the conclusions reached by Johnson J. Such issues are of the utmost gravity and are of particular anxiety since the decision of the court may run counter to the most profound and sincerely held beliefs of the parents. For these reasons the most strenuous efforts should always be made to achieve an inter partes hearing. Such issues should also be determined, wherever possible, by a High Court judge and this is of particular importance in those exceptional circumstances where an application must be made ex parte so that the parents cannot be heard. But in my judgment these prerequisites can be as well met by an application for a specific issue order under s 8 as by an application for the exercise of the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction. A section 8 application can, and in circumstances such as these undoubtedly should, be made to the High Court. When leave to make it is sought by a local authority, or other appropriate body or person, the district judge, as in this case, can give all necessary directions for a speedy hearing. It will then be heard by a High Court judge. Although there is yet no reported decision as to whether or not a specific issue order can be made ex parte, I should be very surprised if the words of the statute had to be interpreted so narrowly as to deny the court power to give such relief where it was otherwise justified and the circumstances compelled an ex parte hearing. But if such an issue were to come before a judge of the Family Division who was constrained to find the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to be so limited, the power to invoke the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the court would be immediately available and appropriate.</p>

The judge answered all three questions in the affirmative. All three members of the Court of Appeal gave judgments.

Having reviewed the law, she said: - <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 502" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 502</ref> at 509: -</p>

He accepted the unchallenged clinical opinion of the three consultants and assessed the reasonableness of the mother&#8217;s decision against that medical opinion. Having held that the mother was unreasonable he accepted that the liver transplant would be likely to prolong the life of C and in the absence of any reasonable argument to the contrary he came to the clear conclusion that he should consent to the operation. Since he had already decided the mother&#8217;s approach was unreasonable he did not weigh in the balance reasons against the treatment which might be held by a reasonable parent on much broader grounds than the clinical assessment of the likely success of the proposed treatment. Some of the objections of the &#160;mother, such as the difficulties of the operation itself, turned out, from the evidence of Mr R, to be less important than the mother believed. Underlying those less important objections by the mother, was a deep-seated concern of the mother as to the benefits to her son of the major invasive surgery and post-operative treatment, the dangers of failure long term as well as short term, the possibility of the need for further transplants, the likely length of life, and the effect upon her son of all these concerns. The judge did not assess the relevance or the weight of such considerations in his final balancing exercise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, the question of MB undergoing surgery is currently a matter between his parents and the hospital. The hospital is not inviting me to decide that issue, nor are MB&#8217;s parents. There is, accordingly, in my judgment no proper &#8220;lis&#8221;, and no issue for the court to decide.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, it seems to me that the court should be acute to recognise the limitations of its role. Parliament, in passing the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>),  has placed a sharp and clear division between the functions of courts and local authorities. It is properly within the court&#8217;s province to decide whether or not MB and his siblings should be the subject of care orders: it is plainly not the court&#8217;s function to decide issues which are the responsibility of others or outside the ambit of its proper role.  The court cannot control the activities of social services or any other of the  departments of local authorities, nor should it attempt to do so. Not only is the issue of surgery for MB not before me, therefore, but as presently constituted it is not an issue for the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority is not now seeking care orders: to the contrary, it seeks to withdraw its applications for such orders. It seems to me, therefore, that my function, on the facts of the case as presented to me, is to  satisfy myself that such withdrawals are appropriate. Having done so, I have no further function. MB will undoubtedly remain a child in need within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> and Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, and will be subject to the statutory procedures laid down by Parliament for local authority support under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  The court has no role to play under Part III.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can, accordingly, deal swiftly with the father&#8217;s submission (set out in paragraph 26 above) that I should only grant the local authority permission to withdraw on terms. I repeat what I have already said. In my judgment, these are matters for the local authority not the court, and there is no nexus between the local authority&#8217;s application and what the father seeks. In any event, even if I were to take the view that conditions should be attached to the local authority&#8217;s application, there is nothing which I could do to enforce the conditions, should the local authority decline to implement them.</p>

In my judgment, however, neither the court nor the guardian has any current role in that process, and on the facts as currently presented, MB&#8217;s welfare falls to be decided outside the ambit of court proceedings.  </p>
