He said she had always been anxious and nervous.  She is particularly anxious about health matters, both for herself and the children and about safety.  She only feels safe in that very small area of London.  This is not to say that the wife has any physical or mental disability - I was not provided with any evidence that she does - but it is certainly the case that she is acknowledged to be very anxious.  I've thought long and hard about how this should be managed and I asked her, if she had a certain amount of money to buy a house, what would her priority be: The safety issue or the size of the accommodation?  She did not hesitate to say that for her it was safety that came first.&#8221;</p>

This approach necessarily carries with it, when considering the husband&#8217;s prospects, a need to recognise the possibility and thus the risk that, as he asserted in evidence, the husband would not do so, or at least that he would not do so in the short term.  But, in my judgment, this is overlooked by the judge later in her judgment when she is taking the husband&#8217;s earning capacity and prospects into account.</p>

The husband's contribution to the welfare of this family has been very significant.  He supports the family financially.  He has brought in the assets including those that he acquired before the marriage because needs dictated that they be brought in.  He will contribute by paying maintenance in future to the best of his ability.  The wife will also make a full contribution as the mother and main carer of the two children, who will not have recourse to practical help from the husband who will be living overseas.  The wife's homemaking and childcare contribution will last, at least, a further 13 years.  It is difficult to quantify a wife's contribution in terms of money and I shall not try.  But the care of young children and of teenagers has a value and she contributes all of the value of that care that she will provide for the children.</p>

It is hard for both the husband and a wife because they will have to scale down their households and their spending.  There is no alternative to it.

It was, and is, common ground that, as the judge found, housing is a very important issue and that the husband&#8217;s level of income meant that renting a home for the children in the area of the Old Brompton Road was no longer an affordable option.  However, as mentioned above, the judge concluded that it was fair and appropriate to assess the lump sum by reference to the purchase price of homes in that small and expensive area of West London.

There are problems with a Mesher Order.  The likelihood is that the trigger would not fire until about 15 years or so from now at which time the financial position of the husband and wife are likely to be completely different from what they are now.  It may be a problem for the wife at that time whilst being meaningless to the husband who may have recouped the capital provision that he has had to pay to the wife by rebuilding.  The wife is not in a position to rebuild capital because her earning capacity is limited due to her responsibilities to the children.  Her capital will all be tied up in a property whereas the husband has the opportunity to invest and grow capital.  Alternatively, there can be real unfairness to the person who is kept out of what would otherwise be his, i.e. the husband&#8217;s, fair share of capital.</p>

The additional sums which have to be paid to put the wife into the house are not reflected in the capital value of the asset that she will have.  Due to the greater earning capacity of the husband when he is able to exploit it by getting a better paid job, the disparity in capital is not so great that it would be unfair to the husband to make the capital provision and outright order with no charge back in favour of the husband. &#8221;</p>

Rather, it was based on the judge&#8217;s recognition of the possibility that he would be able to do so without any reference to, or analysis of, the possibility and risk that he would not be able to do so, and thus the husband&#8217;s evidence on this point.  So her reasoning includes a risk analysis that leaves a relevant factor out account and, as a result, it is heavily weighted in favour of the payee, albeit that, as the judge found, her earning capacity was limited and significantly hampered now and in the future because  of her role as a single residential parent.</p>

It is clear that all other property acquired during the marriage - other than by inheritance, will or gift, which would be private property - would be marital property.  In a sense all that the marriage settlement does, so far as the husband's private property is concerned, is to identify that he owned it prior to the marriage being celebrated and that it was not to be treated as joint property.  It does not define the party's entitlements in the event of marital breakdown.  It is silent as to the arrangements for S (the child already born to the parties) and it is silent as to any future children that the parties may have.  It is correct that the wife was not legally advised about the agreement, as Mr Swift in his document sets out.  It is correct that the husband's bargaining position was strong in that it was a condition of the marriage, that the parties were already engaged to be married, and the husband knew that the wife really wanted to be married.</p>

If it exercises the discretion itself, the appeal court is very unlikely to rehear the case, or to determine disputes of fact.

This is because those comments and guidance show that the appeal court should not step outside them if they are not tainted by the identified error or errors of law.

At the heart of that significant change, is the need to recognise the weight that should now be given to autonomy, and thus to the choices made by the parties to a marriage (see paragraph 78).  The new respect to be given to individual autonomy means that the fact of an agreement can alter what is a fair result and so found a different award to the one that would otherwise have been made (see paragraphs 75 and 79).</p>

This effects a change because previously the general approach to agreements of the type under consideration in this case (i.e. a pre-nuptial agreement) made between the parties on, or relevant to, the financial award to be made on their divorce was more paternalistic and protective of the payee.  The result was that generally they were given little or no weight, and so generally that they did not found a different award to the one that would have been made by the court if no such agreement had been entered into.</p>

The upshot of both cases is that, the House of Lords and the Supreme Court have decided that earlier reasoning processes and rationales that had been developed and applied to the judgmental or balancing act that is central to the exercise of the judicial discretion conferred by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>, with the objective of achieving a fair result, were wrong in law and so may well not have produced a fair result judged by reference to the correct approach to the exercise of the statutory discretion.</p>

This falls to be compared with the approach of the judge in reaching the figure for the lump sum of &#163;667,100.

On that approach the judge allocated all the lump sum and the assets in the wife&#8217;s name to the purchase of the new home, and left no remaining balance (save that there was probably an ability to make savings in respect of her allowance &#163;20,000 for moving and fitting out costs).  So, this comparison shows that the wife could have adopted this approach of the judge on the purchase of her new home and, if she had done so, she would have been left with a balance in her hands.

This is because it is directed to the reason why in this case an application of the marriage settlement, and the sharing principle, is not determinative of the allocation of available capital between the parties.  That reason is that, the housing needs of firstly the wife and the children, and then the wife, cannot be fairly met if the available assets were to be so divided.  But, it is not necessary to meet those needs by an outright transfer to the wife of all the capital needed to meet the housing needs because in the longer term, and after the needs and requirements of the children have been met, the wife&#8217;s housing needs can be met by  her downsizing to release capital.  So, her housing needs can be fairly met by delaying the payment or transfer to the husband of the capital that will be so released, and which would have been allocated to him now, if the result suggested by the matrimonial settlement and the sharing principle had founded the award.</p>

The problem is that any such provision to address the funding of the extension, and its impact on the husband&#8217;s percentage charge, is likely to be complicated, not least because of the real possibility that the husband would (directly or indirectly) be paying for, or contributing to, the costs of the extension.  So, subject to the provision (not included in either of the draft charges I have been sent) that the wife can by reference to a valuation (I suggest by an estate agent agreed or appointed acting as expert) buy out all or part of the charge (see paragraph 98 above), I have concluded that these problems should be left to agreement and/or adjustment of the periodical payments in the future. In my view, this approach favours the conclusion that the covenant sought by the husband in his draft charge that structural alterations are not to be carried out without his consent should be included, as reasonable conditions for that consent could include conditions on funding.  In any event, in my view such a covenant by a mortgagor is reasonable and appropriate.</p>

It arises from the different discretions involved in making the financial award and the costs award, which were reflected in the <span style="font-style:italic">Leadbeater </span>add back.  The costs of an appeal are not governed by the new starting point in the FPR, and the rule that costs follow the event does not apply, although &#8220;the event&#8221; can be a decisive factor (see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Baker v Rowe</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 761" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 761</ref>).  There are two stages of this appeal, namely the appeal itself, and then, the re-exercise of s. 25 exercise having regard to the present position (albeit that the new exercise is necessarily based on findings made by the judge at first instance).  If the wife was ordered to pay all, or a significant part, of the husband&#8217;s costs of the appeal she would not have the funds readily available to pay them and that liability would undermine, if not destroy, the rationale of the award made by the judge, which I must adopt, that the housing needs of the wife and children should be met in a small and expensive area of West London.  The wife&#8217;s only realistic prospect of paying the husband&#8217;s costs of the appeal without a sale of the home would be to borrow money on it and look to the husband (or her earnings) to meet the loan costs.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In my view, it is clear that the judge would have ordered that the wife should be paid that sum and so there is a powerful argument that the husband should make good that shortfall.  That delay in payment, without interest or an added sum to reflect late payment, would be fair to reflect the husband&#8217;s liquidity and the point that it was essentially the wife&#8217;s fault that the correct figure was not provided.  Further, in my view, the husband should not be at risk of paying interest (at judgment or any rate) until he receives that bonus.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The payment of that sum will increase the sinking fund available to the wife, before and after the payment of the repairs, to meet emergencies relating to the home.  The wife would be well advised to ring fence this additional payment and the sum presently standing to the credit of her savings account, and cut her cloth accordingly.  If she does not do so, it seems to me that this could well be a powerful factor against her if and when she seeks any upward variation of her periodical payments.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">The counter arguments are that (a) the judge did not envisage there being such a sinking fund and so, if it was not paid, it would not undermine the rationale of the award, or create unfairness, and (b) this sum should be set off against the husband&#8217;s costs.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, the charge back should be increased to 35.83% so that it includes the costs of the appeal that in my judgment the wife should pay to the husband.  His costs are reasonable, when compared with the wife&#8217;s costs, and when looked at in isolation and, fortunately for him and the wife, they are reduced by the fact that counsel appeared pro bono on the appeal (although the costs schedule indicates that he had charged for some earlier advice).  In my view, a fair summary assessment of the husband&#8217;s costs is &#163;18,750 (including VAT), which is 2.5% of the &#163;750,000 house price taken by the judge.  That increase in the percentage will not realistically undermine the rationale of the award and will not render it unfair, whereas an order that could be enforced now would do so.  Further, it is a proper and fair reflection of the point that the husband achieved what he sought on the appeal and the wife failed in her argument that there should not be a charge back.  Also, the husband will receive funds (the March 2012 tranche of his bonus) which will enable him to meet his costs of the appeal (or a sum borrowed to meet them) and the cash flow burden this imposes on him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I think that the best way to deal with this award of costs is to set out in a recital that I have determined that the wife should pay &#163;18,750 (including VAT) towards the husband&#8217;s costs of the appeal and that such order is to be satisfied by and through an increase in the charge back in favour of the husband from 33.33% to 35.83%.  </p>
