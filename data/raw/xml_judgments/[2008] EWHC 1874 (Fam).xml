His expertise is tax though he is now partially retired, extremely comfortably off and living in Monaco. R is a solicitor. His career has not been attended by the same success as M&#8217;s. He has had an intermittent problem with alcohol and has struggled at times to live within his means, requiring assistance in the past from F. I will set out later the impressions that I have gained of F, M and H from the papers and from their oral evidence but it is necessary first to set out something of the history that created the present issue. </span></p>

In 1954, F became the registered owner of 36 BR which became the family home. On 19 June 1986, Mabel Q died, aged 65.

Being significantly older than his wife, he had expected that he would die first and his property would pass to her. It provoked him to look at the question of inheritance tax. As a result, certain transactions took place later in 1986 involving 36 BR and assets from Mabel&#8217;s estate. There is a divergence of evidence as to the precise nature of these transactions with F and M on one side of the divide and H on the other.  </span></p>

There is a notification from the Rent Officer dated 5 November 1986 of a proposal to issue a certificate that &#163;1,500 per quarter would be a fair rent. That seems to have been the figure upon which the parties settled for the tenancy to F although a different figure appears for some reason in the tenancy agreement.  </span></p>

I am not entirely sure how this deed of variation came into existence and how it ties in with the other transactions relating to Mabel&#8217;s estate but I do not think that anything turns on those issues. The copy in the bundle seems to be a draft. It does not specify an exact date in June and is not signed. H&#8217;s evidence is that he believes the deed was executed and he speculates that the shares were omitted from the deeds of gift of 1986 and were being brought into line by means of the deed of variation. F&#8217;s evidence is that he needed a capital gains tax calculation before he decided which of Mabel&#8217;s shares he would transfer to H and M and for that reason, the deed of variation was not executed until 1988; M gave a similar account in oral evidence. </span></p>

Despite the 1986 deed of gift, it had remained in Mabel Q&#8217;s name. F&#8217;s oral evidence is that he sold it and the money went into his bank. M and H seem to accept that this is so. M said the sale was to a neighbour. From the documents, it is plain that the sale must have been some time after the start of 2005. Preceding the sale, various options had been discussed and, in particular, the issue of who would pay the CGT which might arise and for which H might technically be responsible. F seems ultimately to have agreed that he would pay it. H&#8217;s evidence is that the sale was against his wishes and in breach of his property rights but, whilst Sd is an important part of the background to these proceedings, it is not my remit to determine issues in relation to that property.</span></p>

In one way or another, M seems ultimately to have acquired de facto control of the majority of them although he regards himself as holding them for F, as indeed is his attitude to all assets deriving from F. F&#8217;s written evidence is that relatively recently he transferred the shares to M and released the title documents to him. In oral evidence he also mentioned having given M a power of attorney relating to the shares. M&#8217;s oral evidence was that in about 2001 or 2002, F had signed blank share transfer forms; they did not relate to specific shares and M did not have authority to use the forms until F was dead but he wanted the forms to avoid practical problems with the estate after F&#8217;s death. Dealing with the up to date position, he told me that the shares were &#8220;still a mess to some extent&#8221; but most had been transferred to him and were registered in his name or as belonging to an Isle of Man investment company of his. H is not privy to all the information available to F and M but also understands that the shares have now been transferred to M. </span></p>

He says he was concerned about the adequacy of his pension provision and &#8220;In essence I did not want to actually part with any of my assets during my lifetime or lose control of them.&#8221; He knew that for the tax to be avoided, the gifts had to look absolute so any conditions upon them had to be verbal. He says there were two face to face discussions on the subject of the proposed gifts. At the first meeting, he told his sons that he intended to give them the assets in equal shares but that he would retain control and ownership of them until he died. He said he would sign documents to show to the Inland Revenue, if necessary, to establish that the assets had been transferred to them but that he would require H and M to make a verbal promise to him that, as he puts it in his statement of April 2008, &#8220;they would not be getting any of my assets until I died, and that they would transfer the assets back to me at my request and without demur if I wanted them back&#8221;. He says the papers were drawn up and there was then another meeting. It took place at 36 BR. He said to H and M that he would not sign the papers transferring the assets unless they gave &#8220;a solemn and binding promise that the gifts would not vest until after my death&#8221;. He says he explained to them that he would be retaining the title documents and they would only receive them after his death. Both sons agreed to the conditions and &#8220;swore&#8221; to them. He then signed the documents but retained the title documents and, in particular, the deeds to 36 BR. </span></p>

I am not sure he agrees that there were two meetings on the subject as opposed to one but nothing turns on that. H&#8217;s case is that he would not have agreed to such conditions as they would have amounted to an attempt to mislead the Inland Revenue. He describes that, in the course of discussions, F said he might live a long time (he was then 76) and he was concerned that he might run out of money and wanted an assurance that if he did, H and M would help him out. H and M gave him that assurance although H considered it unlikely that the eventuality would arise because he understood that F&#8217;s assets were substantial and thought that he would be able to live comfortably without the assets he was giving away.  H says that F was also concerned about his occupation of 36 BR. H&#8217;s case is that he and M dealt with this understandable feeling of insecurity by the grant of the tenancy to F on proper commercial terms. </span></p>

When Mr EC gave oral evidence, it became clear that he was extremely partisan. He conceded that he approached the question of capacity as a property developer and not as a doctor and that by senility, he might have meant physical frailty. The thrust of his evidence was that any grandfather who could, as he saw it, attempt to evict a 6 &#189; year old boy (T, who is his godson) from his home had questionable mental capacity. </span></p>

The doctor&#8217;s report relating to an examination of F in June 2006 describes his mental faculties as &#8220;amazingly good&#8221;. That relating to March 2007 describes him as &#8220;sound in mind, rational, orientated in time and place and remarkable for his age&#8221;. In the witness box, F came over as generally cogent. In some respects, I thought he did have a perfectly clear recollection and was giving a truthful account of events. There were other respects in which, for one reason or another, this was not so. There were times when he became confused by questions. To an extent, this was not at all surprising given the passage of time since some of the events that were being examined and the complexity and detail of some of the documentation. To take one very small example, he denied ever having been upstairs in the house in C Close where H and W lived before 36 BR but he must have been because the lavatory was upstairs. A more significant example was his reaction to questions from Mr Jacob on H&#8217;s behalf about the transfer of 36 BR in October 2000 in relation to which I thought he had considerable difficulty in following and recollecting which was never fully resolved. He said initially that he had not the slightest idea why, as M said was the case, he had asked M to enter into that transfer. Later, after many questions, Mr Jacob took F back to the same passage in M&#8217;s evidence and F dealt with it almost as if he had never had his attention invited to it, let alone only a few minutes before. On revisiting the issue this second time, he said he thought he did agree to the transfer of the property into M and H&#8217;s joint names from M&#8217;s sole name because it &#8220;seemed only reasonable at the time&#8221;. </span></p>

In late 2003/early 2004, he had a stroke, not the first he had had and not permanently disabling but more serious than the previous minor ones. This was the culmination of an ill-conceived expedition from Alderney involving the purchase of a second hand car in Manchester which he intended to use to visit Sd in Suffolk. The expedition ended abruptly at the roadside in Brighton where he was found by the police lost, cold and out of petrol. On 19 January 2004, M wrote to F, then recovering at H&#8217;s from his stroke, reviewing what had happened to him.

His rather gloomy prognosis did not come to pass in that it proved possible to secure regular help for F in his own home in Alderney rather than F having to return to England but there can be little doubt that he was accurate in identifying a decline in F&#8217;s capacity. By 22 February 2005, however, he was satisfied that F was &#8220;entirely lucid&#8221; and remained &#8220;of full capacity&#8221; as he said in a letter to H, written after he had heard that H might be taking legal action against him in relation to F&#8217;s affairs. In a letter written by H to F in May 2005, H expressed disagreement with M&#8217;s assessment in the January 2004 letter that F&#8217;s faculties had faded and that he lacked good judgment and asserted that F was misguidedly letting M dictate his decisions when he could and should be dealing with things himself. On the other hand, in the same letter, he too accuses F of lacking good judgment, in his case in saying that he (H) was ungrateful with regard to 36 BR, and he says, &#8220;You have no idea how crossed your wires can get and I can only put this down to your advanced years.&#8221;</span></p>

It did not seem to me that it was profitable to pursue that argument because I concluded that there were almost certainly other reasons why F wished to remain the real owner of his assets. The view I formed of F, in part from the evidence in these proceedings but more so from what others said of him and from his actions and correspondence over the years, was that he was exceptionally careful about money, liked to be entirely in control of his own assets, and tended to use his resources as a means to exert control over his sons.

A notable example was his payment of the deposit of &#163;45,000 when H purchased a house at C Hill and the payment of some mortgage payments which H could not meet as a result of which his mortgagees were threatening repossession. Another example was, as F recalls it, the payment of &#163;50,000 in total to banks for H. In a letter of 11 April 1996 to H, F put the figure at about &#163;145,000 altogether. There are frequent references throughout the papers to H&#8217;s financial difficulties and F&#8217;s assistance. The letter of 11 April 1996 is, in my view, a good window through which to see F&#8217;s thought processes and the way in which he treated his power over his estate as a means to punish and control H. I have in mind particularly a long paragraph at the bottom of the second page of the letter in which F purports to revoke the 1986 gifts:</span></p>

One can see this in the papers. One can also see in the correspondence between family members how family relationships generally fluctuated.

The changeable feelings were not confined to the men, however. F&#8217;s view of W also underwent revision following her taking steps in relation to 36 BR and the break up of her marriage to H. From having praised her for her contribution to H&#8217;s more mature attitude to life and making a present to her of Mabel&#8217;s jewellery, he came to view her as motivated by greed to deprive him of his property and required that she return the jewellery.     </span></p>

M was considerably less forthright than F in acknowledging that anything wrong had been done vis-&#224;-vis the Inland Revenue in relation to the 1986 transactions. For example, he asserted that the tenancy and the ostensible payment of rent were merely to create an opportunity. He suggested that if F had released M and H from their 1986 promises at any point, the gifts could properly be treated as having been absolute from their inception and wanted me to accept that all he was doing was ensuring that this possibility was not scotched by F being treated as having reserved a benefit by virtue of having been allowed rent free accommodation for some years. The view he put forward was that nothing improper would have been done vis-&#224;-vis the Inland Revenue unless and until a false return was made about F&#8217;s estate after F&#8217;s death. He said, in oral evidence, &#8220;It is possible that an Inland Revenue officer at the back of the court might raise a case of conspiracy to defraud, though I don&#8217;t think it would succeed, but that is the limit of what he could say as these were real transactions which were really carried out&#8221;. </span></p>

However, if conditions had been imposed as M says, the passing of the 7 year period was only a cause for celebration if the intention was to conceal from the Inland Revenue when F died in due course that the gifts had all along been subject to reservations of benefit for F. I have no doubt that M would have been prepared to do this. It was a mainstay of the plan from the start. Ultimately, he agreed in cross examination that the good news was that they now had the opportunity to defraud the Revenue. If further confirmation is required of his attitude to the Inland Revenue in respect of questions of family taxation, one can look to a document that he drew up in around 1999/2000, entitled &#8220;Notes for FQ, RQ&#8221;. The final page culminates in &#8220;more radical advice in order further to compromise any possible IR attack&#8221;, dealing with ways in which to establish that F is no longer domiciled in England and including the following words, designed to address the fact that F would need to survive 3 years after his move to Alderney in order to achieve this objective,</span></p>

The evidence establishes that W was a good influence on him and that after their marriage, there followed some years of abstinence. However, before that, he drank and he has told me that he returned to drinking at times from about 2002. It affects him at times of stress, both in relation to his marriage and his family. In his May 2008 statement, he acknowledges his addiction as a curse that has caused pain and harassment to those around him, been a factor in the break up of his marriage to W and, recently, adversely affected his earning capacity. He says that the strain of litigation has had a very bad effect on him and makes it more difficult to return to being teetotal. Alcohol cannot be discounted as a factor that must have influenced H&#8217;s recall of events at times and his approach to life. In contrast, I do not set any store by his conviction for theft, whilst a student at Cambridge many years ago, which apparently arose from him taking books which had been left in a corridor. I did not consider that that shed any real light on his truthfulness or reliability as a witness now. </span></p>

She said that she saw a lot of F after her marriage to H and that they got on very well and liked each other. She found him a very pleasant person and called him Father. They were all very close and he was very proud of H at that time because he was sober. I entirely accept all of this. I also accept W&#8217;s evidence that she trusted F. I note that even after they were all at loggerheads over 36 BR, when she wrote to F on the subject in May 2005, she still addressed him as Father and ended her letter with a request that she and T could come to visit him in Alderney for a week. This might be passed off as a scheming attempt by a gold-digger to keep in favour but that would be wrong, in my view. W showed real emotion about the family situation during her evidence. She tried not to indulge this saying at first, &#8220;I am not upset&#8221; and then, when it was quite apparent that she was, saying simply, &#8220;I am, actually&#8221;. She was particularly (and I thought very genuinely) emotional when describing how, when she was pregnant, she had asked F to sort out the situation with regard to 36 BR and he said he would but later, after T had been born, told her he had lied. There is no doubt that she felt that she had trusted him and that he had betrayed her. The strain of the years of her marriage to H and her involvement with the Q family was evident.  </span></p>

M told me he was careful with words and I thought that was probably correct so his choice of words in this document was likely to be precise and deliberate. This particular phrase, in my view, only makes sense as a reflection of the hidden reality that the gifts were not absolute. Plainly, the proposed application by George Green to the Rent Officer which the document contemplates is a fiction and I have considered whether it is for that reason that the brothers are described as &#8220;purported owners&#8221; rather than simply &#8220;owners&#8221;. That does not add up as an explanation. George Green could properly be described as a &#8220;purported tenant&#8221; or &#8220;purported proposed tenant&#8221; but, if F&#8217;s gifts were absolute, M and H would not be </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">purporting</span><span style="color:#000000"> to be owners, they would be the real owners.

The &#8220;transferred&#8221; shares remained in F&#8217;s name and he received the dividends and any capital gains. He decided what shares to sell and whether to take up a rights issue. He did not include the dividends/capital gains on his tax returns. H and M accounted for them to the Inland Revenue but H, who was impecunious, was reimbursed any cost by F. Otherwise F retained all the profits. Except in so far as the taxman was concerned, he therefore remained to all intents and purposes the apparent owner of the shares and it was only relatively recently that any steps were taken to transfer title from him. He also dealt with Sd as if it was his property, keeping the proceeds when it was sold.</span></p>

However, I am entirely satisfied that the tenancy was nothing more than window dressing for the Inland Revenue. That is how F described it in evidence. M, rather more cagily, said it was to create an opportunity for tax saving if the conditional gifts became absolute later on; it would prevent the Inland Revenue arguing that F had continued to derive a benefit from the property by virtue of occupation at anything less than a full rent. H&#8217;s recollection of 1986 is not entirely clear or accurate, in my view, and I do not feel able to place reliance on his evidence about the tenancy. He suggested in oral evidence that the primary reason for it was to make F feel secure but this wish for formal security with regard to 36 BR seemed odd when, on H&#8217;s case, F was prepared to transfer the rest of his assets with only an informal assurance about his sons helping him out if he ran short of money in future. According to his May 2008 statement, H also vaguely recollected that there was a tax purpose to having a tenancy with a commercial rent fixed by the Rent Officer. It seems to me much more likely than not that the tenancy was nothing to do with F&#8217;s insecurity but was part of the inheritance tax saving structure set out in M&#8217;s &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">New scenario</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221; document. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">Creating the tenancy was consistent either with a genuine absolute gift of the property to M and H or with a gift with conditions attached. However, when it came to the rent, the parties continued to behave between themselves as if 36 BR was F&#8217;s, thus lending further support for the conditions for which F and M contend. It will be recalled that the rent under the tenancy was &#163;6,000 per annum. This sum does really seem to have been paid by F. M says it was and this is confirmed by his reference in his annual tax accounting notes to H to the difficulty in getting F to pay it up to date. M&#8217;s evidence, which I accept on this point, was that the rent was paid into the joint building society account in his own and H&#8217;s names and then, when the account was closed, he &#8220;accounted&#8221; to F for it. In relation to M&#8217;s share of the rent at least, the accounting has not involved any actual payment; M views the sum as F&#8217;s and considers that he is holding it on the 1986 conditions. No doubt H&#8217;s share of the accumulated rent has been handled similarly. Certainly H has never  received any rent money. He explains this on the basis that M made it plain from the outset that he could not expect anything because any monies to which he was entitled would be offset against the undoubtedly substantial sums he had received from F by way of financial assistance over the years. In contrast to internal arrangements, vis-&#224;-vis the Inland Revenue the family treated the rent as the income of H and M. It would be included on M&#8217;s annual note to H for H&#8217;s tax return along with the share dividends/capital gains and interest on the joint account and each year, H accounted for the rent and the other monies to the Inland Revenue and F provided him with a cheque to reimburse him for any tax to which it gave rise. In short, therefore, the Inland Revenue were given to understand that the rent (and the interest that accrued on it in the joint account) belonged to F&#8217;s sons (or at least to H) rather than F, but neither M nor H had the use of any of the money. </span></p>

There was also an attempt by a trust deed, also dated 23 April 1995, to create a protective trust in relation to any interest H might have in the property. In his affidavit in the ancillary relief proceedings in March 2007, H says that the &#8220;legal title was transferred to my brother solely as he was living abroad and there seemed some future possible potential advantage from overseas resident ownership&#8221;.

When he drew up his &#8220;Notes for FQ, RQ&#8221; in 1999/2000, he made no mention of the revocation of the gifts and set out the position (for example in relation to CGT on disposal of assets) as if H remained the apparent owner of the property concerned.

M&#8217;s later interpretation of the 11 March 2003 letter was that it was a revocation of the 1986 gift. In a letter to H dated 21 February 2005 he set out his understanding that in the 11 March 2003 letter, &#8220;Father informed you, as he has informed me, resting on the terms of the original gift: (i) the gift to us both of BR is withdrawn&#8230;.&#8221;.  He also passed on to H a message from F that &#8220;should you take any such action of any kind [legal action against M in relation to F&#8217;s affairs], he will reverse the arrangements over BR and withdraw your benefit from the remaining 1986 gifts, which latter action he tells me he has been considering in any event, since he now feels locked in because of the CGT penalties on realisation&#8221;.  None of this sits comfortably with F having already revoked the entirety of the gifts to H in 1996.

As to what rights, if any, they say H and W now have in relation to 36 BR, the pleadings deny that H has any beneficial interest in the property; the focus is upon there being at most some sort of right of occupation. Their case is not entirely consistent, however. The proposed right of occupation varied. On one view, it was a right for the family to occupy the property rent free for as long as they wished. Alternatively, it was a right to occupy the property rent free for as long as they wished provided that F did not decide otherwise. There are also indications that at times the possibility that H might be entitled to some other sort of compensation for the money he invested in 36 BR has presented itself to M and F.</span></p>

Firstly, 36 BR was in a terrible state, as the evidence clearly establishes. F had done his best but he agreed in oral evidence that he had not dusted for 14 years and that a lot of work needed doing on top of the underpinning work which was required. M wrote in his 1999/2000 note that the d&#233;cor had deteriorated sharply since Mabel died and in a letter to F following a visit to Alderney, where he had found F living in squalor, he remarked that it was much worse than 36 BR, conveying that 36 BR itself had been bad. In the pleadings, M admits that the property required a good deal of maintenance work although not that it was barely habitable. There were plainly possessions all over. W described how one room was full of magazines piled up. There were old tyres in the loft. One of the rooms upstairs smelled of dog urine from a dog that was not house trained. There were fleas which bit M and H on one of their visits and had to be removed by the council. The plumbing and wiring were pre-war. The garden was a jungle. </span></p>

Undoubtedly it would have been a thorn in his flesh if he had had to take responsibility for works of any significance on 36 BR, even just the subsidence work, which would have had to be done, as a bare minimum, in preparation for a sale or letting of the property. Such a labour intensive asset in England would have had very little attraction for M and there would obviously have been a great deal to be said for relieving himself of all responsibility for it in return for a parcel of well chosen shares from F&#8217;s estate (which is what he ultimately earmarked for himself instead). </span></p>

It seems he first visited Alderney, with M, in the autumn of 1999 and the evidence suggests he actually went there to live in about June 2000. Geography and the limitations of age would have made it quite impossible for him to be involved in managing repair and/or renovation works at 36 BR from there. However I have absolutely no doubt that he had strong emotional ties to the property which had been his home for nearly 50 years and would have been upset to lose the links with the past if it was sold.</span></p>

Increasingly following F&#8217;s move to Alderney, F and M formed an alliance against H and W. M accepted in evidence in answer to a question from me that in so far as F had any remaining rights in 36 BR, he acted as F&#8217;s agent throughout the transactions of autumn 2000. Subject to the issue over the share swap, with which I deal below, I am satisfied that F also saw it this way. M was clearly fulfilling a dual role, in so far as he had any legal/beneficial interest in the property himself at this point, acting both on his own behalf and on his father&#8217;s.   </span></p>

After she had left, H told F that he might be interested in 36 BR; this is consistent with what F later said to H and W in a letter dated 13 December 2000 in which he says he is glad that they are excited at the prospect of living in 36 BR and says, &#8220;You did hint at the possibility that you might be interested when we were in Richmond&#8230;.&#8221;.

F says that he did not hear anything about H wanting to live in the property until M told him, whilst the underpinning was going on, that H had asked him to ask if he could live there. He did not want that because he would have preferred to sell it but decided that he was being a bit of a dog in the manger so said, via M, that he would permit this on condition that H paid the outgoings and looked after the property. He and H never had a direct discussion on the subject. He would never have agreed to H having 36 BR. He says, in his statement, &#8220;I find the idea nauseating.

She has long straight hair and her trim took 20 minutes or a maximum of 30 minutes at the hairdressers almost next door to the caf&#233;. She recollects what she described as casual talk about concerns F had in relation to what would happen to 36 BR following his decision to move to Alderney, of which she learned for the first time there. It was a bit of a surprise to her that there was a conversation with F about the future of the property because H had led her to believe that it belonged to him and his brother but F was living there, it had originally been his house and he was the oldest person in the family who usually gets respected. She also commented, I thought perceptively, that this was a family house, F had memories of it with his wife and loved it and probably wanted to carry it on for generations. Her perception was that F never wanted to sell it, he wanted it to be there. She told counsel for RQ quite simply that she took from the conversation that the house would be theirs if they did the work. She said, &#8220;I felt comfortable and I trusted and believed in him.&#8221; Otherwise, she said, she would not have moved from her home. </span></p>

Firstly, he thought that W was away for at least two hours having her hair cut. I prefer her evidence that she was only away a short time. Secondly, he said he and H were not sitting at the same table. They talked about insignificant things only. A friend of H&#8217;s was there too. It seemed improbable that that was really what happened, particularly if it had in fact gone on for two hours. I also thought it unlikely that if H had said at the caf&#233; that he may be interested in 36 BR, the topic would have been left at that without further discussion. F had finally decided he was leaving for Alderney and the issue of what was to happen to 36 BR was very much a live one. I would have thought that an expression of interest on H&#8217;s part would therefore have been explored further as, indeed, H and W say it was.</span></p>

If, as H says, at that stage 36 BR was in the sole name of M and belonged beneficially to H and M with no conditions attached, what standing did F have in relation to any proposed changes in ownership? W says in her affidavit of December 2006 that she thought it strange when F said he thought the property would have to be sold unless they became the outright owners of it because her understanding was that H was a part owner but she did not say anything. I see no reason to doubt that she did indeed think H had been given part of the property outright. The picture I have formed of H from all the material in the case is that he would not have wished to convey to her the less palatable and more complex reality with regard to the 1986 transactions. I accept that she may well have thought it was explicable that F should be involved in determining the future of 36 BR because he was originally the owner of the house, he was living there and he was entitled to respect as the father of the family. H was in a different position. In my view, the reason he saw F&#8217;s agreement to the renovation project as so important was because he knew that in reality F was in control of the destiny of 36 BR. Accordingly, that there was this conversation in the caf&#233; with F adds further support to my conclusion that the 1986 gifts were conditional. </span></p>

Given the basis of the 1986 gift and my father&#8217;s clearly stated position, I certainly would not have entered into any document if I had thought it might make it possible for R to convert the property for his own benefit.

As to the sending of the transfer document to F, there seems to be no real debate between the parties that H did not just send F the land transfer but also the covering letter for the Land Registry and a cheque. It is simply incredible that H would do this if he was responding, as F says, to a demand that he return the transfer or be disinherited. That would have been chancing his arm in a very dangerous environment where disinheriting (thinking about it, threatening it and no doubt doing it if necessary) was very much an active pastime. It is much more probable in my view that H sent the documents in the form he did because he continued to believe that the property was to become his and he expected that F would unite the form, letter and cheque with the Land Certificate and send them on to the Registry for the necessary registration. Why F changed his mind at around this time, I do not know, but that is what seems to have happened. By then, however, H and W were well down the road of investment and work on 36 BR.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">I was puzzled at first as to why, if the intention of all parties was that H should become the sole beneficial owner of the property, the legal title was transferred from M&#8217;s sole name to the joint names of H and M, rather than simply into H&#8217;s sole name in October 2001. What in those circumstances would be the point of the device of a transfer into joint names and a deed of gift of M&#8217;s share to H rather than just a straight transfer of the whole legal and beneficial interest to H? Nobody could suggest a completely convincing reason during the hearing. It </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">could</span><span style="color:#000000"> have been part of a plan to ensure that H did not realise any benefit until F agreed/died but it would hardly be a very safe way to do it when taken in conjunction with a deed of gift giving the entire beneficial interest to H. Considering the matter after the hearing, it occurred to me that a more rational explanation may be that, in recognition of his forthcoming expenditure which it was acknowledged was going to be significant, the family did indeed intend H to acquire the whole benefit of the property without conditions but F and M understandably remained anxious, because of his quite recent financial history, that he should not be able to imperil it by borrowing against it. With H and M as joint owners, it would be difficult for H to charge the property without M being involved whereas that safeguard would not be there if H simply owned the legal and beneficial estates. That explanation would fit, for example, with what M said in his February 2007 affidavit (quoted more fully above in paragraph 90) which included that &#8220;R still insisted that such interest would not be capable of conversion in any way without my collaboration&#8221;. I have, however, borne in mind that I was not able to explore this explanation with counsel and that, had I done so, they might have pointed out flaws in it. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The earmarking of the shares may also shed some light on the thinking of the parties. The property before renovation was thought to be worth about &#163;800,000. The earmarked shares were worth approximately &#163;800,000. It seems to me probable that the intention therefore was that each brother would take an equivalent amount from their father&#8217;s estate, one in the form of real property and one of shares. Mr Roberts, called as a witness on behalf of H, went to school with M and H and has consulted both of them over business matters. He gave evidence which I have no reason to doubt that M told him that he had agreed with H to exchange his half interest in 36 BR for certain shares that H would otherwise receive. M said to Mr Roberts that he was happy with the arrangement because he felt that the shares were likely to outperform the housing market. It seems to me that at around the time of the transfer and deed of gift in October 2000, M, at that point with F&#8217;s agreement, albeit that F may later have attempted to withdraw that, entered into a deal whereby, in return for H getting the 36 BR property, he would get shares to a similar value. The shares were not, it seems, to come to M before F died and it might be argued that that suggests that neither was anything to be definite in relation to 36 BR until then but, whilst I bear this in mind amongst all the other factors, I do not think there is anything conclusive to be drawn from it. M&#8217;s position was very different from H&#8217;s in that he was not about to begin spending a considerable amount of money on the shares whereas H </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">was</span><span style="color:#000000"> about to act irreversibly to his detriment in relation to 36 BR. M was also much more secure in his father&#8217;s affections and no doubt trusted that he could rely upon F not to deprive him of his proper inheritance in due course. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The timing of all the October transactions is important. It immediately preceded the first tranche of money becoming available to expend on the property when the further advance was made on C Close and I am quite sure H was intent upon securing his position before he and W began to put time and effort into 36 BR. Would H have thought himself sufficiently protected if the transfer deed and deed of gift were in effect held to F&#8217;s order during his lifetime and depended on M not being obstructive thereafter? H and W were intending to leave a comfortable and adequate home and put all their energy and resources into 36 BR at a time when they were thinking of having a child.  It is argued that by so doing they would relieve themselves of mortgage repayments so that they could manage to live on H&#8217;s meagre income from his practice. Against that, H and W do not accept that they were on their uppers. In any event, had they needed a cash injection, I see no reason to suppose that they could not, as an intermediate step, have sold D House relieving themselves of the mortgage on that and raising some capital. It was suggested that H might have been gambling on F dying very soon, taking a calculated risk that although all that was on offer was occupation for the time being, once F died, the property itself would come to him. Alternatively, it is argued that rent free accommodation in such a good property was worth what H and W invested. Those propositions seem to me decidedly weak. H had already received at least one indication of F&#8217;s ability to withdraw favours at will in the form of his retraction letter in 1996. It would have been extremely risky to sell up and invest in 36 BR in the knowledge that the family could be turned out on a whim by F, or indeed M. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000"> M and F&#8217;s case depends on them establishing that the October 2000 documents do not mean what they say and were subject to some sort of condition, the precise nature of which is not entirely clear except that it meant that H and W were not to be the owners of 36 BR, or not yet. I do not accept that that was so. I have found that the conversation with F in the caf&#233; was as W describes. Thereafter, H drew up documentation that was designed to transfer the whole beneficial interest in the property to him and he and M signed it and agreed compensation for M in the form of the earmarked shares, M at that point having F&#8217;s consent, even though F may well have purported to withdraw it later. H and W took steps which would have been incredibly unwise if they were based only on the gamble that F would die soon and they would inherit or that he would permit them to live in the property as long as they wanted or, as F suggested in oral evidence, that they would be able to obtain the property illicitly by taking an action such as this through the courts. They behaved as if they were the owners of the property, investing all their money in it and considerable effort, supervising the insurance works and ultimately making it their home. As F says in his statement, he signed a mandate to allow the insurers to pay the contractor direct subject to the insurers </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">and H</span><span style="color:#000000"> being satisfied with the work and &#8220;R simply took over. He treated the house, its contents and the insurance negotiations as if he owned everything and did not refer a single matter to me or consult with me.&#8221;  I find that H and W did all of this in reliance on the agreement that the property would be H&#8217;s. I do not accept that they were only promised some term of occupation of it. Furthermore, in my view, the evidence establishes that H drew up the transfer and the deed of gift in 2000 in order to put the agreement about the house into effect and thereafter he (joined by W) attempted to get M and F to fulfil their side of the bargain, in F&#8217;s case by forwarding the transfer to the Land Registry and, in M&#8217;s case, by returning the deed of gift to H. F and M had by then changed their minds.</span></p>

The holding of the conversation confirms that a climate of anxiety had developed in the house over ownership, as the June 2001 telephone/fax exchange evidences in documentary form. I accept that H had also acted on the basis that they had been assured the house would become theirs and was trying to sort the situation out and secure their position but he was not succeeding.

That was then approved by M who, by virtue of entering into discussions with H which culminated in the documentation of October 2000, perpetuated F&#8217;s promise on F&#8217;s behalf and added his own promise to the same effect. I do not accept that there were any conditions attached to these assurances that H or H and W would acquire the house by doing the work, whether by virtue of the conditions being carried forward from the 1986 transactions or by conditions being spelled out afresh in 2000. In 2000, the parties were embarking upon a venture which was wholly different in character from the arrangements they made 1986. The 1986 deal involved H and M neither in expenditure nor in rearrangement of their lives. As the parties intended it to operate, it was a deal which would merely alter the outward appearance of ownership and make very little difference to anyone&#8217;s day to day life. In contrast, as they all understood, the 2000 deal would involve H and W in making wholesale changes in their living arrangements and expending a considerable amount of money &#8211; the whole of their capital &#8211; on 36 BR. Nobody gave evidence that the 1986 conditions were explicitly reimposed. There was absolutely no reason why, had they been intended to apply, they could not have been articulated. Indeed, there was no reason why the documentation drawn up to give effect to the arrangement could not have shown them on its face. By 2000, the attempt to deceive the taxman was no more than limping along, if it had survived at all given that F had purported to revoke the gifts once already, in 1996, (although M did not seem to be aware of this). Nobody gave evidence that suggested that the appearance vis-&#224;-vis the taxman was of the slightest interest by 2000. Furthermore, in my judgment, conditions of the 1986 type could not be implied when they would have been so prejudicial to the interests of H and W that they could not have been expected to enter into the agreement at all on those terms. </span></p>

The sale of D House followed in December 2000. Considerable effort was put into matters to do with the property, including a great deal of supervision of works and (particularly it would seem by W, despite her pregnancy during much of 2001) actual labour. The thrust of the evidence was that F, who had agreed to the arrangements in 2000, changed his mind in 2001. When he wrote his letter of March 2001 to the Land Registry for F to send on with the transfer document, cheque and land certificate, H was still under the impression that the property was to become his. By then, he and W had already acted very considerably to their detriment in reliance on the arrangement of 2000. It is not clear at precisely what point he and W would have become aware that F and M were no longer honouring the deal but it is not surprising that he continued to try to secure his position in accordance with it during 2001, as we see from the exchange involving the conversation with M in the car and M&#8217;s fax in June 2001, and that meanwhile works continued on the property, culminating in the sale of C Close and H and W moving into 36 BR at the beginning of August 2001. Given that H and W had acted to their detriment in reliance on the 2000 agreement, the assurance had become irrevocable well before they could have had any inkling that M and/or F were no longer content with the arrangement.</span></p>

Proprietary estoppel typically consists of asserting an equitable claim against the conscience of the "true" owner. The claim is a "mere equity". It is to be satisfied by the minimum award necessary to do justice (</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Crabb v Arun District Council</span><span style="color:#000000"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1976] Ch 179" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1976">[1976] Ch 179</ref> , 198), which may sometimes lead to no more than a monetary award. A "common intention" constructive trust, by contrast, is identifying the true beneficial owner or owners, and the size of their beneficial interests.&#8221;</span></p>

The claimant who establishes a proprietary estoppel may do less well than the claimant who establishes a constructive trust. In this case, however, I have reached the conclusion, for the reasons I set out below, that the minimum award necessary to do justice in the light of the proprietary estoppel established by H and W is for 36 BR to belong to H (or H and W). I can see no point, in the circumstances, in going in depth into the issue of whether the facts I have found also establish a constructive trust but I will set out my conclusions fairly briefly.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">In the present case, the parties&#8217; shared intentions are, in my judgment, clear from the agreement that was reached in 2000, culminating in the documentation that came into existence in October 2000. They all intended at that stage that the entire beneficial interest in the property should belong to H. In relation to proprietary estoppel, I have been content to say quite loosely that the estoppel operated in favour of H or H and W because I understand that there is no dispute between them as to how the benefit of the property will be shared between them in the ancillary relief context so there is no need for me to differentiate between them in these proceedings. However, in relation to the issue of a constructive trust, which issue is peculiarly dependant on what the shared intentions of the parties were, I can and probably should be rather more meticulous in setting out my conclusions. It seems to me that the contemporaneous documentation (whatever its precise legal effect) is drafted in such a way as to establish clearly that the common intention was that the beneficial interest in the property was to become H&#8217;s alone. I base this upon the deed of gift which was designed to transfer M&#8217;s interest not to H and W but to H. It is quite sufficient, in my view, to give rise to a constructive trust in relation to 36 BR in H&#8217;s favour.</span></p>

Accordingly, on the face of it, M and H became the owners of 36 BR as tenants in common in equal shares. F argues that this does not represent the true position and that the property was held on trust for him. There seem to be at least two alternative formulations of this argument put forward by F and M. Firstly, a constructive trust is said to arise by virtue of the conditions imposed on the gift and secondly, the property is said to be held on trust for F by virtue of him having revoked the gift in 1996. In my judgment, neither of these arguments can be pursued by F and M. However they formulate their claim to the property, they have to rely on the conditions agreed as part of the 1986 transaction, whether per se or as the reason why F had power to revoke the gift. The 1986 agreement had an illegal purpose, namely to cheat the Inland Revenue of inheritance tax on F&#8217;s death. Reliance upon the conditions is reliance upon the illegal purpose and is not permissible. In contrast, H need only point to the existence of the transfer of 36 BR into the joint names of himself and M and need not refer to the illegal purpose, indeed he denied its existence. In these circumstances, he can establish title and it matters not that it was acquired in the course of carrying through an illegal transaction. </span></p>

There, two women used funds generated by a joint business venture to buy a house in which they lived together. It was vested in the sole name of the plaintiff but on the understanding that they were joint beneficial owners. The purpose of the arrangement was so that false benefit claims could be made to the Department of Social Security which was duly done. The money obtained helped the parties in a small way with their bills. Subsequently, the defendant repented of the frauds and told the DSS. The parties quarrelled and the plaintiff moved out. The plaintiff claimed possession and asserted that she was the sole owner of the property. The defendant counterclaimed for an order for sale and a declaration that the plaintiff owned the property on trust for the pair of them in equal shares. Ultimately the defendant succeeded, having established a resulting trust by virtue of her contribution to the purchase price of the property and the common understanding of the parties that they owned the property equally.

In particular it is now clearly established that at law (as opposed to in equity), property in goods or land can pass under, or pursuant to, such a contract. If so, the rights of the owner of the legal title thereby acquired will be enforced, provided that the plaintiff can establish such title without pleading or leading evidence of the illegality.

The schedules of dilapidations were in the event never pursued. The father never showed the share transfer to the landlords or to any other creditor although it had been stamped. The negotiations with the landlords for release from the liability for dilapidations were carried out by the son alone and there was no need for recourse to deception.

The primary rule which precludes the court from lending its assistance to a man who founds his cause of action on an illegal or immoral act often leads to a denial of justice. The justification for this is that the rule is not a principle of justice but a principle of policy: see the much quoted statement of Lord Mansfield C.J. in</span><span class="Emphasis" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><a class="Hyperlink" href="javascript:;" style="color:#000000">Holman v.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="color:#000000">Seen in this light the doctrine of the locus poenitentiae, although an exception to the primary rule, is not inconsistent with the policy which underlies it. It is, of course, artificial to think that anyone would be dissuaded by the primary rule from entering into a proposed fraud, if only because such a person would be unlikely to be a studious reader of the law reports or to seek advice from a lawyer whom he has taken fully into his confidence. But, if the policy which underlies the primary rule is to discourage fraud, the policy which underlies the exception must be taken to be to encourage withdrawal from a proposed fraud before it is implemented, an end which is no less desirable. And, if the former objective is of such overriding importance that the primary rule must be given effect even where it leads to a denial of justice, then in my opinion the latter objective justifies the adoption of the exception where this enables justice to be done.</span></p>

One might hesitate before allowing a novel exception to a rule of legal policy, particularly a rule based on moral principles. But the primary rule, as it has emerged from that decision, does not conform to any discernible moral principle. It is procedural in nature and depends on the adventitious location of the burden of proof in any given case. Had the plaintiff transferred the shares to a stranger or distant relative whom he trusted, albeit for the same dishonest purpose, it cannot be doubted that he would have succeeded in his claim. He would also have succeeded if he had given them to the defendant and procured him to sign a declaration of trust in his favour. But he chose to transfer them to a son whom he trusted to the extent of dispensing with the precaution of obtaining a declaration of trust. If that is fatal to his claim, then the greater the betrayal, the less the power of equity to give a remedy.</span></p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="color:#000000">In my opinion the following propositions represent the present state of the law. (1) Title to property passes both at law and in equity even if the transfer is made for an illegal purpose. The fact that title has passed to the transferee does not preclude the transferor from bringing an action for restitution. (2) The transferor's action will fail if it would be illegal for him to retain any interest in the property. (3) Subject to (2) the transferor can recover the property if he can do so without relying on the illegal purpose. This will normally be the case where the property was transferred without consideration in circumstances where the transferor can rely on an express declaration of trust or a resulting trust in his favour. (4) </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">It will almost invariably be so where the illegal purpose has not been carried out. It may be otherwise where the illegal purpose has been carried out and the transferee can rely on the transferor's conduct as inconsistent with his retention of a beneficial interest.</span><span style="color:#000000"> (5) </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">The transferor can lead evidence of the illegal purpose whenever it is necessary for him to do so provided that he has withdrawn from the transaction before the illegal purpose has been wholly or partly carried into effect. </span><span style="color:#000000">It will be necessary for him to do so (i) if he brings an action at law or (ii) if he brings proceedings in equity and needs to rebut the presumption of advancement. (6) The only way in which a man can protect his property from his creditors is by divesting himself of all beneficial interest in it. Evidence that he transferred the property in order to protect it from his creditors, therefore, does nothing by itself to rebut the presumption of advancement; it reinforces it. To rebut the presumption it is necessary to show that he intended to retain a beneficial interest and conceal it from his creditors. (7) The court should not conclude that this was his intention without compelling circumstantial evidence to this effect. The identity of the transferee and the circumstances in which the transfer was made would be highly relevant. It is unlikely that the court would reach such a conclusion where the transfer was made in the absence of an imminent and perceived threat from known creditors.</span></p>

At that point, it would be F&#8217;s executors who would decide whether or not to include 36 BR as part of F&#8217;s estate for tax purposes.

This is not an easy task as the boundaries of the exception are not clear, as Millett LJ acknowledged in the passage I have quoted and as subsequent cases have demonstrated. Nourse LJ makes it clear that one must not confuse the transaction itself with the purpose. It is the purpose which has to have been carried into effect or partially carried into effect. The transaction itself may be and often is entirely unexceptional, as it is here, and in those circumstances it is irrelevant to this issue. It can be relied on by a participant in the illegal compact as the basis for his claim to an interest in the property and, similarly, its existence will not prevent there being a locus poenitentiae for a participant who wishes to withdraw from the illegal purpose and advance his claim to the property in reliance on the terms of the purpose. </span></p>

The earliest at which he might have withdrawn is in 1996 when he purported to revoke the gift, at least in relation to H; it may well be that that revocation, which was not conveyed to M and was in terms directed at H, was ineffective in relation to the gift to M and that that gift was not revoked until M learned of it, which appears to have been sometime in 2003. Giving F the benefit of the doubt however, and assuming that the revocation was fully operative at the earlier date, I ask myself whether any of F&#8217;s conduct up to that point was inconsistent with his retention of a beneficial interest. Although I would reach the same result even if I were to look at 36 BR alone, it seems to me that for this purpose, I can look at the 1986 transactions as a whole. M and F submitted otherwise. They pointed to the fact that the various assets were the subject of separate deeds although it was conceded in argument by Miss Harrison for M that that may simply have been because not all the deeds were available on the same day and I do not consider that the existence of separate deeds was in any way conclusive. The evidence of F and M was that H and M solemnly swore that they would respect F&#8217;s conditions. This was one umbrella promise, intended to overshadow all the 1986 transactions &#8211; the shares, Sd and 36 BR. What happened in summer 1986 was a package designed to put a major part of F&#8217;s estate beyond the reach of the Revenue. In many ways, F behaved thereafter as if he still did retain a beneficial interest in each of these items, threatening to take them back and purporting to revoke the gifts. There were other ways, however, in which he behaved inconsistently with the retention of a beneficial interest. He should have declared the dividends and capital gains in relation to the shares to the Revenue for taxation. He and his sons treated the money as theirs. They (or at least H, because M was living abroad and may not have been accounting to the Revenue here) included it in their tax returns and he omitted it from his. He signed a tenancy and apparently paid rent for 36 BR which, again, was treated as his sons&#8217; income and not his. It sat in a joint account in his sons&#8217; names, making interest which they (or at least H) included in their tax returns to the Revenue and F did not. Given that M&#8217;s case is that he holds that rent money on trust for F, F should have accounted for the interest himself. As a result of these accounting practices, the tax paid to the Revenue in relation to the shares and the interest was not paid at the higher rate as it would have been had it been declared as F&#8217;s income but either at the lower rate (which was all that H had to pay) or not at all (because M was non-resident). It is right to say that the Revenue had the unlooked for benefit of basic rate tax on the &#163;3,000 per annum of spurious rent that the family attributed to H but that, in my view, is nothing to the point. Firstly, I think it unlikely that the question of the availability of the locus poenitentiae turns on whether anyone has yet suffered financial loss as a result of the actions of the transferor. Secondly, I cannot accept that it is open to the transferor to argue that he has done an account and (if it be the case) that, taken in the round, the tax of which he has deprived the Revenue is equalled or surpassed by the extra tax that the family had to pay to cement their deception.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The 1986 transactions and the actions associated with them were put into effect to lay the ground for inheritance tax evasion. In my view, the &#8220;illegal purpose&#8221; to which F, M and H were parties should not be too narrowly defined. F and M would no doubt define it as &#8220;to save inheritance tax&#8221;, hence their argument that nothing relevant would happen until a false declaration was made after F&#8217;s death. If the definition is cast more widely as &#8220;to deceive the Revenue&#8221;, it can be seen that considerable steps have been taken towards this which have gone beyond the mere creation of authentic looking documents which have been kept within the family and moved into the realms of actually presenting a false picture to the taxman. By falsely representing to the Revenue (by false omissions from his own tax return and/or false inclusions on those of H and possibly, depending on what returns he made as a non-resident, M) that he was no longer the owner of the transferred assets, F has, in my judgment, partly carried the illegal purpose into effect and deprived himself of the chance of withdrawing from it and relying on it to establish either that he retains any share in the assets concerned on trust principles or that he was entitled to revoke the gifts. </span></p>

I accept that their caution about this is well placed. The other members of the court appear to have treated the intention (possibly) to defraud the Inland Revenue of inheritance tax as a very minor part of the transaction. The real purpose, still illegal, was to defeat the claims of the father&#8217;s creditors.

I have also taken into account the curious paradox that in this case, the consequence of H&#8217;s defence of illegality succeeding would be that 36 BR would cease to be part of F&#8217;s estate and the Revenue would not receive inheritance tax on it. I have not ignored the interest of the Revenue (as I hope can be seen from my analysis of the issue of the locus poenitentiae) but this particular quirk should not, in my judgment, deflect me from a straightforward application of the principles.  </span></p>

Neither can the 1986 conditions be carried forward to affect any future dealings with the property, tainted as they are by the illegal purpose, so what happened to the property after 1986 had nothing further to do with F. In 1995,  H transferred his share of the property to M and M declared that he held H&#8217;s half share on a protective trust. I do not propose to go into the arguments as to the effect of that because the new deeds in 2000 override it. </span></p>

I have found that F gave his consent to the arrangement whereby the house was swapped for the shares although on what basis he would in fact have had any entitlement to impose any terms on that, given my findings about the impact of illegality, I am not sure. M suggests that he only signed the transfer on being assured by H that, putting it broadly, it could not be turned to his advantage. For the reasons I set out earlier, I cannot accept that when M executed the transfer he intended it to be anything other than what it appeared on the face of it i.e. a transfer which would be registered at the Land Registry in the ordinary way. I do not think he would have relied on assurances about the law from a brother whose legal skills he considered a joke and with whom he had a troubled relationship, where the transfer had a real potential significantly to affect his own financial interests. I suspect that he had to advance the argument that he was misled by H about the transfer because his approach to that transaction would otherwise undermine the credibility of his argument that the deed of gift which went with it, only a week later, was to be held in escrow. Why, it would obviously be asked, was the transfer not held in escrow too? M&#8217;s answer would be that he did not think it needed to be because of what H had told him about its effect. </span></p>

The suggested escrow conditions are difficult to understand. As pleaded in M&#8217;s points of defence they are &#8220;(1) that the deed of gift was only to be produced in the event that M predeceased H or, subject to the agreement of F, on F&#8217;s death; and (2) that, subject to the agreement of F, shares which H expected to receive on F&#8217;s death would be earmarked for M instead&#8221;. What M wrote in his fax of 6 June 2001 was rather different: &#8220;I retain the deed and have left instructions that if I should predecease FQ, he is to be consulted to ascertain whether he is willing for the remaining legal interest to be assigned to you by way of the deed.&#8221; I do not accept that there were any such conditions or that the deed was to be held in escrow at all.

In a case of that sort both the claimant&#8217;s expectations and the element of detriment to the claimant will have been defined with reasonable clarity. A typical case would be an elderly benefactor who reaches a clear understanding with the claimant (who may be a relative, a friend, or a remunerated companion or carer) that if the claimant resides with and cares for the benefactor, the claimant will inherit the benefactor&#8217;s house (or will have a home for life). In a case like that the consensual element of what has happened suggests that the claimant and the benefactor probably regarded the expected benefit and the accepted detriment as being (in a general, imprecise way) equivalent, or at any rate not obviously disproportionate&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

A similar problem arises if the court, although satisfied that the claimant has a genuine claim, is not satisfied that the high level of the claimant&#8217;s expectations is fairly derived from his deceased patron&#8217;s assurances, which may have justified only a lower level of expectation. In such cases the court may still take the claimant&#8217;s expectations (or the upper end of any range of expectations) as a starting point, but unless constrained by authority I would regard that as no more than a starting point.</span></p>

I have already referred to the typical case of a carer who has the expectation of coming into the benefactor&#8217;s house, either outright or for life. In such a case the court&#8217;s natural response is to fulfil the claimant&#8217;s expectations. But if the claimant&#8217;s expectations are uncertain, or extravagant, or out of all proportion to the detriment which the claimant has suffered, the court can and should recognise that the claimant&#8217;s equity should be satisfied in another (and generally more limited) way.</span></p>

Indeed in many cases the detriment may be even more difficult to quantify, in financial terms, than the claimant&#8217;s expectations. Detriment can be quantified with reasonable precision if it consists solely of expenditure on improvements to another person&#8217;s house, and in some cases of that sort an equitable charge for the expenditure may be sufficient to satisfy the equity &#8230;.But the detriment of an ever-increasing burden of care for an elderly person, and of having to be subservient to his or her moods and wishes, is very difficult to quantify in money terms. Moreover the claimant may not be motivated solely by reliance on the benefactor&#8217;s assurances, and may receive some countervailing benefits (such as free bed and board). In such circumstances the court has to exercise wide judgmental discretion.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">When the appropriate remedy is being formulated, every case depends upon its own facts. I have had regard to all the circumstances. Amongst them, I must take into account what the parties originally intended, culminating in the documentation of October 2000. This was plainly that if H and W looked after the renovation of 36 BR, financially and by supervising and putting in their own labour, the house would be theirs. I have rejected the notion that this would be merely on the basis of an entitlement to occupy rent free, whether at will or for life. The deal involved the capital value of the property as well. This can be seen, in my judgment, from the share swap arrangement that M and H arrived at. H would have the house, then thought to be worth approximately &#163;800,000 unimproved, and M would have shares worth approximately &#163;800,000. I take into account that the intention seems to have been that M would only take the shares after F&#8217;s death but given his relationship with F, he would, justifiably, have been confident that he would, in due course, receive them. H was about to alter his position totally in reliance on the assurances he had been given and it was understandable that he would need to secure the benefit of what was to be his asset, 36 BR, sooner. He and W were giving up their established and comfortable home (and the opportunity to benefit from the undoubted rise in the value of that property and D House over the forthcoming years), putting in a very great deal of time and effort, spending money and relieving F and M of the burden of 36 BR. True, they were able to occupy it without rent or mortgage instalments to pay and the evidence of Ms Long shows that this was a significant benefit, although they did, of course, have responsibility for the normal outgoings and maintenance. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">It is submitted on behalf of F and M that H and W only expended a modest amount on repairs. H sets out in his statement of 6 May 2008 a long list of works which he says were done, together with costings. He says, and his evidence in cross examination underlined this, that he does not have invoices for all the works as much of the work was done by casual labour paid in cash, documents have been lost, and W and he did a great deal of work themselves which they have tried to cost out. The figures are questioned on behalf of F and M and it is argued that they are too high for a number of reasons including that a significant amount of work was in fact funded by the insurance claim in relation to the subsistence repairs, that figures for expenditure are overstated, and that the sum for labour of &#163;50,000 is a convenient rounding up figure rather than a proper reflection of what labour they put in. It seemed to me that H could have done rather more to establish the figures as appropriate, not least by producing bank statements to show cash withdrawals, for instance, because on occasions large sums of cash were necessary to pay workmen. I did not conclude, however, that the failure to produce documentation of this and other kinds to substantiate the expenditure claimed suggested that the claim was false. It seemed to me more likely that it was a further example of H&#8217;s disorganisation and inertia. There are a number of reasons why expenditure of around &#163;200,000 seems not at all unlikely. There was clearly a lot of work to do in addition to the subsidence works. It is known that this was about the sort of figure raised against C Close and then from the sale of that and D House. It is also noteworthy that there seemed to be a view at the time of discussions during 2000 that the work would be likely to cost about &#163;200,000 and there is evidence to suggest that M himself may have floated that sort of figure. If the documentation setting out the details of the insurance claim and precisely how it was calculated is in the bundle, I was not taken to it because the issue of the figures for renovation was not dealt with in that sort of detail, although I did have my attention drawn to some of the (relatively limited) collection of invoices and other documentation that H had. Ultimately, although it was submitted that one or two items on H&#8217;s schedule duplicate insurance works, there really was very little of which that could be said. I considered the argument, explored in cross examination and set out in Miss Harrison&#8217;s final submissions for M, that H and W would have had to rely on their capital for living expenses because H earned little and W nothing. However, W&#8217;s evidence, which I accept, was that they did not have those sort of financial difficulties at that time. Ultimately, I was prepared to accept, on the balance of probability, that, although (given the lack of records) the apparent precision of the claim for &#163;203,350 is probably not to be relied upon, somewhere in the region of &#163;200,000 </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">was</span><span style="color:#000000"> spent by H and W on 36 BR from their own resources. That expenditure has to be seen against the value of the property, then worth about &#163;800,000, but it can hardly be described as &#8220;modest&#8221; even in that context. It was all H and W had and not an insignificant sum by any means. In any event, expenditure is only one of the relevant features. </span></p>
