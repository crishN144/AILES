He is a farm manager, running two farms approximately five hours drive apart in regional South West Australia.  He has two adult children from a previous marriage.

She also has an operational role for same international event in England which she has been able to conduct in the main (apart from an extended period in which the event falls) remotely.  She has also worked on the family farms.  Before moving to Australia she had a range of jobs in England; when she first moved to Australia she was a dancer in a Gentlemen's club.</p>

After a brief separation in 2015, they became engaged in 2016 and were married in Australia in 2017. A was born in October 2018; R was born in November 2021.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the mother&#8217;s case that the relationship has been characterised by controlling and coercive behaviour by the father towards her; she has deposed at length in her statement to examples of his anger, intimidation towards her, and his physical and emotional abuse of her going back to the very early stages of their relationship (long before they were married).  She has described his sexual abuse of her.  She has described abuse of others too, including his employees.  She has described the impact on this alleged abuse upon her.  She also describes the father&#8217;s own struggles with his mental health. The father denies the alleged abuse, and expresses himself to be distressed that the mother should invent such a false narrative; he accepts that latterly he suffered &#8216;situational depression&#8217; which he associated with the deterioration of the parents&#8217; relationship.  The mother and father have attended couples&#8217; counselling on occasions in the past to assist their relationship, albeit, as it turns out, unsuccessfully.</p>

Following this event, she received weekly counselling.  She did not tell the father about this event or the counselling.   The hospital record for her attendance reveals that the mother was not complaining then about domestic abuse, and she had no concerns for her or the children&#8217;s safety. </p>

It is the father&#8217;s case that the parents had agreed that the mother&#8217;s trip in 2023 would exceptionally be extended, as this would be the last year in which she could come to England to attend the event in person, given A's upcoming commitment to day-school in Australia from early-2024.   In early June 2023, the father travelled to England to join the family, and to take up his work at the event.  At the end of July 2023, after the event, the father returned to Australia to continue managing the farm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is apparent from the contemporaneous e-mail exchanges which have been filed by the parties that the parents discussed various dates for the return of the children during the period August to November 2023.  The mother acknowledges in one message that she was due back for work in Australia in September; it is evident from the mother&#8217;s recent interview with Dr McClintock that &#8220;she was not planning to remain here&#8221;.   During August, the parents discussed by e-mail specific alternative homes for the mother to rent in Australia and schools for the children (immediately for A) on her return.  Good-natured e-mails passed between the parents during September about the arrangements for the mother and children on their return to Australia.  </p>

It is necessary to assess the degree of integration of the child into a social and family environment in the country in question. The social and family environment of an infant or young child is shared with those (whether parents or others) on whom she is dependent. Hence it is necessary, in such a case, to assess the integration of that person or persons in the social and family environment of the country concerned.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father emphatically denies the abuse; Ms Roberts asks me to look with care at the evidence advanced by the mother and to note the areas in which she has been obviously unreliable. The father has (reluctantly he asserts) exhibited WhatsApp and other messages from the mother to him which I accept give a quite different perspective on her assertions of sexual abuse and control than she has sought to paint, and shows her a willing participant in a range of sexually explicit activities involving third parties.  In support of her own allegations the mother maintains that the father has been issued with an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) for abusive behaviour towards a female former employee; this is not borne out by the evidence before me.  Indeed, the father categorically denies that he has been issued with any form of conviction or AVO, and his police and employment records are shown (as exhibits) to be clean.  If the mother has fabricated this allegation relating to the AVO, it is a serious matter.  The father has exhibited a number of statements and references from friends, employers and others who describe him in very different terms from the mother. While domestic abuse often occurs behind closed doors, without independent corroboration, I have been asked to note that there is no contemporaneous evidence of domestic abuse in the instant case; there are no police call-outs, no social services or mental health records to confirm the mother&#8217;s account.    The affectionate terms of the mother&#8217;s correspondence with the father in 2023 does not entirely square with the picture she paints of their relationship in her later-prepared witness statement within this application.</p>

Dr McClintock was clear that the mother was not suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, and in this regard it was a matter of concern to me that the mother&#8217;s therapist appeared to believe that she was and was apparently treating her for this condition.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties agree that the relevant date of the retention of the children in England was 19 November 2023.  By that time, the children had been in this country for seven months.  For children of this age, this represented a significant proportion of their lives &#8211; this is particularly so in the case of R.   In that period, plainly the children had developed routines and a way of life which accommodated both of their parents&#8217; working commitments at the international event in England and otherwise. They plainly benefited from, and enjoyed, living with their maternal grandmother, while also having considerable contact with members of the maternal family and friends of the mother&#8217;s.  Their lives were evidently enriched with a range of pursuits which reflected their various needs (given their ages) for physical activity and stimulation (including swimming and the playgroup).  The arrangements during this extended summer visit to England in 2023 was in many ways a reprise for the children of their extended visits in earlier years. In 2022, they were here for four months before returning home to Australia.  In A&#8217;s case, the 2023 and 2022 visits repeated earlier extended visits too.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was during this period that the relationship of the parents finally came to an end, after what they both accept to have been a difficult period in Australia.  It is striking that until 18 November, the mother&#8217;s explicit plan was to return to Australia with the children; the parents were focusing on the timing of when this would happen, and the precise arrangements for the &#8216;new normal&#8217; for when the children and mother returned: where would the mother live? when would A start school? and where? how the mother/children&#8217;s accommodation was to be funded? what should happen to the farm where the father worked and the family had lived? where would the mother work? how were the new arrangements to be financed?  These were all questions which the parents were constructively discussing during the summer months and into the autumn of 2023.  It was the search for answers to some or all of these questions which took them into formal mediation.  What is apparent, from the contemporaneously generated evidence, is that until the 18 November the mother had not signalled to the father that she was intending to make England her permanent home.  Her intention was, as I say, to return.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The medical records of early September shine a small light on the mother&#8217;s quiet hope of remaining for the long-term in the UK.  While I have no doubt that the children benefited from time with the maternal family, the evidence does not support the conclusion that in this phase of their lives prior to mid-November their lives had acquired such a degree of stability, or they had became so integrated into English life, as to change their habitual residence. They were Australian children, on an extended holiday in England staying with their maternal family, the second such extended visit in as many years, who would at the end of the holiday be returning to their home country.  While of course they were supported by their mother in benefitting from health, educational (pre-school) and recreational (swimming) facilities while they were staying here, this did not represent integration into English life to a degree which enables me to conclude that they had become habitually resident here.  Insofar as the mother&#8217;s intentions are relevant to this evaluation, my finding is that for the whole of the period under review she was planning (with doubts and anxieties for sure) to return to Australia.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On this basis, the father has made out his case under Article 3 of the 1980 Hague Convention, and I would be obliged to return A and R to Australia unless the mother can demonstrate that one of the exceptions under Article 13(b) is made out.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus, I turn to the mother&#8217;s secondary case, which is indeed based on Article 13(b).  As I have described above, she asserts that the relationship with the father has been abusive in multiple ways, and that this has directly impacted on her and directly or indirectly on the children.  The parental relationship is such, she asserts, that if the children are returned to Australia there is a grave risk that they would be exposed to physical or psychological harm, or be otherwise placed in an intolerable situation.   The mother further argues that were she to return with the children, she would suffer such a serious downturn in her mental health, that this would have serious adverse consequences for the children and place them &#8216;in an intolerable situation&#8217;.  She relies on the evidence of Dr McClintock in this regard, but in fact his report does not support this conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence of domestic abuse is largely founded on assertion by the mother.  There is little if any independent verification for the mother&#8217;s case; it is indeed limited to an extract from the confidential medical records of the mother for September 2023 which reveal her disclosing that the father &#8220;could be demanding&#8221; with &#8220;elements of emotional and controlling behaviour&#8221;, &#8220;manipulative and controlling&#8221;. The report from the psychotherapist is not of any corroborative assistance; therapy was only commenced in November 2023 (coincident with the time of the wrongful retention, and with litigation in prospect) and is predicated solely on the mother&#8217;s own statements; the diagnosis of PTS made by the therapist is, as I have said, challenged by Dr McClintock.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s statements about the father&#8217;s abuse of her are not entirely consistent with the tone and content of the e-mail exchanges which passed between the parties in the summer of 2023, which I have had the chance to consider; nor is her case entirely borne out by the way in which she explicitly sought to involve the father more fully in the children&#8217;s lives (as per her communications) over the second half of 2023.  The mother&#8217;s statements have been shown to be at least questionable.  That all said, for present purposes I proceed on the basis that <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">if they are true</span><span style="color:#000000">, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. I then ask myself how could these children be protected against the risk </span>(per <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span> at [36])?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I mentioned above, during a number of short adjournments in the hearing over the last day, the parties agreed what could represent &#8216;protective measures&#8217;, should they be relevant.  The mother is satisfied that in the event of a return, these would indeed mitigate in material ways the harm she fears; she says in terms in her witness statement that &#8220;the Australian authorities would be in a position to put in place protective measures in relation to [the father&#8217;s] behaviour&#8221;.  I am satisfied that the undertakings offered by the father will be capable of ready enforcement in Australia, and will offer immediate protection for the mother from the father&#8217;s alleged conduct.  Although the mother fears a deterioration in her mental health in the event of a return, I am satisfied &#8211; having regard to the opinion of Dr. McClintock &#8211; that her mental well-being can be managed sufficiently through access to medical and therapeutic services in Australia.   This is not a case (such as that contemplated by Lord Wilson in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> see above) where the evidence points to the mother <span style="color:#000000">suffering such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the children.  </span>Although the mother has been prescribed medication, Prozac, in this country, she has in fact been &#8220;non-compliant&#8221; with that medication (i.e., has rarely taken it, so she told Dr. McClintock); it is nonetheless readily available in Australia should it be required.   Moreover, the father has indicated that he will pay an enhanced premium on the family&#8217;s private health cover to include provision for counselling and other psychological support for the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The provision of a sizeable lump sum (AUS$31,200) for the mother will furnish her with the financial wherewithal to enable her to rehabilitate back to life in Australia independently of the father, in suitable rented accommodation with the children in a location of her choosing (which is likely to be some 2-3 hours drive from the father); within this lump sum fund, provision has been made for her to be able to continue with her therapy, and to acquire the lease on a car to ensure her independence. The father has helpfully exhibited the protective measures fact-sheet (referenced in the <span style="font-style:italic">Re T </span>judgment) which can be referenced by the parties and their Australian lawyers, to assist them in ensuring that the offers made here are enforceable there.  As may be necessary and/or appropriate, the Australian International Social Service may be in a position to offer valuable support for this mother on her return to Australia; the mother should take note of <a href="https://www.iss.org.au/our-services/1980-hague-convention-support-service" class="Hyperlink">1980 Hague Convention Support Service (iss.org.au)</a>.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall I have concluded that a return of the children would not create <span style="color:#212121;background-color:#FFFFFF">a grave risk to them of exposure to physical or psychological harm; I do not find that a return would otherwise place them in an intolerable situation.  The mother&#8217;s case in this regard has been more than adequately addressed and answered by the father in the ways I have set out above.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is extremely regrettable that this application was so delayed in the administrative phase in passing between central authorities between December 2023 and July 2024; the upside is that the children and the mother have benefitted from greater time spent with the extended maternal family and the mother&#8217;s friends here in England.  The downside is that it has prolonged for many unnecessary and uncertain months the almost inevitable decision-making on whether the children are to be returned to Australia.  The parties have been in limbo for too long; this decision should have been made much closer in time to the point at which discussions between the parties about their futures, and the formal process of mediation, had failed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having regard to the matters placed before me, as I have outlined them above, I am driven to accede to the father&#8217;s application for the return of these children to Australia and that is the order which I make.  I shall require the father to make arrangements for the provision of the lump sum to the mother to put her in a position to plan for her return, and I hope that the parties can agree a suitable timeframe within which the return can be effected.    I envisage that the flights will be booked to ensure that they are on Australian soil within approximately one month.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both parties contemplate that they will engage in Family Court process once the children and mother are back in Australia; they need to bring their marriage formally to an end, they need to resolve the financial issues between them; they both seek welfare orders in respect of children.  It seems highly likely that the mother will apply for formal permission to relocate permanently to this country with the children.  In the e-mails which I have seen, the father at one time appeared to acknowledge this (see &#167;15 above), and &#8211; perhaps significantly &#8211; appears also to contemplate relocating himself &#8220;after two years&#8221;; he is, after all, familiar with the life in England, having worked here for four to six weeks every year for the last couple of decades.  </p>
