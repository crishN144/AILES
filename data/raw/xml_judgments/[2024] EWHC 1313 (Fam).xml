	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In this judgment I have deliberately used random initials to describe individuals and places rather than real names.  The purpose of this is not merely to protect confidentiality and so secure privacy, a matter of importance in family proceedings, but also to enable this judgment to have a wider circulation, particularly amongst individuals who reside in the country from which the family originated.  There may be much misunderstanding in that place as to why certain decisions have been taken and it will be important in the future for those who are members of the wider paternal family to understand how matters have concluded as they have. The use of names may, to some extent, restrict the ability of others to have access to this judgment and therefore to understand properly how and why these decisions were made.</p>

Accordingly throughout the judgment the country shall be referred to as X. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I am concerned with the welfare of a child whom I shall refer to as L (a randomly chosen initial), who is a boy now 7 years old.  The legal proceedings which have been generated in respect of this child have been nearly as wide as they have been long. The applications before me have ranged across the family jurisdiction from wardship and return orders through committal proceedings and sequestration and then to welfare orders under the Children Act wrapped around personal protection orders and finally supported by an order in relation to financial support.  This has been a case, more accurately a series of parallel proceedings, in which the term &#8216;welfare&#8217; can properly be used in its very broadest sense.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Those various legal proceedings cover a two year period from 2021 until 2023 but which for both L and his mother (M) was only a part of a very difficult, turbulent and uncertain time for them and which will probably continue to reverberate emotionally for some time to come.   I cannot know whether M will experience such emotional highs and lows ever again but I can be confident that she would not wish to endure the sense of desperation and despondency which has accompanied her during times in this litigation.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The word &#8216;journey&#8217; is a much overused one in current times but is apt in this case.  It is not an exaggeration to say that for both L and M this has been a journey not only in geographical terms, as will be described below, but for M at least one which took her to the very limits of family law.  In her determination to be reunited with her son M traversed almost the full range of the legal landscape of the Family Division of the High Court. The only thing which came close to this mother&#8217;s doggedness to care for her child was the commitment of her legal team to ensuring that nothing was left undone that could be done in the struggle to achieve a successful reunification.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">M and F were married in X two decades ago and moved to this country two years later where, in due course, L was born.  Initially the parents were in this country to pursue their separate academic studies and each was successful in that endeavour.  M gained both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and aspired towards a professional career as a teacher.  F completed his studies and either began or took over the operation of a food store business through a shop in a city in the north of England.  In due course they purchased a home in a different city to the one where the business F was operating was situated.</p>

M claimed that F required her to abandon her goal of teaching and instead work in the store where she was paid a low wage from which more than half was then deducted as a contribution towards family bills.  According to M in her initial statements to the court this effectively meant that F had &#8216;complete control over everything.&#8217;</p>

The details are limited but M asserted that whilst matters between the couple were &#8216;ok&#8217; at the beginning of their relationship F was abusive towards M both before and after L was born.  On occasions this abuse was physical and M contacted the Police but thereafter F would be apologetic and she would not pursue any formal complaint.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Nowhere has M detailed as to on how many occasions or with which consequences F was abusive towards her.  In relation to both these allegations it has not been possible to make findings in respect of any of these matters and they have not been the subject of any specific forensic exercise.  It follows therefore that they have been neither proved nor rejected. I include these matters here as instances of the deterioration in the parental relationship which paved the way for what followed.</p>

What he was doing there, how he lived and supported himself was not explained by M although, as will be noted below, F later asserted that they had all gone there for the purpose of visiting his brothers and had had to remain in Geneva for medical reasons when M and L returned home.  In that period  M asserted that F simply failed to provide for either her or L at all, that communication was very limited between the parents and that such that did take place was abusive on the part of F and indicative of a lack of care towards her and L.</p>

At this point M decided that the marriage was at an end and decided to separate.  To achieve this M felt it necessary to contact the police but having done so she then decided against accepting their offer to be moved somewhere other than the family home and she and L remained in the property along with F.</p>

Whether connected to this or for other reasons F had arranged to fly to X in November 2020 but contacted M from the airport to inform her that he had suffered a collapse and requested her assistance to travel.  F said that he would agree to their separating but that this should be arranged in X once they were all there and he was with his family who could then care for him.  M agreed to this proposal and the family travelled together in November 2020 to F&#8217;s home city in X.</p>

F removed all of M&#8217;s belongings, including her phone and bank cards, and restricted her movements.  Although M was allowed to attend at her own family&#8217;s home in the same city she was apparently threatened that were she to say anything about her situation then she would not see L again as F would remove him from the city to an unknown location. </p>

In late June / early July of 2021 M left the F&#8217;s family&#8217;s home following an assault which left her, she said, &#8216;incredibly badly beaten&#8217; and went to her parents&#8217; house where she was protected by her own family until she returned to England on 28 July 2021.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In an email sent in response to the initial Without Notice orders secured by M, F denied that the police had ever had dealings with him whilst the family lived in England. He accepted having departed for Switzerland in 2020 but asserted that it was a family trip and his health prevented him from returning to England with the family and his having to remain in Geneva. The decision to return to X was due to the father&#8217;s known medical condition and was a planned move in which M played a full role in both agreeing to and implementing it.  Upon their return to X the family lived initially with the maternal family before moving into their own flat. In reference to the allegations of physical abuse and control F produced (by email and not exhibited to any sworn statement) several photos which show groups of people, including M and F, all wearing the traditional garb of citizens of X, at what appear to be either family or general social gatherings.  The inference being that these were all occasions when M was neither under the control of F nor bearing any evidence of having been assaulted.  In addition, F has asserted that M was free to move around of her own volition and she used that freedom to visit the maternal home, which he stated was within the same street as the paternal family home, and to access professional services in X including places away from the city in which they were living.  F accepted that during this period L was living with him but claimed that it was always known and accepted that they would all return to England following the conclusion of the unspecified course of treatment F was undertaking.  M, according to F, was depressed and this had been part of the family&#8217;s joint decision to return to X and once there M had effectively abandoned L and F and come under the control of her own family who were intent on securing monies from F for the sole benefit of M.</p>

Directions were given for F to file evidence in the event that he applied to vary the freezing orders.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">A further hearing was listed in early September (there was an error within the order as to the date of that hearing) and the matter duly came before Mrs Justice Judd on 6 September 2021.  By that time F had been in email contact with M&#8217;s solicitors and was asserting that his medical condition was known, real and currently prevented him from travelling to the UK or even participating remotely at a court hearing.  However he indicated that he intended to return to the UK as soon as his health &#8216;allows it&#8217;.  His inability to participate remotely was initially explained on the basis of being in hospital and not having access to stable, consistent wi-fi but he then changed his position to it being due to the effect of the medication he was taking.  Notwithstanding his apparent inability to participate in a court hearing F indicated an intention to challenge what M had sworn to in her affidavit (summarised above) but that his inability to be present at a court hearing or to be in a position (for unspecified reasons) &#8216;to write details at this stage&#8217; precluded him doing so at that time.  It will have been noted from the paragraphs above that his medical issues had not prevented him writing emails in which he made clear efforts to set out his stall.  Prior to the hearing on 6 September F continued in email communication with M&#8217;s solicitors and indicated his willingness and ability to facilitate the indirect contact previously ordered, however he was keen to delay the next court hearing on the grounds that he was struggling to secure legal representation in this jurisdiction.  By this point F had also slightly altered his stance in relation to L. Having previously indicated that he would return L when his condition allowed it he was now stating that if he could not do so then he would identify someone who could escort L back to this country.</p>

In a further email also prior to that hearing F identified a second person, like the first also a member of his family, who was proposing to travel to Finland and who could take L there for M to then collect him. During the course of that morning the hearing took place and in the order which followed it was recorded that F had participated remotely.  Within the sealed order there was confirmation of the proposal for L to be returned to the jurisdiction by a family member and a date set of 21 September for that to have occurred.  Directions were given for monies to be made available from the frozen funds to allow for the travel costs to be met.  Crucially for what followed but entirely understandably from the position of a court concerned to ensure that its orders were going to be had been complied with the case was not concluded and a further hearing set for 24 September.  As a consequence the freezing orders had been extended through to that date also.  For good measure the order also made reference to an expectation that at the next hearing and if L had been returned consideration would be given to the making of section 8 orders (a &#8216;Child Arrangements / live with&#8217; order and a prohibited steps order preventing further removal from the jurisdiction.  </p>

F was clear that he was not now going to return L to the UK &#8216;because my assets are going to be frozen or transfer <span style="font-style:italic">[sic]</span> them to my wife.&#8217;  It would appear from his email that the prospect of being unable to personally travel with L as well as the on-going nature of the freezing orders were active in this change of mind by F.  In the email communication which took place over the next couple of days F appeared to resile from this new stance and be working towards arranging the necessary consents to enable L to leave X in the absence of a parent as well as being able to return back into the UK (two separate issues which threw up different challenges). Despite this apparent, if late, indicator of compliance with Judd J&#8217;s return order the frequency of communication out of X began to decrease significantly and by 21 September, the date by which L was to have been returned if F was to comply with the order, F was emailing M&#8217;s solicitors to inform the that he would &#8216;attend&#8217; (probably &#8216;participate&#8217; was a more accurate word) at the hearing on 24 September to explain why L would not be returned.</p>

There was no mention of his own medical condition, of L&#8217;s welfare, of the reasons for his change of heart regarding L&#8217;s return or of any other matters which were pertinent to the issues before the court.

The outcome was a reconfirmation of the wardship and a further return order for L, to which was now attached a penal notice. The court gave further directions for achieving compliance with the return order and confirmed the existence of the financial orders.  F was now legally represented and had sworn a statement in which he asserted that the sale of the business had resulted in two cash payments both made in X rather than in England and with which monies F had used to live due to having no income in that country.  It was also revealed that F had taken out a Covid loan, a facility made available during the pandemic to assist businesses during lockdown, in the sum of &#163;50,000 which had now been spent.  The expenditure, F claimed, had not all been the business, despite that being the purpose of the loan, as a considerable portion had been spent either in respect of or on behalf of M and her family. F was clearly now asserting that not only did he not own the business but now was in significant debt as a result of it.  F&#8217;s figures, as set out in the document, suggested that he had in fact spent more money than he had borrowed and yet had still had retained sums in X.  Insofar as F addressed his medical condition he exhibited a one page document purportedly from a Nephrologist practicing in X which suggested kidney failure.</p>

The same statement addressed two other issues raised by F.  Firstly, M refuted F&#8217;s allegations that she had suffered from poor mental health.

At the final hearing in London it had been pointed out by Holman J that there was a mandatory minimum period of fifteen days required to effect good service upon F in X in accordance with FPR 2010 PD 6B, para. 7.1. That time limit was duly complied with but despite the efforts made by those instructed by M, F was a noticeable absentee. This was not unexpected as he had failed to respond to all efforts to communicate the fact of this hearing.

Successive hearings in London had failed to persuade F to engage meaningfully, let alone actually cooperate, with either M or the court in securing even any up to date information as to the well-being of L and the prospect of M spending any meaningful time with L, whether via video screen or otherwise, was looking increasingly remote.</p>

It was equally important that F, steadfastly remaining in X and giving no indication of being willing to reflect upon the necessity for any dispute resolution mechanism, was encouraged to understand that despite being a court in this country and applying the laws of this jurisdiction critical decisions pertaining to L&#8217;s welfare were not going to be decided only in accordance with any presumption that this jurisdiction was the only place L must be or that a parent situated in this jurisdiction would be perceived more favourably over one who was elsewhere.  </p>

Welfare is an aggregation of many different facets of a child&#8217;s life of which a child&#8217;s nationality, their familiarity with their geographical location and the attachments and connections they have to the place and people there are important factors in that determination of their welfare. But so to is the importance of maintaining historic cultural connections with a foreign homeland, significant familial ties in another part of the world and the values of the society in which the family has been rooted, including religious faith and belief systems which are ingrained within the societal values to which the child and family adhere.  All have a role to play in welfare determination but none of them are dispositive. Whilst welfare incorporates all of these it also transcends them all.  Furthermore a child&#8217;s welfare is never determined by giving any priority to simply being in this jurisdiction as opposed to a different country or any preference for &#8216;Englishness&#8217; in the values, mores and morals which will inform the child as they grow and develop.  In the same way as there is no promotion of a local view there should be no demotion of values, beliefs or attitudes which have greater currency in another place.</p>

In early March 2022 there was a fire at the former family home in northern England, now unoccupied as M had never returned there.  A Fire Investigation report was prepared by the local Fire Service and a copy of the report was disclosed into the proceedings. The report made for disturbing reading.  Just after midnight on the morning of 10 March 2022 a male was caught on the CCTV camera of a neighbouring property running from the house with what looked like his clothes on fire. There was a fire within the property itself and the emergency services were called.  The fire itself was relatively easily extinguished and there was no serious damage to the property.  What was noted however was that within the property there appeared to multiple seats of fire, i.e.. multiple places where individual fires had started, and no indication that one blaze had then spread throughout the property.  Within the house a strong smell of petrol was detected and a along with two petrol cans and a bag which contained an axe. The report concluded that the cause of the fire was the deliberate bringing together of a heat source and combustibles which were flammable liquids.  A police investigation was started which in February 2024 resulted in the conviction of an individual who, according to M, happens to be the son of a close friend of F.  </p>

Each had the opportunity, albeit F was unrepresented, to challenge evidence and I was satisfied that the process was fair.  With suitable modifications to remove information which I have deliberately kept from this judgment I have appended that judgment to this one for three reasons. Firstly, to ensure transparency and the comprehensiveness of this record.  Secondly, to clearly identify that F was in contempt of court by reason of his serial failings to return or cause the return of L to this jurisdiction.  Multiple return orders had been ignored.  F had repeatedly asserted that he was too ill to travel and that no one was available to escort L in his absence.  This was despite the clear indications he had given earlier in the proceedings that at least two different people were willing and able to do so.  There was no evidence to support his apparent state of ill-health and insofar as M accepted his on-going kidney issue she was clear that it had not prevented his flying abroad on other occasions when it suited him to do so.  His protestations of holding anything approaching a reasonable excuse for his failings therefore was firmly and fully rejected.  The third reason for appending this judgment is that it is important to ensure that the threats allegedly made by F and brought to M&#8217;s attention by the individual referred to as D in the Appended Judgment (but who is in fact Y in this judgment) are recorded because they will feature in the risk analysis undertaken later.</p>

In taking that course M, rightly in my view, considered that to do so would more likely than not make it less likely that L would be returned to this jurisdiction.  If F decided that by returning L he was opening himself to serving a sentence of custody (a not unlikely outcome given the findings made in respect of the multiple Return Orders with which he had failed to comply) then the prospect of a return would diminish. As importantly the imposition of a custodial sentence might only fuel suspicions in the minds of those around F in X that a foreign court was minded only to mete out injustice to an absentee party who was not either from or in that jurisdiction.  None of that would assist in securing the return of L.  </p>

The instrument by which the process had been initiated in late 2021 was via a writ of sequestration.  Although orders were made which removed the property from the control of F but he was not stripped of any legal or beneficial ownership.  If M was to achieve more than simply keeping it from him, which of itself had been an important part of her strategy in seeking to encourage F to co-operate in respect of L, she needed to now identify how that loss of control over it could be turned into realising the value of that asset for L&#8217;s benefit.</p>

She had held back from seeking specific personal penalty, such as a custodial sentence, against F following the contempt hearing, preferring instead to pursue the sequestration of the property as the proper outcome of those findings having been made, and continued to seek to bring pressure to bear upon F through other routes.  One particular matter which had been raised at successive hearings was whether some form of mediation in X involving members of the wider family to whom custom and tradition required that respect be accorded, notwithstanding the difficulties between the parents, could be utilised.  Although M had made efforts to identify those who could intercede upon her behalf these efforts did not produce any positive benefits. In an effort to assist that process or at least to engage those within the parents&#8217; wider families who might speak with authority to F at the hearing on 23 June 2022 the court order allowed for the possibility of members of the wider families being allowed to participate at a further hearing in August so as to ensure that there could be both a proper understanding of the nature of the proceedings as well as enable others within the family to bring such influence or authority to bear upon F to enable L to move to M&#8217;s care.  It was important to make clear that by so doing F would not be losing L but rather that the child, after over a year of not having seen his mother at all save for infrequent and short videocalls, could spend time with her again whilst investigations were made in whether more permanent arrangements could be established which would enable L to be able to spend time with each parent even if F remained in X.</p>

The specific circumstances of what had occurred were not matters which I considered necessary to have set out in any detailed statement for a variety of reasons but it was necessary to be satisfied that what had occurred was not unlawful, antithetical to the child&#8217;s interests or likely to generate yet further litigation based upon any relevant international convention.  I was so satisfied. </p>

This was important information to M because having left X she now considered that she was unable to return there for reasons of personal safety and that, irrespective of her own safety, a return would not, even though she was L&#8217;s mother, assist her to resume care of L whilst he remained in X.  L being taken into a neighbouring state gave M cause to believe that a retrieval attempted from there would be less risky for her personally and more likely to succeed.  This is what occurred.  Whilst L was in the neighbouring state M had been allowed to meet with L, with F&#8217;s knowledge, and whilst in her care there she was then able to leave that country with L and they both returned to England.</p>

M&#8217;s action was covert and unilateral but not, in my judgement, unlawful.  L was a ward of court in respect of whom a best interests decision had been made as far back as 6 August 2021 that he should be returned to this jurisdiction, which decision had never been rescinded, appealed or otherwise formally challenged by F.  In addition, no order had been made either in this jurisdiction or in X which confirmed that L should be in the care of F and certainly nothing which required that he should not spend time with M.  F had unilaterally but effectively created a situation whereby he had sole custody, care and control (to use a phrase from old legislation) of L, no court had sanctioned this.  In taking the steps that she did M simply reversed this arrangement and L&#8217;s exit from the neighbouring state was undertaken by a parent holding parental responsibility for their child and therefore, to the knowledge of this court, neither in breach of any order of this court nor any applicable legislation to which effect had to be given.  It was unorthodox and undoubtedly highly risky but not illegal.</p>

F asserted that this had been agreed not just between M and himself but also with members of their families with standing.  F further asserted that in acting as she had M had broken its terms by removing L to England.  No evidence was put forward to support such an agreement having been reached and no document provided which confirmed its terms. Even had one been produced the idea that a child&#8217;s arrangements would be reversed without recourse to their welfare but on the basis of a parent&#8217;s decision to marry is completely inconsistent with modern definitions of welfare and not something which would be sanctioned by a court in my judgement.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is unnecessary to make findings in relation to the disputed positions about how L came to be in M&#8217;s care.  If what F has said is true the best that can be said is that F after nearly two years was finally able to understand the importance for L of being able to spend time with each parent.  However the reality is that for two years F saw fit to ensure that M had little if any real opportunity to spend time with her son and rejected multiple requests, whether from M or the court, to allow L to leave his care.  It must be said however that the idea that F suddenly changed his mind and allowed this to happen is not immediately and without much more cogent evidence a probable conclusion.</p>

From the information made available I am unaware that L&#8217;s period of time in isolation with F had left him with any physical issues. There is no suggestion of any ill-treatment, neglect or lack of care in physical terms.  On the contrary, I have no doubt that F loves his son and therefore ensured that whilst in his sole care he was properly cared for in almost all respects.  I could see that for myself at the hearing in May 2022 when L inadvertently came into view whilst F was participating in that hearing.  Whilst I may have been reassured to see that L appeared to be happy and unfazed by his situation I have no doubt that the sight of her son was deeply distressing to M, a fact which F should have been aware of and which he wholly failed to acknowledge.</p>

There can be no argument but that prior to her involuntary separation from him M was at least as responsible for L&#8217;s care as F and probably far more so given that it appears to be a truism of families everywhere that a mother very often takes on the greater share of child-rearing responsibilities as between two parents.  L would therefore have had a significant and deep attachment to his mother.  It was a serious failing by F not to ensure that, despite the geographical distance, L was able to talk with M frequently upon her removal from his life after November 2020 and especially upon her return to England. I have no doubt that this will undoubtedly have had an emotional impact upon L.  F was repeatedly told this by me at successive hearings and constantly failed to accept it or to do anything about it.  The impact upon L of effectively losing his mother and then regaining it unexpectedly and without warning nor preparation will have been traumatic.  It should be added that the secondary effect, of losing his father (which is how it must have seem to L) will have been equally difficult and on-going.  It should not have come to this that a child having been monopolised by one parent to the detriment of the other had to snatched by the other to the detriment of the former.  This is very far from good child-centric care.  I hold the father directly responsible for this state of affairs.</p>

Fortunately the wound was to the leg and the gentleman has recovered.  Although F was reported to the authorities M understood the position to be that because F allegedly had connections to or at least some influence with the state security authorities he was not arrested.  Whether this was true could be questioned by the fact that F did apparently go into hiding, despite these alleged connections, and the general level of civil disorder and protest in X meant that no immediate action appeared to be likely.</p>

In addition I continued the wardship, made a Port Alert order, a Prohibited Steps order to prevent F either removing or arranging for the removal of L from Ms care and orders covering both L and M made pursuant to s.42, Family Law Act 1996. Understandably M&#8217;s focus was upon securing L&#8217;s situation and enabling him to move through the trauma of isolation and then removal.  </p>

The final hearing was listed in June 2023 when all applications were before the court.  At that hearing however F indicated that he was not currently in X but at an undisclosed location in that region of the world, that he was imminently about to undergo surgery for his long running issue with his kidneys and that, for the first time, he wished to have the use of an interpreter to assist him at the final hearing.  Upon his application therefore the hearing was adjourned and re-scheduled for later in the Autumn, a long adjournment but necessary to take into account of F&#8217;s needs, counsel&#8217;s availability and court listing commitments.</p>

It was known that F and M were not only nationals of X but also members of a minority ethnic group in that country which had, in times past, been subjected to repression on a regional basis.  However to now suggest that F was being covertly controlled during court hearings was new information which was entirely contrary to all previous assertions that had been given by F when confirming his situation with regard to privacy and isolation for the purposes of a remote court hearing. There had been no indication, even on the occasion when L had innocently wandered into the room from where F was participating in the hearing, of anyone else being present.  It was clearly incapable of verification but raised questions either about F&#8217;s ability to conduct litigation, about his willingness or ability to be open with the court or possibly even about F&#8217;s mental health.  In any way this assertion did not assist F&#8217;s case.</p>

Having previously stated that during hearings he had been in the company of members of the security services of X whilst in his family home he was now claiming to be a hostage of them and in the total control of that state.  What that amounted to, he claimed, was that he was required to return each evening to a prison where he spent the night before being released the following morning.  He stated that because of this he could not access any legal advice (presumably in respect of his local difficulties as well as the legal issues which were the focus of the court hearing) and was not allowed to travel abroad.  In this hearing F asserted that a further form of control being exercised upon him was being denied kidney surgery, the need for which operation he said was essential.  He did not indicate whether this was the same operation he had said was imminent and which necessitated the adjournment in June.  Furthermore F said that his wider family were similarly in the control of the state and gave the clear impression that this was an additional difficulty he was facing.  F added that he was now at risk of torture if it was the case that any information from the hearing was then passed to the state security services.  How that last comment squared with his initial claim to be the hostage of the state was not clear.</p>

However there was no evidence to suggest that anything F said was true.  It was clear that that he had been able to join and participate at the hearing despite whatever custodial regime was in place.  F displayed no physical evidence of having been controlled or intimidated, there were no injuries, no appearance of degradation or weariness associated with imprisonment. Furthermore this information was being given for the first time during the hearing.  There was no prior issue or difficulty which had been indicated and M had received no information from any other source which could verify or even support anything F was saying.  In short I could not conclude that anything F was saying at this point in time was true and was unable to ascertain any reason why he might make such otherwise outlandish assertions.</p>

No doubt the effects of his extended separation from her will be felt for some time to come and may prove an indelible memory beyond his childhood. Similarly he will undoubtedly be experiencing a sense of loss from any contact with F and this too may be a difficulty he will endure for some time to come.  I consider that M is well placed to anticipate, identify and meet all of L&#8217;s needs and ensure that the remainder of his childhood is geared towards minimising this period of turbulence he has suffered rather than exacerbating it. Furthermore M has throughout these proceedings demonstrated fortitude, patience and an unwavering commitment towards L and towards achieving a fair outcome for all members of the family.  The actions she took to retrieve L were not illegal but necessitated by F&#8217;s blatant refusal to even consider what was in the best interests of L.  I have no difficulty in accepting that M genuinely sought to exhaust all avenues open to her before embarking upon her plan to secure L from the neighbouring state.  Throughout these proceedings M has been clear, honest and acted entirely appropriately and with a clear focus upon L&#8217;s best interests.</p>

The reasons why the family travelled to X and of what happened there to cause M to leave without L are disputed but insofar as M and F differ in their accounts I unhesitating prefer M.  F lacks credibility, not merely by reason of his sensationalist claims in relation to being a prisoner within X but through his actions throughout these proceedings.  F has been inconsistent, untruthful and duplicitous. He has made such statements as he believes will assist him without any regard for consistency or credibility.  Furthermore F has acted according to what he wanted, not what he considered was in L&#8217;s best interests.  F never once sought to put forward any reasonable proposal by which L could spend time in England as well as in X or offer any guarantees as to L&#8217;s well-being whilst being away from M.  As in so many cases before the family courts F&#8217;s unwillingness to offer anything approaching regular and frequent video contact demonstrated the true state of his mindset.  F was concerned to ensure his principal bargaining chip, L, was kept close to him and therefore away from M.  He showed a callous disregard for L&#8217;s welfare in so doing and acted in a deliberately cruel and vindictive manner towards M.</p>

Such an order is undoubtedly a significant disruption to both L and F&#8217;s rights to associate and continue their relationship which is undoubtedly extremely significant to both of them.  F is his father and has been, even if not for positive reasons, L&#8217;s full-time carer for nearly two years.  In addition L has lived amongst his paternal family and undoubtedly developed significant ties with them which, in the absence of F, will be impacted.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">However despite all these reasons and the statutory imperative towards parental involvement it is necessary to make a &#8216;no contact&#8217; order at this time.  It is clear in my judgement that F has shown neither an ability nor a willingness to abide by court orders.  Such a demonstration does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> mean that an individual is thereby deprived of contact with a child as some form of punishment. The proper response to non-compliance (as this father now knows) is a finding of contempt not a deprivation of contact.  However a child arrangements order that enables a person to spend time with a child requires a willingness to abide by the terms of that order, to make the arrangement work and not to seek to undermine it or sabotage it.  I could have no confidence in F at all that this would not be his primary goal.  It also assumes that the involvement of the parent is of benefit to the child.  In this case I have to take into account the known risks presented by this father &#8211; of abduction, isolation and control - and such unknown risks as he now raises but which cannot be verified.</p>

That fear is fully justified by reason not only of F&#8217;s previous actions and also now of M&#8217;s.  F isolated M from L whilst the family were in X and thereafter refused to return him.  M however then retrieved (snatched might be a not inappropriate word) L from F&#8217;s care.  Each parent has resorted to unilateral action in respect of L.  It is now what they do. The risk to L of F attempting a copy-cat action is high and the risk to L of that succeeding is significant if, as it undoubtedly would, what resulted was more of the same of what L has had to endure these past two years.</p>

However that is by no means the best outcome for L in the longer term.  As was repeatedly said to F in successive hearings a child having to lose his relationship with one parent simply to gain one with the other loses every time this occurs.  What L needs is not repeated swings of a pendulum between one parent and the other but a balanced, settled approach whereby he is able to enjoy a good relationship with each which allows him the fullest opportunity to explore his understanding of himself, including his cultural heritage and his connections to his wider families.  </p>

For that reason it will be necessary for F to make himself available to a local authority or other qualified individual to undertake a full risk assessment in order then to commence a planned approach to re-engaging with L.  When that can happen and the stages which will be required to be worked through will be dependent upon the situation at the time.</p>

Indirect contact, particularly when it involves instantaneous communication, can too easily become an interrogation session for a child when talking with a parent who is determined to use it as a device to locate whereabouts.  Where an individual is considered high risk there is a real danger than indirect contact itself requires monitoring, supervision and a degree of control.  The point was eloquently made most recently by Hayden J:</p>

Generally, this is considered to be an opportunity for a child to obtain some understanding of their cultural and genetic inheritance. As a principle, it is obviously both sound and important but it must not be seen as automatic. The need for it and the potential damage that might be caused by it, need properly to be evaluated. Nor, in my judgment, should the importance and reach of indirect contact be underestimated.</span></p>

The combined effect of these different orders is to create around M and L a protective network which works to keep F from discovering where they are and also to ensure that L, in particular, is protected against forced removal.  I consider that the orders are necessary and proportionate at this time.  The extension of the period of operation of the Child Arrangement order (&#8216;live with&#8217;) until L turns 18 is another part of this phalanx of orders.  A Child Arrangements order brings with it certain legal protections such as the criminalisation of any unauthorised removal, which, at this point in time, would appear to be necessary for L.  </p>

A ward is a person in respect of whom no person can take a decision of significance without the leave of the court.  It is inconceivable that L would benefit from multiple applications to court in order that M could properly parent her child.  The period of control that was required by the court has now passed as the purpose of the wardship is concluded.  The wardship is accordingly discharged.</p>

It is a device by which access to justice can be controlled as opposed to barred.

I questioned what purpose would be served by the making of such a direction and whether in fact the better outcome was simply to direct that any future application in respect of L is listed before myself.  In the event, whilst I will make a direction that any future application in relation to this child is reserved to myself I have concluded that there is a benefit to the making of a s.91(14) direction because I will direct that prior to the granting of permission the application shall not be served upon M but remain an issue for F to persuade the court of the value of his application.  In the absence of merit the application will not proceed and M need not be troubled with it.  By this means F can ensure that the court door is not closed to him but that M need not be unnecessarily disturbed by his banging on it for no effective purpose. The term of the order is five years.  Therefore the direction will stand until 2 October 2028.  The reservation of future applications to myself is without time limit but parametered only by my being available to hear the application. </p>

Pursuant to paragraph 1(2)(c) of Schedule 1 to the Children Act 1989 the mother can apply to the court for &#8216;an order requiring either or both parents of the child to pay to the applicant for the benefit of the child such lump sum as may be so specified.&#8217;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">M&#8217;s case is that she seeks to utilise the sum available from the sale of the former matrimonial home.  She is a single parent on whom the full cost of raising L has now fallen without any hope of securing maintenance from F.  F asserts that he has medical issues, is being controlled in his movements and has already had the benefit of significant sums from what was the family business.  In addition the former matrimonial home suffered a reduction in value by reason of the lack of occupation and the fire damage.  This has had a knock-on effect upon the proceeds of sale. The very fact of a sale was a matter arranged by F in December 2021, when freezing orders were already in place in respect of the property and which therefore was in breach of the same.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">There is one source of funds as between the parents and if it is released to F, the legal owner still, then there is every possibility that he will transfer those sums out of the jurisdiction and away from M and L forever.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">To capture all of the apparent available finances would appear to be a harsh decision for F, denuding him of monies to which he would otherwise expect a significant if not the whole share.  However F had the benefit of a loan in the sum of &#163;50,000 taken out in 2020 against the business which has never been repaid and also directly received a sum of &#163;19,000 upon its sale.  Accordingly F has had &#163;69,000 from the business which supported the family and in which M worked.  M has had the benefit of &#163;5,000 from the proceeds of sale which stemmed from the need to travel outwith the jurisdiction by reason of F&#8217;s continuing contempt in 2022.  Although M had indicated a willingness to repay that sum if so required by the making of a single lump sum order both she and F are freed from such concerns and in due course L can be made aware of the significant financial contribution which F has made to his welfare.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Accordingly I make an order that the sum of &#163;75,000 or such lesser sum as is the current sum available from the proceeds of sale is paid to M as a lump sum for the benefit of L.  To make such an order also avoids any question of matters being set up as a trust, an arrangement F was clear he did not support.  It is far better that M is put in a position whereby she can apply those funds for L&#8217;s benefit directly.  By so doing F can have it placed on record in the event that circumstances  change and he is in a position to make maintenance payments of the contribution he has already made.</p>

It is to be hoped that significant change can be made by F in his outlook towards the needs of his son so as to enable him to put forward realistic, safe and practical arrangements by which he can renew his relationship with L in due course and before too much time has elapsed.  F must understand that significant change will be required and clear insight into where matters went so wrong if he wishes to move matters forward from this current state.  Assuming such reflection can be undertaken and change mind F will then need to make an application to vary the current orders, certainly the Child Arrangements (spend time with) order.  If and when it is made it will be made to myself alone pending further directions.</p>
