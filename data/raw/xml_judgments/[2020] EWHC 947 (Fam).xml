He has been living here for some years and became a British citizen in 2008. He met the mother when she was sixteen as her family lived next door to his in X. The parents entered into an Islamic marriage in 2015, and came to live in this country in 2017.   C was born here.   </p>

She alleged that the father had shaken C and thrown her against a wall at Stansted airport, and that he had assaulted her (the mother) that evening and the following day. The father was arrested and interviewed under caution where he denied the allegations although he did say that there had been an argument where he had pushed the mother, and indeed that she had pushed him.  After the father was released, the mother would not make a statement and the police decided they did not have enough evidence to prosecute.  The local authority began a section 47 investigation during which the mother alleged that the father had been abusive to her during her pregnancy and afterwards, including physical and verbal abuse, financial and coercive control.  She said she had withdrawn her complaint to the police because she feared repercussions and that she would be deported.  </p>

The social worker warned the mother of the risks involved in this, and that she might be prevented from returning to the UK.  The mother told her that she believed it was for a holiday and that she wished to go. The social worker&#8217;s warning proved to be prescient as the family did not return on the date expected. The local authority reported them missing to the police on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June and it was assumed that they had gone back to X. Messages sent by the social worker to the father went unanswered until 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June when the father sent the social worker a message to say that the mother&#8217;s mother had become critically ill and that they had returned to X.  </p>

They may arise for a number of reasons.  One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability.  Another is that they are lies told for other reasons.  Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the recordkeeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account.  The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.  As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process that might inelegantly be described as "story-creep" may occur without any necessary inference of bad faith&#8221;. </p>

The mother was pressed firmly (but entirely properly) about her evidence by Mr Wainwright on behalf of the father, who put it to her that she had invented her claims of violence and abuse against him (save for one episode of pushing with the father said was mutual).  It was also put to her that she had decided quite by herself that she wished to abandon her daughter and husband in favour of a new man, and that her claim that she had been threatened, stranded in X and separated from her daughter by the father and the family was false.   </p>

At the visit by the social worker on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April the mother said that she no longer wanted to leave her husband because he was very sorry, but she did not retract the allegations, indeed she said that he had threatened to send her back to X and to keep C himself.  The mother&#8217;s statement for the court dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October is very much consistent with what she said to the social worker and the police too, including the detail that the father&#8217;s brother had been present at the assault on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.  There was no obvious reason for the mother to make all this up, especially when she had decided to give the marriage another go. In June she told Ms U that she felt safe whilst the local authority was still monitoring things.   When the family went to Turkey and then X, the mother contacted the social worker early in August to say that she had not seen her daughter for three weeks, and she was asking for help. She has consistently continued to ask for help since this date, help to come back to England and help to get her daughter back.  I do not find that the variation in how long the mother says it was since she had seen C before her first contact with the local authority in August is material, particularly as she timed the point of separation with the day of the family meeting.  </p>

If he is right, the mother for no obvious reason made allegations of violence and abuse against him in April, and maintained them even when she had apparently decided against leaving him.  The father would have it that it was the mother who wanted to go to Turkey and then to X and was careless as to the visa renewal, yet when in August she had apparently decided to abandon her marriage and her child in favour of another man she was only interested in her visa application so she could return to the UK.   On the father&#8217;s case, at the same time as the mother was contacting the social worker in August asking for help and expressing anxiety about the whereabouts of her daughter,  she was apparently in the process of engaging in a new relationship in which she was proposing to abandon her. The father&#8217;s only explanation for this was that the mother was simply trying to make life difficult for him. I reject this as a motive or a possibility.   I accept that the mother appeared somewhat flat at the beginning and that she did not display as much anxiety about C&#8217;s whereabouts at the beginning as she did later, but I am not at all persuaded that this was because she was unconcerned.

The father makes no further mention of the maternal grandmother&#8217;s grave illness once the family arrived in X. The suggestion that the mother was unwilling to come back to England in late July to renew her visa sits very badly with the rest of the evidence, and I also think it highly unlikely that the mother would have been so open in X about wishing to leave the father because she would have realised there could be serious repercussions for her if she did so.

An act of  abandonment by a mother who was the primary carer of her two year old child to pursue a new relationship (which seems to be what the father is suggesting) is an act of rejection. If at the same time as doing this the mother expressed indifference to an extremely painful injury her daughter had suffered in her care, it would place serious question marks as to her fitness to care for C<span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">.</span></p>

She was tricked into going to Turkey and her phone was removed from her. Her visa was allowed to run out. When she was in X she was put under pressure by both sides of the family to say she had betrayed the father, and C was removed from her. Shortly after that she managed get hold of another phone to try and contact the local authority (via the police) here.  When the wardship application was launched as a result of the mother&#8217;s contact with the local authority the father reported the mother to the authorities there, causing her to be arrested, and then he made more complaints in October. Since that date he has done nothing to withdraw his complaint or the proceedings and as a result his protestations that he thinks the mother should have a role in C&#8217;s life ring extremely hollow.  </p>

I also accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that the father assaulted her, both on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April and this is what led her to call the police.  The father&#8217;s suggestion that the mother had sustained a cut to her leg falling over when they were out on another occasion was untrue; she had sustained it because he kicked her. </p>

Her situation, as a women much younger than him, speaking little of the language and without her own family, made her vulnerable.  </p>

The local authority did not seek such a finding and I think it would be unfair to the father were I to do so. In any event the photograph is of poor quality and the allegation was made late. I do not say I disbelieve the mother, although even if I did consider that the incident had been exaggerated, it would not undermine my overall conclusions about the credibility of the other allegations.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.01in">I have already said above that the mark to C is a worrying one. The medical evidence is that it is a burn. I have already rejected the father&#8217;s evidence that C was in her mother&#8217;s care when it happened, and it follows therefore that she was either being cared for by relatives or the father himself (albeit it is right that there is only a small window of opportunity between his resumption of her care and the doctor&#8217;s appointment on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August).  The local authority did not seek a finding in terms that the burn was non-accidental  although the medical report says that this is likely in the absence of any explanation as to how it happened.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.01in">I am sure that the father is not telling the truth about the burn. No doubt this is because of his pretence that C was being cared for by her mother.  If the burn was there when he picked C up from relatives on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August I am sure he will have noticed and asked for an explanation. If one was not forthcoming he would have demanded one. If she was in his care, then he knows how it happened. My finding is that C suffered a  burn in the care of either her wider relatives or the father. C either sustained the burn as a result of negligence (she is only two and should be being supervised) or it was inflicted. Either way, she suffered significant physical harm as a result of care given to her, not what it would be reasonable for a parent to give.  The father knows whose care she was in, and he very likely knows what happened to her, but he has chosen to conceal it and blame others.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.01in">The local authority has alleged that the mother failed to protect C from domestic abuse and violence, and by going to Turkey in circumstances where she had been warned she may be prevented from being able to return. Whilst I understand why these allegations have been made, I am not prepared to make these findings. They are not required in the sense that the threshold criteria are amply met in this case, opening the gate to the making of public law orders should they prove to be necessary.  This mother has been the victim of domestic abuse in the wider sense of the word,  in circumstances where she was vulnerable, in a country relatively unknown to her, and where she did not speak the language. She lived with the father and his brother.  In this situation the mother&#8217;s ability to stand up for herself and her daughter was badly compromised, and I do not think it is right or necessary to label her or suggest that she was to blame. The question for this court is whether or not she can protect her daughter if she is to resume her care, and I think this would be better framed as a risk that C will suffer significant harm in the future, which can be addressed at the welfare stage of the case.  </p>
