		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The background this case is to be found in my fact-finding judgment of 30 November 2012 to be found in section A at page 53. I do not repeat it here. Suffice to say that I found the father, Stefan D, to be guilty of truly bestial conduct. I recorded his conviction in the year 2000 in the Czech Republic of offences of the utmost seriousness involving the gross abuse and exploitation of women and girls. I found how, after his arrival in the UK, he meted out appalling domestic violence to his wife, Daniella D. I found how he engaged in serious criminal activity, largely centred around illegal drugs. I described how I was satisfied that he had seduced his 16 year old stepdaughter by plying her with drugs; how he had had unprotected sex with her; and how she became pregnant by September 2011 when she was only 17 years of age. I recorded how this sexual congress took place in the family home to the knowledge of the other minor children there, B and K. I recorded how he was even having sexual intercourse in the same time-frame with his wife as he was with his stepdaughter. I found that the statutory threshold in section 31 of the Children Act had been comprehensively crossed, both in respect of past harm and the risk of future harm. </p>

I recounted how, by Christmas 2012, so that is very shortly after my first judgment, the mother had rekindled her relationship with the father, if it had ever ended; became pregnant by him again; and as a result baby LD was born, as I have said, on 13 September 2013. Since Christmas 2012 mainly and since the birth of baby LD fully the mother and father have lived together in Novy Ji&#265;cin. When pregnant with baby LD the mother was in England from time to time for contact and no doubt in order to meet with her solicitors. It emerged in the </p>

It subsequently emerged from the father when he gave evidence by video link that he had been consorting with a 19 year old prostitute. To say that this cast doubt on his assertions of reformation, repentance and rehabilitation would be an understatement. His own explanation for this conduct was merely, "She was away and I am a man."&#8221; </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In his oral evidence whilst he accepted his criminal convictions and indeed his seduction of the mother whilst plying her with drugs, he emphatically rejected my findings of domestic violence. He stated that they were just not true and were based on false evidence. In a revealing moment he disclosed that he had not even seen my judgment and so his rejection of my finding was based on what other people had told him what they are. He did admit consorting with this prostitute and he made the statement to which I have referred in justification for that, "I am here on my own and I am a man." However, notwithstanding that dubious conduct he asserted he was a changed man and that he was starting afresh. He told me that if ED could not be returned to him but was placed with foster parents in the Czech Republic he would be mad with happiness.&#8221; </p>

First, I reject the proposal by the mother that these proceedings be dismissed and ED be returned to her and the father in the Czech Republic. That is manifestly not in his interests. Such a placement back with his parents would be replete with far too many risks in circumstances where the father categorically rejects the majority of the previous findings made in this case. He plainly cannot confront his demons until he has identified his demons. The same is true to a lesser extent in relation to the mother. If these parents were living here it is inconceivable that ED would be returned to them. That they are in the Czech Republic surely makes no difference.&#8221;  </p>

In my judgment I am satisfied that it would be appropriate to make such an order. That would mean that any such applications would be put on the same footing as an application to discharge the special guardianship order itself. That requires the leave of the court. It would put it on the same footing as an application for postadoption contact, as set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/51" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51</ref>A(4)(c) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>. In my judgment it is plainly an order that should be made so that the stability of the placement with the special guardians can be guaranteed, or at least, if not guaranteed, assured so far as is possible. It should be understood that an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> carries with it no stigma. It simply requires that the parents, were they to make an application the nature of which I have mentioned, to satisfy a court that they have an arguable case before the special guardians are troubled by the application. In my judgment, on the facts of this case where this is not a conventional special guardianship order (they are normally made in favour of relatives) but is in fact made in favour of carers whose identities shall remain confidential. In my judgment that order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> should endure until ED&#8217;s 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. In other words until 27 June 2026. After his 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>birthday his own views, were an application to be made for contact, would, in my view, be, if not decisive, then highly influential, and in such circumstances it would not be necessary for the court&#8217;s leave for an application to be made.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I agree with Ms Best that these provisions cannot literally apply to this application because it is, of course, neither an application to vary the special guardianship order nor an application for post-adoption contact. I agree with her that I must determine the application within the four corners of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> and the governing authorities on that provision. However, on the particular facts of this case it must be right, I believe, that the matters mentioned by Parliament in relation to those provisions, namely the need to have in mind a change of circumstances, and the risk of disruption of the placement of the child, should be afforded due weight. Put another way, I should take those matters fully into account in any event. </p>

I place particular weight on the risk of disruption and on the views of the special guardians.

In the light of that I am not satisfied that the applicant would make a positive contribution to the well-being of ED. </p>
