	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment follows a finding of fact hearing concerning GH, a six year old boy, whose mother and father are the First Respondent, CD, and the Second Respondent, EF. GH&#8217;s parents have been separated since before his birth and he lived with his mother, spending limited time with his father until events in September 2023 which led to the Local Authority issuing public law proceedings and obtaining an interim care order under which GH was removed from the care of CD and placed in the care of EF where he remains.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority&#8217;s allegations, set out in a long schedule of findings sought, concern CD exaggerating or fabricating illnesses suffered by GH. These include alleged misreporting and exaggeration of symptoms relating to his urination, constipation, and fever. In August and September 2023 CD sought medical attention for GH in relation to his passing kidney stones, including on 17 September 2023 when she brought GH to the Emergency Department of Sunderland Royal Hospital with a urine sample which contained two stones, the largest measuring 2.5 cm long which she reported had been passed by GH, from his penis, at some time that morning. It is now accepted that these particular stones cannot have been passed by GH and that none of the stones presented to clinicians by CD in August and September 2023 were passed by GH. GH&#8217;s maternal grandmother, JK, has given evidence that GH passed a number of stones when in her sole care on 16 September 2023 but the expert evidence that these were not kidney stones is unchallenged. I have to decide where those stones, the large ones handed over by CD on 17 September 2023, and the earlier stones she handed over to healthcare professionals, came from. The Local Authority alleges that CD has fabricated her accounts of GH passing kidney stones and has added non-renal stones to his urine samples. CD strongly denies having done so.</p>

She has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (&#8220;ASD&#8221;). Dr Swart, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, has advised that her ability to retain verbal information is &#8220;extremely poor&#8221; and her verbal comprehension index is low. In combination, these factors mean that her &#8220;ability to absorb and retain verbal information is extremely poor.&#8221; Following recommendations from Dr Swart and an intermediary assessment, CD has had the assistance of an intermediary at this finding of fact hearing. Ground rules were adopted which included regular breaks and the use of simple language when questioning. EF was assessed by Dr Clark-Dowd, Clinical Psychologist, who found his full scale IQ to be 71 (3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> centile) but that his verbal abilities were in the &#8220;extremely low range&#8221;.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">GH was born in August 2017. His parents had already separated. He lived with his mother but spent time, including some overnight stays with his father. He is the first and only child of each parent. GH started nursery at the age of 4 and began at primary school in September 2022. CD keeps a clean and tidy home. GH attended nursery and school properly dressed and equipped and had a positive attitude. He continues to do very well at school. CD has always engaged well with teachers and staff.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In September 2021 GH was reviewed by Dr G, Consultant Paediatrician, who carried out a series of investigations which excluded any serious underlying condition. On 26 January 2022, only eight days after GH was discharged from Dr G&#8217;s clinic, CD requested a second opinion suggesting that GH needed a full body scan. On 31 March 2022 GH was seen by Dr B, another Consultant Paediatrician, reporting that GH was not gaining weight. Further investigations were all normal except that a bowel marker study showed a slightly slow gut. Following further reports by CD of GH suffering abdominal distension and pain, GH was admitted for a four night stay for detailed observations. He was largely well on the ward save for slight distension after meals and some episodes of pain. A tentative diagnosis of aerophagia (swallowing too much air) was made. On 1 September 2022 CD reported concern that GH was losing weight and might have ulcerative colitis. She requested an ultrasound scan and one was arranged for 15 September 2022 but on 14 September GH was taken to A&amp;E by ambulance with what CD described as abdominal pain. At the hospital GH was noted to appear well and happy and no acute abnormality was found. The ultrasound scan on 15 September was reported as being entirely normal. Blood tests were normal. On 20 September at an out-patient clinic with Dr B, CD reported recurrent abdominal cramping pains and another battery of blood tests was ordered. All were normal. Despite repeated reassurance from Dr B, CD requested a third opinion and was referred to Dr M, Paediatric Gastroenterologist who, in November 2022, confirmed the diagnosis of constipation with no serious underlying problems.</p>

Dr B recorded his considerable disquiet about the frequency and manner of presentation of GH by CD for medical attention, and CD&#8217;s inability to accept &#8220;hours and hours&#8221; of reassurance.</p>

On 22 February 2022, CD took GH to A&amp;E with complaints of high temperatures day and night not responsive to over the counter medication. GH appeared well on examination but a ten day course of penicillin was prescribed. A week later GH was taken by CD to the rapid access clinic reporting raised temperatures over the previous month but nothing remarkable was noted on examination. GH was referred to a Consultant in Infectious Diseases and a Paediatrician specialising in Immunology. All investigations were normal (save for an x-ray showing evidence of constipation). On 15 February 2022, CD provided GH&#8217;s school with equipment to measure his temperature and oxygen levels. On 2 March, GH was admitted to hospital for two days for investigations into his reported fevers and abdominal pain and CD reported that he was having fever &#8220;all day every day&#8221; at home. His temperature was normal throughout that short admission. CD was asked to bring her thermometer in to the hospital. She did so and it was found to be consistently recording a higher temperature than the hospital thermometer, although both recorded a normal temperature. CD was advised to stop measuring GH&#8217;s temperature.</p>

CD now says this had happened for about six weeks. She handed over a urine sample containing some large stones and reported that he was passing about two stones a day. It was recorded that CD stated that GH was under investigation for a low immune system and had had recent blood tests. He had been complaining of lower abdominal pain and had cried when passing the stones. On examination he was alert and bright and all observations were normal. He looked &#8220;very well&#8221; and on examination of his penis no abnormalities were detected. Whilst at the centre he passed urine twice, cried when he did so but was described as being completely fine afterwards and was eager for the clinician to inspect his urine. He was admitted as an  in-patient between 27 and 31 August 2023 and did not pass any stones. He did not demonstrate any signs of pain when passing urine. He made a noise when urinating and when asked why, he said he was in pain but was noted not to be distressed.

CD told me that GH refused to stay overnight because it was too cold in his father&#8217;s house and because his father and paternal grandmother did not believe he was unwell. CD took GH to his maternal grandmother&#8217;s house on the morning of Saturday 16 September 2023 and left him in her care whilst she went to the shops and had what she described as some &#8220;me time&#8221;. She collected GH at about 1700 hours and took him home. The following morning, at about 11.15 am on 17 September 2023 she arrived with GH at A&amp;E with a urine sample that contained urine and objects including two large stones which she said he had passed. The largest was recorded as being 2.5 cms long and triangular in shape. Greenish plant-like matter was noted to be in the sample. CD reported that GH&#8217;s temperature had frequently been over 38C over the weekend and that GH had had intermittent abdominal pain, throat pain, and nausea. In the department GH was noted to urinate without any signs of pain or discomfort. GH was admitted to hospital. He did not pass any stones but on 19 September he went to the toilet. CD was seen to be standing behind him and she handed over the sample bottle with a stone in it to Nurse C. </p>

Children&#8217;s Services were notified and social worker G attended the hospital to speak to GH and CD. GH said to G and Dr V that it hurt when stones came out, that &#8220;mummy watched me and it came out and it hurt. Mummy helped pull it out&#8221;.  He said that his tummy was sore when urinating. Following a strategy meeting held on 19 September 2023, these proceedings were then begun.</p>

Since being in EF&#8217;s care from 20 September 2023, GH has not passed any kidney stones. He has been generally well with a couple of short-lived illnesses and only one day off school as a result. He has not required any visits to healthcare professionals other than as directed for the purpose of gathering evidence for these proceedings. EF has a full scale IQ of 71. He appeared to me to be somewhat suggestible and to have previously accepted, without question, directions from CD in relation to GH&#8217;s health and care. For example, at her insistence, he had ensured that GH had urinated into a jug so that he could measure his urine output. He had photographed possible anomalies after GH had urinated when in EF&#8217;s care. Three photographs were provided to me. The first showed two tiny dots apparently attached to the side of a white toilet bowl which I was told was within a hospital. They look like nothing more than tiny stains on the bowl and no-one could reasonably conclude that they were kidney stones from the photographic evidence. The second showed a small dark object lying at the bottom of a white toilet bowl. EF told me that GH had drawn his attention to this as a possible stone. I was told that this photograph had been taken at home. It cannot be discerned whether the object is hard or soft. It could even be a small piece of faecal material. The third photograph is of a test tube shaped receptacle containing fluid which I was told was urine, within which is floating a small, white substance. The substance could be gelatinous, it could be mucous, or it could be tissue paper or cotton wool. </p>

He was unsure whether or not this was due to GH suffering pain, but he soon stopped making the noise and he has had no difficulty with passing urine at any time in EF&#8217;s care.

They gave evidence that CD would frequently call on them to talk about GH&#8217;s medical condition. On a date that they could only identify as being in early September, but when GH was not that week attending school, they said that CD told one of them, in the hearing of the other, that GH had been producing kidney stones and had been taken by ambulance to hospital the previous night. She said that she had found 20 stones in the toilet bowl. The school records show that GH did not attend in the week beginning Monday 4 September, and did attend hospital on 4 and 8 September. He attended school on the 11 to 14 September inclusive, but not on 15 September. It is likely therefore that this conversation took place on the morning of 5 September 2023. </p>

She had a good knowledge of prescribed medication, investigations, and diagnoses, but she has fixated on certain things said to her, elevating them to a level of importance that they were not intended to have, whilst disregarding or forgetting other advice that <span style="font-style:italic">was i</span>mportant. For example, someone may have said to her that she could monitor GH&#8217;s temperature or even his oxygen saturation if she was concerned, but she has interpreted that as an instruction to do so over a prolonged period, even for it to be done when GH was at school. But when given important advice that there was no serious condition underlying GH&#8217;s constipation, she has effectively disregarded it and has maintained the view that doctors have simply not got to grips with GH&#8217;s condition and are missing something serious. She told me that she has felt &#8220;fobbed off&#8221; by doctors. She has not been satisfied by reassurance and she has latched on to any hints of a sinister underlying illness. I have no evidence that CD has adopted this approach out of malice or with intent to cause GH harm. It is true that she did occasionally express the view that professionals were out to do her down, but I do not believe that she has been driven by animosity to others. Rather, her anxieties and rigid thinking have led her to focus on passing comments that she has taken as suggesting that GH might have a serious condition, whilst ignoring clear and direct reassurances that he does not. I am sure that this tendency is due in large part to her learning disability and autism spectrum disorder.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fluid balance charts appear to be meticulously completed but CD described to me that she would complete the times at the beginning of each day. Hence the times when GH is recorded to have drunk some fluid or to have passed urine, are usually only accurate to the nearest hour. Furthermore, in her oral evidence CD accepted that she had completed entries for at least three days, 11 to 13 September 2023, when GH had been at school between about 0900 and 1530 hours. So, it seems, had EF on 11 September 2023 when the handwriting appears to be his for most of the entries. CD explained that GH would come home from school and tell her what he had drunk so that she could complete entries on the record sheet. It is fair to note that there is perhaps only one entry for an amount of fluid passed as urine that clearly falls within school hours, and that may be an error in completing the form, but the entries for fluid input during school hours are clearly unreliable.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst allowances must be made for error and confusion due to CD&#8217;s learning disability, there were other aspects of CD&#8217;s evidence that went to her honesty rather than to her level of cognitive functioning. CD&#8217;s evidence at court was that only once had she seen a stone within or emerging from GH&#8217;s penis. On that occasion it had been a large stone and she had &#8220;teased it out&#8221; with her fingers. At all other times she had either heard a stone fall into the jug he was using or seen stones in the jug or seen something in a toilet bowl. She maintained that on many occasions when GH had seemingly passed a stone, he had had no opportunity to access the garden or any plants in the house which might have gravel or stones within their pots. Parts of her evidence on these matters went to her honesty and credibility:</p>

For example, when asked why, on her evidence to the court, she had never once stood by GH and watched him urinate to see whether he passed a stone given her heightened anxiety about the number of stones he was producing, she said that he had not allowed her to stand and watch him. This was not something she had put in any of her witness statements. Likewise she began to tell me of a clinician who had seen blood in a urine sample but had then simply thrown the sample away. This was new evidence apparently given off the cuff.</p>

Now she states this happened only once. In her oral evidence she settled upon the night of the 17 September 2023 for this memorable event, but in her written witness evidence she gives an account of this happening on 4 September 2023. Even allowing for confusion as to the date, it is difficult to accept that CD is confused about whether this happened once, as she now says, or more than once, as she reported at the time to healthcare professionals. </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">CD&#8217;s reports of symptoms suffered by GH attributable to passing kidney stones are inconsistent with the physiological process. As Dr Coulthard has advised (see below) the process of passing a stone from the kidney to the bladder is well known to be excruciatingly painful. Most patients never pass the stone from bladder to urethra because the pain of the movement of a stone to the bladder is so great that they attend for emergency treatment, the stone is identified, and treatment is given such that the stone is never passed down the urethra. CD repeatedly reported that GH suffered abdominal pain on urinating when passing stones out of his penis. She did not report evidence of excruciating pain when not urinating or passing a stone from the penis. Also the pain on passing a stone through the penile urethra would not be abdominal but would be in the affected area. CD&#8217;s reports are consistent with her imagining incorrectly, what the symptoms would be on passing a stone, rather than reporting genuinely what symptoms GH was exhibiting.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">On occasions too numerous to list, CD made a claim in her oral evidence that was flatly contradicted by contemporaneous evidence in the medical records or the witness evidence of others. When the conflict was pointed out to her, she said that the notes were wrong. These included the detailed evidence of Dr V, the evidence of the administrative staff at GH&#8217;s school, and medical records completed by Dr L. The inconsistencies between their evidence and notes, and the evidence of CD, were stark and cannot be glossed over as minor differences in recollection or confusion on the part of CD. For example, she told me that she had not taken GH to hospital on 16 September notwithstanding that on her evidence he had produced eight stones, because he was otherwise well, whereas the medical notes record her report on arrival at hospital on 17 September 2023 that GH had been ill all weekend. </p>

For example, she denied that she had gone into GH&#8217;s school in September to speak to the administrative staff which, if so, would mean that they had both concocted their evidence of that event. Then, CD denied having told the staff that she had seen 20 stones in the toilet bowl on one day but was referring to 20 stones over a period of a few weeks. So, she denied any such conversation but then corrected their evidence about a part of that supposedly non-existent conversation.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Coulthard provided written evidence but was able to consider further evidence about the stones presented by CD as having been produced by GH before giving his very careful and well-informed oral evidence. He was very clear indeed that GH had not ever produced a single kidney stone. GH does not have a condition such as oxalosis which can give rise to production of stones in children. The stones were of different colours. Some were plainly too large to have been passed through a child&#8217;s penile urethra, or indeed from the kidney to the bladder. He described how excruciatingly painful is the passage of a stone from the kidney to the bladder along the ureter. Most children and adults present at an A&amp;E department at that stage, their stone is identified and it is treated so that it never leaves the bladder to pass through the urethra and then exit the body naturally. He could not conceive of the possibility of GH passing a stone of more than 5mm diameter and that would be extremely painful to pass and would cause some physical trauma. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Coulthard told the court that in his years of practice he had been involved with one 12 year old child who &#8220;faked&#8221; the passage of stones on one occasion by using gravel she had taken from a plant pot within the bathroom at her home. Members of her family had been having kidney stones. There was no repeat of the incident. He rightly raised this case to demonstrate that children can do surprising things and that faking the passage of kidney stone cannot be said to be impossible. He properly accepted that if the court were to accept that the stones presented by CD had not been emitted naturally by GH then it was for the court to determine how they had come to be presented at hospital as having been passed by him.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the summer of 2023 GH was urinating into a plastic jug so that CD could measure his urinary output in order to complete the fluid balance charts she had copied and which she thought important to complete. If he was not emitting stones into the jug for CD to put into pots and present to healthcare professionals, the question arises as to where the stones came from. Having considered the evidence carefully, I have no doubt at all that CD put the stones into the pots herself. The main reasons for reaching that conclusion are:</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">It is highly unlikely that GH himself pretended to have passed the stones from his penis. CD herself did not suggest that GH put the stones in the jug. Mr Pike on behalf of CD put the best case he could that GH may have placed the stones in jugs and toilets himself, but that case is not at all credible. The burden of proof remains on the Local Authority &#8211; CD does not have to establish that GH was responsible. However, I am quite satisfied that GH was not the agent for putting stones in jugs or pots. Firstly, the evidence before me was that no-one had discussed the notion of kidney stones with him before he &#8220;produced&#8221; the first stone. CD told me that she had not discussed with him her own anxieties about producing kidney stones. As a 6 year old boy he would have had no notion of how the kidneys can produce stones which can then pass through the bladder into the penile urethra. Secondly, he would have had no motive to fake the passage of stones. Thirdly, for him to have been responsible he must have put stones in the plastic jug over a period of at least four weeks and then, as unaccountably as he had started, stopped as soon as he was placed in the care of his father. Fourthly, he would have carried out this campaign of deception wholly undetected by his mother or maternal grandmother even though they were sometimes in close proximity to him when stones were found in the jug. On one occasion he was naked in the bath when, according to both his mother and maternal grandmother, he passed a stone into the jug. How could he have achieved that deception? Finally, CD said that on a number of occasions when GH apparently passed a stone, he had not had access to any stones in the garden or otherwise.</p>

She told healthcare professionals that she had seen this more than once. Even if it was on only one occasion, if the account from CD is true then, given that the stone was not emitted from the penile urethra, either the stone must have been pushed into the penis opening or the event never occurred and CD has fabricated it. I find it to be highly unlikely that GH pushed a stone into his own penis such that it became wedged inside. Accordingly, I am quite satisfied that CD&#8217;s account is untrue. I am fortified in this conclusion because (a) CD has variously said that the stone was large and that it was only a piece of grit; (b) that this happened once and that it happened more than once; (c) that the one time it happened was on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, and that it was on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September.

I make full allowance for her learning disability but cannot avoid the conclusion that the core of CD&#8217;s evidence about the kidney stones is untrue. There would be a thread of consistency running through her evidence had she been telling the truth, but that thread is wholly absent.</p>

I acknowledge that submission, but find that CD&#8217;s fabrication in respect of GH passing kidney stones fits with an escalation in her attempts to attract medical attention for him. I bear in mind the RCPCH&#8217;s guidelines quoted above, and forms of parental behaviour that are alerting features of possible fabricated or induced illness. They include insistence on continued investigations instead of symptom alleviation when reported symptoms are not explained by any known medical condition or by the results of examinations or investigations, reporting new symptoms, repeated presentation at medical settings including emergency departments, seeking multiple medical opinions, and not being able to accept reassurance. All of those features apply to CD in the year or so before 20 September 2023. The chronology shows that CD pressed for further investigations of a possible bowel condition, including cancer and ulcerative colitis, and then for a possible underlying condition causing repeated fevers, but then when all possible investigations had been exhausted and she was effectively refused further investigations, new symptoms were reported, escalating to the reports of kidney stones.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Pike submitted that the fact that in her oral evidence CD did not take the opportunity to blame GH for having planted the stones in the jug, pointed to her honesty. She could have blamed GH to deflect from her own responsibility but she did not do so. There are a number of reasons why CD may not have sought to blame GH even if she herself had fabricated the evidence of kidney stone production, not least that her fabrication was not designed to harm him but to bring medical attention to him which she felt was needed. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">CD told me in her oral evidence that she felt she was being &#8220;fobbed off&#8221; by medical professionals. They were &#8220;hiding something&#8221;. I am sure that her reports of kidney stones were designed to initiate further investigations with a view to someone finding out what was wrong with GH. In fact there was nothing wrong with him save for some childhood illnesses and a problem with constipation. CD did not see it that way and wanted to prompt further medical attention and investigation, hence the false reports of kidney stones.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fixation with a belief that something is seriously wrong with GH has been a prominent motivation for CD&#8217;s behaviour and is one of the motivations for FII recognised by the RCPCH 2021 guidelines. The other recognised motivation &#8211; some sort of reward or gain for the parent &#8211; is also present in this case: CD enjoyed having some power over others by reason of GH&#8217;s supposed illnesses and the need to address them. She would give clear instructions to EF to take temperatures, keep records of fluid balance and so on. She would make similar requests at the school and enjoy talking to staff about her son&#8217;s condition and needs. </p>

In 2022 and 2023 he was never found to have a fever when in the care of others. The only evidence of fevers in that time is from reports by CD. GH is regarded as a well child at school and when in the care of his father.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have had to consider the role of GH&#8217;s maternal grandmother. I regret to conclude that she has also been dishonest with the court. I am sure that she has done so in order to support her daughter. At meetings with professionals which she has attended she has been a staunch supporter of her daughter even in the face of compelling evidence that GH was not ill and was not passing stones. In her statement to the court she said that the first time she was aware of stones being passed was when she was present at her daughter&#8217;s house. CD had had to help GH remove a stone from his penis. Two stones were passed and CD handed them in to the nurse at the GP practice. The records show that that occurred on 22 August 2023. That was not a date when CD said she had teased a stone from GH&#8217;s penis. CD said that she had been alone with GH when that happened.  The maternal grandmother then gives an account of GH passing a stone when in the bath with her and CD present. The clear medical evidence is that GH has never passed a stone. Although she does not claim to have seen it emerge from GH&#8217;s penis, her account is not consistent with GH having put it into the jug he was using or with CD having put a stone in the jug. Most clearly, the maternal grandmother has given unreliable evidence about events on 16 September 2023. She says in her statement that when GH was in her sole care and presence that day, he passed five stones. A record sheet was produced which records stones passed at 0600, 0700, 1000, 1100, 1600, 1700, and 1800 hours (two stones on the last occasion). CD&#8217;s evidence was that she recorded all but two of those stones. During the hearing text messages were produced after JK had given evidence, which showed that at 1730 hours that day CD texted her mother to say that GH had passed another two stones. Clearly GH was in her care at that time, not with his grandmother. And yet the maternal grandmother describes the colour and size of those stones in her statement. She cannot ever have seen those two stones.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After JK&#8217;s evidence had been given, a text from her was disclosed. It was dated 9 September 2023, written to CD, and referred to GH passing a stone. The maternal grandmother had not referred to this in any of her written or oral evidence. I accept that she may have thought on 9 September that GH had passed a stone but she cannot have been sure of what she had seen that day otherwise it would certainly have been included in her otherwise detailed statement.</p>

I see no requirement to make findings in relation to each and every one of the very many allegations set out in the Local Authority&#8217;s Schedule. I begin by addressing those allegations that relate to deliberate fabrication of illness, as opposed to misreporting or exaggeration due to misunderstanding or poor memory or which might be accountable by reference to CD&#8217;s learning disability and/or ASD. I stand back to consider all the evidence in this case. I bear in mind the burden and standard of proof and the legal principles set out above as they apply to findings of fact. This case has not been difficult to resolve &#8211; the evidence very clearly establishes the following findings (with the equivalent paragraph numbers as per the Local Authority&#8217;s Schedule). I have added some details to the allegations in the Schedule so that the findings can be precisely stated without reference to the multiple other allegations in the Schedule:</p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The conduct set out below arises from CD&#8217;s fixed beliefs that doctors had missed some serious underlying condition, and that she needed to be extremely vigilant to monitor GH&#8217;s condition, and from her inability to accept reassurance. I remind myself of Dr Mercow&#8217;s evidence that in the first two years of GH&#8217;s life the number of medical attendances could be attributed to excessive parental anxiety not FII. I am sure that anxiety  also explains some of CD&#8217;s conduct from January 2022 to August 2023 before the reports of kidney stones. I am not sure that there is a clear line between categorising over-presentation and a drive for unnecessary medical investigation as due to excessive anxiety or due to unconscious FII. For the purposes of making findings of fact I do not regard it as necessary to draw that line. My specific findings are:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find that as a result both of CD&#8217;s dishonest conduct and her misguided conduct as set out above, GH has undergone multiple unnecessary medical tests and investigations including the taking of blood samples which CD has told me he found particularly distressing, ultrasound scans, bowel studies and physical examinations. He has had avoidable periods of in-patient treatment and avoidable medication. He has missed time from school as a result of unnecessary monitoring and treatment. He has been encouraged to believe that he was a sick child. Furthermore I note that he had a bruised penis tip when examined on 4 September 2023. I cannot know the precise circumstances in which this occurred because, as I find, CD has not told me the truth about teasing out a stone from GH&#8217;s penis on that or any other day. It is possible however that CD pretended to GH that he had a stone coming out of his penis and she caused bruising when doing so. Finally, I also note that GH has given accounts of passing stones and of it hurting when he did so. Either he has simply picked up on the reports CD was making, or he has been told to say this, or he has come to believe that stones he has been shown by CD had indeed come from his penis. I do not make any finding as between these possible explanations, but they all point to further harm to GH arising out of CD&#8217;s dishonest fabrication of illness.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">CD and GH were alone on most occasions when stones were in the jug or put in the pots. I am sure that GH did not put the stones in the jug or pot, so it must have been CD. She cannot have got them from within GH&#8217;s urine because he did not pass the stones through his penis. So she must have got them from somewhere else such as a garden.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">CD&#8217;s evidence about finding stones stuck in GH&#8217;s penis has changed. She told doctors this had happened more than once. Now she says it happened only once. She has said it happened on 4 September now she says it was on 17 September.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am sure that the evidence of CD and her mother about charts completed on 16 September 2023 is untrue. GH&#8217;s maternal grandmother told me that she had completed only  two of the entries about stones on the fluid balance chart that day but her statement says that she was alone with GH when he passed five stones that day. In her witness statement she describes stones that she says were passed by GH when she was alone with him, but text messages and CD&#8217;s evidence show that GH was not with his grandmother when he passed the last three stones that day. So, his grandmother cannot have seen those stones and she could not have described them if she was telling the truth. I find that GH&#8217;s maternal grandmother has not told the truth about seeing some of those stones. She has tried to support CD instead of telling the truth. I cannot rely on the charts themselves. I do not accept that they contain reliable information.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At other times JK may have thought she saw a stone, for example on 9 September 2023. She texted CD that day to say GH had passed a stone. But she did not mention that in her statement or at court. She would have said so had she thought that this was really a stone. I do not believe she did in fact see a stone on 9 September 2023.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At other times, between early 2022 and early 2023, CD has told doctors that at home GH has had high temperatures but when he was in hospital his temperature was always normal. Her thermometer may have been recording a higher temperature than the hospital thermometers but it was tested and did not record temperatures that were very much higher. The thermometer CD used cannot be the explanation for why CD was reporting such high temperatures.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am also sure that CD has exaggerated GH&#8217;s tummy pain due to constipation and this has resulted in many more hospital attendances than he needed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgement, CD&#8217;s exaggerations of GH&#8217;s illnesses and symptoms have not been due to any bad intentions. She has been over anxious and has had ideas stuck in her mind that doctors are missing a serious illness. In fact, when she made up stories about GH passing kidney stones, I do not think she did so because she wanted to cause him harm or because of any bad intentions. I find that she made up stories about the kidney stones to get attention for GH, because she still thought there was something seriously wrong with him that doctors were missing, and to get attention for herself as a concerned mother. She did not want to harm GH when reporting kidney stones, but she was being dishonest.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So, my decision is that CD has lied about GH producing kidney stones. She has handed over to doctors some stones which she knew GH had not passed in his urine. She told doctors that he had passed them in his urine. She knew that was not true.  She has exaggerated GH&#8217;s symptoms of fever, high temperature, and night sweats and tummy pain. That exaggeration was due to her fixed beliefs due to her learning disability and autism. But the lying about the kidney stones is not due to her learning disability and autism. GH has suffered harm as a result of the exaggeration and the lying.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That is my decision. It is set out in full in a detailed judgment in writing. I will now have to decide how this decision affects how GH should be cared for in the future. That will need more evidence and more court hearings.</p>
