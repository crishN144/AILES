The judge gives permission for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of this judgment the anonymity of the children and members of their family must be strictly preserved. If the judgment is to be reported or published, there is a requirement to ensure that no reporting restriction will be breached. This is particularly important in relation to any case involving a sexual offence, where the victim is guaranteed lifetime anonymity (Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992), or where an order has been made in relation to a young person. All persons, including representatives of the media and legal bloggers must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so may be a contempt of court.</span></p>

The purpose of this judgment is not for there to be a public flogging of the individuals concerned.  It is so there is a proper objective record of what has happened.  This judgment should be placed on the child&#8217;s file and anyone dealing with this matter in the future should carefully consider this judgment to have a clear understanding of what has happened.  This judgment is also for the Local Authority and the Welsh police force to have a clear and complete picture of matters so that lessons can be learned, and mistakes of this nature can be avoided in the future.</span></p>

They accept that &#8216;learning has taken place as a result of the matters raised in these proceedings and processes will be implemented&#8217;.  However, the position statement does not go very far and other than a bald assertion that lessons have been learnt it provides no further information.  It is largely a repetition or chronology of what has happened.  The concerns arising from the evidence I heard in January have not been fully ameliorated.  In submissions Miss Knight accepted that there had been failings in terms of the disclosure.  She said that the Police acknowledge that processes in place have not been followed; that there was a lack of communication between them and the Local Authority and that for some aspects there were no processes in place and lessons have been learnt.  She said that a training package is being put together to assist officers in understanding the Family Court process.</span></p>

They  marvel that the  Grandparents were strong and managed to do what they did for them all when placed under such terrible stress.  They feel that the grandfather values honesty, the grandmother is nurturing, protective and understanding.  As a teenager they  described themselves  as a bit of an arsehole and felt they  did go off the rails for a while.  However, she always felt she could talk to the Grandparents and despite this difficult period in their life, they stood by them , continued to parent them  and did their best to keep them  safe&#8221;. </span></p>

The analysis of Miss Heyworth KC in February is entirely correct.  Based on that analysis I am entirely satisfied that there is no prospect of proving the allegations to the civil standard and that the Local Authority should be given permission to withdraw their application for a care order.  It is of the utmost concern that this exercise was not carried out by the Local Authority sooner.  This exercise was not undertaken until directed by the court following the defective fact find in January 2024.  As Miss Hughes KC submitted the local authority has an on-going duty to ensure that any interference with a family&#8217;s rights continues to be necessary and proportionate.  That duty is fundamental to the process of justice.  It is clear when one considers the chronology that the Local Authority have not complied with this duty.  Had they done so the proceedings may well have been withdrawn many months before.  Most of the information used by the Local Authority to rationalise its decision to withdraw was or should have been available to the Local Authority many months ago.</span></p>

She submitted that the allegations relate to abuse alleged to have occurred in the early 1980&#8217;s, over 40 years ago.  There is no other evidence of inappropriate sexual behaviour and no evidence that the child has been subjected to inappropriate sexual boundaries or exhibited any sexualised behaviour.

There was no evidence of or analysis of propensity.  That point was made by the Guardian in her final analysis who confirmed she did not see this as a two-option case but rather even if findings were made then the next stage ought to be a risk assessment to consider whether findings of sexual abuse against a female child some 35 &#8211; 40 years ago translated into a direct risk to the child.

This was the extent of the risk assessment and balance of harm exercise that it was incumbent upon the Local Authority to carry out when considering whether the child should be removed.  The decision was made to remove the child  without the benefit of legal advice; without any real consideration of the impact on the child ; without an analysis of his specific needs and risks that would arise from his removal; without consideration of the immediacy of any alleged risk and whether the Court should be involved; without any mention of the previous allegation and what, if any, impact that would have on the risk analysis.  All of these things should have considered fully before reaching a decision that removal was necessary and proportionate. I fully agree with the submission that the risk assessment was wholly defective.</span></p>

The grandfather  said the police got them out of bed last night saying an allegation has been made and they know nothing else.  The identified safeguarding adult  was asked to supervise them and social services would be out 9am in the morning.  He said they waited in all day and nothing and the identified safeguarding adult  got sick of it and said he was off to work as he was losing money.  I explained to the grandfather  that I didn&#8217;t know the exact details of the allegation but it was important that the identified safeguarding adult remained with them today, the grandfather said its tough he&#8217;s in work and we are in MacDonalds. I said to the grandfather  social services will be out today they are trying to get hold of him and the grandmother, I passed the social worker&#8217;s  mobile onto them for them to ring.  The grandfather  said this is the complainant  this is we had a falling out weeks ago and she is nasty cow.  Soon as we say no to money that&#8217;s it, her and the grandchild  all about money.  Few weeks ago they  tried telling us how to deal with the child , how can they  do that when they didn&#8217;t even bring up their  own we brought them up.  I told them  straight get out and don&#8217;t come back.  I asked grandfather l to leave the call and ring the duty number so arrangements could be made and he said he would. I informed the social worker  that they were alone with the child and the identified adult  was at work.&#8221; </span></p>

The content of this call also provided some context to events.  The grandfather was clearly under the impression that the complainant was involved.  He said that there had been a falling out recently.  This should have led the Local Authority to reflect once again on the context of previous allegations that had been withdrawn.  There does not appear to have been any attempt to consider matters or to try and obtain further information from their own records to contextualise matters.</span></p>

The Local Authority had pre-empted this by making prior arrangements for the police to attend and exercise their powers of protection.  That was used by the social workers on scene as a threat to try and secure consent.  It was an entirely inappropriate way of seeking consent and entirely against all of the authorities.  It was inappropriate and as the Guardian says appallingly managed contrary to the basic principles of fair and open justice and deeply harmful to the child .</span></p>

The Head of Service  in fact positively maintains that the decision to remove was correct.  Such a position seems contrary to the acceptance in the statement that at the point of initial contact in August there was no action taken to consider the records and what that information might mean in terms of the assessed risk of significant harm to the child , and the proportionality of any action required to safeguard him whilst investigations were ongoing.  </span></p>

I appreciate that when referrals are received matters are often fast moving and decisions have to be made with incomplete evidence.  However, from the outset the Local Authority knew allegations had been made previously by the complainant.  They had assessed the grandparents positively in the knowledge of those allegations.  It seems they made no effort to retrieve their own documents to consider matters.  They knew the child had significant needs and that there was no criticism of the care provided to him in the years that he had lived with the grandparents.  They knew that the police investigation was likely to take months.  From the records there is a complete absence of proper risk assessment.  There was no consideration of the balance of harm in removing the child.  There was no consultation with the grandparents; no consideration of any safeguards that could be put in place and no consideration of alternative carers.  These should be some of the main tenets of a decision to justify such a sharp interference with family life.  This judgment should go to the Head of Service for further consideration in the hope that such fundamental errors will not be repeated in the future.</span></p>

Failure to do this was compounded by the decision to not issue proceedings for over 7 months.  7 months during which time the child was denied a Guardian and a voice and denied court oversight where there would have been a requirement for proper evidence and a scrutiny of plans and the process.  </span></p>

Again, this did not prompt the Local Authority to consider its own historical records.  They were entirely reliant on the police investigation and seemed to have made no assessment of the available evidence themselves.  The social worker said that she was unaware as to whether the allegations had been investigated previously.  The Team Manager said that the Local Authority had to a responsibility when new allegations are raised.  Whilst correct this entirely misses the point being made by the grandparents from August 2022 that these were not new allegations.  They had been made previously and retracted.  This is 11 weeks after the child had been removed.  The Local Authority had been aware since the very beginning that the complainant had made allegations previously.  It is apparent that no attempts had been made to consider their own records.  I agree with Miss Jones that to have removed the child and not undertake the most basic enquiry of records which were in the Local Authority&#8217;s own control is simply negligent and prevented there ever being a proper evaluation of risk and welfare.  </span></p>

At that meeting the Local Authority said that it had received information from the police that they were unable to share details of the allegations due to the risk of prejudicing the investigation.  As Miss Jones submits, at this meeting matters took a deeply unfortunate turn as the social work team raised: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;the deterioration of the child&#8217;s condition and the Grandparents health; how they would care for him late into their 80&#8217;s and with his health too.  It is hard to see a future without re-assessing.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">   In her statement, the Head of Service said, it was agreed that 8 weeks would be required for an updating assessment and that it would be beneficial for the assessment to be completed prior to any application to issue.  She now acknowledges that this thinking was flawed because, regardless of any concerns in respect the grandparents  continued ability to care for the child , there was still the key matter of the historic sexual abuse allegations that needed to be resolved.  In my judgment, the thinking was more than just flawed.  It was entirely inappropriate.  Prior to August 2022 there were no concerns regarding the care being provided.  All reports were that the grandparents  were providing a high level of care and meeting all child&#8217;s  needs with no consideration as to how the assessment was ever going to be able to properly and fairly conclude without a factual matrix regarding the allegations being determined.  This decision and approach continued to pervade Local Authority thinking for a significant period of time.  It was in fact issues with this assessment that led to the proceedings eventually being issued.  It was such an issue for the Local Authority that threshold for a long time included a finding in relation to the Grandparents&#8217; health.  This finding was only removed after a strong indication from the Court that it was not appropriate and not relevant to threshold.</span></p>

As at the relevant date, being the date of removal, the evidence from the Local Authority&#8217;s own employees was that the child was &#8216;thriving&#8217; and reports were &#8216;glowing&#8217;.  There was not an iota of evidence to underpin a pleading that the Grandparents couldn&#8217;t meet the child&#8217;s  needs as at the relevant date.  The health issues were exactly the same faced by the grandparents  when they were positively assessed as Special Guardians.  They had shown an excellent ability to care for the child  and meet his needs throughout the time he was placed with them.  This was raised at the hearing on in  September 2023 and specifically recorded on the face of the order dated in  October 2023.  It was not until December 2023 order that the Local Authority accepted it would not be pursuing health matters in threshold.  This was not far off a year to the day since the matter had first been raised (December 2022 PLO meeting).  For that year the grandparents  had the unnecessary and immeasurable upset and worry that even if the allegations made by the complainant  were not proved the child  may still not return to their care due to other reasons.  I agree with Ms Reed KC that the inclusion of health in threshold is a further clear indicator of a failure in analysis and apparently a failure to appreciate how threshold works and why it exists.  </span></p>

The order of 12 May 2023 provided for an assessment plan in respect of the grandparents by 26  May 2023 and an assessment of them by 11 July 2023.  For some reason that assessment took the form of a Connected Persons and concluded that irrespective of the outcome of the criminal investigation the grandparents  should not be approved as connected persons foster carers for the child .  This assessment entirely missed the point that the grandparents  were the primary carers and Special Guardians for the child.  They held enduring overriding parental responsibility.  Absent the issues arising from the allegations of the complainant there was absolutely no legal basis for state intervention in this family and no basis for the child  to be removed from their care.  </span></p>

It was at this meeting that a decision was made to issue proceedings by April 2023.  This meeting was over six months after the child had been removed from the care of the grandparents.  The Local Authority were no further forward in terms of obtaining information about the police investigation.  There had been no apparent attempt to retrieve documents to consider the previous allegations.  It appears that the main rationale for issuing was the ongoing concern in respect of the grandparents&#8217; engagement.  The entirety of this important meeting was redacted when it was eventually disclosed and only after a specific request was the redaction removed.

The manner in which it was obtained and the manner in which it was then used was contrary to the authorities and guidance.   This case doesn&#8217;t fall into any of the categories of appropriate use of section 76 identified by either the PLWG or the Court of Appeal.  It should not have taken the grandparents withdrawing section 76 consent for the Local Authority to see that.  The purpose of section 76 is not to allow the Local Authority to accommodate a child without a plan until forced to issue.  The Local Authority missed multiple opportunities to issue proceedings to allow the Court to have oversight of what was happening.  The Head of Service said that the grandparents could have withdrawn their consent.  Whilst that is correct it is clear from the records that they mentioned withdrawing on a number of occasions but were always persuaded to continue for another period whilst information was being sought from the police.  They could have withdrawn which would have forced the hand of the Local Authority to return the child to their care or to issue.  The child did not have this option available to him.  He was removed from his carers by the police in distressing circumstances.  Less than a week later he was moved yet again.  He had no voice in this process and as Miss Jones submits his rights were trampled over roughshod.</span></p>

The case summary went on that the Local Authority had obtained the digital records but that upon consideration of the same it was clear that various documents were missing and that 2 files from secure storage had been requested which would take 2 weeks to consider.  At the hearing I was informed that the historical records had now been retrieved (including a risk assessment from the late 1990&#8217;s) and could be disclosed in 2 weeks.  The order from that hearing extended the time for disclosure of the 2018 and 2020 proceedings and the historical records (to include the late 1990&#8217;s  risk assessment) to October 2023.

It was from looking at these recordings that it became apparent that there was likely to be information held elsewhere.  The Local Authority solicitor therefore searched the Local Authority&#8217;s archived records.  The Local Authority solicitor had to identify where the files were stored and physically retrieve the same.  This is where the late 1990&#8217;s  risk assessment was located.  The Local Authority solicitor  checked whether any other documents relating to the allegations had been archived but only the risk assessment was present.  The Local Authority solicitor also looked through the bundle to see whether there was any additional information relating to the allegations and there was not.

The Local Authority argued that there was no probative value in permitting the full disclosure of the historical documents. The issue had to be dealt with on submissions.  Junior Counsel for the grandparents submitted that allegations had been made in the course and context of care proceedings in respect of the complainant&#8217;s children and therefore of course any documents in the proceedings relating to those children and any social services records would be relevant in this case.  I agreed with that submission and ordered disclosure.  The Local Authority argued that the parties to those proceedings needed to consent to the disclosure.  A number of directions were made to the Local Authority to place those parties on notice of the intention to disclose the documents from the proceedings in the late 1990&#8217;s and the subsequent discharge proceedings into these proceedings.  I was clear that the Local Authority would need to bring the matter back immediately before the Court, in the event that there was any difficulty or delay in seeking the consent of those parties to the disclosure. </span></p>

The Local Authority were fully aware of these issues and had been since the date of the notification in August 2022.  I am drawn to the inescapable conclusion that in the 7 months before issuing proceedings the Local Authority had not properly considered its own records as to what had happened historically.  Nearly all of the evidence that the Local Authority considered in February 2024 in making its withdrawal decision was available to them from the outset.  They placed inordinate reliance on the police investigation without conducting their own analysis of matters.  Not only had they not considered the material from the late 1990&#8217;s, they had also not properly considered the material from 2018 and 2020.  Failure to do so is, in my judgment inexcusable.  The application in April 2023 was not an emergency application yet there was nothing to alert the Court or other parties as a result of the Local Authority failing to undertake even the most rudimentary of checks of its own records.  </span></p>

It is unclear when this document had been located as it was referred to by the fostering panel as long ago as 1 August 2023.  Again, it is unclear why it was not raised and disclosed by the Local Authority at that point.  When the Local Authority belatedly complied with the order for disclosure they only disclosed 23 pages parts of which were inappropriately redacted.  I say that the redaction was inappropriate as unredacted copies were provided following the hearing on 6 December 2023.  The unredacted copies revealed information that was clearly of relevance to the allegations that had been made by the complainant in the late 1990&#8217;s and 2022 and should never have been redacted in the first place.  The Local Authority maintained up to and including the hearing on 9 January 2024 that this 23 pages represented all of the relevant material.  It is now clear that this was not accurate.  I ordered the Local Authority to bring all of their files to Court on 15 January 2024 when it became apparent that they were significantly more documents that should have been disclosed.

It was only on receipt of these papers that it immediately became apparent that the grandparents, unbeknown to all, were actually parties to the late 1990&#8217;s  proceedings, and therefore entitled to copy documents regardless of the consent of other parties.

Thereafter, inconsistent and contrary plans were put forward.  This was exacerbated by suggestions of unplanned withdrawal of section 76 consent to force the hand of the Local Authority.

Those allegations raised a legitimate safeguarding obligation, but the Local Authority still had a duty to discharge that obligation fairly and responsibly.  The making of an allegation does not automatically mean that the child would not be safe in the care of the grandparents.  It was incumbent upon the Local Authority at all stages to assess the evidential basis for their threshold; the risks that arise and the proportionality of their actions.
