	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This is an appeal brought by the Official Solicitor (&#8220;OS&#8221;) on behalf of NG against the decision of HHJ Vavrecka (&#8220;the Judge&#8221;) dated 24 July 2020. The issue in the appeal is whether NG&#8217;s mother, the Second Respondent AG, and NG&#8217;s step-father, the Fourth Respondent NDG, have a reasonable excuse to leave their homes to provide care to NG, pursuant to regulation 6(2)(d) of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 (&#8220;the first restrictions Regulations&#8221;). </p>

His ability to communicate is severely impaired and he is considered to be vulnerable to the influence of others. It is not disputed that NG lacks capacity to conduct proceedings in respect of decisions as to his residence, care arrangements and contact with NDG and AG. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There have been proceedings since 2017 relating to contact between NG and NDG involving very considerable dispute between AG and NDG. There was a long period when NDG was not having contact with NG. The dispute came before HHJ Waller in June 2018 and he gave judgment on 6 July 2018. The specific matter before HHJ Waller was NDG&#8217;s application to have contact with NG. Throughout HHJ Waller&#8217;s judgment there are references to &#8220;contact&#8221; between NDG and NG rather than to the care that was being provided by NDG by NG. Mr Chowdhury, for the Local Authority, places considerable reliance on these passages to support his argument that the parents were having contact with NG but were not providing a &#8220;shared care&#8221; package to him. </p>

In short, one of the two households had to be a single-person household, and the adult members of the other household (which could comprise any number of adults and children) each had to agree.  Once you formed a linked household, and then ceased to be a linked household, you could not form another linked household.

Hertfordshire (the area where NG, NDG and AG live) was placed in tier 1.  There was no restriction on movement but there were restrictions on gatherings of more than six people.  Tier 2 and tier 3 contained greater restrictions on gatherings.  In Tier 2, no gathering could take place indoors which consist of two or more people (see paragraphs 1 of Schedule 1), and no gathering could take place outdoors of more than six people (see paragraph 2 of Schedule 1).  In Tier 3, the same basic restrictions applied as in Tier 2.

The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (All Tiers) (England) Regulations 2020 (SI/2020:1374) (&#8220;the All Tiers Regulations&#8221;) were published.  Hertfordshire was placed in Tier 2 (High).  The restrictions on gatherings to be imposed were identical to those which were imposed under the tier system previously (see paragraph 21 above).  The restrictions were subject to exceptions in relation to linked households and to the provision of care or assistance.  The latter exception was widened to include care or assistance to a vulnerable person and a person who has a disability.  The latter person is not expressly defined in the legislation.   The Secretary of State is under an obligation to review the need for the restrictions once every 28 days and the tier which each area should be placed in once every 14 days (see regulation 14(1)).  It can be seen that this case continues to be relevant because the &#8220;care&#8221; exception in the first restrictions Regulations remains extant.  </p>

The principal issue before HHJ Waller, as he records at [2], was NG&#8217;s contact with NDG. The dispute was that there had been a complete breakdown in the relationship between AG and NDG and AG submitted that NG did not wish to have contact with NDG and it was not in his best interests to do so. There are a large number of references in HHJ Waller&#8217;s judgment, which both HHJ Vavrecka and now Mr Chowdhury rely on, which refer to the issue of &#8220;contact&#8221; between NDG and NG. However, in my view it is important to appreciate that it was always the intention that when NDG (or indeed AG) had contact with NG they would provide him with care at the same time as contact. NG requires 24/7 care including encouraging him to eat and helping him with personal care. The use of the word &#8220;contact&#8221; in HHJ Waller&#8217;s judgment therefore must be read in this context.  </p>

Although the annex to the judgment dated 11 July 2019 (K2934) clarified the terms of the order and that NG &#8216;should be transferred to NDG&#8217;s full care and responsibility&#8217;, in my view there is nothing in the annex or the wording of this additional paragraph that in any way alters the framework of the time NG spends with NDG being described as contact. </span></p>

I do not accept the suggestion that the care package always included an element of family care as well as professional care. NDG describes it as &#8216;an integrated care package&#8217;. That does not accord with Judge Waller&#8217;s entire approach and judgment. The fact that the LA has commissioned a 24/7 care package is relevant and the nature of NG&#8217;s care package makes clear it is not a &#8216;shared care package&#8217; rather that there is a care package and that the family have contact. </span></p>

In describing it as contact, I do not intend to diminish its significance for NG, but it does distinguish the arrangement from the care package which was otherwise in place to meet NG&#8217;s 24/7 needs. I am also aware of the NHS guidance and the key importance of family links and continued visits for people with autism. This does not however alter my interpretation. The description that NDG has put to the court regarding the nature of what he sees as an &#8216;integrated care arrangement&#8217; is not reflected in the judgment of HHJ Waller or the actual provision of the current care package as set out in the evidence of HG.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The OS submits that the Judge erred in law in three regards. Firstly, that his finding that NG was not receiving &#8220;shared care&#8221; and that Judge Waller&#8217;s order was concerned with contact and not care is plainly wrong. Secondly, that the Judge&#8217;s interpretation of regulation 6(2)(b) was incorrect because it incorporated a test that the provision of care must be &#8220;essential&#8221; (see J152) and it gave a priority to paid care over unpaid family care. Thirdly, that HG was wrong in saying that the test was whether HG&#8217;s approach was reasonable, this being a matter of the interpretation of the regulation and not rationality. Mr Patel accepted in the course of the hearing that the third ground added nothing, because if HG&#8217;s interpretation of the regulation was wrong, he would succeed on ground two. It is therefore not necessary to consider the third ground any further.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In support of the first ground, Mr Patel points out that on average NG&#8217;s parents provide three out of seven days care to him, including NG spending three overnight periods with either AG or NDG. The distribution of time is somewhat complicated, but the three days out of seven is the evened out position. When NG spends time with his parents, they provide him with all his care needs and those care needs are and were extensive. At no time prior to the March 2020 lockdown was NG provided with a 24/7 paid care by the local authority. Up until August 2019, and the appointment of HG, arrangements for care were made by AG on the basis of direct payments from the local authority to her. This arrangement broke down because HHJ Waller concluded that AG was using her role to impede contact between NG and NDG, not because the care was not being provided by family members. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The nature of the arrangements and the provision of care by his parents is made clear in the report of the independent social worker which was before HHJ Waller. That report recommends a move from AG organising the care, and the parents being the primary carers, to Home Instead being the organiser of the care and the primary provider. However, it is clear in the report that the intention is that the parents continue to provide care during the times when NG is with them, either in his home or theirs. There is therefore a distinction between the organisation of the care, which shifted to Home Instead and HG, and the provision of the care at different times either from paid carers or the parents. Mr Patel submits that it is important to look at the substance of the arrangements and not the label that HHJ Waller was using.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On the second ground, Mr Patel submits that regulation 6 should be interpreted on its clear language, particularly as it creates a criminal liability. There is no requirement in the regulation for the care being provided to be &#8220;essential&#8221; and for there to be no prospect of the potential provision of paid care instead of family care. He says that the &#8220;need&#8221; identified in the opening words of regulation 6 must focus on the needs of the provider of the care, i.e. the person who is seeking to leave their home. If, as here, the person providing the care is doing so pursuant to a court order where the court has found it is in the vulnerable adult&#8217;s best interests for that care to be provided, then that is the end of the matter. Such care is plainly the provision of care which falls within the terms of regulation 6(2)(d).  </p>

He relies heavily on the terms of HHJ Waller&#8217;s judgment and the consistent references to NDG having &#8220;contact&#8221; with NG. The terms of that judgment, particularly [133]-[143], is he suggests a complete answer to the case. The purpose and nature of the order that followed the judgment was to make provision for contact and not for care. Had the court been minded to make an order for care and contact, i.e. a shared care order, then it would have said so.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On ground two, Mr Chowdhury starts with the context in which the first restrictions Regulations were made and the very great importance of preventing the mixing of households to stop the spread of Covid-19. He relies on what was said in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Dolan</span> about that context and the mischief that the first restrictions Regulations were seeking to combat. He argues that the &#8220;need&#8221; in regulation 6(2) when read in the context of regulation 6(2)(d) must amount to a &#8220;necessity&#8221;, and that in regulation 6(2)(d) the provision of care has to be for &#8220;essential&#8221; care. He also disagrees with Mr Patel by arguing that the focus of the question must be on NG&#8217;s subjective needs. Therefore, if the care could and would be provided by someone else, i.e. the paid carers, then there was no need for NDG or AG to provide care within the meaning of regulation 6(2)(d). Here, NG did not need his parents to provide the care because from late March 2020 full time paid care had been put in place.  </p>

NDG and AG are beyond any doubt providing care to NG when they are spending time with him. At those times, which amount to approximately three out of seven days per week, they are his sole carers. NG requires 24/7 care by reason of his disability and at the times the parents are having contact with him, the care he needs is being provided by his parents and not by paid carers. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Both the Local Authority and the Judge have placed undue weight on the language of the judgment and order of HHJ Waller without properly considering the nature of the dispute that was in issue. The dispute at that time was about what contact NDG would have with NG and whether AG was acting to prevent that contact. Therefore, the language, both of the judgment and the order focused on the word &#8220;contact&#8221; and on how such contact could be ensured and supported going forward. During the course of those proceedings the nature of the care that was being provided by the parents was simply not part of the dispute. It was both the intention of the order, and the factual position, that when the parents were exercising their contact rights under the order, they would also be providing sole care to NG. However, this did not need to be spelled out by Judge Waller because it was both obvious, but also not in dispute.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The factual position is that NG&#8217;s parents have been providing him with a significant part of his care throughout his life, and in particular since he became an adult. There is, so far as I am aware, no magic in the words &#8220;shared care&#8221;, it is merely a reflection of the reality of the care that is being provided. On the facts of NG&#8217;s case, there was undoubtedly shared care between that provided by Home Instead as paid care and that provided by his parents. When considering the issue in this case, the important matter is the actual provision of the care rather than who arranged and managed the provision of the care. Therefore, in my view, Mr Chowdhury&#8217;s reliance on those parts of the Independent Social Worker&#8217;s report where he refers to Home Instead managing the care is irrelevant to the issue in play before me.   </p>

However, the first restrictions Regulations make little sense if a hard edged objective test of necessity is to be applied to each one. There must be a &#8220;need&#8221;, and not simply a subjective &#8220;desire&#8221;, to undertake the activity in each limb or the restrictions in the first restrictions Regulations would become impossible to enforce. However, the Government has not chosen to use the word &#8220;essential&#8221; anywhere other than in relation to provisions in (a); and where a particularly high test is being required, such as in (i) and the access to &#8220;critical&#8221; public service, that is expressly stated.  </p>

The background to, and purpose of, the first restrictions Regulations is fully explained in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Dolan</span>. There can be no possible doubt that in enacting the first restrictions Regulations the Government was placing a very great emphasis on the importance of people staying at home and not mixing unnecessarily and without very good reason. However, it is equally clear that the Government intended to ensure that those who needed to leave their home to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person should be allowed to do so. In this context it is important to have in mind that there are an enormous number of family carers providing care to persons outside their household. It is essential that care can continue to be provided throughout the course of the pandemic. The fact that it would be theoretically possible, or indeed practically possible, for that unpaid family care to be replaced by paid care does not mean that the family care is not meeting a need.  </p>

His physical needs can be met by 24/7 paid care, but his emotional needs and best interests are met by having a mix of family and paid care. It is wrong in my view to focus simply on the fact that his physical needs can be met by paid care. As NDG and the OS submitted, NG&#8217;s best interests must be relevant to meeting his needs and those best interests include being cared for, at times, by his parents.  </p>

A ban on family members being able to provide care to loved ones, in any circumstances where paid care is available, would be a very serious interference with the right to family life. That does not mean that such an interference would be incapable of justification, but it does in my view mean that a court should be very careful before reaching an interpretation which would give such precedence to paid over family care. There is nothing in the first restrictions Regulations, Guidance, or any Government document which would suggest the Government intended to prioritise paid over family care in this way or to interfere with article 8 rights in such a broad manner.  </p>

NG&#8217;s physical needs can undoubtedly be met by his paid carers, but his wider emotional and psychological need is to see and be cared for by his parents. Further, care from a loving family is not a one way street in which the focus is only on the person being cared for. Both NDG and AG plainly feel that they &#8220;need&#8221;, in the sense that it is important both to them and to NG, to provide NG with care. The very nature of this bond is undermined by the somewhat mechanistic approach of considering that there is no need for the parents to provide care because someone else can be paid to do so.  </p>

If the care had to be essential, or there was a priority given to paid over unpaid care, then the first restrictions Regulations needed to make that clear. The wording of regulation 6(2)(d) is broad and unspecific in respect to the nature of the care. It would therefore be wrong to create a criminal offence for someone providing care in the circumstances of AG and NDG.  </p>
