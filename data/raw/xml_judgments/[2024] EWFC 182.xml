This prompted Mr White to apply to the Family Court for defined arrangements to see X. Cafcass identified safeguarding issues and the mother raised serious allegations of domestic abuse against Mr White.</p>

The judge made a number of significant findings against Mr White that include coercive and controlling behaviour, three occasions of having sex with the mother without her consent and a further occasion of attempting to have sex with the mother without her consent. </p>

Following some further interim hearings, the matter came before the judge on 12 February 2024 for a final hearing. In her careful judgment, the judge considered a number of pieces of evidence and concluded that X should have unsupervised contact with the father in the community. Her decision in this regard was overturned on appeal. The matter was subsequently referred to me to consider the present applications for publication.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Ms Summers and Ms Martin each argue that in the circumstances of this case, the Article 10 rights overwhelmingly outweigh the respondent&#8217;s and in particular the father&#8217;s Article 8 rights. They each rely on a number of factors in support of their arguments. They submit that much of the information is in the public domain in an anonymised judgment that was published by the judge. Mr White is already identified and reported in the media for his convictions that include the rape of a teenage girl for which he served a custodial sentence. This illustrates that his behaviour is not limited to a domestic setting and public interest demands that he is identified. Furthermore, there appears to be a possibility that he has used different names which lends greater weight to the arguments for  him to be publicly identified. Whilst he is no longer in the army, at the time of the rape of the teenager, he was in the armed forces and this lends further substance to the public interest arguments. Mr White is also in a relationship with another woman. </p>

They submit that X&#8217;s mother, who is supportive of the applications, is best placed to address these issues in an age-appropriate fashion when this becomes more relevant to X. Such future discissions with X are likely to be unavoidable as much of the father&#8217;s past behaviour is already in the public domain and he is also registered on the Sex Offenders Register that restricts his access to children. Therefore, it is inevitable that these issues will have to be addressed by the mother.  </p>

The mother submits that she has successfully appealed the judge&#8217;s decision on the issue of contact as her decision was in the main informed by a woefully inadequate assessment by the allocated Family Court Adviser. She has lost trust in Cafcass&#8217; capacity to adequately represent X and the issue is exacerbated by Cafcass empowering the father to shield behind X&#8217;s Article 8 rights without any proper regard for the father&#8217;s behaviour and the consequences for his victims.  </p>

In his written submissions, he properly refers to the relevant law and seeks to distinguish this case from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Griffiths</span> by observing that in the latter case both parents were identified and the children were easily identifiable, the public interest argument was far stronger as the parents each held a public office and there was no other information in the public domain to serve the interest of the public. Therefore he argues that transparency can be achieved by the publication of the anonymised judgment. He states that the mother should be left to discuss the necessary issues in an appropriate way as and when X&#8217;s interests demand it. </p>

He is also profoundly concerned about the stress and anguish on the individuals that are close to him although he acknowledges that his partner is aware of all of the details of the court&#8217;s findings.

The Guardian recognises that Mr White poses an &#8216;increased risk&#8217; to women and children but there is already information in the public domain that makes any further publication unnecessary and disproportionate. She therefore argues that the naming of the father does not add to the legitimate arguments on public interest. The impact on X in the future could be profound and may be bullied or victimised by peers. She also points to the negative impact on the mother of the prospect of being identified as the victim. Finally she states that the mother is best placed to impart the necessary information in a sensitive and age appropriate way to X as and when this becomes relevant. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The court&#8217;s approach to the issues of publicity as guided by the President of the Family Division has seen a welcome shift towards greater publicity and a better understanding of the work of the Family Court. Although this change in approach may be considered to be seismic, there is no change to the primary legislation that is designed to protect the identification of the parties and the subject children. Furthermore, it is a long-established principle of European and domestic jurisprudence that any interference with the individual&#8217;s rights is only permissible where it is necessary, proportionate and in accordance with the law. In this context there is no doubt that the legislative frame work permits the identification of individuals who may otherwise have their anonymity preserved. Therefore, the main focus must turn to necessity and proportionality. </p>

The concerns that the guardian has raised about the potential future harm are in my judgment genuine and meritorious concerns that must be weighed into the balance. X&#8217;s individual needs and characteristics are also crucial factors that lend support to the guardian&#8217;s views. Whilst the mother is ably represented, I also note the guardian&#8217;s concerns about any negative impact upon her wellbeing. Individuals who are close to the family and Mr White may also suffer by their association with him should his name be published. Identification of Mr White is a serious intrusion in his protected rights that has a serious impact on him as an individual which must be considered in the context of his behaviour.</p>

In my judgment this is an important fact that must be weighed into the balance which is capable of addressing some the existing risk and potential future risk to X. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I accept that the publication of the father&#8217;s name is also likely to cause distress and harm to those who are outside but close to the parameters of these proceedings, including the father&#8217;s partner. This is likely to be exacerbated by the repetition of the information that is already in the public domain and that which will be when the father&#8217;s names are published. This is a crucial factor that King LJ identified in  <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Newman</span>. Extending the point further, there is also a clear and strong public policy argument in preserving the identity of the victims of abuse in the Family Court. It is essential that victims are not discouraged from making relevant complaints for fear of identification or reprisals. Thus further  emphasising that each case must be decided on its own individual facts.</p>

This consideration gains greater importance where there is an established course of conduct that may expose individuals outside the confines of the case to a risk of harm and to limit if not extinguish their ability to protect themselves or their loved ones.</p>

To do so, is in my judgment, in pursuance of a legitimate aim, necessary, proportionate and in accordance with the law. The second element of the application concerns Mr White&#8217;s previous connection with the armed forces. Having had the benefit of reading the previous articles about his convictions, I note that this information is clearly in the public domain and at the time of his sentencing he had already left the army. In so far it is required, without hesitation I permit the publication of this fact. </p>
