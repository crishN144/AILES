Proceedings were issued following the unexplained death of SX&#8217;s younger sister, AX, in April 2019 aged two months. At post mortem it was discovered that AX had suffered multiple unexplained fractures.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">All the witnesses gave their evidence remotely through computers from wherever they were staying in lockdown. When it came to the Father giving evidence there were significant difficulties with his attendance during parts of the hearing. I will not set out the detail but on the morning of the second day of his evidence he said that his Wi-Fi was not working and that significantly delayed the morning session. In the afternoon he said that he had a flood in his kitchen and could not attend the hearing, although he ultimately did do so. Whatever the truth of these events, I took the decision that to ensure that the hearing could be completed he should complete his evidence from counsel&#8217;s chambers. I ordered him to attend those chambers on the third day of his evidence and he completed his evidence on 13 May from a computer in chambers. Similarly, Ms King had a problem with her Wi-Fi whilst cross examining the Father. She agreed to travel into chambers, which happily was only 30 minutes away, so that she had a secure connection. I record these events in order to highlight that conducting a hearing such as this does require some flexibility and perhaps creativity, but on this particular case problems were capable of being overcome.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Overall, I am confident that the hearing was undertaken fairly, all the witnesses had the opportunity to give their best evidence, and the hearing was not materially impeded by being undertaken remotely rather than in a courtroom. Some of the evidence was extremely upsetting and there were times when the Mother, Father and the paternal grandmother obviously found the process distressing, but in my judgement this reality was not worsened by the evidence being given remotely. I set out below my judgement as to the truth of the evidence that I heard. I do not consider that my ability to judge the truth or otherwise of the evidence was materially hampered by the remote nature of the hearing. Although watching a witness via computer is different from doing so in court there are advantages as well as disadvantages. The witness appeared much closer and facial expressions were easier to pick up. The interaction between the cross examiner and the witness was surprisingly similar to that in court and, in my view, cross examination was as effective as would have been the case in court. I am also confident that each witness was on their own when giving evidence and was not seeking external advice.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I also record that all the advocates and, I was assured, the parties were entirely content with the process and felt that a fair hearing had been achieved. At the end of the hearing there was a clear consensus that the decision to proceed with the hearing had been the correct one. I want to emphasise this because I am conscious of the danger that the professional parties view a remote hearing to have gone well whereas the lay parties may sometimes feel less content. It took considerable effort to ensure that this was not the case here. There was no suggestion from any of the lay parties, or witnesses, that they did not feel satisfied with the process.  I must also record my thanks to Mr Tughan who organised the technology in a most efficient and seamless way. In my view the process of having counsel manage the technology was an excellent solution. I had no concerns it was not being done entirely fairly to all parties and it meant that there was no burden on HMCTS or my clerk.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">However, I must emphasise that my decision to go ahead with the lay evidence remotely and my comments about the efficacy of the hearing are entirely case specific. This was a case where all the parties were very well represented; the technology worked well; there were no interpreters or intermediaries and none of the witnesses were, in any legal sense, vulnerable. As the Court of Appeal said in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A</span>, decisions about whether to proceed with each case remotely have to be made in a highly case-specific manner.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The LA did not seek findings in respect of the cause of AX&#8217;s death. By the time of the fact finding hearing it was almost a year since AX&#8217;s death and SX had been in foster care throughout that time. There had been very considerable delays in obtaining the medical evidence. The lead pathologist, Dr Fitzpatrick-Swallow&#8217;s final report stated that the cause of death could not be identified. The LA took the view that rather than delay the hearing in order to appoint further experts to give a further opinion on cause of death, they would ask the Court to simply proceed on the basis of the established injuries. Given the scale of those injuries I acceded to that course. Therefore, the cause of AX&#8217;s death remains unidentified.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The LA did seek findings in respect of AX&#8217;s head injuries; rib fractures; limb fractures and bruising to the chest. The findings sought were that one or both of the parents had inflicted these injuries; alternatively, that I should place both parents in the pool of perpetrators; that both parents would have known they had been inflicted and neither parent had sought medical attention. The LA also sought incidental findings relating to abusive treatment of SX; domestic abuse by the Father against the Mother and his previous partner, Ms Z; and domestic abuse by Mother against Father.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I had written statements from all the witnesses referred to below and heard oral evidence from six medical witnesses and seven lay witnesses. The police had seized the parents&#8217; phones when they were arrested and the phones they subsequently purchased. The police had carried out covert surveillance on the parents. From these sources there were transcripts in the bundle of numerous WhatsApp and text messages, voicemails and transcripts of overheard conversations. I will refer to these where relevant below. The parties agreed which parts of this material were relevant and had reduced it to manageable dimensions from many thousands of pages. I am extremely grateful to them for doing this exercise. I am very conscious that what I have are the edited &#8220;highlights&#8221; and that there is a danger of this giving an exaggerated or false view of the parents&#8217; relationship because it misses out the doubtless numerous more mundane exchanges. The material is however of the utmost importance in revealing a number of episodes and exchanges which the parents did not refer to in their statements.  </p>

They had a baby (Y) in 2014. They separated in 2015 and Ms Z alleges that the Father threatened her with violence on occasion and was highly manipulative of her.  </p>

On 26 February a midwife undertook a new-born examination of AX with the baby completely undressed. The record states that there was visualisation and palpation of the clavicles and limbs and all was normal. </p>

The difficulty with this and other surveillance material from the Father is that he lies so frequently that it is not possible to tell whether he is recounting a real incident; whether it was actually him rather than the Mother who shook the baby; or whether he has made the incident up. Ultimately, I have concluded that I can put little weight on this material as there are simply too many doubts raised about it.

In that case a mother had been convicted of the murder of her two children who had simply stopped breathing. The mother's two other children had experienced apparent life-threatening events taking a similar form. The Court of Appeal Criminal Division quashed the convictions. There was no evidence other than repeated incidents of breathing having ceased. There was serious disagreement between experts as to the cause of death. There was fresh evidence as to hereditary factors pointing to a possible genetic cause. In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal held that it could not be said that a natural cause could be excluded as a reasonable possible explanation. In the course of his judgment, Judge LJ (as he then was) observed: &#8220;What may be unexplained today may be perfectly well understood tomorrow.

The first is met in this appeal since the child was injured and suffered significant harm. In relation to the second limb, the attributable condition, it seems to me that the two most likely outcomes in 'uncertain perpetrator' cases are as follows. The first is that there is sufficient evidence for the court positively to identify the perpetrator or perpetrators. Second, if there is not sufficient evidence to make such a finding, the court has to apply the test set out by Lord Nicholls as to whether there is a real possibility or likelihood that one or more of a number of people with access to the child might have caused the injury to the child. For this purpose, real possibility and likelihood can be treated as the same test. As Lord Nicholls pointed out in re O and N (Minors); re B (Minors) (above) the views and indications that the judge at the first part of a split trial may be able to set out may be of great assistance at the later stage of assessment and the provision of the protection package for the injured child. I would therefore formulate the test set out by Lord Nicholls as, "Is there a likelihood or real possibility that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries?". There may perhaps also be the third possibility that there is no indicator to help the court decide from whom the risk to the child may come, in which eventuality it would be very difficult for the local authority and for the court to assess where the child might be at most risk.&#8221; </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">Drawing matters together, it can be seen that the concept of a pool of perpetrators seeks to strike a fair balance between the rights of the individual, including those of the child, and the importance of child protection.  It is a means of satisfying the attributable threshold condition that only arises where the court is satisfied that there has been significant harm arising from (in shorthand) ill-treatment and where the only 'unknown' is which of a number of persons is responsible.  So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way.  Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible.  In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not.  There is no room for a finding of fact on the basis of 'real possibility', still less on the basis of suspicion.  There is no such thing as a pool of one. </span></p>

As is made clear in Lancashire at [19], O and N at [27-28] and S-B at [43], the person is not a proven perpetrator but a possible perpetrator.  That conclusion is then carried forward to the welfare stage, when the court will, as was said in S-B, "consider the strength of the possibility" that the person was involved as part of the overall circumstances of the case.  At the same time it will, as Lord Nicholls put it in Lancashire, "keep firmly in mind that the parents have not been shown to be responsible for the child's injuries."  In saying this, he recognised that a conclusion of this kind presents the court with a particularly difficult problem.  Experience bears this out, particularly where a child has suffered very grave harm from someone within a pool of perpetrators. </span></p>

Centrally, it does not alter the general rule on the burden of proof.  Where there are a number of people who might have caused the harm, it is for the local authority to show that in relation to each of them there is a real possibility that they did.  No one can be placed into the pool unless that has been shown.  This is why it is always misleading to refer to 'exclusion from the pool': see Re S-B at [43].  Approaching matters in that way risks, as Baroness Hale said, reversing the burden of proof.   </span></p>

The court should first consider whether there is a 'list' of people who had the opportunity to cause the injury.  It should then consider whether it can identify the actual perpetrator on the balance of probability and should seek, but not strain, to do so: Re D (Children) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/472" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 472" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 472</ref> at [12].  Only if it cannot identify the perpetrator to the civil standard of proof should it go on to ask in respect of those on the list:  "Is there a likelihood or real possibility that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries?"  Only if there is should A or B or C be placed into the 'pool'&#8221;. </span></p>

Over time more fibroblasts arrive and collagen builds up.

Firstly, they suggest problems with SX&#8217;s behaviour and the parents&#8217; response to it which is not mentioned in any of the Mother&#8217;s statements or interviews. It is perfectly obvious that the Father slapping SX <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;really hard&#8221;</span> because he was angry and frustrated with him is highly relevant to what happened to AX. The Mother did ultimately accept this. There is therefore clear evidence that the Mother was not being honest even in her later two statements and has not given an honest picture of what was going on in the family. Secondly, it suggests that the Mother too either lost her temper with SX or thought that physical chastisement was appropriate. Thirdly, it suggested a very striking lack of empathy with SX. This was a three year old child in a household with parents who were frequently angrily abusive to each other, certainly within his hearing, and, given the smallness of the flat, almost certainly within his sight. It is hardly surprising he was upset and this was impacting on his potty training. Yet the Mother in her oral evidence appeared never to have thought of this possibility.  </p>

The Mother accepted that the Father was very needy and that he was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;insecure&#8221;.</span> She says that throughout the relationship he was controlling in the sense that if she went out with friends or family he would want to come too. There appears to be a pattern, certainly before AX was born, of him seeking to isolate the Mother from her family. The texts suggest that by the time of AX&#8217;s birth he was constantly seeking reassurance, affection and often to have sex. He also appears to have been jealous and suspicious of other men, including suggesting that the Mother was having other relationships. A suspicion which she totally denies and which I am sure was untrue. There is a very obvious pattern of controlling and suspicious behaviour by the Father to the Mother, and before that to Ms Z. Overall, the evidence indicates a relationship that had been characterised by controlling and manipulative behaviour but which had deteriorated into an angry and deeply unhappy one by the time of AX&#8217;s birth.  </p>

There is also the evidence that on the one night that was considered in detail, the night before she died when her femur had been broken 4-12 hours before death, she was up every 2 hours. There is also the objective evidence of her failure to gain weight which might well be a response to more than a mild cold.

In cross examination she kept her answers extremely careful and rarely lapsed into any emotional response. It is important that I do not conclude that the Mother was not deeply upset by AX&#8217;s injuries, her death and SX being in care because she controlled her emotions when giving her evidence.

She had listened to Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s evidence and knew that there were 65 fractures and these were some of the most serious injuries he had ever seen on a baby of this age. Yet she expressed no anger towards the Father, no remorse, she denied (to Mr Verdan) feeling any sense of responsibility and said that she had done nothing wrong. When the issue of the Father slapping SX came up she sought to protect the Father by saying that she thought he had exaggerated. This was not as a result of still loving the Father (that much was obvious). It seemed to me the explanation was that she knew that if she said too much bad about the Father&#8217;s conduct with the children, it would reflect on her conduct and indicate that she knew more than she was telling the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Father commenced his oral evidence by making three concessions on matters which he accepted he had lied about. These concessions had been presaged at the start of the lay evidence once I had decided to continue with the hearing. The concessions were that he had lied about having been in the Army and having served abroad; that he had lied about having cancer in early 2019 and that he had lied about a letter from the hospital. These were the only lies that the Father formally conceded in writing through his counsel. However, through cross examination it became clear, if it was not so already from the rest of the evidence, that he had lied extensively about other matters. His account of many issues changed during his oral evidence and it became at times difficult to understand what he was saying in relation to key points. He accepted that he frequently lied, and his mother confirmed this. I should note at this stage that the fact he frequently changed his evidence, and did not seem to have any grasp on having promised to tell the truth, did not in my view result from the nature of the hearing. The Father is a man who lies compulsively and with no compunction. I have no doubt he would have done the same in any setting. The fact that he frequently lied to the court does not mean that none of his evidence was true, but it does make setting out a coherent account of his evidence very difficult. The Father repeatedly said that he had a bad memory and that much of what he had said in previous statements was wrong because he had been stressed. However, when it suited him he said that what he had said in previous statements must be true because it was nearer to the date of the key events. In my assessment he was a witness who did not wish to tell the court the truth and lied whenever he saw an advantage to himself in doing so.  </p>

He has also lied to his partners, his mother and others. This is plainly a significant part of his characteristic behaviour. That does not mean that all his evidence is untrue but it does make it exceptionally difficult to pick out the elements of truth within his evidence.  </p>

I accept memory is a difficult and complex thing, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gestmin</span> above. But in relation to the 111 incident the recording is perfectly clear about taking the baby to hospital; either the parents jointly decided to ignore this advice or the Father chose not to tell the Mother what the doctor said. The Father&#8217;s alleged failure of memory does not apply only to single events, where memory may become confused through passage of time, trauma and re-telling, it applies to day to day life in the flat and care of the children. Whether or not he slapped SX is not a failure of memory, unless it was so frequent it was not memorable for that reason, it was a deliberate choice not to tell the police and the court in his statements. Equally, his account of the night of AX&#8217;s death is irreconcilable with the medical evidence. The baby had a femoral fracture inflicted between approximately 5am and 9pm the previous night and this would have been seriously painful for a time. I do not believe the Father&#8217;s account. In relation to the night before AX&#8217;s death, when she sustained the femur fracture, the Father gave the doctor at the hospital a detailed account and he then gave Mr Goodwin a very different account having initially said he was asleep. In my judgement the Father was deliberately lying to the court about that night in order to obscure the truth and pretend he is not well aware of the fact that he injured the baby.  </p>

The position of the Local Authority was that I should make findings that each parent inflicted injuries although it was not possible to specify in respect of the fractures which parent inflicted which. In respect of the head injuries, the Local Authority sought a pool finding on the basis that in all probability there was one unifying mechanism for these injuries. In the alternative, the LA sought a pool finding against both parents in respect of all the injuries and, in the final alternative, a finding of failure to protect against the parents.  </p>

Mr Goodwin referred to the toxic relationship between the parents and the escalation of those problems in the period after AX was born. He said that the conclusion of abuse of AX by the Father was inescapable on the evidence. In relation to the Mother, he pointed to the fact that she had slapped SX and had plainly lost her temper on occasions, the extreme strain that she was under as shown in the texts disclosed, her toleration of the Father slapping SX, and her apparently cold and unempathetic response to SX and more generally in her evidence and the text messages. Most importantly Mr Goodwin relied on the multiplicity of injuries and the extreme unlikelihood of the Mother not knowing AX was injured, and of her failing to tell the truth at the outset about various critical matters. This, Mr Goodwin argued, pointed to the fact that she had been party to the abuse and she and the Father had colluded in not telling the truth. </p>

Mr Verdan placed a good deal of emphasis on the 111 call, both for the fact it showed a seriously distressed baby, which was quite inconsistent with the parents&#8217; evidence, and because it suggested the Mother&#8217;s story about not realising that AX should be taken to hospital was unbelievable.

Importantly, there is also no evidence that she had any condition that would diminish her pain response.

Her response to the immunisations the day before she died seems to have been an entirely normal one, i.e. that she cried for a short period but then settled. So there is no evidence that AX had an abnormal pain response, nor do the parents suggest that this was the case.  </p>

It is also possible, though less likely, that the subdural haemorrhage was birth related. However, on the facts of this case I find that it is much more likely that both these injuries were inflicted. The axonal brain injury was undoubtedly inflicted according to Professor Al-Sarraj.  On the balance of probabilities, the likelihood that AX suffered a relatively unusual subdural haemorrhage at birth but was then abused in a way that caused axonal injury to her brain seems slight. Dr Cartlidge thought that there was probably a single traumatic event involving abusive shaking and Dr Fitzpatrick-Swallow agreed that there could have been a unifying mechanism.  I find that there was in all probability one unifying explanation for her head injuries which was that she was shaken so badly these injuries occurred. It may be that that was at the same time as one of the early sets of limb injuries was inflicted, but that is not possible to say with any confidence. </p>

Firstly, fractured ribs from CPR in babies are very unusual according to Dr Fitzpatrick-Swallow. Secondly, the fractures being at the side are in the wrong place for them to have been caused by CPR. It is also highly unlikely, if not impossible, that any of the rib injuries or long bone fractures were caused at birth. It must be more likely, and I find, that they were inflicted injuries.

That does not mean she would often have been screaming in pain, save for the short periods after the injuries had been inflicted, but it does suggest that she would have been unhappy and often hard to look after. Secondly, the Father&#8217;s evidence about her being a poor sleeper and a &#8220;night-owl&#8221; was one part of his evidence that rang true. Thirdly, the parents&#8217; evidence about AX rarely crying and never showing distress, save when she was constipated, was exposed by the 111 call on 1 April. AX was crying in distress on that call as the Father accepted. It is simply unbelievable that the only occasion when she cried like that was the brief moment when she was captured on a recorded call as the Father tried to suggest. In my view the parents lied to me about how AX presented and she must have been unhappy, grouchy and hard work to look after for much of the time. This is hardly surprising given the extent of her injuries. </p>

There also seems to be some pattern of him lying but shifting what he has done onto the other person. On each allegation of domestic violence, he turned it round and said that the woman had pushed him or come at him with a knife.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">However, in relation to the last injury as identified by Professor Mangham, the right femur, we do have a slightly more detailed timeline and a number of wholly inconsistent reports from the Father. According to Professor Mangham that fracture was inflicted 4-12 hours before AX died. Her death was recorded at 10.17am but could have been somewhat earlier, so the fracture probably occurred between about 9pm and 6am on the night of 25/26th April. The Father told the doctor at the hospital that the baby had been up at least twice in the night, but he had not thought she was in pain or distressed. He gave inconsistent evidence orally. It is not possible that someone looking after AX that night would not have realised she was distressed. I conclude that the Father lied to me about that evening and that he inflicted the injury on AX.  </p>

I cannot be sure, but on the balance of probabilities, I think it is more likely that the Father inflicted them all.

The Mother chose to do nothing about it and has chosen to lie to the court about what she knew. She has taken this course in order to protect herself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In terms of the background, I accept that the Mother was the victim of domestic violence by the Father up to when SX was 18-20 months. There is a very clear pattern in the Father&#8217;s abusive behaviour towards the Mother and Ms Z, and probably with Ms P as well. Both the Mother and Ms Z were very young when the Father first went out with them and both were told he had PTSD because of military experience. Both record a similar pattern of manipulation by the Father. I suspect that the violence was less frequent than the Mother now claims and I note that her claims have escalated from the Father being violent to her &#8220;occasionally&#8221; to &#8220;occasionally every week&#8221;. In my view the Mother&#8217;s has increased the allegations in order to paint the Father in a worse light, but the frequency of the historic domestic abuse does not assist me with findings on AX&#8217;s injuries.  </p>

By the time AX died the pattern of the relationship was that the Father was needy, insecure and begging for attention and the Mother was largely dismissive and hostile. The children were both caught in the middle of this hostility and it is a striking and enormously sad part of this case how little emotional attention the children seem to have been given by either parent. This emerges both from the text messages, but also the evidence of the parents in court. The fact that it does not appear to have occurred to either parent that SX&#8217;s difficulties were probably caused by their behaviour speaks volumes about their lack of empathy and the degree they actually thought about the children&#8217;s needs save in the most utilitarian manner. I was very struck by the way that even in oral evidence they seemed far more concerned about their relationship than the reasons for the death of their daughter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The domestic violence is important in that it shows the Mother was very well aware that the Father had a temper, which he easily lost, and was capable of being violent when angry. This is obviously highly relevant to what happened to AX, but the Mother chose not to tell the police or the court about the Father&#8217;s behaviour for many months after AX died. The sequence of events suggests that the Mother did not conceal the Father&#8217;s behaviour because she was trying to preserve the relationship or out of shame and embarrassment, but rather in order to conceal the level of her own knowledge of what had been happening to AX. </p>

The WhatsApps suggest that the Mother thought physical chastisement was acceptable, including on a three year old who had problems with potty training. Although the Mother&#8217;s family members all say that she was kind and loving to the children, I note that they appear to have been wholly unaware of the history of domestic violence despite the Mother&#8217;s evidence of it having been so frequent in the early years of the relationship, and unaware that both parents slapped SX. This suggests that the Mother did not share much information with her family, including Ms B, and that they were not particularly good at spotting what was happening. The same is true of the slapping of SX when neither Ms B nor Ms C appeared to know how SX was being treated. </p>

However, there is a very great difference between slapping a three year old who you (wrongly) think has behaved badly and shaking/manhandling a very young baby so badly as to inflict these injuries. The Mother was cold and unempathetic to her children, and certainly became frustrated with SX, but there is little evidence that she is likely to have lost her temper with AX in a way that gave rise to the type of physical abuse involved in these injuries.  </p>

She was with AX fairly constantly throughout her short life. Although there were occasions when the Mother went out to the shops, or took SX to nursery on the bus (a journey which took about 1.5 hours both ways), there was nothing to suggest that she was regularly out of the house for significant periods.  </p>

The evidence suggested that there was limited soundproofing in the flat with the Father saying that he could hear the TV playing in the living room if he was in SX&#8217;s bedroom with the door shut. The Father said he could hear the Mother smacking SX from the other room and the external walls were such that the neighbour could hear the parents arguing. Both parents referred to the doors being fire doors. However, in my view, if AX was in one room with the Father, and AX was crying in the way I heard on the 111 call, then anyone in the flat would have been aware of that crying with or without the doors closed. Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s evidence was that each time she was injured she would have cried with distress for 5-10 minutes. </p>

She described AX as a generally happy smiley baby who rarely cried and who she never heard in distress save for the constipation. The Mother&#8217;s depiction in oral evidence bordered on the idyllic &#8211; &#8220;She was a good baby, I didn&#8217;t have any issues or anything.  She slept well, fed well, she was growing well.  A little bit grumpy, but usually herself, her cold went away, there were no major concerns&#8221;. This is completely at odds with the medical evidence. Further, the 111 call shows at least one instance when AX was very distressed with the Mother in the room and, as I have already said, it is exceptionally unlikely that this was the only occasion AX was so distressed. But this evidence is also totally out of keeping with Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s evidence about AX&#8217;s likely presentation after she was injured but also more generally.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The 111 call is also important because it strongly suggests that the parents, including the Mother, actively avoided taking AX to hospital to be checked, probably because they were worried about what the hospital would find. The recording of the conversation between the Father and the doctor (the third tape) shows the doctor very clearly telling the Father to take the baby to hospital. The Father repeats the name of the hospital to the doctor and the Mother was in the room and the baby was not crying at this point so, contrary to her evidence, she would have heard this. I find the story that the Father told the Mother it was bile and the doctor said in that case it was not necessary to go to hospital not believable. I think it is much more likely the parents decided not to take AX to hospital because of whatever had happened to her. The Mother accepted that she had seen blood on the baby muslin and she knew the baby was very distressed. It does not make sense that she would then decide it was only bile. Any responsible parent in those circumstances would have taken the baby to hospital to have it checked. This was not a family who were generally avoiding medical attention, the Father having regularly attended A&amp;E. That the Mother knew AX was injured would tie in with the Mother cancelling the jaundice appointment the next day. This might have been genuinely because AX no longer had jaundice, it is simply not possible to tell. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The parents both put a huge amount of weight on the fact that AX had been seen by a number of healthcare professionals during her short life. However, when these visits are carefully analysed it can be seen that they show little if anything. Dr Cartlidge said that he would not be surprised that a doctor/health visitor would not have spotted that the baby was being injured given the nature of the injuries. The schedules of timings of the injuries show that they could well have been inflicted at points when there would have been no reason for the professional to realise there was an injury. With the exception of the right femur in the hours before she died, none of the injuries have a sufficiently small time window to be sure precisely how it related to a visit to the doctor/health visitor, but the schedule shows quite clearly that they could all have been at a point where nothing would have alerted the professional. It is however important that a doctor did find that AX was not putting on weight at a normal rate and had slipped down the growth charts which fits with, though is not in any sense conclusive, a baby who was not feeding well.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">That the Mother knew the Father had abused AX is also strongly supported by her approach to the evidence and the timing of information she has given to this court and the police. The Mother now accepts that she did not tell the police the truth about her relationship with the Father and his history of domestic violence until December 2019. The parents were both told about the initial findings of fractures in May 2019 having been sent the x-ray report on 20 May. Although further detail was revealed by Dr Oates&#8217; report, that AX had serious injuries and that these were very possibly inflicted injuries must have been plain from at least early June. That the Father&#8217;s history of violence to the Mother and his anger and loss of control with SX were highly relevant is utterly obvious. The Mother is not lacking in intelligence and the relevance of the Father&#8217;s conduct must have been obvious to her. The fact that she did not tell the police the truth about the Father&#8217;s past behaviour until December suggests to me, very strongly, that she was trying to avoid revealing anything about her own level of knowledge. She changed her position when she realised that the Father had lied about the 15 July 2019 audio recording and that whatever tacit or otherwise agreement they had reached was breaking down.  </p>

I can see the logic in this argument but, in my view, she may well have not revealed what she knew about the Father&#8217;s conduct to SX and past domestic violence because she was worried about exposing that she knew about the abuse of AX. Although logically she might have been better off saying at the outset that she knew the Father had abused the baby, she may well have realised that would inevitably lead to a finding of failure to protect and have extremely serious consequences for her. I therefore do not accept the full force of Mr Goodwin&#8217;s submissions. I think the more likely scenario is that the Mother knew about the abuse and colluded in covering it up.  </p>

AX was a two month old baby who died after having been abused repeatedly and in a very violent way through her short life. This is not a case of a parent having made a terrible mistake in failing to intervene once, or not being sufficiently watchful. In my view this is a case of a parent who deliberately allowed her daughter to be harmed again and again, who knew she was in pain and distress, and who chose for whatever reason not to stop the abuse.  </p>
