	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">This judgment concerns two unconnected young people who have been accommodated pursuant to the provisions of The Children Act&#160;1989, section&#160;20 (the 1989 Act) for a very considerable period of time.  Their treatment by Herefordshire Council (&#8216;the local authority&#8217;) represents two of the most egregious abuses of section&#160;20 accommodation it has yet been my misfortune to encounter as a judge.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">CD was born in 2001.  A series of referrals were made to the local authority in respect of his parents' allegedly abusive relationship in 2005 which led to CD being accommodated by the local authority in October&#160;2009 when he was eight years of age.  He was not made the subject of public law care proceedings until September&#160;2017, when he was 16 years of age; a period of eight years, subject to section&#160;20 accommodation.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">GH was born in early 2008.  He was born with significant disabilities and spent the first five months of his life in a special care baby unit in Hereford hospital.  His mother was 14 at the time of his birth and his father was 17.  In July&#160;2008, GH was accommodated pursuant to section&#160;20 of the 1989 Act.  Initially, he was placed in a mother and baby foster placement with his mother but this broke down in September&#160;2008.  He remained with the foster carer.  He was not made the subject of public law care proceedings until September&#160;2017 when he was nine years of age; a period of nine years under section&#160;20 accommodation, the whole of his life to date.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">These two cases, once issued, came before the designated family judge (&#8216;the DFJ&#8217;) for Worcester and Hereford, His Honour Judge Plunkett, who referred both cases to me as the Family Division Liaison Judge for the Midland Circuit.  When the cases came before me for the first time, I had statements from the respective heads of service which set out the chronology of events for both children but neither of which gave me any explanation for what appeared to be wholly inexcusable delays and inaction in the care planning for these children.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">I required the Director of Children's Services to file and serve (i) a statement explaining the events and lack of planning in respect of CD and GH, and (ii) a statement detailing the circumstances of each and every child accommodated by this local authority pursuant to the provisions of section&#160;20. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">The latter document made very grim reading.  Excepting CD, GH and three other children who are now the subject of public law proceedings, the local authority is accommodating 42 children.  Of these 42 children, the local authority have now recognised that 14 have wrongly and abusively been the subject of section&#160;20 accommodation for a wholly inappropriate lengthy period of time and/or should have been the subject of legal planning meetings and/or care proceedings at a much earlier time.</p>

It is right that I record at an early stage in the judgment that he (a) has readily and timeously complied with all directions made by this court for the filing and serving of statements and letters (b) has been completely frank and open about the past failings of this local authority (c) has provided a ready explanation of the steps he has taken or will take to remedy past mistakes, and (d) has chosen to attend court hearings in person.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">Later in this judgment, I will be roundly critical of egregious failings of this local authority in relation to CD and GH but also in relation to the 14 children to whom I have referred above.  Nevertheless, it is important for me to recognise and acknowledge that Mr&#160;Baird and the new senior management team at this local authority have taken and will take steps to ensure that such dreadful failures in the care of and planning for children and young people in its care will not occur in the future.  I have every confidence in the sincerity and commitment of this director to improve very significantly the planning for and provision of services to the children and young people for whom it is responsible.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.44in">"The catalogue of errors, omissions, delays and serial breaches of court orders in this matter is truly lamentable.  They will be serious enough in respect of an older child but they are appalling in respect of a 15-day-old baby.  Each day, each week and each month in his young life is exceedingly precious.  Where so young a child is removed from the care of his mother or father his case must be afforded the highest priority by the local authority.  The use of the provisions of section&#160;20 of the Children Act&#160;1989 to accommodate was, in my judgment, seriously abused by the local authority in this case.  I cannot conceive of circumstances where it would be appropriate to use those provisions to remove a very young baby from the care of its mother, save in the most exceptional of circumstances and where the removal is intended to be for a matter of days at most.  The accommodation of DS under a section&#160;20 agreement deprived him of the benefit of having an independent children's guardian to represent and safeguard his interests.  Further, it deprived the court of the ability to control the planning for the child and to prevent or reduce unnecessary and avoidable delay in securing a permanent placement for the child at the earliest possible time.  I trust that the events of the first 23&#160;months of DS's life will not have a detrimental impact on his future development and his emotional and psychological wellbeing.  There is a real risk they will do so."</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">In the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re: N (Children) (Adoption: Jurisdiction)</span> [2016] 1 FLR, 621, the President said at paragraphs 157 to 160 and 171 as follows:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.44in">"The first issue relates to the use by the local authority, in my judgment the misuse by the local authority, of the procedure under section&#160;20 of the 1989 Act.  As we have seen, the children were placed in accordance with section&#160;20 in May&#160;2013.  Yet it was not until January&#160;2014, over eight months later, that the local authority eventually issued care proceedings.  Section&#160;20 may, in an appropriate case, have a proper role to play as a short-term measure pending the commencement of care proceedings but the use of section&#160;20, as a prelude to care proceedings for a period as long as here, is wholly unacceptable.  It is, in my judgment, and I use the phrase advisedly and deliberately, a misuse by the local authority of its statutory powers.  As I said in Re: A (a Child) in Darlington Borough Council v M <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/11" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 11" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 11</ref>, paragraph&#160;100, 'There is, I feared, far too much misuse and abuse of section&#160;20 and this can be no longer tolerated.</p>

As I have said, CD first became known to the council in late 2005 following a series of referrals related to concerns around CD's parents, being in a domestically abusive relationship, the impact of emotional harm on CD and his mother, experiencing difficulties in managing his behaviour.  To prevent CD suffering or being at risk of significant harm, on 14&#160;October&#160;2009 CD was accommodated at the request of his mother owing to CD being beyond parental control.   CD's first LAC review was held on 9&#160;November&#160;2009.  </p>

CD's legal status was, therefore, deemed appropriate whilst reunification continued to be explored.  On 28&#160;March&#160;2010, the mother wrote to the local authority formally to withdraw her consent to CD remaining accommodated by the local authority pursuant to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section&#160;20</ref>.

It was recorded that permanence for CD had been established practically through his placement but issues about his legal status remained.  The local authority, it was noted, had considered applying for a special guardianship order in favour of CD's foster carers but they did not pursue this option due to CD's mother opposing the plan.

At a LAC review and child protection conference on 16&#160;March&#160;2009, a decision was made that GH would no longer be subject to a child protection plan as he was not at risk of significant harm due to being in the care of his foster carer.  Consideration of rehabilitation continued for some period of time.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"> At a LAC review held on 5&#160;September 2014, the issue of care proceedings, it was decided, would be put on hold because GH's carer expressed a wish to apply for a special guardianship order.  At the following LAC review on 24 February 2015 it appeared that the foster carer was being offered a choice either for GH to remain under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> accommodation, or for her to apply for a special guardianship order.  It appears that the foster carer opted for the first option of GH, remaining under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> accommodation.  It is not at all clear, and I have no explanation, as to why the foster carer was offered that choice.  Further, I do not understand why the possibility that the foster carer might apply for a special guardianship order justified a delay in the issue of public law care proceedings.</p>

She explained she had at numerous review meetings emphasised the need to secure legal permanence for the child and had repeatedly highlighted the lack of planning for GH.  She ultimately challenged his legal status as a looked after child following a comprehensive review of all children accommodated by the local authority which, as I have said, was undertaken in 2016.  She accepted however the following: (a) there was no evidence that matters were escalated to the responsible heads of service as is now the current practice; (b) the delay in issuing care proceedings should have been more robustly challenged by her as GH's independent reviewing officer;  and (c) she should have challenged more tenaciously the failure to achieve legal permanence of GH, especially in between LAC reviews.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of both CD and GH, there were repeated occasions over very many years when it was accepted that legal advice should be sought and/or that care proceedings should be issued.  Notwithstanding the close scrutiny which has been undertaken by senior managers of the local authority and by the director, it has still not been possible to explain why these decisions were not put into action.  It is extremely concerning that when this local authority recognised, as it did on repeated occasions, that it was not acting in the welfare best interests of either these children, it did nothing.  The complete inertia is inexplicable.  Such gross failings by a local authority are intolerable.  CD and GH were denied a voice in the determination of their future care.  The same may be said about their parents.  The boys were both denied the opportunity for clear and focussed planning about their respective futures to be undertaken and for the same to be endorsed by a court.  The early issue of care proceedings would have enabled a decision to be made about their legal status and their future in a structured and time-limited manner.  </p>

The director has acknowledged that this was a misuse of the local authority's powers and it should have made immediate arrangements to return CD to his mother's care.  It is, however, far worse than being a misuse of powers.  The local authority acted unlawfully and unlawfully retained care of CD until at least February 2013 when it appears from the chronology that the mother was engaging with the local authority and agreeing to CD remaining in care.  </p>

It was submitted on behalf of the local authority that I should anonymise the names of all parties, including the local authority, because the adverse publicity would be damaging to the council.  I subsequently received a letter from the director bringing to my attention Hereford's struggle to recruit solicitors and social workers and that "adverse publicity for the local authority does count in the minds of some prospective employees and it would be unfortunate if our historic failings were to turn people away."  The contents of this letter, which had been disclosed to all of the other parties, caused me to consider once more whether it was necessary for me to name the local authority in this case.  After long and careful reflection I have concluded that it is.  I decided that a public judgment which named the local authority was necessary for the following reasons: (a) the President has repeatedly emphasised the importance of transparency and openness in the conduct of cases in the Family Division and in the Family Court; (b) the public have a real and legitimate interest in knowing what public bodies do, or, as in these cases, do not do in their name and on their behalf; (c) the failure to plan and take action in both of these cases is extremely serious.  There were repeated flagrant breaches of guidance from the judges of the division and of standard good practice; (d) it is evident that this case emanates from the Midlands Circuit.  Not to identify the relevant local authority would unfairly run the risk of other authorities on this circuit coming under suspicion; and (e) the President and the judges of the division have always previously taken a robust approach on the identification of local authorities, experts and professionals whose approach or working practices are found to be below an acceptable standard.  </p>

I offer the warmest of thanks and congratulations to CD's foster carers and to GH's foster carer.  For periods of at least eight years they have each cared for the two boys without any parental responsibility for either of them.  Both sets of foster carers have in many ways been failed by this local authority, but their commitment to CD and GH respectively has been undaunted and unfailing.  </p>

She was not given any of the foregoing.  The local authority, as referred to above, did not even consider whether she was capable of consenting to GH's accommodation.  Thereafter she was frankly side-lined.  As she grew older and matured, little, if any, consideration was given as to whether she could then care for GH or whether she could and should play a greater role in his life.  I have a very real sense that her role as his mother, albeit, or perhaps because, she was so very young, was simply overlooked and ignored.  Fortunately, with the issuing of these proceedings it has been possible to secure the placement of both children.  In respect of CD with his current carers as special guardians.  In respect of GH, to secure his placement with ZA but then to consider where his interests lie in a future long-term placement.  It has also enabled CD's foster carers to be invested with parental responsibility for him.</p>
