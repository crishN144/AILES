	    <p class="ParaHeading" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">This matter returns to court following an application by the Local Authority (&#8216;LA&#8217;) for a re-hearing concerning findings of fact I made on 11.2.11, as set out in the judgment of the same date (<span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v C [2011] EWHC 231</span>). The proceedings concern a girl A born on [a date in] 2006, now 5 years and a boy B, born on [a date in] 2008, now 4 years. Their parents are C and D. I shall refer to them in this judgment as the mother and father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaHeading" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">At the hearing in February I concluded that I could not be satisfied, to the required standard, that A had a laceration to her hymen. One of the main reasons why I could not be so satisfied was the complete failure of both experienced consultant paediatricians who carried out an examination of A under general anaesthetic to follow their own guidance or well recognised national guidance in relation to recording the results of that examination.</p>

	    <p class="ParaHeading" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">I heard the welfare hearing over 7 days from 28.9.11 to 7.10.11. In the judgment I handed down on 31.10.11 I concluded that the children could be rehabilitated home to live with their parents. That conclusion was contrary to the plan proposed by the LA (supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian) for the children to be placed for adoption. A rehabilitation plan was put into effect and the children started having contact at the family home. The plan was to place the children at home with their parents full time from 18.1.12.</p>

	    <p class="ParaHeading" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">Following concerns raised by the foster carer in early December 2011, in relation to bruising on A, a child protection medical was carried out by Dr S (Consultant Paediatrician) on 9.12.11. Part of that examination included an examination of A&#8217;s genitalia. That examination concluded there was evidence of a transection of the hymen; the medical opinion was that it related back to the occasion I had been considering at the hearing in February 2011. That opinion has not been challenged at this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaHeading" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">In addition to the fresh medical evidence, it was also discovered by the LA in early December 2011, that the father had been convicted of a number of offences on 26.9.11 (2 days before the commencement of the welfare hearing) and had been given a sentence of 180 hours community service. It is accepted by the parents this information had been withheld from the court and the other parties. It is accepted that this fresh information is relevant to the credibility of the parents.</p>

I have had the enormous benefit of experienced counsel conducting the case for all the parties, which has assisted me greatly.

The essence of the findings now sought are that A had a laceration to her hymen in September 2009, that injury (together with the other injuries I found) were caused by an abusive act whereby an attempt was made by the father to insert his penis into A&#8217;s vagina prior to the hospital admission on 15.9.09 and the mother failed to protect A.</p>

The court must be careful to bear in mind that a witness may lie for many reasons, such as shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear and distress, and the fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Lucas <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1981] QB 720" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1981">[1981] QB 720</ref></span>).</p>

There is a transcript of the telephone call in the papers, I heard the live recording at the February hearing. During this conversation the father explained that A had slipped and fallen in the shower/wet room, which served as the family bathroom. After she had been picked up by the mother she noticed that A was bleeding from between her legs. The father commented during the telephone discussion that he thought A had damaged her hymen. Initially the advice was to take A to see the GP in the morning. However, subsequently the advice changed that A should immediately be taken to hospital.</p>

This is contained in their witness statements, a series of police interviews, the medical records and their oral evidence. Their account is that she was in their care all day, save for a period at nursery in the afternoon. When it came to bath time in the early evening the mother was bathing A and B in an inflatable paddling pool and shower in the wet room/shower whilst the father was in the parents&#8217; bedroom which is adjacent to the bathroom. They had to use a paddling pool as the bathroom had been adapted to a wet room/shower for the previous occupant and the children preferred to bath rather than shower.</p>

She spoke with Dr H and D from social services who said they had visited the house, they agreed the bathroom was inadequate and would try and help the family. In addition they had looked into the background and had no concerns. In view of the fact that Dr H and social services Dr J thought it was probably acceptable for A to go home but did discuss it with Dr C who was the consultant for the week. Dr J then went to speak to the mother and confirmed she was happy for A to be discharged and apologised for the distress caused. A went home. There is no record of the precise time, the nursing note is timed at 4pm. In her oral evidence she confirmed prior to discharge she spoke to Dr H, Dr C and D in social services. There is no suggestion during the hearing that she did other than follow the correct procedure at that time. However, in the closing submissions prepared by the LA in February 2011 it noted that the Trust&#8217;s own guidance states that discharge arrangements for a child about whom there are child protection concerns must always be discussed with the Named or Designated Doctor or Named Nurse for Child Protection. That did not happen in this case.</p>

Dr S&#8217;s conclusion is that this is the healed laceration of the hymen that was observed by Drs Croft and Reiser in the EUA but, for the reasons given in the February 2011 judgment, I was unable to find on the evidence then that it was established. This evidence has not been challenged in this hearing; Dr S has not been required to give evidence.</p>

In his oral evidence in February Dr Hobbs was taken through a number of scenarios by Mr Verdan Q.C. and he agreed that if there was no hymenal injury the injury was less severe, but still worrying. </p>

He continued &#8216;A transection of the hymen in the posterior part of the hymen (here at 6 o&#8217;clock) is therefore probably the strongest evidence of vaginal penetrative sexual abuse that it is possible to find at a distance from the abusive penetrative event after healing has taken place.&#8217; He agreed in his oral evidence that it was necessary to look at the whole picture, but said this was a strong physical finding that needed to be taken into account.</p>

Dr Hobbs outlined the work that was currently being undertaken by a Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health working group he was a part of, looking at studies of accidental injury. He said the Boos paper was one of those they were considering, he was not able to say whether it was going to be accepted or not. He said the majority of the papers they reviewed in preparation of the Royal College Guidance were rejected as being insufficiently robust in their preparation. He accepted the principle that this type of injury could be caused accidentally, but said it was very rare. He relied on the Sugar/Feldman paper for this, as he said it listed only very few case examples after an extensive search through the reported studies.</p>

Dr Hobbs, on the other hand, said the evidence was strengthened by this additional finding &#8216;because the evidence is more tangible for someone who has not examined the child&#8217;. Whilst his working assumption in his previous reports accepted what Dr Croft and Dr Reiser reported they saw, in the questions put to him by Mr Verdan Q.C. in February he acknowledged that if the court was not able to make the finding about the laceration to the hymen it was a less serious injury. It is now established that there was a laceration to the hymen which he said in his oral evidence in this hearing was very strong evidence of vaginal penetration of this child. He described this combination of injuries as being at the top end of the scale of injuries in a sexual assault. He said it indicates penetration of the internal parts of the genitalia. He considered the bruising was not inconsistent with a sexual assault. He did not agree with what Dr Hanmer said regarding the &#8216;V&#8217; shaped mark, he said their difference was as a result of a different emphasis in relation to his as in his view it was not inconsistent with sexual abuse.</p>

Dr Hanmer&#8217;s experience was slightly different, in that he had experience of a delay in bleeding caused by restriction. Dr Hobbs said the bleeding would be visible, more so he thought if the child was wet. In relation to the child&#8217;s reaction he said that could depend on the circumstances of the cause of the injuries, but in normal circumstances (non-inflicted injury) he would expect the child to have a high level of distress and would not expect the child to be running around playing soon afterwards.</p>

They were prepared pursuant to my very specific direction. It was the opportunity for the parents to be frank with the court and the parties in relation to these matters. Sadly, that has been shown not to be the case, in the light of their oral evidence the apologies to the court and the assertions as to honesty in both parents statements ring very hollow indeed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaHeading" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">The mother gave evidence first. In her evidence in chief she changed a number of significant matters set out in her statement, which she accepted had been prepared with her solicitor who she knew well and was not done in a rush. The main change was she said she had known for sometime about the fact that the father had a community service order. On her case she knew in October and I have found it was probably possibly earlier. This is because, despite what she states at paragraph 11, she knew perfectly well the father was attending a community service order and, as had been agreed between them, she was covering up for him by saying he was attending a job seekers course, and did so on at least 20 occasions. In very effective cross examination by Miss Morgan Q.C. it transpired that she had gone further by initiating conversation with the father in front of the supervisors about the work experience, successfully feigning the shock in front of the social worker Mr M in December, when it is patently clear she already knew of the community service order and was actively complicit in its non-disclosure. Even with her intellectual and emotional limitations, which I bear very much in mind, the mother is, in my judgment, a relatively sophisticated liar. She positively maintained that false position at the child protection meeting on 5.1.12.</p>

A number of assertions in his statement were simply untrue. The main one is set out in para 15. In his oral evidence he confirmed he had told the mother about the community service order prior to the December meeting with Mr M. It was also patently clear from his oral evidence he and the mother had discussed the contents of their recent statements, they had made a deliberate decision to maintain the various lies and withhold relevant information from the court and the parties.</p>

In his sworn oral evidence to me in September he told me that he had kicked his cannabis habit at the time of A&#8217;s birth. That was not disputed by the mother during that hearing and is referred to in my judgment in October. The hearing proceeded on that basis. That was not, in fact, what he said to the probation officer only a few days earlier in September, he told him his use was daily. Yet in his statement dated 20.1.12 at para 6 he gave the very clear impression that it was very occasional. His oral evidence provided little clarity about his use, he sought to obfuscate rather than enlighten in relation to his historical and current use. The mother&#8217;s evidence in this hearing was contrary to what had been said during the September hearing, she said in this hearing he had smoked cannabis daily whilst they had the care of the children.</p>

He further rationalised it at this hearing in that the existence of this injury meant there was more injured tissue, which increases the severity of the injury and is consistent with penetration of the internal parts of the genitalia. Dr Hanmer was more cautious, but in the telephone meeting with Dr Hobbs agreed the most likely cause was sexual abuse. </p>

I was wrong about that. The evidence given in this hearing has shown that despite what she says about finding it hard not to tell the truth she is in fact rather good at it. She maintained the cover about the father&#8217;s attendance at the community service order over a significant period of time (from October 2011 to March 2012), she feigned shock to Mr M which he believed (in the context that he has been the allocated social worker since 2009 and prior to him coming to see the father it was not known the LA had discovered the existence of the conviction and sentence) and continued the lie at the child protection meeting in January. These are not the actions of someone who finds it difficult to tell lies and it displays an effective modus operandi between the parents that enables the mother to do this.</p>

He was, in my judgment, evasive and wholly unreliable in the evidence he gave. He unashamedly accepted that the statement he had signed on 20.1.12 as being the truth was not. He allowed the position set out in that statement to remain for the following four months, until he gave his oral evidence. The only explanation offered for that was that he wanted to support the mother&#8217;s position but when asked whether they had discussed what was going to be in their statements he reverted to his unhelpful vagueness. I am quite satisfied that the parents decided what (untruthful) account they were going to give in their statements and they both chose to file those statements knowing they would be relied upon. He can&#8217;t hide behind the intellectual impairments that the mother can. These are deliberate decisions made by him to lie together with the mother following the court giving them an opportunity to give an explanation.</p>

As I said &#8216;I found her evidence to be a truthful account. There was no hesitation in responding to questions, her account remained consistent&#8230;.&#8217;. That assessment has been seriously called into question. Whilst of course not in a court setting the mother has shown that she has been able to effectively maintain a lie to the contact supervisors over a number of months, the social worker, the child protection conference and her own solicitors. I am satisfied that my assessment of her in February 2011 has been seriously undermined and was more likely than not, in the light of the evidence I now have, wrong. She is someone who does have the capacity to effectively maintain an untruthful account to others in a number of settings. She was able to do that very quickly following the decisions made by the parents on 29.7.11 and following the mother being informed of the need to cover the father&#8217;s attendance for the community service order. In my judgment those settings now include the hospital, the police interviews and her evidence before me in February.</p>

That assessment of the father&#8217;s credibility has got to be re-evaluated in the light of the findings in this hearing. In this hearing he has demonstrated an ability to lie very effectively (together with the mother) by not only withholding information and/or lying to the LA, the jointly instructed experts, the Guardian and the court but also his legal team in the instructions he gave for his statement. The level of sophistication includes the decision on 29.7.11 to withhold the information about his arrest, feigning of the mother&#8217;s knowledge of his convictions/community service to the social worker, the decision with the mother not to give a full and frank account in the statements I directed to be filed, the course of conduct agreed with the mother to lie to the contact supervisors about his attendance at the community service order over a number of months.</p>

In reality the mother pays lip service to any objections she may have to what the father proposes should be done. She loyally, faithfully and unquestioningly follows what he may ask her to do and understands the reasons for doing so. This is well illustrated in the timing of her decision to reconcile with the father; it is precisely the time when, according to her, he asks her to embark on a course of conduct of deceit. Rather than causing her to hesitate about resuming her relationship she reconciles with the father and talks enthusiastically about his ability to change. I strongly suspect that from the father&#8217;s perspective this was a deliberate decision by him to keep the mother under his control.</p>

His failure to go to the hospital due to his concern about awkward questions is now more likely to be more consistent with him wanting to re-assess his position before going to the hospital. This is supported by the fact that the first mention of toys comes from him when he is seen with the mother and he quickly dismisses her failure to mention it due to her &#8216;confusion&#8217;.
