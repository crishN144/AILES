It is quite impossible to hold that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref>(c) of the 1973 treats the sex of the party to a marriage ceremony as irrelevant, as it makes express provision to the contrary.  In any event, problems of great complexity would be involved if recognition were to be given to same sex marriages.  They must be left to Parliament.  I do not think that your Lordships can solve the problem judicially by means of the interpretative obligation in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3 (1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref>.&#8221;</p>

To place the threshold any higher is to invite heavy and time-consuming ancillary litigation of the type that disfigured the conduct of civil litigation twenty-five years ago.  We realise that in CPR Pt 54 the rule-maker prescribed no explicit criteria for the grant of permission to apply for judicial review, but we consider that no PCO should be granted unless the judge considers that the application for judicial review has a real prospect of success and that it is in the public interest to make the order.</p>

In relation to this sum the petitioner, who acknowledges the common interest of herself and the first respondent in the proceedings and their joint position as a couple living together in a jointly owned house and pooling their resources, has set out in detail their joint assets by way of capital and income available in respect of any liability for costs, it being the position that they do not claim costs against each other and are being supported in their action on a <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> basis.  I do not propose to set out their means in detail.  Suffice it to say that they are both professors with two homes and two incomes.  Considered jointly they have combined salaries of &#163;105,630 per annum (plus small additional incomes of approximately &#163;600 per annum between them; they have an equity of more than &#163;240,000 in their two homes; a sum in excess of &#163;21,000 in ISAs and the benefit of their respective final salary pension schemes.  Their joint income after tax would appear to be some &#163;68,950 and their personal joint outgoings &#163;54,000.  According to the tax treatment of certain business expenses their surplus income after taking account of the detailed figures is &#163;4,000 on the basis of the petitioner&#8217;s presentation and &#163;9,500 upon the intervener&#8217;s calculation, which I am inclined to think is likely to be correct.  </p>

In such cases, there is a wide margin of appreciation.  The concept of marriage as a relationship between two people of the opposite sex is not only deeply embedded in the common law of United Kingdom; the laws of all the member states share this approach save for three, namely Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain, which have recognised marriage between same-sex partners.  The  <span style="font-style:italic">Civil Partnership Act</span> has afforded to same-sex couples essentially all the practical property and legal benefits of marriage, stopping short of its formal status only in deference to religious and deep-seated beliefs on the part of large numbers of the population, areas in which European jurisprudence most readily recognises and permits to member states a margin of appreciation.

That, submits Ms Mountfield, does not of itself render the question to be decided a matter of general public interest in the sense hitherto contemplated in the authorities, let alone one which needs to be speedily resolved.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as the preliminary criterion is concerned, I can say at once that, while it is plain that considerable difficulties lie in the petitioner&#8217;s path, I do not accede to the submission that her case is misconceived in the sense that it is not arguable.  I consider that there is sufficient material available for an argument based on principle and Commonwealth and U.S jurisprudence that the requirement of the <span style="font-style:italic">Civil Partnership Act</span> that a marriage between same-sex partners abroad must, on registration, be treated as a civil partnership and not a marriage, is on the face of it discriminatory on the grounds of sexual orientation in that, despite the equivalence of the material rights and responsibilities granted by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> to the rights and the responsibilities of those enjoyed by married couples, the validity and dignity of the ceremony and title of marriage itself is denied to them. The hurdle to be overcome, however, is the requirement to tie such discrimination to Article 8 and/or Article 12 rights as interpreted to date.  In this respect, so far as Article 8 is concerned the decision of the House of Lords in<span style="font-style:italic"> Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">v  M</span> [2006] UKHL11, published after counsel had completed their submissions in this application, increases the height of that hurdle.  In that case, their Lordships emphasised the necessity to tie Article 14 to the &#8216;ambit&#8217; of another Convention right, that the ECtHR does not at present recognise that the Article 8 guarantee of respect for family life is applicable to the relationship of same-sex couples and that contracting states still enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in that respect.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the preliminary canter which this application has afforded, I can see few grounds for optimism on the part of the petitioner, at least so far as a decision at first instance is concerned.  However, I do not consider the matter is unarguable in the light of the trend of modern developments within and outside Europe as listed by Lord Mance at paragraph 152 of his speech in <span style="font-style:italic">M</span> and, were these proceedings for judicial review, I would regard the matter as hovering on the threshold of the preliminary criterion laid down.</p>

The issues raised are of considerable interest and of importance to an indeterminate number of same-sex partners who are, like the petitioner, not content with the grant of substantial equivalence to marriage so far as the general rights and responsibilities attaching to that status are concerned but who, in the words of the petitioner, &#8220;are forced to have our lawful marriage reduced to the status of a civil partnership&#8221; and who consider that the offering of &#8220;a lesser status of registering a civil partnership to lesbian and gay couples, while reserving marriage for heterosexual couples, is deeply discriminatory&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I readily understand that view, it seems to be questionable whether it is one of <span style="font-style:italic">general</span> public importance or one which the public interest requires should<span style="font-style:italic"/>be resolved, at least in the sense in which those considerations have previously led to the grant of a PCO<span style="font-style:italic">.  </span>This is indeed a case where the law is clear, that is to say where the distinction between marriage and civil partnership is clearly laid down and readily applicable without doubt or difficulty.  No process of clarification is necessary.  There is no question as to whether the law is being fairly or evenly applied; nor is any novel or allegedly unfair action on the part of the executive under challenge; nor is the action brought to uphold or further some matter of broad environmental or social benefit to the community.  In short, the action is being brought, not to uphold the law, as recently laid down by Parliament, but to secure its change.  Put in that way, it is difficult to see that the public interest requires change so soon after the passage of the relevant legislation and the general welcome it has received.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to (1) (iii), I find the requirement that the applicant should have &#8220;no private interest in the outcome&#8221; a somewhat elusive concept to apply in any case in which the applicant, either in private or public law proceedings is pursuing a personal remedy, albeit his or her purpose is essentially representative of a number of persons with a similar interest.  In such a case, it is difficult to see why, if a PCO is otherwise appropriate, the existence of the applicant&#8217;s private or personal interest should disqualify him or her from the benefit of such an order.  I consider that, the nature and extent of the &#8220;private interest&#8221; and its weight or importance in the overall context should be treated as a flexible element in the court&#8217;s consideration of the question whether it is fair and just to make the order.  Were I to be persuaded that the remaining criteria are satisfied, I would not regard requirement 1(iii) as fatal to this application.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have already indicated, it seems to me, at this preliminary stage at least, that the applicant&#8217;s prospects of success are substantially in doubt and depend upon establishing propositions which extend well beyond the present bounds of English and European jurisprudence.  While the issues are of public interest and importance in the sense that any question of alleged discrimination deserves public concern and the court&#8217;s attention, the issue raised in this case relates to a measure carefully and recently considered and passed by Parliament with a view to producing equivalence, in a context in which the ECtHR clearly recognises the margin of appreciation and permits it to operate.  Further, there is scant evidence before me that a substantial number of same-sex couples are in the same position as the petitioner and first respondent, or consider that the status, rights, and responsibilities accorded to them under the <span style="font-style:italic">Civil Partnership Act</span> disadvantage or demean them in any way in comparison to married couples.  In the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the issues raised require resolution as a matter of general public importance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nor do I find that criteria 1(iv) and (v) are satisfied.  This is a case where those acting for the applicant are doing so pro bono. Pursuant to criterion (2), that  consideration has the potential to enhance the merits of the application for a PCO but it is not alone sufficient.  It is plain, and must have been plain to the petitioner and first respondent from the outset that, challenging as they do the basis of the traditional and fundamental definition of marriage, and the Government&#8217;s recent decision to preserve that status and institution as distinct from civil partnership, there was bound to be intervention by the Government in resistance to the petitioner&#8217;s claim, with the potential liability for costs which such intervention would carry.  Despite that, the petitioner took a measured decision to proceed with the support of Liberty and pro bono representation.  In this situation, as a matter of fairness and justice between the parties, it does not seem to me unreasonable, unfair or unjust, in the absence of evidence of real hardship, that the petitioner should be at risk of at least a contribution to the costs of an intervenor who has a proper interest in opposing the claim.  So far as criterion 1(v) is concerned, having recited and considered the financial resources of the petitioner and first respondent, it does not seem to me that, whether from their savings or by way of a loan, they would be unable to meet an order for costs if an award of costs were considered appropriate at the end of the litigation.  They are at no risk of liability in respect of the petitioner&#8217;s own costs and, as the statement of the petitioner makes clear, theirs was a measured decision to proceed as a matter of principle.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Against that background, I find the wording of the petitioner&#8217;s statement on the question of her costs illuminating.  She does not say that if the order is not made she will &#8220;probably discontinue the proceedings&#8221;, but, in a carefully worded statement says simply that: &#8220;if a PCO is not granted, we would have to seriously consider whether or not we would continue with the case.&#8221;  In the light of that careful phrasing, and bearing in mind the resolve of the petitioner and the assistance available to her, I do not think that it is probable that she will discontinue if she is refused the PCO which she seeks, at least provided the costs which she faces are quantified on a reasonable basis.  In that respect, having investigated the matter with Ms Mountfield in the course of argument, it appears that the Crown&#8217;s estimate of the costs of the proceedings (including this application) was reached on the basis that the trial of the action would take four days.  In my view, two days should be sufficient and, in those circumstances, I propose to impose a cap of &#163;25,000 upon any sum which may ultimately be awarded to the Lord Chancellor on account of costs.</p>
