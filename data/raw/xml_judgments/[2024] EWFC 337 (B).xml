When his mother had moved to live independently, Father remained living with his grandmother. When Father was about 12 or 13 years old he started to help his grandmother who had been diagnosed with [a debilitating] Disease, eventually becoming her carer. As a result of the impact of being a young carer, Father exhibited challenging behaviours as a young adolescent and describes himself as &#8216;emotionally reactive&#8217; at that time. He is insightful into the impact of him being a young carer and describes a lack of support around him to help him manage. He was particularly impacted by the death of his grandfather.</span></p>

It is clear that much of the information she received concerning the father&#8217;s alleged abuse and controlling behaviour came from the MGM.

She described their relationship as &#8220;loving&#8221;, with &#8220;disagreements being resolved by giving each other space and talking later. Mother also stated that &#8220;father could be angry when playing on games console, but this had changed during the pregnancy&#8221;. &#8220;I asked mother whether she noted any controlling or abusive behaviours from father; she no.&#8221; She used visual tools and was quite involved in discussing abuse and was satisfied that mother had understanding. Indeed she made disclosures about previous partners but not the father. Disclosures by mother about the father were only made after the injuries to A. She was also of the opinion that the mother was &#8220;ambivalent&#8221; about her separation from the father, due to her own feelings for him, the separation was for A.</span></p>

She visited on 2 days later when A was weighed and there were no concerns, nothing unusual. I note that her notes state &#8220;she (mother) rang father one morning when A was crying. Father provided lots of reassurance and told mother to place baby down safety and walk away, which she did&#8221;.

I do, for now, note that there was no mention of A having urinated on her sister&#8217;s baby&#8217;s nappies as the reason for the phone call as mother claimed in her oral evidence.

It is clear that there is no love lost between her and the father and she willingly admitted that she and he did not get on and that she tolerated him for the sake of her daughter: &#8220;He was not what I wanted for my daughter&#8221;. I found her to be basically an honest witness but it was clear that her personal opinion of the father has impacted upon how she perceives matters. She cannot be considered to be independent, her dislike of the father was apparent throughout and this may mean a tendency to think the worst of him and the best of her daughter. As well as seeing some of the couple&#8217;s behaviour herself, she has also clearly received a detailed narrative of the father&#8217;s alleged behaviour from the mother&#8217;s point of view and seemingly simply accepted this as the truth. The majority of her evidence about the father was not what she herself has witnessed but what her daughter has told her. Her evidence was overwhelmingly negative about the father but when pressed she was not able to provide much of a basis for this. She spoke of her &#8220;gut feeling&#8221; &#8211; a phrase also used at times by the mother in her live evidence. </span></p>

In reality the only matters that she could point to in evidence were the issues of the gender reveal party, the argument near father&#8217;s home and him calling the mother stupid. She was defensive of the mother, taking what the mother told her at face value as being the truth, likely as this fitted in with her perception of the father. An example of this was the father&#8217;s allegation that the mother had struck him with a boot; she would not accept that it could be true or that it was even possible that her daughter had done that as there was no mark from the boot on him. There was no thought that such an assault may not produce a mark.  </span></p>

The father simply sought to have the party nearer to him for his own personal reasons whereas the mother wanted it at home for her personal reasons. It was simply an argument, a difference of opinion but this then was used by the mother and the MGM as an example of his alleged controlling behaviour. It is not. During the incident and argument near father&#8217;s home it is clear that both parents now admit to being drunk and behaving badly. The MGM has only the mother&#8217;s description of the events prior to the phone call from her daughter, and which it appears were not entirely open and frank. She heard very little of the events even during the call &#8211; she simply  &#8220;didn&#8217;t like the way he spoke to her or was with her&#8221;. In relation to name calling, both the parents admit to calling each other names and there is no evidence that either was worse than the other. She herself heard them shouting at each other over the phone on some occasions and she had felt the need to go upstairs and intervene, to tell the mother to stop. In my judgment, her evidence fell far short of establishing that the father was controlling of the mother. It was very one sided.  Additionally she admitted that she has never seen him being violent or lose his temper.</span></p>

She accepted that this was one occasion only and he never repeated it again after she had offered guidance. It was clear that she wholly blames him for the incident when she had to collect her daughter from father&#8217;s home town in the middle of the night, despite them both being very drunk and her being unaware of the true events, accepting her daughters version as gospel despite the circumstances. Indeed she appears to believe everything her daughter has told her about the father as the truth, even when denied, such as holes in walls and broken monitors. She appeared to be reluctant to accept the nurse&#8217;s description of the father as being &#8220;very gentle and loving&#8221; with A and in response brought up an occasion when she said the father has moved her legs like a frog. She saw his wanting to hold A on the few days he visited as being possessive. In my judgment she sought to place the father in the most negative light possible at every opportunity, without actually having evidence to support the same. I accept that she was being truthful in her evidence but it was far from independent and her beliefs and opinions are clearly skewed in favour of her daughter.</span></p>

She was also reluctant to accept that the mother may have been extremely upset as father described in the phone call, although she then accepted that she was not there.

Whilst appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of medical experts, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence. The roles of the court and the expert are distinct. It is the court that is in the position to weigh up expert evidence against the other evidence (see A County Council &amp; K, D, &amp;L <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/144" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 851" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 851</ref> per Charles J).

They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others. As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process that might inelegantly be described as "story-creep" may occur without any necessary inference of bad faith&#8221;.</span></p>

It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child.</span></p>

As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, "nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another". Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their longsuffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm. This professional and realistic approach allowed the Court to focus on what was, in reality, the only live issue, namely; was GL's history of violence sufficient to lead to a finding of failure to protect upon the mother's part?&#8221; Similar points were made in G-L-T (Children) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2019/717" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCA Civ 717" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCA Civ 717</ref>.</span></p>

Hayden J addressed in detail the issue of propensity evidence and criminal matters at paragraphs 37 to 42 and in family matters from paragraphs 43 to 51. Mr Justice Hayden underlined the duty on judges to draw on the totality of a wide canvas of evidence and, where that evidence permits, to identify the perpetrator of significant harm. He reminded us that this evaluation is carried out on the balance of probabilities (nothing more, nothing less) and, while this builds in a risk of error, lawyers and judges should not shirk that obligation out of an abundance of caution. The wide canvas of evidence invariably includes a variety of evidence, including hearsay and evidence of propensity to cause harm. Drawing together that evidence and properly drawing inferences from it assists in building a picture of the family&#8217;s life at the point at which significant harm is caused. Identifying the perpetrator avoids tainting the non-perpetrator parent while also providing the foundations for constructive and safe strategies for a child&#8217;s future care.</span></p>

She has set out to paint him in the poorest possible light yet without any evidence to support her claims &#8211; either historic or at the time of the injuries. No allegations about the alleged incidents in the night time were mentioned to any professional at the time and the mother&#8217;s later suggestions or explanations that this was she was basically scared of the father (or indeed his mother) simply do not ring true and are wholly unsubstantiated. In my judgment these allegations were made to either divert attention from herself or to muddy the waters about the father. She on several occasions denied any abuse by the father to the nurse even when spoken to on her own and at no stage did she accuse the father of abuse or state that she was scared of him. The same is true for her police interview, where she initially refers to the father as being violent towards her and then admits that he was never physically violent to her, instead he would &#8220;just be quiet&#8221; or &#8220;ignore her&#8221;.  I do not accept that she was being honest with much of her evidence. This includes her numerous claims in her oral evidence to have reported things to a variety of professionals, co-incidentally none of whom appears to have taken any notes, recorded or reported the same. It simply does not ring true that so many professionals would forget to record so many statements by the mother about her beliefs or accusations. One example is her assertion that the nurse told her she could stop breast feeding, another is that she claimed to have told someone about the possibility of the father injuring A by winding her prior to the discovery of the rib fractures and she also claimed in her oral evidence that she had claimed that she told the professionals about the father &#8220;she wont fucking shut up&#8221; comment. There is no reference to this comment before her final statement &#8211; it is not in the evidence of the nurse, nor any of the social workers evidence and it is not in her own police interview.

Having identified the alleged lies in issue, the court must ask itself whether the local authority has proved, on the simple balance of probabilities, that the alleged lie has been told. The court must accordingly seek to distinguish a lie from, for example, &#8220;story creep&#8221;, mistake, confusion, memory failure or distortion arising from impairment. Once the court has undertaken that analysis it moves to consider why the proven (or accepted) lie has been told. This is important because people may lie for many different reasons - embarrassment, a sense of shame for having caused an injury accidentally, a desire to hide some other wrong-doing or a mistaken belief that lying might improve their position. Of course, it is also imperative that the court reminds itself that just because a person lies about one issue, it does not automatically follow that they have lied about everything.</span></p>

I do not intend to address them all, it is unnecessary, but I will highlight a few others which are particularly relevant to the picture of the father which the mother sought to paint. An example is in her initial statement when she is seeking to show that the father was rough with A and she claims that &#8220;My mum tried multiple times to show father how to change A as he would try and force her legs into her baby grow.&#8221; The MGM&#8217;s evidence was clear, though maybe rather grudgingly, that this had happened on one occasion and she then showed him what to do and he learned. Another is her repeated references to the father&#8217;s alleged temper and controlling behaviour towards her but for which she was unable to provide any coherent evidence and indeed admitted that father was never violent but walked away.</span></p>

I make this finding as I found the MGM to be a mainly truthful witness and I accept her version of events, which is that she thought her daughter was coping. I accept that she has tended to see her daughter in the best possible light and the father in the worst but I do not accept that she was lying in her evidence which was clear that she was unaware of the extent of the mother&#8217;s difficulties and minimised the issues as being &#8220;just a new baby&#8221;. Her personal animosity towards the father meant that her evidence was in my judgment rather skewed in favour of the mother. She was of course away or working during this period and did not see the mother when she was possibly at her lowest. I compare her comments to the quite graphic descriptions by the family nurse of the mother being overwhelmed. I wholly accept the evidence of the family nurse which said that the mother was under pressure and was not coping. The fact that mother does not admit or hid that she was not coping is not suggestive of guilt for actually causing the injuries but may have been done out of pride, not wanted to admit how hard she was finding it and that she was indeed overwhelmed. </span></p>

I accept this was also the case for the father but I will address this separately. There were many instances were mother appeared to be deflecting with her answers by not remembering or saying different things to her written evidence and she appeared to be easily suggestible to expanding her answers, possibly to show that she was trying to answer or if she thought it could assist her position. Overall, she was a poor witness and her answers occasionally became more detailed as people can tend to do when they are lying. Again I think she was simply trying to paint the picture that father was responsible. She claimed to have gaps in her memory where she couldn&#8217;t remember things which did not assist her case but then conversely claimed, as an example, to precisely remember her sister being present at the day of the phone call to the father even though she had never mentioned this before. The father was adamant in his written evidence that the mother was alone and this is reflected in his police interview and conversation with the nurse. He accepts that one of the mother&#8217;s brother&#8217;s may have been present but it was clear that the issue was the mother being alone without any support on the day. </span></p>

Instead he remained resolute that he could not remember and this rang true. Indeed he was vague as to his memory of various dates and events during his evidence, but since he is not making any specific allegations against the mother or others, and his case is that he does not recall any events which may have caused harm to A, again this is credible. He simply was living day to day and there were no issues of concern to him. Even when he reported the phone call in his evidence he makes no allegation against the mother and when he told the nurse of the phone call (&#8220;one morning&#8221;), this was not done in an accusing manner but was reporting how he had been concerned about mother and told her to place A down and walk away. It predates the discovery of any injuries and I accept this was done out of concern, certainly not as any accusation. The family nurse also records that mother rang her a few days earlier seeking support for the same issues. It is likely that the calls were within the same period of time as the issues are so similar and this was the worst period for A and mother&#8217;s inability to settle her. </span></p>

Mother submitted for the first time in her oral evidence that her upset was due to A having urinated on her sisters nappies. This was never mentioned to the father (I accept his evidence of this) and it was not mentioned to the police, family nurse or any social workers. It was mentioned to the grandmother at some point later, but since she has taken and accepted whatever her daughter says as fact it is merely hearsay and not corroborative evidence. There is simply no reason for the father to lie about whether the issue of the nappies was mentioned, no motive for lying. There is motive for the mother in lying, in order to minimise how poorly she was coping and to give justification for the stress and phone call. I prefer the evidence of the family nurse that at the time of this call &#8211; and the precise date is not crucial for the purposes of this judgment &#8211; the mother was overwhelmed and not coping. I also accept that the mother was alone on the day (save for maybe a younger brother) as father states. Again there was no reason for him to lie when he discussed the call with the nurse and if the sister was present, as mother claimed in her oral evidence (but not in any contemporaneous, timely or written evidence), then mother could have asked her for help but would likely have mentioned it to the father. She was seeking help and the father suggested she put A down and walk away for a break, not seek help from someone at the house as would surely have been the case if she was not alone. It is yet another of the mother&#8217;s inconsistencies and embellishments in an attempt to discredit the father and therefore appear more positive herself.</span></p>

In her initial statement, she clearly wrote &#8220;I cannot say that there was any memorable event that happened when A was in my care that would cause these injuries.&#8221; It is clear from her own evidence that the father did not have sole care of A, when she was not present, on any occasion. The only time he was ever alone with A was a short time when they were out and the period where mother alleged the injuries happened, when she was in fact lying right next to them. It is extremely hard to see the opportunity, let alone the motive, for the father to injure A when her mother was lying next to her. Despite this lack of coherent opportunity (and her own responses to the events she alleges), this then changed throughout her written and oral evidence. There were discrepancies as to who woke first &#8211; her or the father, whether she was woken by A&#8217;s cry or by the father, how long she was asleep, whether and when the father was asleep, how long father looked after A &#8211; 10 minutes or more than an hour and how long it took to settle A &#8211; 30 minutes to 90 minutes. Her evidence about A&#8217;s &#8220;piercing cry&#8221; is also not credible. She stated in her oral evidence that the father woke her to help her as he could not cope but also that she woke whenever A cried in the night. It is simply not credible that such a cry as she describes would not have woken her, however tired she was. What is also not credible is that having heard such a cry she mentioned it to no-one at the time the injuries were discovered, to none of the professionals at the hospital, not to the family nurse, she never asked the father about it and remained silent even when she knew her child had been seriously injured. In her oral evidence, she claimed that she believed it was father from when they were at the hospital but that she did not say anything as she was intimidated by the father and his mother at the hospital. I simply do not accept that. Even her own mother&#8217;s evidence showed that mother was quite capable of standing up for herself against the father. There is also an example of this with the foster carer who she challenged.</span></p>

In her initial statement she says that on waking at 7am the mark was not noticeable. In her live evidence she had not seen the mark until changing the nappy much later in the day at 5.30; the same time as it was noticed by the MGM. In her initial statement she says that she noticed it &#8220;earlier that day&#8221;. What is clear is that they each stated that they thought the marks may have been something different but no-one accused another of being responsible at the time, despite the mother claiming in evidence that even a few days after the hospital admission, when they were still at the hospital, she though father was to blame. Indeed the contemporaneous hospital notes set out no such beliefs or allegations but rather the mother&#8217;s support for father, the closeness of their relationship and disbelief that either could be thought responsible. Yet another contradiction in the mother&#8217;s evidence. </span></p>

In my judgment, the mother has failed to establish that any of the father&#8217;s alleged behaviours suggest that he would have been more likely to injure A. I do not accept that the father has been violent to the mother; indeed she accepts this herself. He has a conviction for criminal damage at his grandmother&#8217;s property which predates these issues by a considerable time and no other convictions. The offence was also when the father was younger and under considerable stress in caring for an elderly infirm relative at a very young age. There is no evidence that he was ever violent towards mother or even particularly argumentative with any of her family or that he would be violent to A. The family nurse&#8217;s evidence, the contact supervisors and indeed the mother&#8217;s and even the grandmother&#8217;s evidence was that he was gentle and loved A. He was open and reflective, in his evidence, about his childhood difficulties and this was echoed by the social worker in her assessment. </span></p>

Father&#8217;s evidence that he cannot really remember the night in question itself is in my judgment credible, to him it was a normal night when care was shared as agreed on other occasions. I preferred the father&#8217;s evidence to that of the mother&#8217;s. He was in simple terms, much more credible. I do not accept that the father&#8217;s comments about &#8220;taking the blame&#8221; are indicative of guilt as mother submits, they are not an admission.</span></p>

The reality of this matter is that this is a sad case, with a young mother as primary carer who was under considerable stress with a poorly and fractious baby and she was overwhelmed and not coping. The father had extremely limited opportunities to harm A and any evidence of the mother that he did precisely this is countered by her own evidence that she saw and heard nothing at the time, followed only by her attempts to place father in the frame at a later date. The only opportunities the father had were a few minutes when they were out for the day together when mother reported nothing unusual at all, and somewhere between 10 minutes to an hour or so, depending on which version of mother&#8217;s evidence you choose to believe (10 minutes said to the nurse became over an hour in her live evidence), when she was lying next to them in the bed on the night in question. Even then, she reported her concerns to no-one and her description of events has varied to widely as to be almost now incomprehensible. In short, he had practically no opportunity to cause the injuries, whether they occurred on one of more occasions. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.27in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:#000000">The mother, however, had considerable opportunity. She was the primary carer apart from the few occasions when the father was also present, and her mother had little input in reality, certainly insufficient for her to be placed in the pool of perpetrators. The MGM herself in her evidence was clear that she had never had sole care of A and I accept her evidence of this. The period for the injuries is around x - x 2024 for the bruises (but this is not necessarily accurate due to dating issues) and y - y  2024 for the rib fractures. It cannot be ascertained whether there was one of more event which caused them. What can be said with certainly is that the mother was present with A throughout that period. I accept also that the mother was alone with A without any support for a period of up to 3 days, during the days when her mother was at work and her sister at hospital giving birth. Any incident which occurred then would be unwitnessed and unreported. It is also likely due to the evidence which I have already addressed that the phone call to the father, which was effectively a cry for help when she was at the end of her tether, was within that same period.</span></p>

She phoned the family nurse for help a few days before the hospital admission and the father around the same period. The coherent evidence points towards the mother being alone and having a loss of control on one or more occasions during this period. Mother&#8217;s claims to the contrary or that it was the father to blame was simply not credible. None of her allegations against him stood up to challenge and they were not substantiated. Conversely the father&#8217;s evidence in respect of the mother remained unshaken, he did not seek to blame her for the injuries other than on the basis that it was not him so it must be mother. He struggled to believe it, it is clear from his evidence. He even stated that he would still be happy for the mother to still  care for A, although he later reconsidered this. He gave evidence that the mother herself had a temper and could be violent &#8211; on their night out near father&#8217;s home  and another occasion hitting him with a boot, something he immediately and contemporaneously reported to the mother&#8217;s mother although she chose not to believe him. The father was not under stress &#8211; he was only assisting in care on weekends in the main and was sleeping and rested. His main areas of stress appear to be from gaming and he stated in evidence that this is no longer as much of an issue, indeed mother accepted that he had improved in this regard during the pregnancy. Mother&#8217;s evidence was that when stressed otherwise he withdrew and became silent. </span></p>

It is possible that the mother did not fully appreciate what she had done at the time because A was so ill and suffering from reflux and she could not necessarily recognise a stronger cry from a squeeze to ribs causing a fracture to a cry from merely being very poorly with reflux but I accept the medical evidence that she knew that something unusual had occurred and chose to hide it.  The mother was alone at the time when the injuries occurred and no-one else witnessed the cries. She told no-pone of what had happened or any concerns she may have had. She was also a new, young and inexperienced mother. I am unable to say factually precisely how the injuries occurred as no mechanism has been suggested by either parent in their evidence. I accept the evidence of the medical experts in that regard.</span></p>
