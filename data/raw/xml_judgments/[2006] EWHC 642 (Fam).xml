	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two issues for resolution in order to determine whether the Petitioner, Patricia Alfonso-Brown, is entitled to any of the relief which she seeks from the Respondent, Robinson Milwood. The first is whether the events which occurred at a ceremony which took place at Osu in Accra, Ghana on 27 December 1997 would constitute a marriage in accordance with the customary law of the Ga people, of which group the Petitioner is a Ga-speaking member. Logically, the second question only arises if the answer to the first is positive: did the Respondent intend there and then to marry her, such intention being a necessary ingredient for such a marriage to be potentially effective? In the event, as will appear, I feel confident about the findings of fact I will make in relation to the state of the Respondent&#8217;s mind and his intentions, whatever the true answer be to the first question of fact I have posed, whether as a matter of Ghanaian law this ceremony could give rise to a customary marriage recognised in that country. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have referred to the ceremony being &#8216;potentially&#8217; effective, because the Respondent was at that date (as has been clearly established) still validly monogamously married to another woman whom I will call W1. Thus the marriage ceremony (if it would otherwise have been effective) would have been void for bigamy, both in Ghana and here, and therefore a nullity. That notwithstanding, if yes is the answer to both questions then the Petitioner would be entitled to a decree of nullity and thus to pursue financial claims in these proceedings. </p>

For the point has been made that now it is clearly established that any otherwise effective marriage would have been void for bigamy she does not need to seek any further declaration or order to enable her to regard herself and to be regarded by others as free of any matrimonial bond to the Respondent. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These parties met in about 1991 when the Respondent employed the Petitioner, then as now said to be a student, as a part-time assistant at a day nursery for which he had administrative responsibility. The Petitioner made it clear in one of the three affidavits she has filed in connection with these proceedings that their immediate affinity soon translated into a sexual relationship. At the time the Petitioner was herself married, and her own first marriage was not dissolved until 1994. From an early stage in their relationship however, according to her, she understood from the Respondent that he was no longer married to W1, that is to say that they were legally divorced. But when attempting a verbatim account of what she said he had said to her on the topic she attributed to him words and expressions far less definitive and far more ambiguous. Thus, she told me, he had from an early stage said his marriage was &#8216;over&#8217;, an equivocal expression. This trait or tendency to draw firm conclusions from words neutral in their effect was a feature of her evidence, and may well be a feature of her thought processes.</p>

In May 2004 there was a disagreeable confrontation when the Petitioner and a number of her supporters came to the church. The Respondent says that that was the first time that anyone had suggested that they were married as a result of what took place in Ghana, and that the purpose of the meeting was to extort money from him. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Certainly the initiation of formal hostilities in June 2004 had a financial flavour. The Respondent received notification of matrimonial home cautions placed on three properties owned and rented out by him in North London, and of allegations leading to restrictions on the title of three others on the basis that they were held by him on trust for the Petitioner. No evidence whatsoever supports the proposition which would properly found either inhibition. It does not, for instance, appear that the Petitioner asserts that either of them ever lived at these alleged matrimonial homes, far less that they did so or intended to do so together. The Respondent&#8217;s solicitors asked in vain for evidence of the basis on which the claims were asserted. They also asked for evidence that the parties were married. It is true that a marriage certificate, said to have been misplaced, was referred to by the Petitioner&#8217;s solicitors in correspondence. It is to this day impossible to know what that document, first referred to in correspondence in July 2004, was as no copy of it has ever been produced. But for a time reliance was placed by the Petitioner on a document which I have seen, procured in Ghana in May 2005 by her younger sister Catherine (who gave evidence before me), and that sister&#8217;s Ghanaian husband who represented that he was the head of the Respondent&#8217;s family. It is sufficient to say that the document is a grotesque compendium of errors obtained by multiple misrepresentations. It proves nothing about the quality or effect of the ceremony itself. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A petition seeking dissolution of marriage was finally issued by the Petitioner in November 2004, based on what was said to constitute the Respondent&#8217;s adultery with the lady who was by then his current wife. The Respondent by his Answer denied that any ceremony of marriage had been performed, and said that if there was an apparently valid ceremony he had not consented to it so that it had had no effect. He asserted that what he had agreed to, and what he believed was happening, was a traditional engagement ceremony.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 9 June 2005 directions in the suit were given by a District Judge. The parties were to file affidavit evidence by specified dates, and to agree upon and jointly instruct an expert in Ghanaian customary marriages. The evidence was to be complete in time for an estimated two-day hearing of the suit on 20 October 2005. Clearly the obligation to file affidavit evidence would be intended to extend to any witnesses relied upon by either party, and was not meant to be limited to that of the parties themselves. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The timetable slipped and the expert eventually agreed had not reported by the date of the hearing. Meanwhile, however, the Respondent had raised the point, and established by documentary evidence, that his marriage to W1 still subsisted at the date of the Ghana ceremony, and thus that even if what happened in Ghana could have amounted to a valid marriage there it was in fact ineffective, and would not be recognised here in any event. Baron J agreed, and made a declaration to the effect that in December 1997 the Respondent was not capable of entering into a valid marriage with the Petitioner, with the consequences just stated. She thereupon dismissed the prayer for dissolution of marriage in the Petition, but gave leave to the Petitioner to amend to seek a decree of nullity. </p>

This obviously crucial evidence, the only reliable evidence of what in fact transpired, was not made available to the Respondent until December 2005 as a result of a direction given by Baron J, and I will comment upon it to some extent at this point. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is very lengthy (of the order of three hours) and the language used is almost entirely Ga. At very late stages of these proceedings, (including during the course of the hearing before me this month), the Petitioner sought to rely on three successive purported translations. They were not consistent with each other and were evidently partial in both senses of the word. They were hopelessly incomplete, and included biased comment to the effect that this video was of a marriage ceremony. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A clearly much more comprehensive, and virtually uncontested translation, setting out the Ga text alongside the English translation, was commissioned by the Respondent in the interval between the second and third days of the hearing before me. Mr Benedict, by then counsel for the Petitioner, accepted the accuracy of the translation but for one word. He contended that a phrase translated as &#8216;wishing to engage&#8217; the Petitioner in fact means &#8216;wishing to marry&#8217; her. If so, it is surprising that none of the purported transcripts produced for the Petitioner include what she would regard as so favourable a reference to marriage, from her point of view. Mr Benedict&#8217;s assertion, made on instructions as he is not a Ga-speaker, was however unsubstantiated and had no evidence to support it. Overnight the Respondent&#8217;s solicitors did what they could to check and, for what it is worth, their second-hand information tends to confirm that the word used is specific to engagement rather than to marriage. In fact, as I find, in context there would be no particular significance if the word and phrase used did anticipate a marriage following at some stage after what clearly at the very least (as the Petitioner accepts), started off as an engagement ceremony. The question on which I heard so much oral and expert evidence is whether the engagement was immediately followed by a marriage ceremony, seamlessly as it were, on that same occasion.</p>

In circumstances the detail of which emerges from the rulings I made at the time I declined to admit a lengthy affidavit from an extraneous witness which had very much at the last minute been served, but permitted the Petitioner to call her sister Catherine, whose statement had apparently been prepared at the beginning of September 2005 but not served nor even referred to until the week before the February hearing. I also declined the request of Miss Villarosa (who represented the Petitioner until shortly before the third day of the resumed hearing before me) for an adjournment to instruct another expert and for a proper transcript of the video to be obtained, again for the reasons I then expressed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The expert evidence in the case came from Professor Woodman of the University of Birmingham School of Law, who was jointly instructed. He has made intensive study of Ghanaian customary family law and has written extensively on the topic over forty years. He produced a number of written reports. In making his first he was hampered by the fact that he did not receive the video. He was further hampered in relation to all his reports (but not in respect of the second tranche of oral evidence which he gave before me on 16 February 2006) by the absence of any reliable transcript, given that he does not speak the primary language of the tape, Ga. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Professor Woodman&#8217;s opinion, once he had seen the video, was that the first and longest part (extending to just over an hour) recorded a traditional engagement. The Petitioner expressly accepts that this was so. The question therefore becomes, what if any features of what happened in that first part or subsequently point towards a marriage having been seamlessly solemnised then and there; and what is their cumulative effect in informing the Professor&#8217;s opinion. Save to say that he did not suggest that I would be wrong to attach weight to them, he was however careful not to comment directly on the way in which the video was captioned, and on the admitted fact that on the conclusion of the engagement section mementos were distributed to those present which were inscribed with reference to the parties&#8217; engagement, rather than to any marriage. </p>

Miss Villarosa set out those features in detail in a written submission dated 9 February 2006 summarising the Petitioner&#8217;s case as it had by then developed. A number of the specifics upon which she relies in paragraph 2 of that document are in my view neutral in that they would apply equally to an engagement ceremony. Such neutral factors include that this was an occasion attended by senior members of the family, and that during the first hour of the video before an exclusively female audience comprising neither party there was a series of formal presentations of cash and gifts appropriate to an engagement. The presentation of a hymn book and money with which to buy a bible do not point specifically to a marriage rather than to an engagement. The lady conducting the ceremony did not refer to either of the conjoined rings as a wedding ring. </p>

The envelope and its contents were described as dowry in the middle part of the ceremony, where the Petitioner&#8217;s family representative recounts what has taken place before the audience of women to a group of men including no doubt the head of the Petitioner&#8217;s household in a short sequence in an internal room.

She then enters from the house attended by her spokeswoman and a number of children who are fanning her. She dances her way between the tables and seats herself next to the Respondent. People are eating and singing all around them, but they are the only people at the table. They are then shown standing with a lady next to them dressed in blue whose identity and function was never explained in evidence, and the two spokeswomen. The lady in blue holds the ring and offers up a prayer to which those present respond by saying &#8216;Amen&#8217;. The prayer apparently offers thanks to God and invites the man to place the ring on the wife&#8217;s finger. It is quite evident from the video that no one is translating the proceedings or any part of them to the Respondent. The Respondent places the ring on the Petitioner&#8217;s finger and the woman dressed in blue can just be heard softly to say in English words including &#8216;The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit&#8217;. Neither party says anything at all throughout this part of the proceedings. He then kisses her and presents her with a bouquet of flowers from the table. Some photographs are taken. The scene then moves to them standing by a cake which they ceremonially cut. A male voice over the loudspeaker system encourages those present to hooray and some do so. It does not appear that the whole of the audience are intent upon watching this sequence, and indeed there is continuous movement as people move to and fro fetching and carrying food and drink. The film then moves to a sequence where the Petitioner is shown dancing first with another woman and then with the Respondent. The entire passage from where the parties are first shown standing by the table with the unknown woman in blue through to the conclusion of the cake cutting takes a mere two minutes on the video. The title &#8216;Engagement Day&#8217; continues periodically to be superimposed from time to time throughout the video, at least up to this point. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With what seem to me to be very considerable reservations Professor Woodman came round to the view that the references to dowry pointed sufficiently to this being a ceremony involving marriage for him to conclude that that is what it was. He regarded these references (none of which, I emphasise, took place in the Respondent&#8217;s presence or hearing) as tipping the balance. Contrary factors (before consideration is given to any relevant inferences which may be drawn from the Petitioner&#8217;s evidence) were that he had never heard of a combined ceremony such as this. Indeed Professor Woodman&#8217;s opinion and experience (both direct and recounted to him) was that the suggested combination of engagement and marriage ceremony into one event was unique. There would be no reason to have an engagement ceremony at all if the intention was to proceed immediately, or indeed later, to marriage but such an engagement was usual. He did have experience, where there was urgency, of the two ceremonies being separated by a few days. That said, he did not rule out the possibility that the families (or, in this case, the Petitioner&#8217;s family and the Respondent personally) might agree to celebrate an engagement and a marriage in this foreshortened manner.</p>

Gifts (including envelopes containing gifts of money, in this case &#163;20 or &#163;30) are made by the man, through his representative, to the woman&#8217;s family at each stage of the offer and acceptance ritual. Household goods, jewellery, clothing and cosmetics are carried in and handed over in the same way. There is a strong sense, confirmed by Professor Woodman, that what one is watching is in large measure well-established play-acting and includes lines recognisable and familiar to the audience, who respond with pleasure and expressions of humour at what for them are familiar and rather florid metaphors and amusing flights of fancy and of fantasy.</p>

Her final suggestion to support the proposition that a marriage took place proceeded on the basis that the words engagement and marriage are used interchangeably, but (somewhat contradictorily it would seem) references to husband and wife or to a couple as being engaged are used only when that is indeed their status. As I have said, Professor Woodman takes an opposite view. Nor does he agree with what became the Petitioner&#8217;s assertion that a combined ceremony all on one day was commonplace in 1997. </p>

She also, therefore, lacked intent as evidenced by the surrounding circumstances, such as the references to engagement on the video title and on the going-home presents for the guests distributed, be it noted, at the end of the engagement part of the ceremony rather than at what would be the end of the marriage ceremony if it had been a marriage.
