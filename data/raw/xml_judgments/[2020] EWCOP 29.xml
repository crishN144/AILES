The application is resisted on RS&#8217;s behalf by the Official Solicitor, represented by Ms Sophia Roper of counsel  At the outset of these proceedings, and having heard evidence from the jointly instructed expert Dr Lawson on the issue, I satisfied myself that RS continues to lack capacity to conduct these proceedings and that, accordingly, it remained appropriate for the Official Solicitor to act.  Dr Lawson had originally opined that, in addition to having capacity in all of the decision making domains with which the court is concerned, RS had capacity to conduct these proceedings.  However, having seen an attendance note dated 13 May 2020 and a statement dated 29 May 2020 provided by RS&#8217;s solicitor, Dr Lawson changed his position in oral evidence.  The local authority does not dispute that RS lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings.  The local authority also seeks a declaration that it is lawful to deprive RS of his liberty, asserting that the regime applicable in RS&#8217;s current placement amounts to a deprivation of liberty.   </p>

At his request, I also had the opportunity to meet RS (via a remote connection) prior to the hearing and to hear his views during the course of the hearing itself.  Finally, I have had the benefit of extensive and helpful written submissions from Mr Karim and Ms Roper. </p>

Having heard submissions I declined to deal with either of these applications.  In respect of both applications no formal application had been issued on notice to the Official Solicitor by the local authority, with respect to both applications the jointly instructed expert had not been asked to assess capacity to manage finances or to address the question of RS&#8217;s vulnerability to exploitation.  Within this context, I was satisfied that it would not be appropriate to embark on determining the oral applications the local authority sought to advance at this hearing.  In the circumstances, the issue before the court remains that articulated in paragraph 1 above.    </p>

This fetish involves adults role-playing a regression to an infant-like state, including the wearing of nappies.  Such conduct is not, subject to the ordinary boundaries delineated by the criminal law, unlawful.  The local authority contends however, and the Official Solicitor accepts that his fetish leads RS, in the exploration of his sexuality, to engage in risky behaviour, including contacting males on the Internet and thereafter going to meet them.  The local authority relies on a number of instances of such alleged behaviour as evidence that RS lacks capacity to make decisions with respect to his contact with others.  In particular: </p>

During crossexamination by Ms Roper, the allocated social worker Ms G stated that there had been some further incidents since the lockdown consequent upon the COVID-19 pandemic had come into force (which incidents related to financial conduct) but conceded that there had been a long gap between the last incident in July 2019 and these recent concerns about RS&#8217;s management of his finances. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In 2014 a specialist psychological assessment was completed on RS by Dr Lesley Taylor, Chartered Clinical Psychologist, a copy of which is in the bundle.  Dr Taylor noted that RS&#8217;s &#8220;ability to offer information with absolute certainty means that he presents with a cloak of competence&#8221; and that RS &#8220;sometimes misunderstands what is happening around him and does not always understand the requirements of him.&#8221;   However, it is clear from the report that Dr Taylor did not assess RS with a view to considering his capacity to make identified decisions within the criteria set out in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.

It is likely that he has coped with these events without appropriate care and direction and he may not have realised that some of his experiences have been abusive or inappropriate. As a result he may have an altered sense or benchmark for what is acceptable behaviour, especially masturbation, sexuality and in coping strategies. He may have been reliant on extreme family views, behaviour or the media as a guide to what is acceptable and as a result may be misinformed.&#8221; And: </p>

In June 2018 the local authority obtained a report from Dr Lisa Rippon, consultant developmental psychiatrist.  Dr Rippon was asked to opine on whether RS had capacity to make a decision in relation to consent to sexual relations and whether he had capacity to make a decision in relation to contact with others.  Whilst a capacity assessment by reference to the criteria set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>, Dr Rippon&#8217;s report is now two years old and deals with only two of the aspects of RS&#8217;s decision making that are in issue before the court. </p>

No party now seeks to suggest that RS lacks capacity to consent to sexual relations.  However, Dr Rippon also expressed some concern regarding RS being coerced into sex, stating that RS under-estimated his vulnerability and over-estimated his ability to protect himself.   </p>

He could identify a number of positives in the relationships which he has with others, including family members and also his care team. [RS] understands that these relationships are beneficial for his emotional well-being and the staff that he works with provide him with support in many areas of his life, which is a benefit to him. However, in relation to particularly potential sexual partners, in my opinion [RS] under-estimated his own vulnerability and over-estimated his ability to keep himself safe. I believe he has limited insight into why others may target him because of his interest in nappies and also because of his own vulnerability. Although [RS] could acknowledge that going to stay with a strange man could put him at risk, I believe that his understanding of how potentially dangerous this situation was is lacking, with him believing that he can keep himself safe. It is my opinion that [RS] would not be able to understand if another person was a risk to him and would struggle to say 'no' to a sexual advance from another person, even if he did not wish this act to occur, as was seen in his time at [Scotland]. It is my view that [RS] lacked understanding of the information necessary to make decisions around contact with others and was unable to weigh-up the positives and negatives of contact particularly with sexual partners. It is therefore my opinion that [RS] lacks capacity in this area. I believe that this is a consequence of his learning disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder.&#8221; </p>

Following the report of Dr Rippon, RS agreed to abide by rules governing his meeting strangers, a copy of which rules are contained in the bundle.

With my further understanding of him from the second assessment, it is my view now that he makes unwise decisions at those moments rather than his capacity being impaired. The chronology of his history, presented in my first report indicates that he has behaved in similar ways and for many years... my view as already stated above, is that [RS] understands and can use relevant information about the risk but is making unwise decisions, similar to reckless behaviour that other young adult may show (as per Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Z &amp; Ors</span> [2016] EWCOP - a case I was directed to in the Additional Questions).&#8221; And: </p>

However, my current view, following the second interview and evidence of change reported by [RS] and indicated in the 5th statement of the social worker, suggest that [RS] can modify his tendency to act impulsively, including deferring impulses to meet with people he chats with online, (in part with the support of his support plan, staff and others). There is evidence from the second interview and from the 5th statement of the social worker that despite frequent access to the internet and social media, [RS] is reported to make only a few arrangements a year to meet with strangers he chats with online, and he has not acted in this way for some time. To this extent, while he can be impulsive in his behaviour, he appears to have some control over it ('encouraged' in part by his concerns that the court may place restrictions on his access to social media if he is judged unable to make relevant decisions). [RS] is able to make wise decisions and resist his impulsive tendencies when he chooses to (with or without the support of others). I cannot currently therefore consider his impulsive behaviour to be abnormally impulsive. My view is that [RS] shows impulsive behaviour that may be risky, poorly thought through and prematurely acted on; he chooses to satisfy his short-term goals perhaps over long-term ones. This behavioural tendency can be considered to be understandable in the context of an adolescent or young adult showing poor judgement on occasions, including choosing to act recklessly. My current view is that [RS] makes unwise decisions.&#8221; </p>

[RS] reported he has developed a better understanding of the concerns of others about the risks he could face as a result of his behaviour of contacting and staying with strangers he met online. At the second interview, he was able to describe the risks to himself, the benefits of the support plans and he reflected on the consequences of his past behaviour of flouting rules he has himself set or agreed to. He described his changed attitude to his risk behaviours, explaining how the period of social isolation / 'lockdown', instructed by the government as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, has given him time to reflect. [RS] appeared to show improved insight, in part related to his reported anxiety that if he did not change, he risked consequences such as possible court-sanctioned restrictions on his risk behaviours. He was particularly concerned that he may lose unsupervised access to the internet and social media - and that this would limit his opportunities to engage in his online activities. It is not improbable that [RS&#8217;s] concerns about consequences has 'focused' his mind and has led to a change in attitude to risks and recognition of the need to work with others to mitigate risk associated with his need for gratification.&#8221; </p>

Whilst appropriately challenged by Mr Karim, Dr Lawson maintained his opinion and, in particular, re-emphasised the following matters: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.03in">The significance of the impact of RS&#8217;s learning disability and autism on his executive function articulated in Dr Lawson&#8217;s first report was highlighted in an attempt to draw a causative nexus between the first and second stage of the capacity case and it may have been the bridge.  Later analysis, including his second interview with RS, caused Dr Lawson to conclude that it is not possible to say RS&#8217;s difficulties with decision making result from an impairment in the functioning of his mind and brain, as opposed to from his psychological makeup, his sexual proclivities and desire and the fact he is a young man with a level of impulsivity commonly seen at his age, which factors cause him to make unwise but capacitous decision.  This was because of a number of factors. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.03in">It is important not to use repetitive risky behaviour to justify an assessment of lack of capacity (Dr Lawson using the example of a doctor who continues to smoke despite being fully cognisant of, and able to weigh up the risks of lung cancer, develops lung cancer and then goes back to smoking after the operation to remove the cancer).  Repeated risk taking behaviour may simply mean that the risk has been understood, weighed up and a decision made to take the risk again.  Why RS continues to behave in a risky manner is complex.  If stemmed from his learning disability and autism it would be seen in all areas, but it is not. </p>

Within this context Dr Lawson cautioned against making the mistake of attributing RS&#8217;s impulsive decision making to his learning disability and accepted the need to consider whether it in fact is motivated by elements of RS&#8217;s history and development and falls within the ordinary recklessness demonstrated by young people. </p>

Equally, in cases of vulnerable adults, there is a risk that all professionals involved with treating and helping that person &#8211; including, of course, a judge in the Court of Protection &#8211; may feel drawn towards an outcome that is more protective of the adult and thus, in certain circumstances, fail to carry out an assessment of capacity that is detached and objective.&#8221; </p>

Healthy risk-taking helps young people to learn. Some adolescent risktaking can be unhealthy and dangerous &#8211; casual sexual relationships, unprotected sex, driving too fast on the roads, excessive consumption of alcohol, consumption of non-prescribed drugs, dealing with anger and confrontation. These forms of risk-taking are inherently unwise and unsafe. In dealing with risk issues in relation to a young person in the context of assessment under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, it is necessary to separate out as far as is possible the evidence which indicates that second category of risk taking (unhealthy, dangerous, unwise) from that which reveals or may reveal a lack of capacity. As Lewison LJ said in PC v City of York (above) "adult autonomy" includes the freedom "to make unwise decisions, provided that they have the capacity to decide" (see [64]).&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The local authority has provided very limited evidence as to the question of capacity with respect to the decision making domains with which the court is concerned.  Ms G&#8217;s statements contain <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> detailed analysis of capacity with respect to any of the decision making domains with which the court is now concerned.  When giving oral evidence, Ms G did not expand in any meaningful way on her analysis of RS&#8217;s capacity in relation to each decision making domain by reference to the criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.  Where she did descend into detail, Ms G had a tendency to gravitate back to her assessment of RS&#8217;s capacity to manage his financial affairs when challenged to justify her assessment of capacity in the other decision making domains before the court.  There are examples in her statements of it being unclear whether, in assessing RS&#8217;s capacity, Ms G applied the criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>, she for example telling Dr Lawson that RS lacked capacity to make decisions about accessing the Internet and using social media because although he could understand the relevant information he could not act on his understanding.  At a number of points in her oral evidence Ms G gave the impression that an application had been made to the Court of Protection less on the basis of considerations of capacity and more because of a view that steps needed to be taken to protect RS. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In the circumstances, with respect to RS&#8217;s capacity in the relevant decision making domains, the evidence of the local authority is limited to the capacity assessment undertaken by Ms G on 21 February 2018, which relates only to RS&#8217;s capacity to manage his finances, and the COP 3 assessment of capacity undertaken by Ms G that I have summarised above, completed over a year ago in April 2019.  Insofar as the local authority also seeks to rely on the assessment undertaken by Dr Rippon in 2018 which, as I have noted, deals with only two of the decision making domains before the court and is now over two years old, I am satisfied in the circumstances the court cannot place any significant weight on that assessment.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Further, and within this context, beyond a series of generic assertions in the COP3 that RS demonstrates a lack of understanding upon being asked to repeat information and that he is &#8220;unable to weigh up the information due to him not being able to understand or retain the information&#8221; and &#8220;and therefore could not communicate his decision because of this&#8221;, there is again no real analysis by Ms G of the extent to which he can understand, retain and use or weigh the information relevant to making decisions in relation to each of the domains of decision making by reference to the examples of relevant information summarised above or otherwise. Ms G did seek to deploy the fact that RS has repeated the risky behaviour associated with his fetish as indicative of his lack of understanding of the information comprising the nature and extent of the risk.  However, considerable caution is needed with this contention.  As I have noted, risky behaviour is not inevitably evidence of a failure to understand the risk being taken or evidence of an inability to weigh that risk when deciding whether to act despite it.  The repetition of risky behaviour can also indicate that a person has understood the risk, weighed it and decided to take it anyway notwithstanding the dangers.   </p>

Beyond their contended for irrationality, at no point does Ms G depose to <span style="font-style:italic">why</span> these incidents demonstrate that RS is unable to understand, retain, use or weigh the information relevant to each decision as distinct from other possible reasons for his unwise and risky behaviour.  In this latter context, with respect to the question of causation, whilst Ms G gave evidence that, contrary to the evidence of Dr Lawson, RS&#8217;s decision making is impaired by his mild learning disability and his autism as opposed to any aspect of his personality, her rationale for reaching this conclusion was unclear.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Within this context, by far the most reliable evidence before the court regarding RS&#8217;s capacity is that of Dr Lawson.  Dr Lawson&#8217;s reports contain a detailed and nuanced analysis based on his interviews with RS and a careful review of the documentary evidence available, including the reports of Dr Taylor and Dr Rippon.  Dr Lawson is clear on his evaluation of capacity in each of the decision making domains that is before the court.  In oral evidence Dr Lawson stated that following his second assessment of RS he &#8220;could not have come to any conclusion other than [RS] has capacity.&#8221; </p>

Having regard to the reports of Dr Lawson, there is cogent evidence that he understands, retains and can use or weigh relevant information concerning his residence.  RS understood the difference between living in a place and visiting it, the differences between options and the advantages and disadvantages of the same.  He was clear about his history with respect to his residence and as to his current wishes in terms of residence.  He likewise was able to detail the support he would receive, the activities he would undertake and the rules applicable to his placement.  He was likewise able to detail some of the obligations owed to him by his landlord and understood the reciprocal nature of contracts.  RS had given consideration to the extent that the area in which he now resides is safe and had had no bad experiences in his current placement.  He did report negatively in respect of local noise.  RS demonstrated knowledge of what to do if he felt maltreated or abused by staff members.  During the course of his second interview with Dr Lawson, RS explained the advantages of his current residence. </p>

Once again, having regard to the reports of Dr Lawson, there is cogent evidence that he understands, retains and can use or weigh relevant information concerning his care.  RS described the relevant information during his interviews with Dr Lawson.  He was able to set out the care he can give himself and the support he is given with his care and by whom, including support with managing his finances, in respect of which he acknowledged his own difficulties, and his medical needs.  RS expressed himself content with these arrangements.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">With respect to the question of contact, the evidence before the court does demonstrate that RS is able to understand, retain and can use or weigh relevant information concerning his contact with others.  Dr Lawson&#8217;s conclusion in his report is clear and is informed by the further interview he had with RS.  In that interview, RS was able to articulate his reasons for not contacting strangers, the need to get to know people who he was talking to and not to exchanges addresses until this has been achieved.  RS was able to state why those caring for him were worried about his contacts in the past and was able to explain to Dr Lawson, without prompting, the nature of the risks associated with such contact.  Within this context, it is of note that the last incident of concern regarding RS having contact with men he had met on the Internet is over a year ago.  Further, when pressed by Mr Karim in cross-examination Dr Lawson reiterated that:  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">For the reasons I have articulated above, nothing in Ms G&#8217;s evidence is sufficiently cogent to gainsay this conclusion.  Moreover, I note that with respect to the occasion in February 2018 when RS went to stay with a male in [Scotland] and revealed, some weeks later, that the man was a registered sex offender who had forced RS to engage in sex, Ms G states that when RS was asked if he knew why professionals were worried about him, &#8220;RS said yes because he met a stranger who he didn&#8217;t know, RS said he could have been a rapist, murderer, child molester or paedo&#8221;.  RS informed her that having been told by professionals that the male in question was &#8220;not a nice man&#8221; RS said he did not want to go back to [Scotland] because of that.  With respect to the men that RS made contact with during April and May 2018, when asked why professionals were worried RS replied that it was because &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t really know&#8221; the men in question.  RS was also able to explain that one of the men in question was safer because he was in a similar situation to RS with support, with which proposition Ms G agreed.  Whilst Ms G concentrated heavily on the welfare consequences for RS of having contact with men he had contacted via the Internet or social media, as noted, the outcome of the decision made is not relevant to the question of whether the </p>

The fact that a decision to make contact with a man to satisfy fetish urge may be considered risky is not of itself evidence of a lack of capacity to take that decision.  The question remains whether RS can understand, retain and use or weigh information when making a decision whether to contact others.  The balance of the evidence before the court indicates that he can. </p>

During his second interview with Dr Lawson, RS was able to articulate an understanding of the risks of using the Internet and social media.  He was aware that he should not post or access offensive material online and retained his awareness of information relating to privacy online and recalled relevant information about sharing.  He was aware, for example, that privacy settings do not prevent screenshots being taken and shared more widely.  He was clear in his understanding that others he may meet online may not be who they say they are and that those who appeared to have his interests at heart may not do so.  He was able to articulate the risks to himself of using the Internet, including sexual, financial, emotional and/or physical harm.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Dr Lawson clearly articulated in cross examination the factors that led him to this revised conclusion.  First, that it is important not to use, as the local authority had sought to use, repetitive risky behaviour to justify an assessment of lack of capacity.  If RS&#8217;s risky behaviour stemmed from his learning disability and autism it would be seen in all areas but it is not.  Second, further consideration had to be given to the significant issues of RS&#8217;s maturity and his actual age and he gave these more weight in coming to a balanced view as to why he makes unwise decisions.  Third, and within this context, caution was required against making the mistake of attributing RS&#8217;s impulsive decision making to his learning disability and autism where elements of RS&#8217;s history and development may explain that conduct, which falls within the ordinary recklessness demonstrated by young people.  Fourth, the sexual element is a powerful drive and RS&#8217;s mild learning disability and autism are not the driving force behind his fetish and ABDL behaviour.  Fifth, on  the totality of the evidence Dr Lawson could not consider RS to have an abnormal level of impulsivity.  Sixth, whilst the possibility cannot be excluded that RS&#8217;s impulsive and reckless decision making is linked to his learning disability and autism, his decision making could also represent a normal level of impulsivity and recklessness for a young person of his age. </p>
