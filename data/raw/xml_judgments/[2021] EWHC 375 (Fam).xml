If an abduction does take place, the next object is to restore the children as soon as possible to their home country, so that any dispute can be determined there. The left-behind parent should not be put to the trouble and expense of coming to the requested state in order for factual disputes to be resolved there. The abducting parent should not gain an unfair advantage by having that dispute determined in the place to which she has come. And there almost always is a factual dispute, if not about the primary care of the children, then certainly about where they should live, and in cases where domestic abuse is alleged, about whether those allegations are well-founded. Factual disputes of this nature are likely to be better able to be resolved in the country where the family had its home. Hence it is one thing to say that the factual context has changed and another thing entirely to say that the change should result in any change to the interpretation and application of the Hague Convention&#8221; </span></p>

Accordingly, I am mindful that my role in this case is not to determine the question as to whether it is better for EF to live with his Mother or his Father, or to decide whether he should live on a long term basis in Italy or in the United Kingdom.  The key question I have to decide is, assuming that the parents remain in dispute about arrangements for EF, and thus those arrangements will have to be determined by a court, whether those important issues should be decided by the courts in Italy or by the courts in the United Kingdom.  Further, in coming to my decision about which court should decide these matters, I acknowledge that I am not generally in a position to make final factual findings concerning a significant amount of the disputed evidence.  Accordingly, save where specifically stated, nothing set out hereafter should be treated in any future hearings between the parties as constituting a final finding of fact on any contested matter. </p>

However, that case unravelled when it became clear that some of the evidence she relied upon to support that claim was based on doctored text messages. Whilst it is not the role of a Judge in these types of proceedings to make final findings of fact over all matters in dispute, there are some aspects of the Mother&#8217;s evidence to this court which show clearly that she attempted to mislead the court.  The Mother exhibited what she claimed were records of text exchanges between her and the Father in October 2019 in support of her case that she had discussed moving to England with the Father.  The Father exhibited the originals of the text messages which demonstrated that these referred to the Mother claiming that she was in Tuscany at a time when she was in fact in England. All references to Tuscany had been edited out of the versions of the text messages exhibited to the Mother&#8217;s evidence.  Once the originals of the text messages were exposed, the Mother dropped her factual claim that the Father had consented to the Mother taking EF to England.   </p>

Instead, her counsel submitted that my focus in this case should be on EF&#8217;s interests and it is not part of the court&#8217;s function to judge the actions of the Mother.   </p>

He also explained that if the Mother applies for an injunction against the Father in Italy, he will agree to the Italian Court making an interim order preventing him from intimidating, harassing or pestering her, using or threatening violence against her (or encouraging a third party to do so) and preventing him from removing EF from her care without her permission or the order of the Italian Court.  That concession would be on the same basis as the undertakings that he offered to the English Court during the trial, namely that the orders would last until the Italian Court can hold a proper hearing to determine disputed facts and whether or not there should be long term protective measures and the provision of such agreement would be on the basis that he has made no admissions, the English Court has not determined any findings in relation to allegations against him and that he reserved the right to dispute any and all allegations in full. </p>

She also makes it clear that, if she was to return to Italy, she will seek permission from the Italian civil courts for EF to live with her in England.  She is concerned that, even if she were to obtain an order to that effect from the Italian civil court, she may be required to remain in Italy as a result of an order made in the criminal court or could not leave Italy until the criminal proceedings were concluded and that she may be stuck in Italy for an extended period, and that this would be intolerable for EF. </p>

Many Contracting States, including England and Wales, buttress the provisions of the Convention with criminal sanctions against parental kidnapping of children out of their jurisdiction. Following the mother's second abduction and prolonged disappearance, it was entirely predictable that criminal proceedings would be launched in Florida; indeed it seems to have been the warrant for arrest pursuant thereto which triggered the international police activity that led to the location of the mother and children in England. There is no reason to think that, in deciding whether to continue with the prosecution following any return of the mother and children, the state prosecutor would exclude consideration of the interests of the children; nor that, in deciding whether to grant bail or, in the event of conviction, whether to sentence the mother to any term of imprisonment, the Floridan judge would fail to pay significant regard to their interests </span></p>

She had already been prosecuted for an earlier act of child abduction when she moved the child from San Benedetto del Tronto, which is on the Adriatic Coast, and took her to Sommacampagna in northern Italy.  Three years later the criminal case came before the court and the Mother was sentenced to 1 year&#8217;s imprisonment.  She was also ordered to pay the father compensation, with a payment on account of &#8364;5,000. The mother appealed against her conviction, which had the effect that her sentence was not activated pending the appeal.  The Mother then moved with the child to England whilst the appeal was pending, also without the consent of the Father.  Her appeal failed and there was somewhat inadequate evidence before the English court about the chances of the Mother being able to get the sentence suspended or being prosecuted for the second abduction.  The Judge was unimpressed by the Mother&#8217;s plea that this case brought the child within article 13(b).  He said: </p>

Nobody suggests that it would be realistic, or in GP&#8217;s best interests, for her to go immediately to live with her father in San Benedetto del Tronto, presumably without her mother who as matters now stand could hardly be expected to live under the same roof as the father. It is clear that GP has, or at least has come to have under her mother&#8217;s influence, unhappy memories of time spent in her paternal grandmother&#8217;s home; and it would anyway be contrary to Ms Julian&#8217;s recommendations if GP were to live in her father&#8217;s custody before careful consideration by the Italian courts of her welfare.

The questions asked of Ms Gambirasio were deliberately couched in general terms concerning the way in which the relevant law worked in Italy.  Ms Gambirasio was not provided with the papers relating to this particular case and was not asked to speculate what steps the Italian Criminal Court would be likely to take in this particular case. There was no provision in the order for Ms Gambirasio to supplement her evidence by appearing in person at the resumed hearing or for her to be crossexamined on her report.  Despite that, the Mother&#8217;s counsel sought permission to cross-examine Ms Gambirasio on her report on the day before the hearing.  </p>

I am grateful to Ms Gambirasio for making herself available at short notice although, the more she proceeded with her evidence, the more it became clear that the Mother&#8217;s case about the likely consequences for her of the criminal proceedings were far removed from the realities of the situation.   </p>

Thus, as Ms Gambirasio confirmed, the Mother could now approach the prosecuting authorities to negotiate a period of probation as an alternative to being prosecuted.  She explained that a common period of probation for a child abduction offence would be in the region of 6 to 8 months.  Once a proposed period of probation was agreed with the prosecuting authorities as a way of disposing of the criminal case, the probation order would need to be confirmed by a Judge.  She also explained that, even if the matter proceeded to a criminal trial, a sentence of what she described as &#8220;testing until proven&#8221;, which appears akin to probation, could be imposed.  That sentence would not result in the Mother going to prison.  Ms Gambirasio said that an approach to the prosecutors to discuss probation could take place whilst the Mother was in England but that the 6 to 8 month anticipated period of probation would have to be served with the Mother in Italy. </p>

Ms Gambirasio explained that this power only arose in a case where the Judge made an immediate custodial sentence of more than two years.  However, she did not think this would be a likely outcome in this case.  I also bear in mind that Italy is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and thus any court making such a decision would only do so if the court was satisfied that it was in the paramount interests of the child to make such an order.  Whilst I understand the Mother&#8217;s fears, there is no basis for considering that the Italian Court would be likely to make such an order without having reached conclusion that it was in EF&#8217;s interests to make such an order.  It follows that it would be close to improper for me to refuse to return EF to Italy because of a fear that the Italian Court would act so as to put EF in an intolerable position as a result of exercising this power. </p>

I appreciate that it may seem that way to the Mother but, in my judgment, that is not a fair or accurate characterisation of the Father&#8217;s position in this case.  The better way to consider these matters is that the Father is one of the two parents of this child and is fully within his rights to ask the Italian court to make a decision as to whether the welfare of the chid would be better served by the child residing with him or the Mother.  I have to assume that that decision will be made by the Italian Court after looking at all the facts and with EF&#8217;s best interests as the court&#8217;s paramount consideration. </p>

She now faces criminal proceedings in Italy as a result of that decision and, in facing those proceedings, must take personal responsibility for the consequences of her own actions.  The Father cannot make those proceedings &#8220;go away&#8221; and cannot be expected to say anything in her favour to the Italian court which is untrue.  Relations between the Mother and the Father in this case are pretty bad at the moment and thus the Father cannot be asked to say otherwise to the Italian court.    </p>

I accept that evidence and thus consider that whether the Mother faces a prison sentence or not is very largely in her own hands.

Assuming for present purposes that this were to be the case, the issue under Article 13(b) of the 1980 Convention is whether the Mother has proved (bearing in mind that the onus of proof is on her) that there is a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">grave risk</span>&#8221; that this will happen.  In my judgment she has not proved that there is a grave risk of such an outcome.  If the Mother returns to Italy with EF, she can take steps that will substantially reduce the small chance of her going to prison.  It seems to me that, much as she does not want to be in this position, if she returns to Italy it is highly likely that she will take those steps in order to avoid a prison sentence and the consequent separation from her son.  I thus do not consider that she has made out her case in relation to article 13(b) on the grounds that there is a grave risk that she will go to prison as a result of the institution of criminal proceedings. </p>

As Ms Gambirasio made clear, any period of probation is likely to be limited to 6 to 8 months or, as an alternative, if a suspended sentence is imposed, it is likely that there will be no requirement on the Mother to remain in Italy during the period of the suspended sentence.  Thus, if the Mother persuades the Italian Civil Court that she should have sole custody of her son and should be permitted to return to England with him, I do not consider that there is a grave risk that she will be stuck in Italy because of the criminal proceedings for any extended period that could lead to life becoming intolerable for EF. </p>

I do not accept that the Mother has proved her case under article 13(b) on this point for a series of different reasons.  First, the Mother, through her counsel, accepted the financial offer made by the Father as part of the negotiations between the parties in December. The Mother&#8217;s counsel specifically accepted that she was not seeking to go behind that agreement but argued that it would leave EF in </p>

She has not disclosed details about her current financial position, what she is doing as a job to support herself in England or indeed where she is living.  However, she has worked consistently through the marriage and clearly has an ability to earn a living.  I do not accept that she has proved that, even given the relatively modest level of financial support offered by the Father, she has shown that there is a grave risk that the situation will become intolerable for EF.  I could only have reached that conclusion if the Mother had made full disclosure of her financial position which she has not. </p>

That will give the Italian civil court a considerable advantage over this court and means that it is entirely appropriate that financial arrangements should be determined by that court from the earliest opportunity.  I thus do not consider that the length of the undertakings offered by the Father brings the case within the scope of article 13(b). </p>

The background here is that the Mother has made serious allegations of sexual assault and controlling behaviour against the Father.  Whilst these are strongly denied by the Father, I do not accept that he has shown that these allegations cannot be true.  I therefore proceed on the basis that the Mother has shown that the allegations made by her may be true. </p>

The question is whether the undertakings offered by the Father mean that EF faces a grave risk of an intolerable situation if he were to return to Italy because of the risks that his mother will face domestic violence from the Father.  In my judgment, having regard to a combination of the facts which will arise on the ground when EF returns, the undertakings offered by the Father and the fact that civil proceedings are already in existence in Italy which could be used to protect EF, the Mother has not proved that there is a grave risk of such a situation arising.   </p>

I say that because, having given the court jurisdiction to hear a particular matter by reason of the continuing application of the Regulation, the court must be both entitled and required to hear and determine the matter in accordance with the relevant set in the Regulation, given that it has jurisdiction to make a decision under the Regulation. I therefore do not agree with the initial position taken by one counsel in one of the cases before me that the court retained jurisdiction in relation to child abduction to make an order for the return of the child under article 11 of BIIa but could not apply that jurisdiction in accordance with the remaining parts of Section 2 of Chapter II of the Regulation, including article 11(4).  The better interpretation, as I think counsel was inclined to accept after argument, was that if jurisdiction in relation to the welfare of the child was retained by the home country under article 10 BIIa and jurisdiction to make a return order continued under article 11 BIIa, any return order decision was required to be made by the court in accordance with that jurisdiction, namely </p>

The delays in resolving this matter due to the instruction of the Italian legal expert probably mean that the Mother will not return in time to be able to attend the directions hearing before the Civil Court on 2 March 2021 but Hague Convention proceedings should be resolved within 6 weeks and thus, after the 14 day period I have indicated above, the order should provide that EF should return to Italy as quickly as it can be arranged. </p>
