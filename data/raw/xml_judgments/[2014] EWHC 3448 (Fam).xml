Her older siblings &#8211; V a boy and W a girl, aged 9 and 8 respectively &#8211; live with their father, MN, under a residence order. Proceedings in relation to those children as well as three others, one older and two younger, were finally concluded in March 2013 when orders were made as the sequel to a substantive fact finding and welfare hearing in October 2012.</p>

V and W are the mother&#8217;s second and third eldest children and had been in the interim care of another London local authority, B, until first W and then V went to live with their father. W and MN lived in a single room, the only accommodation available to them, from September 2012 until they were offered a more suitable home in an adjacent local authority shortly before the March 2013 hearing. It was at that point that V joined his father and sister.</p>

She flew to Uganda just a few weeks before his birth, during the currency of the earlier proceedings. There was an extensive litigation effort by the putative father of Z, who is also the father of X and Y, to secure Z&#8217;s return to this jurisdiction. His attempts came to an end in March this year at a time when complete obscurity surrounded Z&#8217;s whereabouts and no progress of any kind had been made in establishing paternity.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Underlying the welfare question, there are a number of factual issues some of which have real and obvious relevance, others less so. One area of interest which occupied a great deal of court time surrounds the relationship between the mother and MN during a three month period last summer when MA was conceived. MN was cross examined extensively in relation to all aspects of that period and notwithstanding the frank admissions contained within his July statement that he had made a stupid mistake. He apologised to the court, the professionals and to the guardian for his actions which, he said, he deeply regretted. MN also made clear that he was very apologetic to his children for indirectly involving them in further court proceedings. He assured everyone that he was very sorry, had learnt his lesson and will not repeat the error.</p>

None of those matters, even if substantiated, would have made a difference to my welfare decision. Other evidence, notably from the children&#8217;s schools and Ms Tobin suggests the mother is simply making mischief. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the threshold criteria, it is necessary to say only this. In October 2012, I found that all of the older five children had been significantly harmed as the result of their mother&#8217;s inability to consistently meet their emotional and educational needs. I concluded that she had made it impossible for outside agencies to provide her with help; and that there was no prospect of the mother assuming the role of a dependable, consistent and stable care giver within a timescale which matched those children&#8217;s requirements.</p>

As Ms Rednall said, at those times when the mother has been in a calm state she has been able to carry out the basic tasks in looking after MA. But her &#8220;highly dramatic reactions to any engagement which challenges her, heavily outweigh the positives.&#8221; Most unfortunately, as Miss Rednall also said, and I accept, MA has been in her mother&#8217;s arms at times when she has become distressed, exhibiting &#8220;extremely dramatic behaviour, dashing through the unit&#8221; and compromising MA&#8217;s safety.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A glaring example of the mother&#8217;s difficulty in containing her emotional responses arises out of what occurred on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June in the car park outside the West Green Building immediately after a brief court hearing. She set fire to her clothing and only escaped serious injury as the result of her advocate&#8217;s quick thinking as well as the intervention of a nearby film crew. The mother was admitted to the Maudsley Hospital for assessment under s.2 of the Mental Health Act 1987. The diagnosis of her treating psychiatrists was that she did not suffer from serious mental illness but was rather reacting to circumstances. On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, she had learned that MN was putting himself forward to look after MA.</p>

Whether his actions could be characterised as the infliction of significant emotional harm is open to question. In order to qualify, the harm must be significant enough to justify the intervention of the state and disturb the autonomy of the parent in bringing up the children on his own; and significant enough to enable the court to make a care or supervision order if the children&#8217;s welfare so demands: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re MA (Care Threshold) [2010] 1FLR 431.</span></p>

He had done &#8220;as much as possible to keep the mother calm, not lose her temper and not raise her voice in front of the children.&#8221; MN agreed with Ms Gardner that the entire experience of those three months &#8220;must have been very distressing for the children.&#8221;  However, when Ms Newton spoke to V in September this year, he said he &#8220;liked to see Mummy &#8230; she stayed over and it was nice. It&#8217;s been a long time since (he&#8217;d) seen Mummy &#8230; and he would like to see her locally &#8230; twice a month.&#8221;</p>

He was, I remind myself, completely isolated from his family who remain in Uganda; he had come to the UK as an unaccompanied minor when only 15 years old and lived without recourse to public funds for six years. He assumed responsibility for W and then V who had experienced considerable instability and neglect at a time when he and they had had no contact for about 5 years. </p>

The starting point is that Ms Tobin, an independent social worker of long experience and considerable expertise, unequivocally recommends that MA should be placed with her father. In her first report she commented that MN is an intelligent and thoughtful father who could easily, in the right circumstances, parent MA alongside V and W. In her supplemental report, focussed upon a number of discrete areas of further inquiry, Ms Tobin concludes that her view of the father&#8217;s ability to care for MA had been reinforced; and she should be given the opportunity to live with her father, sister and brother within their local community.</p>

As she commented towards the end of her evidence in chief, and so pleasingly given earlier responses from other local authorities, Ms Lowrie considers her local authority has a duty of care to MA, she is their responsibility; and even although MN lives in another London borough there is no present intention to pass responsibility for MA elsewhere.</p>

In relation to MN, her report was focussed upon what, in her eyes, he had done wrong rather than reflecting upon his considerable achievements.

Would it, could it, ever be appropriate to deprive her of the opportunity to grow up alongside her father, brother and sister because, for a period last year, her father had, and was then seen as being secretive about, a relationship with the mother?

She needs to be able to develop a secure, loving and reciprocal attachment with whomsoever is looking after her. As she grows she will benefit immeasurably from a day to day relationship with one of her parents and also, if it can be arranged, with her siblings as well. She will require consistency, stability, calm and reflective parenting if she is to develop emotionally as she should.

MA might be expected, over time, to forge attachments to either of them. All the signs, sadly in relation to the mother, are that the relationship would be insecure because of MR&#8217;s limitations in providing consistency, safety and good quality care when emotionally aroused, for whatever reason. The same problem does not arise in relation to the father who has done so very well in providing for V and W in every area of their development. </p>

The strong likelihood is that over time her emotional needs would be neglected; and her physical safety could not be assured because of the potential for the mother to act dangerously and impulsively when emotionally distressed. There would be an appreciable risk of flight arising out the events surrounding firstly W&#8217;s abduction in 2011 and, more recently, the mother&#8217;s decision to fly to Uganda when heavily pregnant with Z. I reject the mother&#8217;s account that her departure in December 2012 arose from any Home Office &#8220;force&#8221; as she suggested in evidence. The mother made a deliberate choice to put Z beyond the reach of the authorities here, knowing as she did there would be proceedings and possibly separation had she given birth in this country. Left to her own devices, it must be seen as altogether likely that the mother would once more take the law into her own hands and put MA beyond the reach of her father, siblings and the court.</p>

The mother says she saw them &#8220;countless times between June and September last year,&#8221; at least every week. But I note that neither V nor W corroborated that account when asked questions by Ms Newton just a few weeks ago.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not hard to make sense of what occurred between the mother and NM knowing, as I do, about the mother&#8217;s extensive history of child bearing and the way in which she has involved herself with other men, notably the father of X, Y and Z. Because of the way in which she has lost her older children and the profound emotional impact upon her of having been separated from them, the mother craves motherhood. She yearned to conceive once more after her return from abroad having relinquished Z to someone else. I have no doubt she was, as MN suggests, very happy when she telephoned him to say she was pregnant. I know how deeply she yearns to be able to look after at least one of her babies. I have no doubt that it was part of the mother&#8217;s plan to become pregnant. She wanted another child and made sure there was no barrier in place to prevent her conceiving.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MN provides a detailed, almost day by day account of events including his reasons for continuing to see and have an intimate relationship with the mother &#8211; because he wanted to &#8216;keep her sweet&#8217; during the period when it would have been possible to terminate the pregnancy safely. Overall I found his account both entirely plausible and utterly reliable.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Understanding why there was sexual contact between the parents seems to me to be one of the least complex issues of all. MN is a normal individual with the impulses which might be expected of any man of his age. On 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, the first occasion when there was sexual contact, the mother had installed herself in his bed, the children were asleep, he didn&#8217;t believe, so he said, that &#8220;anything would happen&#8221; but it had not crossed his mind to sleep on the sofa. One thing led to another and MN found himself in exactly the same position as the father of X, Y and Z. He, too, was drawn back in to a sexual relationship with the mother, at a time when the authorities had been led to believe there would not be contact between them and a child was conceived.</p>

Sometimes, as here, the consequences are great. MN commented during the course of his evidence that this experience has been the &#8220;worst (he&#8217;s) ever had in (his) life;&#8221; and he could never put himself in this position again. I believed him.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally in relation to sexual matters, I should say that I reject the mother&#8217;s allegation of having been raped by MN in September last year. During her oral evidence relating to 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September, the mother said that she&#8217;d had a &#8220;difficult night.&#8221; On the day she had reported MN to the police, it had been &#8220;wrong for (her) to have (her) sleep disturbed by him wanting to have sex.&#8221; The mother added more detail but nothing she said seemed to me to come close to substantiating the very serious allegation of rape. </p>

He provided a detailed account of consensual intercourse. By mid October, the mother was telling the police she wished to drop the charges. The case was not referred to the CPS because it was considered there was no realistic prospect of a conviction. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is part of the mother&#8217;s strategy, I am afraid to say, to seek to make trouble for those with whom she has argued. MN has found himself in almost the same, terrible position as did the father of X, Y and Z during the hearing of October 2012. Scurrilous and wholly false allegations were made against each man in a bid to defeat their cases in relation to their children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I turn to the future, convinced as I am that the essential &#8216;direction of travel&#8217; should be towards placing MA with her father. Ms Lowrie has drafted an impressive proposed plan. It is designed to incorporate MN&#8217;s support network and will be developed so long as he is fully engaged and cooperative with the relevant agencies. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a first step, MN must be given parental responsibility for MA. There is every reason to continue the interim care order so that the admirable Ms Lowrie can pursue the plan with vigour as I am confident she will. MN must commit himself to engaging fully and timeously in the planning process and alter his university schedules accordingly. I approve of the proposal to gradually reduce the mother&#8217;s contact between now and the next hearing and authorise the local authority to with hold it should there be a welfare need so to do.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MN, V and W do not live in the area of the local authority which is responsible for MA. It will be essential, for the future, that the two authorities liaise and work together to produce joint, counter-signed plans. I am cheered, therefore, to read within the Position Statement of Ms Peck who has represented the other local authority today, that its social workers support the sharing of information, joint working and plans which are co-authored. One of the complications of this case is that there are not one but four local authorities, three of which sit close by one another. Thus far, although I could be wrong, it does not appear to be the case that there&#8217;s been joint working.</p>

Full co operation from the other authorities, particularly the one in which MN lives will be essential. I can only reiterate my gratitude to Ms Lowrie for her ready willingness to take the lead in seeking to coordinate inter-authority working &#8211; the pre-requisite to securing the best of outcomes for each of the six children now spread across a wide area.</p>

I hope that, by then, a great deal will have been achieved so that it becomes possible for MA to move to live with her father. If there is the potential for an earlier move, then I make clear my likely agreement to that course. I am sure Ms Lowrie will keep progress and timing under constant review, gauging when the circumstances are right for MA to move within her family.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I cannot conclude this judgment without observing that Ms Gartland has performed her task in representing the mother in the most exemplary fashion. She did not have the advantage of having represented MR at any stage before this hearing having inherited the brief from Ms Perry who was simply unavailable to continue in the role. Ms Gartland&#8217;s performance has been faultless. She presented her client&#8217;s case fully, economically and with flair. She has made every legitimate point on MR&#8217;s behalf with moderation, proper emphasis and singular poise. </p>

Whenever she was on the point of completing her cross examination of any witness, Ms Gartland would turn to check with her client, not once but repeatedly, as to whether she wished to raise anything else. There could have been no better all round example of how to perform the role of Counsel for a parent in a complex public law case. I am indebted to her as I hope the mother is also.</p>
