	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">The residence and contact proceedings began in 2007 and have since been conducted continuously before a highly experienced County Court Judge, who has throughout been concerned, and rightly concerned, with the effects of publicity on X who is an intelligent and articulate child, well able to read about and follow references to her parents or herself as well as these proceedings in the press or on the internet. The Judge has, on two occasions in the course of the proceedings, warned the parties against any airing of their dispute in public or originating any leaks to the press and both are currently bound by undertakings to the Court not to disclose any information concerning these proceedings, save to their legal advisers. They have also agreed not give or permit interviews concerning the arrangements for X&#8217;s upbringing. The parties are themselves genuinely motivated by concern for X, but the Judge was satisfied that the undertakings to which I have referred were essential if reference by the parents to their dispute, or indulgence in any kind of point-scoring in the course of press or other media interviews, was to be avoided.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">Both parties have co-operated in supplying information to a CAFCASS officer for the purposes of ascertaining X&#8217;s wishes and feelings, encouraging contact, and assessing the harm which X has or may have suffered or may be suffering as the result of the parties&#8217; estrangement and their attitude towards each other; second, they have also co-operated by resorting to the services of Dr C, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. Towards the end of 2008, Dr C was jointly instructed to report on the question of X&#8217;s welfare generally and, inter alia, (1) whether she was suffering from emotional harm as a result of the current circumstances and the short and long term effects which the parental dispute might have upon her; (2) an assessment of each of the parents&#8217; understanding of the issues pertaining to X; (3) what, if any, work should be undertaken by the parents and/or X either separately, or with each other, or as a family. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">On 7 December 2008, Dr C reported at length. The parties had given conflicting accounts as to various events which shaped their attitude towards each other, as well as a number of disputed incidents in the course of contact, in relation to which X had formed, or at any rate expressed, her own views and opinions which in turn shaped her attitude to each of her parents. Dr C made clear that he was not in a position to advise about the therapeutic work to be undertaken until there had been a fact finding hearing and the issues as to residence and contact established.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">At a directions hearing in early December 2008, Dr C expressed concerns about X&#8217;s emotional welfare and detailed directions were made in relation to the involvement of Dr C and the progressing of contact. More difficulties were encountered in the light of X&#8217;s feelings and reactions, and further directions proved necessary shortly before the fact finding hearing. On 4 March 2009 Dr C also delivered an updating report for that hearing.</p>

The Judge heard evidence from both parties and from Dr C and Miss E the CAFCASS officer who, since March 2008 had been involved with X and the progression of contact. Miss E had made five reports concerning X over the year preceding the hearing. In the light of the intimate, emotional and sensitive nature of the issues explored and the information concerning X as reported by the CAFCASS officer and Dr C, and in the light of the manifest media interest outside the Court, the Judge, in anticipation of her judgment which she reserved, and in response to the joint urgent application of the parties, made a<span style="font-style:italic"> contra mundum</span> order dated 13 March 2009 in relation to X until her 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday or further order in the following terms:</p>

If the need for an order arises in the existing proceedings in the County Court, Judges should either transfer the application to the High Court or consult their Family Division Liaison Judge. Where the matter is urgent, it can be heard by the Urgent Applications Judge of the Family Division. Paragraph 3 sets out provisions for service of the application on the National News Media via the Press Association&#8217;s CopyDirect Service. Paragraph 4 of the direction refers applicants for guidance to the joint Official Solicitor/CAFCASS Practice Note, also dated 18 March 2005 and states that such guidance should be followed.</p>

It refers in length and detail to the evidence to which I have referred at paragraph 9 above. It makes clear that the reason for this is the necessity to make findings to assess the contribution of each parent to the current predicament in relation to X&#8217;s emotional state, her view of her parents and her attitude to contact. It also makes clear that its purpose is not limited to finding the facts necessary for the therapeutic purposes anticipated by Dr C, but extends to helping X make sense of the events in her life once she is an adult. It expresses the hope that she will never have to read the judgment. It contemplates a six-month adjournment of the final hearing in the light of the parents&#8217; consent to co-operate in the intervention of Dr C. It also makes provision for further hearings to progress the matter in the interim.</p>

They were also advised that if injunctive relief were sought restraining publication based on Convention rights rather than statutory provisions, the matter should in any event be transferred to the High Court to be dealt with under the President&#8217;s Direction dated 18 March 2005 to which reference has already been made. </p>

Since March 2009 two more experts in disciplines relating to children have been involved in assisting with the issues with which the Court is concerned and this evidence will be relayed in the evidence of Dr C. It is also envisaged that the CAFCASS officer will give evidence. The views of the experts and the CAFCASS officer will inform, and be inseparable from, all of the matters to be considered and determined at the hearing, including the child&#8217;s state of health; the nature, timing and duration of any work to be undertaken with or involving the child and/or one or other of the parents; and the impact of these matters on the child&#8217;s welfare and upbringing, including questions of contact residence and education. It is inevitable that detailed reference will be made in the course of the hearing to the Judge&#8217;s judgment of 6 April 2009 and to previous evidence both written and oral of Dr C and the CAFCASS officer. </p>

However, it lends considerable substance to the recognition by government in that Response of the need to safeguard and protect children and their families. Dr C explains that when a specialist such as himself interviews children for public or private law proceedings, they explain to them according to their age and understanding, the process in which they are involved and what is going to happen to what they say to the specialist. Hitherto specialists have explained that what the children say will be written down and put in a report which will be seen by the Judge, their parents and, according to circumstance, a CAFCASS or other social worker. Hitherto children have not been informed that the media will be given access to what they have said. That is the position in this case in relation to X who has spoken frankly and in confidence to Dr C and Mrs M, a colleague working closely with him, on the basis that matters would only be disclosed to the Judge the parties their legal advisors and the CAFCASS officer. Dr C considers, and has been so advised by the Medical Protection Society, that if he were to disclose to the Court in the presence of the media the information which he possesses concerning X it would be a clear breach of confidentiality. Furthermore, if he or Mrs M were to inform X now that the information they possessed were to be so disclosed it would undermine the trust which X has placed in Dr C and the work undertaken by him. She would also be highly likely to assume, regardless of explanations to the contrary, that their attendance was at the invitation and instigation of one of her parents. Dr C considers that, if the media are admitted to the hearings in this matter, X will not have sufficient trust in the ongoing process to be able to participate in it and the work initiated as a result of these proceedings will be unable to continue. Dr C also makes clear that, quite apart from that unfortunate effect, he would himself be inhibited and in considerable difficulties in relation to giving evidence about X if the media were to be admitted to the hearings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">In recent years, the privacy of family law proceedings in this country has given rise to concerns, not only on the part of the media and certain pressure groups, but also of government, that a procedure designed to protect the privacy of the parties and the welfare interests of the children has given rise to a system perceived as one of &#8220;secret justice&#8221;, in which the workings of the courts and the decisions of judges are not available to public (in reality media) scrutiny. This is a view which has principally been propounded in relation to public law care proceedings on the basis that public scrutiny is of high importance in cases where the state (albeit in the interests of safeguarding children) intervenes from outside in family life and seeks to remove a child from his or her family or to supervise or limit parental rights (see <span style="font-style:italic">Moser v Austria</span> [2006] 3 FCR 107 at [97] and <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X, London Borough of Barnet v X &amp; Y</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 FLR 998" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 FLR 998</ref> at [166].

The restrictions i.e. the grounds for exclusion under Rule 10.28 (4) are in broad terms Article 6 compliant. Paragraph (a) (i) is within the legitimate aim of protecting the interests of juveniles and grounds (a) (ii) (iii) and (b) are legitimised under the heading of &#8220;special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice&#8221;. It is to be noted in passing that nothing is included in the Rule to provide for exclusion of the press where the Article 8 interests of the parties (as opposed to those of the child) so require. However, one can envisage a situation where a ground for exclusion, at least for part of the proceedings, might be required to protect the Article 8 interests of the parties which could properly justify exclusion of the media under ground (b) to prevent the press from hearing and/or reporting allegations of an outrageous or intimate nature before the Court&#8217;s decision as to whether or not they were established. This might well constitute a serious and irredeemable invasion of the privacy and/or family life of an adult party if the press were not excluded.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>, the Court was concerned with an application to restrain the right of the press freely to report criminal proceedings and, in particular, to report the identity of the adult defendant in those proceedings in order to protect the identity and privacy of the defendant&#8217;s child who was not involved in the proceedings in any way. The dispositive feature in the decision of the House of Lords was (a) the emphasis it placed upon the importance of the public and media interest in enjoying the uninhibited right both to attend and report on all criminal proceedings; (b) the fact that the child who was sought to be protected was not the subject of or involved in the proceedings in any way; (c) the fact that the provisions of S.39 of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/23-24/12" uk:canonical="1933 (23 &amp; 24 Geo. 5) c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children and Young Persons Act 1933</ref></span> directed to the question of child protection in relation to criminal proceedings limited the Court&#8217;s powers to any child or young person concerned in the proceedings as a party or a witness; thus,  the right not to be identified which the child was asserting was contemplated but not recognised by domestic legislation. None of those considerations applies to the issues in this case. Whilst the principle of open justice is important in civil proceedings concerning children, the need for the protection of children from publicity in the course of proceedings which concern them, was long ago recognised at common law in <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott</span>, and is provided for in the statutory provisions as to identification to which I have referred at paragraphs 29-31 above.</p>

First, private law family cases concerning the children of celebrities are no different in principle from those involving the children of anyone else. An application by a celebrity who happens also to be a parent who is unable to agree with a former spouse or partner over the appropriate arrangements for their child(ren) is not governed by any principle or assumption more favourable to the privacy of the celebrity than that applied to any other parent caught up in the court process. In this respect, and in very different circumstances concerning the publication of the identity of a barrister who had been convicted of criminal offences, (<span style="font-style:italic">Crawford v CPS </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2008/854" uk:canonical="[2008] EWHC 854 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWHC 854 (Admin)</ref>), Thomas LJ rejected the submission that, in conducting the <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>balancing exercise there involved the Court should have regard to the public profile of the appellant:</p>

Thus references to the Court&#8217;s discretion in paragraph 3.1 and in the heading to paragraph 5 in the Practice Direction dated 20 April 2009 are a misnomer. Nonetheless, the balancing act involved in the weighing of the conflicting but interlocking rights and restraints embodied in Article 10 and Article 8 of the Convention are highly fact sensitive from case to case.

While there are no transitional provisions in Rule 10.28, and it makes no distinction between the right of the media to attend in respect of proceedings commenced and underway prior to the Rule coming into force and those commenced thereafter, the fact is that matters have to date proceeded on the basis of the privacy of the proceedings and the confidentiality of X&#8217;s exchanges and interactions with Dr C and Miss E, as to which X has received assurances too late to be qualified or withdrawn if she is to remain engaged in Dr C&#8217;s work (see para 22 above).</p>

Whilst I would agree in general with that observation, I would not accept its universal application. This case is a very good example of a situation where, in the circumstances already explained, the evidence of such witnesses is likely to be the only &#8220;live&#8221; evidence before the Court at the next hearing and the matters to be dealt with are all matters of high sensitivity and importance to the welfare of X.</p>

It has been argued by Mr Millar QC for the media that the interests of X can be sufficiently catered for by the protections as to identity and on reporting imposed by the current statutory regime. I do not consider that is so for a number of reasons. The first is that which I have already articulated, namely that the intrusion of the press into the proceedings in relation to this particular child and the particular matters investigated in Court would constitute a betrayal of the trust already built up between X and Dr C and Mrs E and would present a grave danger to a successful outcome for the welfare and family issues on the case.</p>

The reason for the Judge&#8217;s granting of the <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum </span>order was the presence of press photographers outside the Court throughout the hearing. Shortly after the grant of the injunction, a foreign magazine published an article identifying the parents and speculating upon the outcome of the proceedings. Upon the day the matter was transferred to me by the Judge, a member of the press of that country was taking photographs in the Court corridors and of the door of the Court. Upon appearing before the Judge, she said that she was intending to publish the pictures to illustrate a report of the proceedings in a foreign magazine. </p>

However, the Judge should  reconsider the matter prior to the final hearing, whether upon her own motion or on the basis of written representations from the parties and/or the media to be forwarded to the Court not less than five days before the hearing. At that stage, it may well be that the Judge will consider it appropriate to hear further argument on the basis that she will deliver an anonymised judgment following the final hearing, in terms appropriate to enable the media to comment in an informed manner upon the process and outcome of the proceedings.</p>

This is similarly designed to prevent harassment of the child by representatives of the media seeking to acquire, with a view to publication information about X not already in the public domain. In the light of the evidence of Dr C and Mrs E, such approaches and/or publication of such information would plainly cause distress to the child, be corrosive of her current regime and would be likely to cause her to perceive herself as having been placed in the limelight by one or other of her parents in an unwelcome manner.</p>

Indeed, Mr Millar recited and relied upon the terms of the Press Complaints Commission Editor&#8217;s Code of Practice which variously provides that &#8220;editors must not use the fame, notoriety or position of a parent or guardian as the sole justification for publishing details of a child&#8217;s private life&#8221;; &#8220;Pupils must not be approached or photographed at school without the permission of the school authorities&#8221;; and &#8220;In cases involving children under 16, editors must demonstrate an exceptional public interest to over-ride the normally paramount interests of the child&#8221;. That being so, I do not regard the provisions of paragraph [6] of the injunction as constituting an oppressive or unjustified fetter upon the Article 10 rights of the media, whereas I do regard its provisions as an essential part of the protection to be afforded within the circumstances of this particular child in the course of these particular proceedings.</p>

Accordingly, while it appears that there was a full consideration by the Judge of the substantive matters to be taken into account, of the importance attached to the Convention right to freedom of expression by the HRA and of the requirement that the Judge should be satisfied that the applicant is likely to establish that publication should not be allowed, the Judge did not have drawn to her attention the need for the appellant to establish either that all practicable steps had been taken to notify the media (which was plainly not the case) or that there were compelling reasons why the respondent should not be notified. The reasons advanced were that the information in the proceedings had not been the subject to any publicity and that there was nothing about it in the public domain, it not yet having been mentioned in the media. It was therefore feared by the parties that notification in the case would only serve to draw the media&#8217;s attention to it. That can scarcely constitute a compelling reason in this context. For similar reasons it was requested of the Judge that it should be sufficient to serve a copy of the order made upon the media rather than any other documents accompanying the application including the skeleton argument. It was simply stated that once the draft order was served, any party wishing to vary its terms could do so at any time by giving 48 hours notice and that anyone genuinely wishing to vary or discharge the injunction (as opposed to being curious about what was being said within the proceedings) would be provided with appropriate material. The Judge having acceded to this reasoning, the media were thus deprived of an opportunity which is plainly contemplated by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.12 (2)</ref> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref></span> and by the President&#8217;s Direction of 18 March 2005, to argue against the grant of the injunction before it was made.</p>

This may or may not exhibit documents or opinions referred to in the statement which support the grounds of justification advanced. Where, as here, the grounds are based upon the confidentiality and sensitivity of material contained in medical and social work reports which will be deployed and referred to in the course of the proceedings from which it is sought to exclude the media, it would obviously defeat the object of the application for those reports to be supplied or that detailed contents be revealed in advance.

I would add that where the reports or other documents containing sensitive matters are already in the possession of the applicant&#8217;s solicitors, they should be brought to the hearing of the application in a convenient bundle to enable the Judge to refer to such documents as seem to him necessary for the purposes of his decision.

Meanwhile, although the Practice Direction does not expressly so provide, I consider that it is incumbent upon an applicant who wishes to exclude the media from a substantive hearing <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span> to raise the matter with the Court prior to the hearing for consideration of the need to notify the media in advance of the proposed application and that, if this is done, the Court should require the applicant to notify the media via the CopyDirect service in accordance with the procedure provided for in the CAFCASS Practice Note. The Court should at the same time make directions for the hearing of the application whether by way of special appointment or consideration at the outset of the next substantive<span style="font-style:italic"/>hearing. It is of course not necessary for the matter to be dealt with by a High Court Judge and it should, wherever possible, be dealt with by the trial judge. In the light of the view I have expressed, I consider that para 6.4 of the Practice Direction of 20 April 2009 should be read as if there were added at the end of the final sentence in that paragraph the words &#8220;and should do so by means of the Press Association CopyDirect service, following the procedure set out in the Official Solicitor/CAFCASS Practice Note dated 18 March 2005&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">It has been suggested on behalf of the media that a similar procedure is necessary or appropriate even in respect of cases where, although the parties do not challenge the right of the media to attend the proceedings from the outset, they seek during the course of the proceedings the temporary exclusion of the media in relation to the evidence of a particular witness or witnesses. I do not think that is either practical or necessary. There are likely to be frequent occasions when, either on the application of a party or of its own motion the Court considers it necessary, on one of the grounds set out in Rule 10.28 (4) to direct that accredited media representatives temporarily withdraw while certain evidence is given. To require the parties or the Court to institute the processes provided for in the President&#8217;s Direction and CAFCASS Practice Note would create undesirable interruptions and produce unacceptable delays in the administration of justice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">The decision as to the necessity to require the withdrawal of such representatives from the courtroom on a temporary basis will call for careful but robust decision making by the Judge who has the task of hearing the proceedings and completing them so far as practicable in the limited time available for the hearing of the case. Whilst the Judge is required to engage in a balancing exercise as between the Article 10 rights of the press and the Article 8 rights of the child, and the jurisprudence describes the exercise to be performed in fairly elaborate terms, the factors to be weighed in the balance as applied to the particular circumstances of the case will be well in the trial Judge&#8217;s mind. It will not be a difficult task for the Judge to articulate them shortly to any media representative present, inviting him/her to comment and/or make representations before the Judge gives brief reasons for his/her decision (see para 5.5 of the Practice Direction of 20 April 2009).</p>
