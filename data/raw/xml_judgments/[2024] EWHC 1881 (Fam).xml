	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am once again concerned with proceedings with respect to A, a girl born in 2021 and now aged 3 years old.  A&#8217;s mother is E (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;).  The mother is represented by Ms Marisa Allman of counsel.  The mother was born in Zambia.  A&#8217;s father, J (hereafter &#8216;the father&#8217;), is a British Citizen.  The father is represented by Mr Devereux of King&#8217;s Counsel and Professor Rob George of counsel.  </p>

Whilst by that application the father sought the return of A to the jurisdiction of England and Wales, when this matter came before the Court of Appeal that court concluded that the father also sought by his application orders relating to care and contact within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref>(d) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> and, very probably, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref>.  The father now pursues child arrangements orders in respect of A. The mother no longer pursues her application for permission to remove A permanently from the jurisdiction of England and Wales to the jurisdiction of Zambia at this time but does continue to pursue her application for financial provision for A under Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As also noted in my previous judgments, the father&#8217;s original application dated 23 June 2022 was heard by Arbuthnot J in November 2022.  Arbuthnot J handed down judgment on 23 December 2022 by which she dismissed the father&#8217;s application for the return of A to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  On 12 June 2023, the Court of Appeal allowed the father&#8217;s appeal and remitted the case to the High Court for re-hearing.  On 8 February 2024, I determined that A was habitually resident in this jurisdiction at the date of the father&#8217;s application and that the jurisdiction of England and Wales was the appropriate forum for determining the dispute as to A&#8217;s welfare.  I further concluded that it was in A&#8217;s best interests to be returned to this jurisdiction whilst the issues with respect to her welfare were determined and ordered the mother to return A (see <span style="font-style:italic">J v E (Habitual Residence)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2024/196" uk:canonical="[2024] EWHC 196 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2024">[2024] EWHC 196 (Fam)</ref>).  The mother returned A to this jurisdiction on 21 February 2024.</p>

The father maintains that the parents met on a dating website, albeit one that has a greater transactional element than other dating websites in that it seeks to match women with wealthy men. The mother further alleges that that father has paid young women to perform sexual acts via escort agency websites.  The father concedes that he has continued to use the dating site through which he met the mother but denies that this constitutes paying young women to perform sexual acts via escort agency websites. In addition, and again as part of finding sought by the mother that the father lacks appropriate sexual boundaries, the mother now alleges for the first time that during the course of their relationship the father had in addiction to porn and masturbated to Instagram videos posted by young women who appeared to be in their late teens or early twenties.

[E] has a long history of making outlandish allegations against me of this kind, including historically accusing me of being gay, and attracted to my best friend who is homosexual, having an untoward interest in her sister and work colleagues, and even that I had, at some stage, been sexually inappropriate with our dog. Despite this, I specifically recall the incident in question where [E] accused me of being sexually aroused when changing A&#8217;s nappy due to the appalling nature of the suggestion. I cannot fathom why she thought this, but I very much recall we argued about it at the time. I was very angry at the suggestion and implication and also incredibly sad to realise that [E]&#8217;s history of making paranoid accusations was now going to extend to our infant daughter. I cannot understand how [E] could have allowed me to continue to spend time on my own with A if she sincerely believed I was capable of becoming aroused whilst changing her.&#8221;</p>

When dealing with the question of forum in my judgment of 8 February 2024, I recognised at [126] the potential difficulties in securing evidence with respect to the matters of fact now in dispute before this court:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;[126] I am not satisfied that the likelihood that this court will be required to hold a finding of fact hearing in respect of an event alleged to have occurred in Zambia leads to the conclusion that is clearly and distinctly the more convenient forum for the determination of question of A&#8217;s welfare.  Whilst the allegation arose in Zambia, the alleged event was unwitnessed.  A is too young to give her own account. In the circumstances, in addition to the father&#8217;s evidence, the primary evidence with respect to the allegation will comprise the medical report, which is already in mother&#8217;s possession and which the father has indicated he does not dispute the authenticity of, the swab results (in the form of the letter from the Zambian Ministry of Health National Food Laboratory dated 20 September 2022), which again are already in the possession of the court, and any relevant police disclosure, including the DNA test results, any medical photography and the interview(s) of the father.  I accept that that latter evidence may be more challenging to secure, although requests can be made of the Zambian authorities and this court can reasonably anticipate that the Zambian authorities will co-operate in assisting with provision of documentary evidence.  This court in any event has a record of the father&#8217;s evidence in respect of the allegation given to the Zambian court in the civil protection order proceedings.  Whilst I accept that the father could give evidence on these issues by video-link were they to be the subject of determination in family proceedings brought in Zambia, if the issue was dealt with by this court the father could give evidence in person and on an equal footing with the mother.&#8221;</p>

The relevant court orders were served on each of the entities between 17 and 18 May 2024 and, to date, the only response that has been received is from the National Prosecution Authority. Within their letter, the National Prosecution Authority confirms that they cannot provide the information and documentation requested, as they are no longer in possession of anything following the return of the docket to Zambia Police. They have also suggested that Dr G would be better placed to assist. No other agency in Zambia has taken the opportunity to provide further information or documentation to the court.</p>

It is also important to note that the court has little or no information about standards of good practice and procedure in the investigation of sexual abuse allegations by medical professionals in Zambia and little or no information about the Zambian criminal legal system, police structure, accountability and responsibility for decision making. Generally, I have borne in mind that the court does not have access to the range and depth of material which it would have available to it if the alleged events under consideration had taken place in England and Wales. </p>

That video, which is five seconds long, shows A laughing and playing with her father.  A does not show any sign of distress, discomfort or wariness of her father, with whom she is interacting well.  The father then telephoned the mother to inform her that he intended to carry A in the baby sling provided by the mother to the local shopping mall to buy baby wipes.  CCTV footage timed at 1607 hrs shows the father leaving the hotel lobby with A in a sling.  The walk to the mall took 10 minutes where the father bought baby wipes and returned to the hotel.  Once again, there is CCTV footage showing the father re-entering the lobby of the hotel with A in the sling and carrying a bag of shopping. That footage is not time stamped but on the basis of the length of time it took the father to buy the baby wipes, would have been at about 1630hrs. With respect to the sling, the father says in his statement that the sling in question belonged to the mother and did not fit him, meaning A was in a fairly unnatural and uncomfortable position when they went to the mall, with part of the sling crossing between her legs.

The second video of the contact handover was taken by the mother at approximately 1722hrs and shows the father walking A down the hotel ramp back to the mother at the end of contact.  A is seen to be smiling and happy as she excitedly approaches her mother.  She is showing no signs of distress or different behaviour to that shown in the videos taken by the father.  There is no suggestion that she is upset or wary of her father or that she is in pain or discomfort.</p>

Even though the opinion section of Dr G&#8217;s report certifies that the findings set out in report are correct in respect of the examination carried out on 14 September 2022, the opinion section of the report in fact appears to have been completed on 26 September 2022 as it refers to the results of the swab test, which were not available until 20 September 2022, and makes reference to both clinical and laboratory evidence. Dr G has not given evidence at this hearing (the Zambian Ministry of Health advising that guidance was needed from the Zambian Director of Public Prosecutions and no such guidance was forthcoming).  A timeline of events provided by the mother states that she was made aware by a police officer of the results of the swabs six days before the report of Dr G was finalised.  The father asserts that his Zambian solicitor was informed by Dr G that she had found no evidence of bruising, damage or any indication of sexual assault.  The father has not, however, taken the opportunity to file and serve a statement dealing with that assertion.</p>

Again, the father asserts that his Zambian solicitor was informed by the lab team at the hospital, after meeting with them on the condition that she left her phone outside, that the test has been faked, reportedly by switching the sample for a sample known to be positive for spermatozoa, and that individuals had been bribed to do so.

The letter from the mother&#8217;s solicitors of 26 September 2022, to which I have referred, states that DNA test results would be available in three weeks from that date. The account of the criminal investigation provided by the mother states that on 30 September 2022 &#8220;an order for DNA&#8221; was applied for and approved by the Zambian court.  However, it appears to be common ground that DNA testing of the samples taken during Dr G&#8217;s examination was not undertaken initially as there was, at the time, no provision for DNA testing in Zambia.  It further appears now to be conceded that no court ever made an order requiring the father to submit to DNA testing.  The mother now relies on the assertion that the father failed to comply with a request from the police on 23 September 2022 to attend the police station and provide a DNA sample.  It is clear from her own correspondence that the mother was heavily involved in seeking to obtain DNA testing of the samples.  On 7 November 2022 the mother wrote to the police to &#8220;formally express my intention to privately fund the DNA testing through a reputable South African based laboratory&#8221;.  The mother contends that this was offered following a conversation with one of the investigating police officers, but this is not reflected in her letter.  It would appear that the swab samples taken by Dr G have now been the subject of DNA sequencing, but the court has not been provided with a report confirming that.  In any event, without a sequence to compare to the sequence undertaken in Zambia, the report would be of no assistance to the court.  I will deal with the parties&#8217; competing positions regarding the father&#8217;s refusal to undergo DNA testing when dealing with the individual findings below.  </p>

The mother suggests the father&#8217;s ability to secure his passport is evidence that the father had bribed officers.

However, on 15 November 2022, the mother applied to the Zambian court for a civil protection order against the father under the Anti-Gender Based Violence Act 2011, relying on the allegation that the father had &#8220;defiled&#8221; A.  The written submissions on behalf of the mother in the Zambian civil proceedings state that she is certain that the father abused A in circumstances where A did not spend time with anyone else on the day in question and there was no explanation for the positive findings of spermatozoa.  In evidence in the Zambian proceedings the mother alleged the father had failed to show concern for A&#8217;s wellbeing following the incident.  It is, however, plain from the evidence that the mother did not inform the father of her concerns and, indeed, provided the father with a false excuse to cancel the next contact he was due to have. As I will come to, it would not appear that in these civil proceedings in Zambia, centring on the need for a protection order in the context of the allegation of sexual abuse, the mother made any reference to the father having become sexually aroused when changing A&#8217;s nappy or to the matters on which she now relies to demonstrate that the father had inappropriate sexual boundaries.</p>

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the &#8216;lie&#8217; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is "capable of amounting to a corroboration". In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Middleton</span> [2001] Crim.L.R. 251. In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt.&#8221;</p>

The position is complicated further by the fact that &#8216;normal&#8217; in the context of the anal and genital anatomy of children is not a single, fixed point but rather a spectrum.

Detailed medical and forensic evidence may support this statement, as may a psychological assessment of the child or the confession by a perpetrator.  Physical signs alone are on rare occasions sufficient to make the diagnosis.&#8221; The Handbook of Best Practice in Children Act Cases 1997 notes that there is often a tension between a positive clinical finding of sexual abuse, and judicial findings that sexual abuse has not occurred and that, within contested cases, clinical methods will inevitably be subjected to scrutiny.</p>

Those factors listed as indicating risk are said to be physical or mental disability in children that may increase caregiver burden, social isolation of families, parents' lack of understanding of children's needs and child development, parents' history of domestic abuse, history of physical or sexual abuse (as a child), past physical or sexual abuse of a child, poverty and other socioeconomic disadvantage, family disorganization, dissolution, and violence, including intimate partner violence, lack of family cohesion, substance abuse in family, parental immaturity, single or non-biological parents, poor parent-child relationships and negative interactions, parental thoughts and emotions supporting maltreatment behaviours, parental stress and distress, including depression or other mental health conditions and community violence. Those facts considered to be protective were said to be a supportive family environment, nurturing parenting skills, stable family relationships, household rules and monitoring of the child, adequate parental finances, adequate housing, access to health care and social services, caring adults who can serve as role models or mentors and community support.

He was prepared to make concessions where it was appropriate to do so, for example conceding that having employed someone in Zambia to make representations on his behalf in that jurisdiction in the context of the criminal investigation it was likely that those representations had some effect.  Having heard the father give evidence, I share the view formed by Arbuthnot J (and not interfered with by the Court of Appeal) that the father presents as a kind although somewhat na&#239;ve individual.  It was plain from the father&#8217;s evidence that he was terrified of the consequences of being convicted and imprisoned in Zambia for an allegation that he denies.  Whilst on occasion the father failed to answer the question put to him, overall I consider the father&#8217;s evidence to have been reliable.</p>

She was prone to blaming the father for the serious physical and verbal domestic abuse she now concedes she perpetrated on him or to excusing that domestic abuse using the modish language of &#8216;wellness&#8217;. The mother appeared to have an extremely heightened sense of distrust of others and appeared vulnerable to misinterpreting the actions of others, particularly with respect to the father.  A striking feature of the mother&#8217;s evidence was what actions she considered amounted to frank infidelity, including the father looking at another woman.  During her evidence, the mother was caught in a number of exaggerations and ultimately had to concede that her denial of having perpetrated domestic abuse against the father in her sworn affidavit in the civil proceedings in Zambia was a lie.  Within this context, I have had to treat the mother&#8217;s evidence with considerable circumspection where it is not corroborated by other evidence.</p>

As noted in my judgment dated 8 February 2024, during her evidence at the hearing which led to that judgment the mother conceded that she had caused injuries to the father, before confirming that the photographs of the father&#8217;s injuries contained in the bundle prepared for that hearing were accurate.  The mother has now made further concessions in respect of the domestic abuse she perpetrated on the father between March 2017 and January 2022, which concessions were further illuminated in the admissions contained in the schedule of allegations and during cross-examination.  The incidents required the father to have medical treatment on two occasions and twice resulted in the mother being arrested by the police.  </p>

The mother physically assaulted the father resulting in cuts and scratches to his face and a bleeding eye.  During cross examination, the mother conceded that, whilst she could not remember the incident due to being very inebriated, she had grabbed and thrown the phone of a member of the public who had attempted to intervene to stop her assault on the father.  The mother was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  Whilst the mother initially alleged to the police that she had been assaulted by the father and showed a broken finger nail as purported evidence, at this hearing mother confirmed that father has never been physically violent to her, suggesting this account to the police on 6 April 20217 was untrue.  As I remarked during the hearing, the text from the father to the mother the following morning is of note.  That text reads very much as the victim of domestic abuse seeking to assuage a perpetrator, the father being anxious to make sure that mother knew that it was not him who called the police and that it was police policy and not the father which caused the mother to be arrested.</p>

In her statement the mother states that she had left her anti-depressants at home and was having mood swings and irritability.  In cross examination the mother stated that, although she could not recall it, she assumed there had been an argument but that she &#8220;had no memory&#8221; of hitting the father. In her statement, the mother sought to suggest that a text sent by the father on 17 September 2017 demonstrated that the father too had behaved inappropriately on 10 September 2017.  However, and as the mother was forced to concede, that text plainly relates to a different event, a week after the incident in Dubai.  I am satisfied that by her statement the mother was seeking to mislead the court.  Having regard to the evidence, and placing the allegation in the context of the totality of my findings, I am satisfied that the mother did attack the father in a hotel room in Dubai, hitting him several times around the head and causing him pain.</p>

It&#8217;s not like you hurt me or do any serious damage, aside from the first time, but it&#8217;s so unhealthy, and makes me feel pathetic.&#8221;  When cross-examined, the mother demonstrated almost no ability to accept responsibility for perpetrating this domestic abuse on the father, blaming the father for not &#8220;understanding the co-dependent relationship he had created&#8221;.</p>

The mother contends that the father sustained injury accidentally when she went to pour a glass of wine on him and he instinctively raised his hand.   The mother accepts that the glass smashed, resulting in a deep cut to the father&#8217;s hand requiring 5-6 stiches.  She asserts that she does not recall a puncture to his shoulder that required treatment.  The father contends that his hand was in a defensive position when the mother lunged at him with the glass.  When cross-examined the mother conceded that there was a heated exchange in the hotel room. I accept the father&#8217;s evidence that injury occurred the when the mother lunged at him, having once again badly lost control.  Once again, the mother sought during her oral evidence to place responsibility for the domestic abuse on the father, stating that he &#8220;was not being forthcoming and honest&#8221;.</p>

The mother has denied making threats to kill against the father during this incident, including during cross-examination.

The father alleges that once the police had left with the mother, he discovered the mother had also smashed two Apple computer screens.

Essentially, I consider it a matter of life and death, being certain that if I were to be made to return to Zambia I would not face a fair process. The sentence for the crime I am accused of in Zambia is a life sentence of hard labour, in chronically overcrowded prisons with appalling conditions and a prevalence of malaria and HIV, with no meaningful protections from other prisoners. I have no doubt that if I were incarcerated in Zambia I would die in prison. I am fortunate to have significant financial resources available and have sought to deploy these resources in my defence where I can. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As with the mother, the efforts made by the father with respect to the investigation in Zambia did not emerge voluntarily, but rather as the result of the father disclosing his bank statements in the proceedings under Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  As originally disclosed, whilst father did not seek to disguise the fact that the payments had been made, those accounts were redacted to remove the name of the private investigator, on the grounds that the father was concerned that the private investigator&#8217;s safety might be imperilled were his identity to be revealed to the mother.  In the absence of any cogent evidence to support that contention, the court directed that unredacted copies of the bank statements be disclosed to the mother. The mother now contends that the private investigator hired by the father, a Mr Y, has been the subject of investigation and prosecution in Zambia.  In this regards the mother relies on a press report from Zambia obtained via a Google search, which reported that Mr Y was acquitted of a charge of theft.  That evidence is plainly insufficient to reach any considered view on Mr Y&#8217;s probity or lack of it.</p>

In circumstances where the father, with considerable justification in the circumstances I shall come to, firmly believed that the police investigation would result in a miscarriage of justice based on an allegation that was untrue, he conducted himself in the manner I have described in an effort to ensure that he was not the subject of a wrongful conviction that would lead to him being incarcerated for an extended period in appalling conditions. </p>

Ms Allman advanced several formulations during her cross-examination of the father and in her closing submissions.

Further, whilst the father paid significant sums of money to Mr Y, there is no evidence before the court that the father intended that money to be used to bribe officials in Zambia or that Mr Y made corrupt payments to such officials.  In the circumstances, whilst Ms Allman sought in her written and oral submissions to make links between the fact money had been paid and certain actions on the part of the Zambian authorities, there is likewise no evidence that a particular action taken by a police officer or official in Zambia was the result of a payment made by the father either directly or through Mr Y.  It is the case that the father did not reveal the payments made to Mr Y voluntarily nor the extent of the meetings with officials that were conducted on his behalf.  However, I remind myself that the mother too did not reveal the matters set out above regarding her efforts in respect of the police investigation until they began to be revealed during cross-examination at the hearing in February 2024.  In the same way that the mother&#8217;s actions in relation to the investigation are consistent both with a concerned parent wanting a thorough investigation and a malicious parent making a false allegation, so are the father&#8217;s actions consistent both with a guilty man seeking to avoid investigation and an innocent man terrified of being wrongly convicted in a foreign jurisdiction.  </p>

Nor, for the same reasons, is the evidence is sufficient to conclude that the father has turned a blind eye to bribery being undertaken by Mr Y using the money the father paid to him.</p>

Ms Allman submits that this must be taken into account when considering the forensic significance of any omissions in the mother&#8217;s earlier statements.  Whilst there is some force in that point, it is also the case that the question of whether A should be returned to the jurisdiction was a welfare question, the father&#8217;s application having been brought under the inherent jurisdiction. Further, each of the statements filed and served by the parties deals with matters that provided the opportunity for the mother to raise the serious allegations on which she now relies.  Finally, and importantly, as noted above the mother commenced proceedings in Zambia for a protection order in which the sexual risk allegedly presented by the father was the central issue before the court, in circumstances where the mother contends those proceedings were brought because of the allegation of sexual abuse against the father.</p>

In each statement prior to her final statement, in describing how the parties met the mother has stated that this was through a dating website.  At no point did the mother suggest that she was working as an escort or that the parents&#8217; relationship commenced in that context.  She did not make such an assertion in the proceedings in Zambia for a protection order.  Whilst I accept that it might be difficult for someone to acknowledge working as an escort, I am not satisfied in this case that that is the explanation for the mother&#8217;s change of account.  Whilst the mother plainly had an opportunity in her earlier statements that deal with how the parties met to give an accurate account, it is only in the context of her statement that deals with her allegation that the father lacks appropriate sexual boundaries, which allegation itself has not been levelled before, that the mother changed her account.  </p>

I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s change of account is a deliberate mischaracterisation of how the parents met.  I am further satisfied that the father&#8217;s continued use of the dating website in question to form relationships does not support the mother&#8217;s allegation that the father is paying young women to perform sexual acts via escort agency websites. </p>

The father exhibits to his statements examples of the Instagram pages themselves, depicting the photographs from the Instagram pages listed by the mother.  All of the women in the photographs are clothed, the photographs generally depicting women engaging in a wealthy lifestyle in fashionable evening, sports and leisure wear or interacting with friends and relatives.  The mother made no previous mention of her concerns regarding the father viewing pornography or social media either in these proceedings, as a reason that it would not be in A&#8217;s best interests to return to this jurisdiction or as a reason for caution with respect to contact, or in the protection order proceedings in Zambia, as justification for a protection order.</p>

Contrary to the assertion now made by the mother, there is no evidence before the court that the father is addicted to pornography.  I am satisfied that by producing only the web addresses of the Instagram pages on the father&#8217;s phone rather than the pages themselves and then seeking to characterise those pages picturing women &#8220;in their late teens or early twenties&#8221; without any further qualification, the mother deliberately sought to mischaracterise the Instagram pages being viewed by the father.  Once the pages themselves are seen, the mother&#8217;s mischaracterisation becomes clear.  In this context, I likewise reject as untrue the mother&#8217;s evidence that the father told her that he had been looking at Instagram to get in the mood ahead of masturbating to pornographic material.  Having regard to the evidence before the court, I decline to make a finding that the father masturbated to Instagram videos posted by young women who appeared to be in their late teens or early twenties.

Whilst, once again, I note Ms Allman&#8217;s submission regarding the purpose of earlier statements, the mother has made no previous mention of this extremely serious matter in her previous statements in these proceedings as a reason that it would not be in A&#8217;s best interests to return to this jurisdiction or as a reason for caution with respect to contact.  The mother conceded in cross-examination that she had not mentioned the fact that, on her case, the father was becoming sexually aroused around A to any safeguarding agency, the GP, the police or to members of her family.  The mother was unable to provide any dates of specific incidents.  Whilst the mother claimed to have raised these matters with the police in Zambia during the investigation she was unable to provide any specifics and couched her answers in terms of what she &#8220;would have&#8221; done, not what she did do, notwithstanding her other extensive and documented efforts concerning the investigation.  There is no mention of the mother having raised such concerns in the Zambian documents available to this court.

In her statement of 22 October 2022, made after the she had raised the allegation of sexual abuse in Zambia against the father, the mother recalled that &#8220;when he travelled in June 2022 for a 1 week visit, I offered my home as a place of accommodation which would enable him to spend an unlimited amount of time with A around her routine but [the father] declined&#8221;.   As I have noted, on 9 August 2022 the mother sent an email to the father outlining proposals with respect to the future.  At the outset of the email, the mother referred to the father&#8217;s contact with A and stated that &#8220;It was good seeing you and A really enjoyed father daughter time&#8221;. The email further states that the father &#8220;would be welcome to stay at the house during your visits&#8221; and, as noted above, ended by referring to &#8220;the beautiful bond&#8221; shared by A and her father.  The mother permitted the father further unsupervised contact in Zambia on occasions in August 2022 and again on 11 September 2022.  The allegation that the father became sexually aroused around A was not mentioned in the mother&#8217;s statement dated 1 March 2024 dealing with interim contact arrangements for the father following return of A to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  Finally, the &#8220;open offer&#8221; made by the mother in these proceedings dated 25 June 2024 proposed to drop all allegations against the father and proceed immediately to unsupervised contact and, ultimately, to shared care.</p>

On the evidence before the court in his case however, I am satisfied that the lies and mischaracterisations by the mother that I have detailed above were deliberate and plainly relate to a material issue.  Having regard to the matters set out above, and the context in which those matters arise, I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s motive in seeking to mislead the court has been to bolster her allegation of sexual abuse against the father by seeking to demonstrate that he lacks appropriate sexual boundaries.  I am satisfied on the basis of the conclusions set out above that the mother has engaged in a number of mischaracterisations and lies in an effort to make good that assertion and to support her allegation that the father sexually abused A. I pause to note that the roots of this conduct can be seen in the mother&#8217;s letter of complaint to the Permanent Secretary on 10 May 2023, in which she mischaracterises the conclusions of Dr M&#8217;s view (&#8220;strong reason to suspect sexual abuse&#8221;) and Dr G&#8217;s view (&#8220;A had suffered some form of sexual abuse&#8221;) when compared with their reports and asserted that police had &#8220;gathered new evidence which supports the notion that this was a serious crime committed against a young innocent child&#8221;.

Ms Allman submits that the RCPCH guidance for best practice states that bruising found on the genitalia is usually a sign of trauma in the absence of other medical causes and, in the absence of a history of accidental trauma, consensual sexual activity or other medical causes, sexual abuse should always be considered.  Whilst Dr G states she noted bruising, Dr M did not note such bruising.  Whilst Ms Allman submits that there is no history of accidental trauma in this case, the mother&#8217;s own evidence is that the bruising noted to A&#8217;s left thigh by Dr G had been sustained during play.  The precise location of that bruise is not noted in Dr G&#8217;s notes or report. Ms Allman further points to the fact that the RCPCH guidance notes in particular that [the features seen on A] have not been reported in girls selected for non-abuse in studies and have been reported in pre-pubertal girls with a history of penetration.  Both Dr M and Dr G state that they saw [those features], as did the maternal grandmother.  </p>

There are, however, real difficulties in relying on the test results in this case.

Of more concern, the mother&#8217;s statement states that once taken the swabs were placed in front of a fan to dry.  As I have noted, the court does not have before it expert evidence.  Again, the mother&#8217;s evidence must be treated with caution.  However, I consider that I am entitled to take judicial notice of the fact that placing a swab in front of a fan risks the sample being contaminated by other material in the vicinity.  There are no details before the court as to how the samples were thereafter transported to the testing laboratory, and in particular no details of the steps that were taken to maintain the chain of custody.  The report stating that the samples tested positive for semen is one sentence long.  It provides no details of the type of testing carried out, the circumstances in which the test were undertaken or the data that is said to constitute the positive result.  In the foregoing context, I am not satisfied that I can rely on the evidence that there was a positive result for semen from the swabs taken from A.</p>

They each record different findings with respect to [some features] but appear to agree with respect to [other features]. As the RCPCH guidance notes, [the latter features] have not been reported in girls selected for non-abuse and have been reported in pre-pubertal girls with a history of penetration.  As the RCPCH guidance also makes clear no physical sign can be regarded as being uniquely diagnostic of child sexual abuse and abnormal physical signs are rarely unequivocally diagnostic.   In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the furthest the court is able to go on the evidence with respect to the question of whether A was subjected to sexual abuse is that on 13 September 2022 A was seen to have injuries to her genitals that can be, but are not inevitably, consistent with having been sexually abused.  </p>

By the findings she seeks, the mother&#8217;s allegation amounts to the father having sexually abused A by penetrating her during the course of a one and a half hour contact visit in Zambia.  In this context, in evaluating the evidence relevant to determining whether the father caused the changes to A&#8217;s genitals by sexually abusing her, I have taken account of the inherent improbability of a father, in respect of whom there are no forensic risk factors or prior concerns and who is engaged in proceedings in this jurisdiction to secure the return of child to England, travelling to a foreign jurisdiction for contact and, between taking videos depicting her presentation and demeanour to send back to his family, sexually abusing that child during contact before returning the child to her mother who is seeking to ensure she remains in her care in that foreign jurisdiction.</p>

That submission, however, relies on two logical fallacies. First, that because A had injuries to her genitals, <span style="font-style:italic">ergo</span> she was sexually abused.

As such, considerable caution must be exercised where a given risk factor has not been formally quantified.  However, in considering the question of whether the father caused the injuries to A&#8217;s genitals by sexually abusing A, I do consider it relevant that, for the reasons set out above, I am not satisfied that the father has demonstrated inappropriate sexual boundaries and have rejected as untrue the mother&#8217;s assertion that the father became sexually aroused in the present of A.   Further, there is no suggestion that the father exhibits other forensic factors that increase the risk of him perpetrating sexual abuse, such as alcohol or drug abuse, depression or other mental health issues, a history of physical or sexual abuse as a child, past physical or sexual abuse of a child, poverty and other socioeconomic disadvantage or a poor parent-child relationship.</p>

Whilst I have declined to make a finding that the father bribed officials in Zambia for the reasons set out above, the mother also places reliance on what she contends is his other interference with the police investigation, his alleged refusal to submit to DNA testing by the Zambian police and his decision to leave Zambia during the course of the criminal investigation whilst subject to a bond.   In circumstances where the father concedes he took the steps set out above with respect to the police investigation, that he has not submitted to DNA testing in Zambia and did leave that jurisdiction whilst under investigation, the central question for the court is the father&#8217;s motivation for taking these steps.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have dealt above with the question of interference, being satisfied that both parents sought to interfere with the police investigation in Zambia.  As I noted, it is not clear the extent to which it is normal practice in the jurisdiction of Zambia for parties to employ others to make representations in the context of a criminal investigation, as both parties sought to do in the case.  With respect to the father&#8217;s actions of not attending to provide a DNA sample and leaving Zambia during the course of the police investigation, I am not satisfied that this is evidence of the father having sexually abused A.  Ms Allman submits that the father has refused to take any steps which would enable the sample taken from A to be analysed against his DNA in &#8220;a safe manner&#8221; and that his failure to agree to such a course is evidence of his having perpetrated sexual abuse.  However, it is very difficult to see how such an outcome could be achieved in circumstances where the comparator for any DNA test would be the swab taken from A, with all the difficulties set out above including the risk of contamination, the lack of evidence as to how the swab was processed and the complete absence of evidence of a robust chain of custody.   With respect to the father leaving the country during the course of the investigation, as I have noted that course of action is consistent both with an innocent man terrified of being wrongly convicted in a foreign jurisdiction and a guilty man seeking to avoid investigation.  Having regard to the totality of the evidence before the court, I am satisfied that the father&#8217;s motivation is likely to have been the former rather than the latter.  Whilst the mother also relies on what she contends is the father mischaracterising the reasons the criminal proceedings were discontinued, I am not persuaded that acts to change my conclusions.</p>

In particular, the allegation made by the mother that the father had sexually abused A was made in the context of private law proceedings in which the father was seeking the return of A to this jurisdiction and the mother was resisting that outcome.  The allegation was made within a short time of the mother&#8217;s proposals contained in her email of 9 August 2022 not having resolved matters.  On the mother&#8217;s case, she did not immediately contact the police following the father&#8217;s contact with A on 13 September 2022, but rather sought to secure evidence from medical practitioners.  As I have already noted, the mother involved herself in, and interfered with, the police investigation on multiple occasions, including seeking to influence the course of DNA testing.  As I have found, ahead of this hearing the mother sought to mischaracterise aspects of the father&#8217;s behaviour in an effort to demonstrate he had inappropriate boundaries and lied about him becoming sexually aroused in the presence of A. Finally, and notwithstanding the gravity of her allegation, the mother caused an &#8220;open offer&#8221; to be made in these proceedings, dated 25 June 2024, in which she proposed to drop all allegations against the father and proceed immediately to unsupervised contact, leading to shared care.</p>

Again, in the circumstances, it was reasonable thereafter for the mother to follow the advice of Dr G to involve the police.  In these circumstances, and whilst I am satisfied that the mother jumped immediately to the conclusion that the father had sexually abused A without considering any other possibility, and whilst I am entirely satisfied on the evidence that latterly, and in particular in her statement of 19 June 2024, the mother has sought to exaggerate and mislead in an effort to bolster her allegation of sexual abuse, I do not consider that she acted in bad faith in taking A to medical professionals on 13 and 14 September 2022 and thereafter reporting the matter to the police.</p>
