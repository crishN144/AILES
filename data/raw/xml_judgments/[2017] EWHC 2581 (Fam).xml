The background of the case included the history of the medical treatment as set out in that judgment, and I do not propose to recite it here.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Last Friday, his condition deteriorated significantly and the trust made an application to court for an order concerning his interim treatment, pending that hearing on Thursday.  The order sought was a declaration order that it was in his best interests that the current treatment plan be revised with immediate effect so that it is lawful and in his best interests for: (a) no neurosurgical intervention to be given; (b) in the event of a cardiac arrest, no forms of cardiac resuscitation to be given; (c) there to be no escalation of treatment from that currently provided, i.e. no invasive intervention, included but not restricted to renal replacement and inotropes.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">After hearing their evidence and the submissions made on behalf of the parties, I made an order making the first and second of the orders sought by the trust but not the third.  In other words, I made an order that it was in his best interests for there to be no further neurosurgical intervention and in the event of cardiac arrest no cardiac resuscitation, but at that stage I declined to make any order in respect of his ongoing treatment, because I felt I did not have sufficiently detailed evidence about that issue.  </span></p>

The parents had simply not been able to give full instructions to their legal representatives prior to that hearing and were thus obviously entitled to having an opportunity to be heard further on those issues.  The order, as drafted, lasts until about six o'clock today.  The parents&#8217; representatives reserved the right to challenge the extension of those orders.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The court has before it further evidence from Dr&#160;D, consultant paediatric intensivist, addressing the ongoing treatment plan.  He reported that, since the last hearing, there has been a continuing deterioration in H&#8217;s condition.  His haemoglobin levels have continued to drop.  He has received a number of further blood transfusions over the last two or three days with consistently falling haemoglobin levels.  There remain no clinical signs of bleeding from the gut and it is therefore considered likely that the cause of the bleed is ongoing haemorrhage into his brain and head, and further evidence for this is found in a growing cephalohaematoma, that is to say swelling on the side of his head.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr&#160;D advised that H has only survived the last few days because of the repeated blood transfusions.  He advised further that, because it is not possible to treat the underlying cause of the bleeding, providing supportive blood transfusions is &#8216;akin to giving paracetamol to a child with sepsis to bring down their temperature without treating the cause of the sepsis&#8217;.  He advised that there was, in addition, increasing clinical evidence that H was suffering as a result of the continued interventions, because he was having increasing episodes of dystonia lasting for much longer duration.  In those circumstances, and having regard to the lack of any evidence of any possibility of recovery or improvement, he proposed that H should hereafter be given non-invasive care, which he particularised in his further report for the court this afternoon.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In his evidence this afternoon, which was given by telephone from the hospital, he explained that again H has become increasingly dystonic, which has the effect of his arms becoming very rigid and then shaking.  At that point, his heart rate &#8216;shoots up&#8217; to 200 and his blood pressure also rises.  Dr&#160;D explained that that was evidence the child was suffering from pain.  He is unable to demonstrate pain in conventional ways, because he is unconscious, but the dramatic and sudden increase in heart rate and blood pressure is indicative of pain.  Were it simply an increase in heart rate with lowering blood pressure, that would indicative possibly of simply fluid loss, but the fact there is the combination of increased heart rate and increased blood pressure is, says Dr&#160;D, indicative of the fact this child is suffering from pain.  He said it is the tightening up of the muscles that has caused the heart rate and blood pressure to shoot up as a response to the pain.  </span></p>

I have been struck in the evidence Dr&#160;D has given, by his compassion and humanity, and by the meticulous care he has given to this child.  He took the trouble of going to the hospital this evening to examine the child again before he came to give evidence over the phone to me this afternoon.</span></p>

He has given the most careful thought and, if I may say so, done exactly what I asked him to do on Friday: to give very meticulous and precise details of what is now appropriate in the form of non-invasive care.</span></p>

It seems to me, in the light of the evidence I have heard, it is manifestly right that those orders should continue, and they will continue together with the additional order to which I have just referred until the hearing on Thursday.</span></p>

It seems to me that that is consistent with the overall framework of the non-invasive care treatment programme that he has put forward this afternoon.  </span></p>
