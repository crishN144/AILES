	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns competing applications for the variation / capitalisation / discharge of a spousal periodical payments order, all within the financial remedies proceedings arising out of the divorce between WK (to whom I&#160;shall refer in this judgment as &#8220;the wife&#8221;) and GC (who I&#160;shall refer as &#8220;the husband&#8221;).  I&#160;am obviously well aware that their marriage ended a long time ago, and I&#160;hope they will forgive me for using the nomenclature &#8220;husband&#8221; and &#8220;wife&#8221; as it is convenient for delivering the judgment.</p>

Both parties appeared before me by counsel. For the wife, Mr&#160;Will Tyzack, instructed by Payne Hicks Beach, solicitors. For the husband, Miss Katherine Cook, instructed by Ribet Myles, solicitors.  I&#160;am grateful to both counsel for the extremely helpful and clear way that they have respectively conducted their cases.  Both parties have been represented before me at a first class level, but it has of course come at a significant cost.  The wife has incurred a total of &#163;135,143 in legal costs and the husband a total of 92,395 in legal costs.</p>

Decree Nisi was ordered in June 2003 and Decree Absolute was ordered on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 2004 after the financial remedies proceedings were completed.

Like now, they both instructed counsel.  Philip Marshall and Alexander Thorpe were instructed then, and the case was fully and robustly argued.  The judge ordered the sale of the then family home in Hammersmith, and he divided the proceeds marginally in the wife&#8217;s favour.  He also made a spousal periodical payments order in the sum of &#163;17,500 per&#160;annum or &#163;1458&#183;33 per calendar month on a joint lives basis.  He did not attach any inflation linking to that order, neither RPI nor CPI.</p>

He directed that the children&#8217;s school fees should be paid equally between the parties not actually till the end of their school days but for a short period; but I&#160;do not think that very much turns on that. As it happens, whatever that order says, by the time the school fees came to be paid the husband paid all of them, and that was in part because he had had an inheritance of &#163;140,000 from his mother, I&#160;think, at that time; and the wife saying she was unable to pay he preferred to pay that rather than insist on the strict wording of the order, and I&#160;want to give him credit for that because the children plainly have benefited from that decision.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to pensions, Senior District Judge Waller took a view (which was perhaps not uncommon of the judges&#8217; views at that time, but would now, I&#160;think, be surprising) of making  no pension sharing order and leaving the potential of spousal periodical payments to continue indefinitely.  In explaining that decision he said as follows:</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.98in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;It needs to be recognised that if the wife does not receive a pension sharing order, she will receive less than half the overall assets.  Equality is a cross-check to ensure fairness is achieved.  Pension assets may be treated differently to non-pension assets.  If the result of not making a pension sharing order is that the wife receives less than equality, this is justified by the fact that over half the Smith New Court pension was acquired before the marriage.  It would not be fair or just to divide that pension equally.  Furthermore, the husband&#8217;s financial contribution from monies acquired before the marriage was significantly greater.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.98in"><span style="font-style:italic">On the capital division so far, the wife has received over half of the assets.  The husband&#8217;s previous contribution should be recognised.  If there is to be continuing maintenance, the possibility of a pension sharing order still remains in the future.  If a pension sharing order is made now and it turns out to be wrong, it may not be possible to set it aside or make further provision.  It could result in much expensive litigation.  It would be better to leave the situation open to consider at a time when income positions are clearer.</span></p>

The parties&#8217; position is currently so unsure that it would be unfair and dangerous to make a pension sharing order.  It would be more appropriate for the wife to benefit from the income side of the husband&#8217;s pensions through the periodical payments.  </span></p>

If there is a continuing maintenance order, the husband needs to provide substantial death benefit cover.  One must be cautious about not making a pension attachment order since the pension sharing order will not be available until a later date.  There is the possibility of a future pension sharing order along with a variation of the level of periodical payments&#8221;.</span></p>

If the same facts had occurred now, a more likely order, I&#160;suggest, would have been a pension sharing order which equalised income at the state pension age of the parties.  The fact that a fair portion of the husband&#8217;s pension had accrued prior to the marriage would have been unlikely to change this outcome in what was obviously a needs case.</p>

The capital position of the parties had an imbalance at that stage in favour of the husband and the reason for that is the fact that he did not make a pension sharing order.  All of these facts seem to be quite significant in the context of what I&#160;am proposing to do now.</p>

In fact, it was &#163;1,458.33 per month and so he was paying, on the headline figure, &#163;100 less per year than he should have done, but it seems to me it is common ground that he more than made up for that by paying other things as well, such as club memberships and for a number of years for both the wife and the daughters, and I&#160;am not going to criticise him for this modest mathematical defect.</p>

First, the wife began to feel that she needed more than the &#163;17,400 which she was receiving from the husband to live on, and she felt the time perhaps had come to capitalise and/or to upwardly vary and possibly capitalise that order. Secondly, at a similar time, the husband decided to sell the home that he had owned since the divorce.  He had not actually been using it because he had become re-married, in 2016, and had moved into his new wife&#8217;s property in Earl&#8217;s Court/South Kensington.</p>

He also decided at the same time that he would stop paying maintenance to his wife or that he should be entitled to stop paying maintenance to his wife &#8211; although he did in fact continue to pay it. But the result of those thoughts by both parties was that in late August 2022, both of them made an application by way of Form&#160;A to the court and under those applications the wife sought an increase in the maintenance and its capitalisation and the husband sought a decrease or a discharge of the maintenance order.</p>

Mr&#160;Lockett was not instructed as a single joint expert and I&#160;need to have in my mind that <span style="font-style:italic">caveat</span>, and he does not have access to the internal documentation of the Bank of America pension fund, so, he does not know exactly how a CEV would be produced.  But he has done what he can to provide a value of what it would cost for the husband to provide similar rights that he has against Bank of America pension fund if he had to purchase those rights on the open market, and he has come up with a figure of a value of &#163;1,074,000 for the husband&#8217;s Bank of America pension.</p>

In this case we have the odd situation where we do not have the CEV, but we do have an independent valuation of what those rights would cost.  </p>

As well as that, the pension at the moment produces an income for the husband of &#163;49,565 inflation proofed for life and I&#160;am not surprised to find that the value of such a thing for a 67 year old man is c.&#163;1,074,000.  It seems about right.  In any event, lest the husband should feel aggrieved by the admission of that document, since no pension sharing order is sought by either party as the answer to this case and since I&#160;am not making an order which is based on any particular value of the husband&#8217;s pension as it is now, I&#160;do not think that he has been in any way affected by my using that figure, but it is helpful and interesting for me to see that figure in the context of a table to illustrate what now appears to be the capital position as it is now, which is Table&#160;B, which I set out below.</p>

The husband has suggested that the wife should move out of her current house, should buy a rather cheaper house and use the surplus cash as effectively a <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury</span> fund to replace his maintenance.  The wife strongly objects to that proposition; and having heard the evidence I&#160;have reached the conclusion overall that I&#160;do not think it is fair or reasonable that I&#160;should take into account money released from a notional sale for the purposes of my calculation.

Although it has a number of bedrooms, it is a modest house in size and not at all unsuitable for her living on her own with some regular visits from her children.  Certainly, there is no reference in Senior District Judge Waller&#8217;s judgment to the effect that he was expecting her to downsize at some future date.  </p>

So, for him to live in a &#163;1,750,000 house, possibly a bit more than that, and suggest that the wife should sell her &#163;1,350,000 house and buy something yet smaller, perhaps &#163;900,000 or even less than that, does not seem to me to meet the test of fairness, and I&#160;have not been satisfied that I&#160;should therefore do my calculations on the basis that the wife should be forced to sell that house or even that she could sell that house.

It is of course possible that the wife will receive inheritance from her mother at some point in the future, but she has not received it yet and her mother is alive and well, albeit at an advanced age of 94.  Although we have not carried out an in-depth analysis of the mother&#8217;s finances, she certainly seems to be a lady of some means.  But the difficulty of including this in any analysis now is that we do not know what will happen.  We do not know whether the wife will fall out with her mother, but perhaps more likely her mother may go into a home, may lose capacity and stay there for quite a number of years at huge cost eating up the capital which is hers, and undoubtedly her house would have to be sold on that scenario and the capital might disappear.  The wife has a brother as well so it would only be half what her mother got in any event and there may be inheritance taxes as well, there are all sorts of complications and I&#160;bear all those in mind, and I&#160;bear in mind also some of the case law on this, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Michael&#160;v&#160;Michael</span> [1986] 2&#160;FLR&#160;389.  </p>

Of course if the wife&#8217;s mother did die in a year or so&#8217;s time and left the wife a lot of money, then the fact that I&#160;have capitalised the maintenance now might seem unfair to the husband and there would be no way I&#160;do not think of re-opening the matter at that stage; but this sort of dilemma often occurs in these cases; and the balance of fairness usually &#8211; and I&#160;think in this case &#8211; comes down in favour of my not including this in the mathematical calculations.</p>

I&#160;heard quite a lot of evidence about the husband&#8217;s spending and it is quite clear that he has enjoyed quite a number of big ticket spending items which, all of us perhaps, envy the fun which he would have had at all of them:  dinner for 40 at a members&#8217; club; a box of 12 at the Albert Hall; a private jet to Venice; or &#163;3,800 Rolex watch purchased on a whim; trips to the Oval in private boxes, etcetera.  In the end, I&#160;do not feel it is appropriate for me to criticise him for doing that or to attach any weight to the fact that he has done that or think that that is significant in the context of this case.  He is entitled to spend his own money in whatever way he wishes, provided that he is not at the same time saying that that means that he cannot afford to meet what is reasonably due to the wife.  In fairness to the husband, he has not suggested that for a moment and he has not argued that there are greater priorities than paying his wife what she is reasonably due.  He has just argued that she is not reasonably due anything.</p>

If he feels that he can do that at the end of this case, all well and good, that is a very generous and loving thing to do and no doubt there are some tax advantages in doing it as well. Whilst I&#160;certainly would not criticise him for doing that, I&#160;certainly would not ask him for an undertaking either not to do that or to do that, it is entirely a matter for him.  But it seems to me that he cannot come to this court and say that that is a greater priority than paying his wife what she is due, and in fairness to him he never has said that and it has been no part of his case to say that that is a priority or because that came first that should be a priority and the issue of affordability should be assessed against that.  It is part of the background, and he will have to decide whether he wants to go ahead with it.  No doubt his daughters will be delighted if he does do that, but it is not something which he is obliged to do.</p>

As ever, we had the &#8220;battle of budgets&#8221; here, and the Form&#160;E budget seemed to pitch things a little on the high side at &#163;59,834, just a little shy of &#163;60,000&#160;per&#160;annum, and it is clear that she had never lived at that level although she said, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Well, had I&#160;had a reasonable amount of money I&#160;would have lived at that level and I&#8217;ve just been, just had to cut my cloth&#8221;.</span>  But in the presentation before me that figure was reduced to &#163;50,000 per&#160;annum and that is the one that I&#160;need to address my mind to.  </p>

In reaching that conclusion I&#160;take into account the standard of living that the parties had when they were together.

The answer is it can be, either by way of a pension sharing order or by way of a cash sum, and both parties would prefer me to do it by way of a cash sum on the facts of this particular case.  That can be capitalised, and so what are the mathematics of that?  And I&#160;have looked at the At a Glance <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury</span> tables for a 60&#160;year old female to secure &#163;25,000 a year for life would cost &#163;321,000, a 61 year old would cost &#163;308,000 and the wife is roughly halfway between the two, and therefore it seems to me that she is entitled to receive a lump sum of &#163;314,500 and that is the lump sum which I&#160;am going to order the husband to pay.  It is available as cash and that should be paid straightaway.  There is no question but that that can be afforded whether or not the husband downsizes what he would have given to the children or downsizes something else in his life, it is a matter entirely for him, but certainly the wife&#8217;s entitlements come first, and it seems to be reasonable that she should have that figure.  </p>
