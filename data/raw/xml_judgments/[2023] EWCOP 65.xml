This case is being heard alongside that of AA an 89 year old man who has been diagnosed with dementia, epilepsy, heart disease and cerebrovascular hypertension. AA is MA&#8217;s husband of 63 years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MA and AA met when they were 11 years old. MA worked as a nurse for much of her life. She has been described as a &#8220;fiercely independent&#8221; and &#8220;very determined&#8221; lady <span style="font-weight:bold">[G14/292]</span>. MA and AA have one son together, CA, who resides in outside of the jurisdiction.

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In summary, MA and AA previously lived at home together as a married couple. After concerns about their ability to manage at home, MA and AA moved to reside together at placement 1 in the same room. MA was later moved to a room on another floor and contact with AA was stopped. Placement 1 was unable to provide the care MA required. MA was subsequently served notice and moved to placement 2 which was a specialist unit able to deal with MA&#8217;s particular needs.</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A tiered plan was made to reintroduce contact between MA and AA via telephone, video call and then in person. After only two in person contact sessions, the local authority issued a COP9 application to end all contact, by any means, between MA and AA on the grounds of distress and risk posed to MA and AA at the end of contact sessions. This application is strongly opposed by MA.</p>

Desirable as that may be, and such a regime may well provide the optimum care outcome for P, but it may also be the case that unless, regular contact can be facilitated to a particular family member, the distress and confusion caused to P would be such that it would be no longer in her best interests to be detained, and that what might amount to sub optimum physical care would ultimately be preferable to no, or insufficient contact. The weighing up of such options are part of the best interests assessment process in relation to which the professionals who are eligible to be assessors are peculiarly qualified to conduct.</span></p>

	      </authorialNote>, I need to strike a balance between the sum of certain and possible gains against the sum of certain and possible losses. MA trusts the manager of placement 2 and is engaging more within the placement now than when she first arrived. If I require the manager of placement 2 to engage MA in something which she does not wish to do, I risk the loss of that trust and as such the quality of life that MA is obtaining within placement 2 diminishing. When that is offset against the benefit of having contact with AA who does not wish to engage in any event &#8211; it seems the emotional well being of MA is better protected by her not engaging in video contact.</p>

In respect of AA, the answer is blatant and obvious &#8211; there should be no contact. However, in respect of MA, the answer is less obvious. MA could draw a benefit from contact but at the present time does not wish to engage and is displaying a reluctance to engage in video calls due to a past bad experience which she can no longer recall save for she didn&#8217;t like it. In addition, when shown photographs of AA is displaying signs of anxiousness and has actively removed such photographs from her album. In my judgement it appears to me that MA would not currently derive a benefit from contact. I appreciate that there will be some distress to MA but when weighed up with the distress she faces each time any remote type of contact is imposed, that no contact is in her best interests at this time.</p>
