The Judge also noted the practical ramifications, noting that given that the alleged offence took place some years ago, and there was little corroborating evidence, the investigation would be even more complex. The context of that discussion was that C, a little girl of only three, would continue to have a restricted relationship with her father. </span></p>

In fact, he reminds himself that he must not make findings on any of the disputed matters. It is right that the Judge reflects what might be more generic concerns about the legal and evidential difficulties for the court when dealing with complaints of sexual assault that are alleged to have taken place within a relationship and which took place a number of years ago. However, the judge was entitled to make those generalised comments as they were important context to his overall premise that there was no basis at the current time to re-open the fact-finding determination and that the FCA was fundamentally wrong in suggesting that delay was necessary and proportionate. The mother&#8217;s position that effectively these proceedings be adjourned generally to await the outcome of that investigation was untenable, within the factual context that she had allowed unsupervised time between C and her father post separation. </span></p>

Therefore, there is a limited basis upon which the court would be entitled to conclude that the father&#8217;s time with C needed to be supervised, save to offer some physical and emotional reassurance. The Judge asks the grandparents to be present to act as a safety net, in order to assure the mother over the coming few weeks that the father has support. Therefore, there was no need for an &#8216;assessment&#8217; or evidence as to the suitability of the grandparents, as their only role, as I understand the Judge&#8217;s order, was to assist the father, particularly with the handover, given that his bail conditions preclude him coming into contact with the mother.

Contact arrangements have been progressing very well, which has been echoed by both parents, and as a result, C has benefitted from establishing a relationship with both parents. The court will however be aware that there is an active police investigation into the sexual abuse reports, and the father is currently on bail. In making recommendations for future contact, I have relied on the Cafcass Domestic Abuse Practice Policy, which stipulates that where there is a disclosure of sexual offending resulting in a police investigation, direct contact between the child and the accused party or parent is not to take place. The policy recommends that direct contact is suspended where it is already taking place, with very limited room for exceptional situations where some form of safe contact arrangements can be arranged. It is my view that C&#8217;s case is an exceptional one, as I worry that the suspension of ongoing contact at this point could impact on her ability to develop a bond with her father given her young age and the facr that this is the time when she is forming a close bond with her parents. There is also compelling evidence from enquiries that the current contact arrangements have been consistent, positive and in C&#8217;s best interests. There are safe arrangements in place where paternal grandparents are supervising contact, to help safeguard her while investigations are completed. Paternal grandparents have shared their commitment to continue supporting these arrangements. </span></p>

This recommendation is in line with the Cafcass Domestic Abuse Practice Policy. It is therefore my view that contact arrangements remain the same, until investigations are completed and a final outcome is received from the police.&#8221; </span></p>

The family court advisor has, in my view, gone  badly awry in making a recommendation that C&#8217;s time with her father must remain as it is until the conclusion of the criminal investigation. The court has already determined an application by the mother to adjourn indefinitely. That application was refused, and then the application for permission to appeal that decision was dismissed. The court has already decided that the allegations of domestic abuse made by the mother are not relevant to decisions about  this child&#8217;s welfare, save that there is a communication difficulty between the parents.  Permission to appeal that decision was refused. </span></p>

The allegations of physical/sexual harm are not being litigated, in large part because the local authority assessed that the father did not pose such a risk, and the court accepted that professional opinion. But also, on two occasions, the court determined that the allegations made by the mother were not relevant to risk, save that there was on-going concern on the part of both parents about the other&#8217;s ability to communicate positively and to co-parent. There was, and is, no additional evidence before the court today which would justify the recommendation of the FCA to &#8216;re-open&#8217; those issues, such that they should prevent the proceedings concluding, or the father&#8217;s contact progressing. The fact that the CAFCASS officer has relied upon the recent CAFCASS practice guidance, and not accepted the previous determinations by the court is a problem in terms of her analysis of risk, and therefore, the conclusions which she reaches.</span></p>

As I have said, the court had already determined, and given reasons, for why the allegations of the mother were not directly relevant to the time that C should spend with her father, and it was erroneous of the family court advisor to effectively seek to re-open those matters when considering how and when contact should move on. </span></p>

All of the evidence before the court, including that of the mother, is that C enjoys being with her father, looks forward to their time together and benefits from spending time within his home, together with his parents. What harm would befall her in the event that her time with her father were to be limited to five hours, once per fortnight, for the foreseeable and indeterminate future? </span></p>

The mother mentioned a number of times in her submissions that she wanted to &#8216;co-parent&#8217; with the father, and she felt that these proceedings were preventing her from doing so. I am going to make a final order today and encourage the parents to develop their communication to the benefit of their daughter, whose welfare is my paramount consideration. Having said that, I have spent some time reading the messages between them since July, and all of them are perfectly appropriate, and there is no evidence of the &#8216;control&#8217; which the mother fears.</span></p>

The arrangements that I put into place must be gradual to take account of C&#8217;s age and understanding. She is also not going to be in school until next year, and so the concept of school holidays is a little premature. She is not at risk in her mother or her father&#8217;s care. She will benefit from spending time in both their homes. They both love her and will ensure that she is able to develop into the young person that they want her to be.
