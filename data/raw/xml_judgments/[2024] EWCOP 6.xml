	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.11in">The general rule in Court of Protection proceedings is that hearings are conducted in private, as set out in Rule 4.1 of the 2017 Rules. However the &#8220;ordinary&#8221; approach, as set out in Rule 4.3 and Practice Direction 4C, is that hearings are held in public but subject to an order which imposes restrictions on the publication of information which identifies or may lead to the identification of the protected person (and others) or their whereabouts. This order is commonly referred to as the &#8216;transparency order.&#8217; Such an order was made in this matter, more or less in the standard terms provided in the Practice Direction, by Her Honour Judge Owens on 30 January 2023, expressed at paragraph eight to have effect until further order of the Court.   </p>

That order was made at a hearing and at the end of it, no party raised any issue about the transparency order.  I make that observation without any intent of criticism at all.  That is absolutely usual, in my experience, in Court of Protection hearings. </p>

She sent an email to the Court timed at 18.02 on 5th November 2023, which I have subsequently deemed to be her application in this respect.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.08in">None of the litigants today has the benefit of legal representation.  My task is more complicated than simply choosing which side I prefer.  I must set the opposing cases in the context of the law and determine the outcome accordingly.  So, more commonly, I would expect the legal representatives now to set your factual arguments into the legal context.  Of course I do not expect unrepresented litigants to be able to do that and I intend that you are at no disadvantage for not being represented.  So I have a proposal as to how we may conduct the hearing.  Having already read your position statements, I suggest that I outline to you what I am reminding myself of in respect of the law so that you know the law that I will be applying, and then you each have an opportunity to say to me anything further that you want to say in the context of that explanation.  Happily, I can see lots of nodding heads for that.  Does anybody want to disagree with that way forward?  Excellent.  </p>

This is because stories about particular individuals are simply much more attractive to readers than stories about unidentified people.  It is just human nature.  Article 10 protects not only the substance of ideas and information but also the form in which they are conveyed.  Editors know best how to present material in a way that will interest the readers of their particular publication and so help them to absorb information.  A requirement to report it in some austere abstract form devoid of much of its human interest could well mean that the report would not be read, and the information would not be passed on.&#8221;   </p>

Mr Stephens himself is no longer in need of its protection.  The family of his marriage actively wish to be able to discuss their experiences, including in  court.  It is not the role of the Court of Protection, still less within its practical ability, to control the accuracy and fairness of reporting. In any event, that is not the meaning of freedom of speech.  The answer to any concerns of &#8216;balance&#8217; in reporting is probably more openness, not less - that Dr Sorensen too should be free to discuss her experiences. </p>

So it is much better if determination of such issue is left for another day, when there is a proper argument to be heard.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.11in">Finally, although it is not within the scope of this decision, it may be helpful to note that the Rules Committee is currently considering the terms of the standard transparency order template.  One focus of its concerns is the expressed duration of the transparency order when it is made.  Had the transparency order in this matter been expressed to have effect &#8220;until final order&#8221;, it would have ceased to have effect on 16th June 2023 - Professor <span style="text-decoration-line:line-through;color:#FF0000">Sorensen</span><span/><span style="color:#FF0000">Stephens</span> would not have had to make this application; Dr Sorensen would not have had the opportunity to argue against it in circumstances where she is aware of the applicants&#8217; intentions to publicise.  Had the order been expressed to have effect &#8220;until the death of VS&#8221;, it would have ceased on 18th June 2023, and the same could be said. The time between the making of the discharge application in September and today&#8217;s hearing is partly explained by an earlier listing being vacated because the respondent was not available to make submissions.  Restriction of freedom of speech is always a serious matter but there has been no argument made to me today of any real prejudice caused by the time allowed to facilitate argument against the application.  </p>
