Otherwise the mere passage of time would qualify as a change of circumstances. Obviously, changes that were clearly either foreseen or which were foreseeable at the time of the original order cannot qualify. Otherwise, the provision would be just another variation power. </p>

In my opinion oral evidence will be a <span style="font-style:italic">rara avis </span>indeed. It must not be forgotten that this is a leave procedure. This is a not uncommon feature of the law. In the sphere of family law leave is required, for example, in proceedings under Part 3 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref>. Leave is required to appeal virtually every family court judgment. Leave is required for an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/50/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 50(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. Outside the sphere of family law leave is required to make an application for judicial review. In none of these cases is the decision ever made on oral evidence. The decision is invariably made on written evidence and on written and/or oral submissions. It would be curious if in proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 47</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> a different approach were adopted save in the most rare and exceptional case. </p>

Further, very recently Mr Justice Hayden has granted care and placement orders in respect of another child of the parents, OH. In that judgment he meticulously analysed the parents&#8217; present position. Ms Maureen Obi-Ezekpazu does not dispute that these judgments are admissible, nor could she. She however strongly maintains that they are not &#8220;binding&#8221; on me, and that I must make my own independent decision on the parents&#8217; application. She is clearly correct about that.
