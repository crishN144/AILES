The application is apparently unprecedented in this jurisdiction, though similar requests have been made in other countries.  It is supported by Mrs Spencer and opposed by Mrs Anderson, Mr Hall remaining neutral.  The arguments have been presented by Mr James Kemp on behalf of Mr Spencer and Mr Michael Mylonas QC and Ms Amy Street on behalf of Mrs Anderson.  </span></p>

Mr Spencer states that as a child he was told by his mother that his real father had moved away.  He never made any attempt to trace his father.  At some point Mr Spencer&#8217;s mother named Mr Anderson, but it was not until 2013, when Mr Spencer was 26 and Mr Anderson deceased, that Mr Spencer sought to establish his paternity.    </span></p>

Because of a family history of bowel cancer, a blood sample was taken and DNA was extracted from it.  This was used for testing for two high risk genes, which were not found.  The hospital retains a single DNA sample and no longer holds blood or tissues.  </span></p>

The new scientific techniques which have developed since the birth of the first IVF baby in 1978 open up the possibility of creating human life in ways and circumstances quite different from anything experienced before then. These possibilities bring with them huge practical and ethical difficulties. These have to be balanced against the strength and depth of the feelings of people who desperately long for the children which only these techniques can give them, as well as the natural desire of clinicians and scientists to use their skills to fulfil those wishes. Parliament has devised a legislative scheme and a statutory authority for regulating assisted reproduction in a way which tries to strike a fair balance between the various interests and concerns. Centres, the HFEA and the courts have to respect that scheme, however great their sympathy for the plight of particular individuals caught up in it."</span></p>

The Swiss court held that the applicant had been able to develop his personality despite his uncertainty as to his parentage.  The Government justified the refusal to allow the DNA test by citing the need to preserve both legal certainty and the interests of others.

After the death of Mr Mortensen, two putative sons asked for DNA testing to be carried out and for his body to be exhumed for that purpose.  The Danish High Court refused the application.

Such interference could not be effected without an explicit legal basis, which the High Court found did not exist in domestic law.  Accordingly, the High Court refused to order the exhumation of Mr Mortensen and the taking of samples for use in the paternity suit.

Such a power is inherent in its constitutional function as a court of justice. Every civilised system of government requires that the state should make available to all its citizens a means for the just and peaceful settlement of disputes between them as to their respective legal rights. &#8230; The power to dismiss a pending action for want of prosecution in cases where to allow the action to continue would involve a substantial risk that justice could not be done is thus properly described as an "inherent power" the exercise of which is within the "inherent jurisdiction" of the High Court. It would I think be conducive to legal clarity if the use of these two expressions were confined to the doing by the court of acts which it needs must have power to do in order to maintain its character as a court of justice.&#8221;</span></p>

If the court allows post-mortem DNA testing in the absence of consent, this is likely to discourage patients from providing DNA during medical treatment and encourage those in Mr Spencer&#8217;s position to defer making applications until after the death of the alleged father so as to circumvent the absence of consent.

Depending on the facts, the rights of surviving relatives may be engaged, but it is difficult to envisage a situation in which the establishment of the truth about biological relationships could amount to an unlawful interference with those rights; at the very least any interference may be necessary and proportionate.  The rights of third parties certainly cannot represent an absolute bar to the existence of an inherent power. </span></p>

In cases where a power exists, it has long been emphasised that the establishment of the truth is both a goal in itself and a process that serves the interests of justice.  As noted above, where a court makes findings of fact based upon witness and documentary testimony, there is always the possibility of error.  Evidence will be incomplete because (by definition in a case of the present kind) people will have died and memories may have faded.  When dealing with matters as important as parentage, the need to reach the right conclusion is obvious.  The prospect of a court trying to ascertain the truth to the best of its ability when the truth is in effect there for the asking is a troubling one.  Account must also be taken of the needless waste of resources that would accompany a trial involving narrative evidence.</span></p>

What is relevant is the range of cases that might arise.  It is possible to envisage opportunistic and unmeritorious applications, but there might equally be applications, perhaps concerning young children, where the need to know the truth about parentage is compelling.  The answer cannot be that the court can consider an application in the second case but not in the first: jurisdiction cannot depend on merits.</span></p>

If the court was unable to obtain evidence of this kind, severe and avoidable injustice might result.   Awareness of the implications of ordering testing without consent and of the wider public interest does not lead to the conclusion that the jurisdiction does not exist, but rather to the realisation that it should be exercised sparingly in cases where the absence of a remedy would lead to injustice.  </span></p>
