It would be entirely possible for grounds not to have existed in May 2005 but clearly to exist now (e.g. even if not habitually resident here then, the wife could have become so in the meantime), so that even if there was no jurisdiction then, a fresh petition could be issued now.   However, as Mr Rafaquat Hussain submitted on behalf of the husband, much has happened between 2005 and the present time in reliance upon the present petition, so it is important to establish whether it was or was not well grounded.</span></p>

However, as will later emerge, I have reached the very clear conclusion on the facts of this case that if the wife was habitually resident here on the date of the petition, then she was habitually resident here throughout the whole of the preceding year and indeed considerably longer. The bigger area of uncertainty in the present case relates to the period immediately preceding the petition rather than to the earlier part of the year.  So any views on this issue of law would be obiter and are irrelevant to my decision, and I have decided I should therefore not express them.</span></p>

The marriage disintegrated during 1999/2000.  The move of the wife to England in December 2000 effectively marked the end of any joint residence.  Immediately prior to that, they had been habitually resident together in Nigeria.</span></p>

During her childhood, she later acquired a Nigerian domicile of dependence which persisted after she attained the age of 16 until at least when she moved to live in England in 1989.  In my view, that move at the age of 23 would have been an enduring one if she had not become pregnant by, and married, the husband.  It is significant that as soon as she had completed her first degree in Nigeria, she travelled back to England and the country of her childhood.</span></p>

Her marriage had broken down.  She settled here where all her several siblings were living.  She placed her child in school here, and she embarked on further study over the border in Dundee.  Having established that habitual residence, the question is whether she broke it and either re-established habitual residence in Nigeria, or ceased to be habitually resident anywhere at all.</span></p>

What took her back to Nigeria was not a wish to establish the centre of her interests there, but the need to find schooling for Omotade when the husband refused to pay the fees here.  She plainly stayed longer in Nigeria when she embarked on her affair with Terry Waya, but it is significant that she returned here in January 2004 to give birth to her son here.  She resumed her LLM at Dundee.  It was only because of continuing difficulties with Omotade&#8217;s schooling that she returned to Nigeria in September 2004.  The periods in South Africa and later in America were clearly only holidays.  She came back here in March 2005 when she could.
