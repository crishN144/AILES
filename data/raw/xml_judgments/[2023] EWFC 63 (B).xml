That report was filed slightly late as there had been some missed appointments, but the local authority filed their final evidence on 25 January 2023, and the mother filed her final evidence on 7 February 2023.  The original guardian has most unfortunately been signed off sick, and has not returned to work, but I am grateful to both the management at Cafcass, and the new guardian who within a very short space of time was able to get to grips with this matter, undertake a significant number of visits, and then to file her report just before the hearing commenced.</span></p>

Another part is that mother is, as I set out on a number of occasions, utterly convinced that she is right, she knows the best thing to do for her daughters.  The judgment is therefore very challenging for her.</span></p>

Furthermore, the mother when asked about a number of  specific findings and whether she would act differently in the future is clear that she would not. </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">The mother makes it clear that if Y were to be returned to her care, she would wish to continue to care for her in very much the same way, including performing a number of the medical procedures upon her that I found were both unnecessary, intrusive, and painful for Y.   When the mother gave evidence in this hearing, she confirmed that is the case.  In the mother&#8217;s statement  she sets out her wish to be able to work with medical professionals involved with Y, but nothing appears to have changed.  On a number of occasions she directly disagrees with clear findings made after hearing extensive and in reality, utterly overwhelming evidence.  In her oral evidence she discussed how she would still want to check Y&#8217;s blood sugar levels, and retain a machine to do that.  She repeated that she thought that if Y was &#8216;pushed too far&#8217;, in what she did she may regress, and although the mother was reminded that the evidence was clear that did not happen, and there was a specific finding made in relation to that, she carried on in her view.  She told the independent social worker that she would continue to use eg the hoists and lifts for Y, and not allow her to climb the stairs, although Y now climbs the stairs herself daily with no problems in her foster placement.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">Another of the problems is illustrated by way of an example in the independent social work report.  The mother carried Y into the contact room when she was being observed, and set her down. At the end of the contact Y got up and walked out of the contact room, clearly to the surprise of the independent social worker.   When she challenged the mother as to why she had carried Y, the mother then denied that she had carried Y into the room. In her oral evidence the mother accepted that she had indeed carried Y into the room, but now said that this was because Y was very tired.  This neatly illustrates another of the significant difficulties in the mother being able to appropriately meet both children&#8217;s needs, as her version of events frequently changes, and does not reflect the reality of the situation. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">I am conscious that when Y was in the mother&#8217;s care, she required very extensive amounts of the mother&#8217;s time. She is a child who needs to be constantly watched, and indeed certainly when she was younger, she had a number of life-threatening incidents.  It is inevitable therefore, that H at times had her needs not met as fully as they might have been had the mother not been extremely busy caring for Y. I bear that in mind and the very significant pressures upon the mother over a period of years in relation to the matters I set out in this judgment.</span></p>

Although we had started to hear evidence on 13 February, it had been known for many months that the Court was not sitting on 14 February.  When the mother was asked about this in cross examination she said she had cancelled that appointment because of the court hearing.  She was challenged that it had been known ever since this hearing was booked that the Court was not sitting on that date.

She told the independent social worker that D became sexually aroused and had an erection during the performance, and that they then had a significant argument and the independent social worker stated that mother had said to her that they ended up leaving the performance early and it spoiled the day.  In her evidence when the mother was asked about this, she then suggested that in fact D was not aroused by watching that children&#8217;s musical, but was aroused when she put her hand upon his crotch area during the performance to check if he was aroused.  This was not a version that she had given to the independent social worker, but the mother appeared to consider that her second version was more acceptable.</span></p>

That records a wide range of aspects of the mother&#8217;s functioning and presentation which impacted upon her ability to meet her children&#8217;s needs. The psychologist set out that the mother has unresolved attachment issues, she is preoccupied and hypervigilant in respect of some reported traumas, but dismissive of others.  Her attachment profile would predict an increased risk of mental health problems, and personality dysfunction. The psychologist sets out that in her view these factors have a significant impact on the mother&#8217;s ability to form and maintain healthy interpersonal relationships, on her parenting capacity, and on her ability to identify risk and respond appropriately to that.</span></p>

Although the mother can repeat parts of what she has learnt on some courses, the way she puts that across caused the psychologist to believe that the mother had a partial understanding of what she had been taught, and cannot necessarily apply that learning consistently, and transfer knowledge and skills from one situation to another. Although the psychologist discusses the mother&#8217;s cognitive profile, she goes on to say that the cognitive profile does not fully explain the mother&#8217;s cognitive rigidity when it comes to her outright refusal to accept alternative opinions when those conflict with her own beliefs.</span></p>

Evidence has been produced that the mother has no diagnosis of that.  The independent social worker was cross examined that the mother had not told her that, and she was incorrect when she had reported that on a number of occasions in her report. It was suggested to her that the mother was describing H as having thyroid difficulties.  The evidence of the independent social worker however was entirely clear and consistent that the mother had been telling her that she, the mother,  also had such problems, particularly as she had discussed that it might be hereditary.  This is a very typical type of information given by the mother to people, which often consists of exaggerations and untruths.  I was quite satisfied that the independent social worker was accurate when she said the mother told her this, and the mother has now had to backtrack upon being presented with the evidence that it is not true.  The report of the psychologist sets out many other examples in relation to this, and there are a number in the previous judgment.  </span></p>

By contrast, to borrow from the evidence in this case, where a mother who untruthfully denies drinking goes to a park at night to drink alone, leaving her baby with its grandmother, the court will view that risk with a sense of proportion.  </span></p>

I have been careful in this judgment, not to simply conclude from that that mother is not able to safely care for H during her childhood.  H has very different needs to Y, and I am mindful that H has remained in her mother&#8217;s care until this point.</span></p>

I accept the evidence of the independent social worker, and the psychologist which in both instances was both extremely clear and accurate.  I accept the welfare analysis of the social worker and the guardian.  H&#8217;s welfare needs are overwhelming at the moment and she needs proper attuned parenting from a carer able to place H&#8217;s needs as their paramount consideration.  </span></p>
