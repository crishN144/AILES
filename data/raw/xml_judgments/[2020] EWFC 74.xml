If so, should the court refuse at this stage to hear the application in this case or list the matter for a final hearing?  These are the questions that arise at this stage of the proceedings in respect of an application made by Mr H for a declaration of parentage in respect of an adopted child formerly known as T (who, for the sake of convenience, I shall refer to in this judgment as T).  Mr H appears before the court in person.  He is the birth father of T as confirmed by the results of a DNA test dated 16 November 2015.  Mr H has provided the court with a Position Statement and has made short oral submissions at this hearing. </p>

R does not appear before the court and is not represented.  The adoption agency, which opposes Mr H&#8217;s application, is represented by Ms Lorraine Cavanagh, Queen&#8217;s Counsel and Ms Eleanor Keehan of counsel.  Ms Cavanagh and Ms Keehan have provided the court with a comprehensive Skeleton Argument borne of meticulous research into the relevant statutory provisions and Ms Cavanagh has made detailed oral submissions at this hearing.   </p>

The adoptive parents of T are aware of this application but are not party to these proceedings, His Honour Judge Booth having directed on 22 June 2020 that they should not be joined.  The views of the adoptive parents have however, been conveyed to the court by the statement of L on behalf of the adoption agency dated 25 September 2020.    </p>

However, I am not satisfied in this case that it is in T&#8217;s best interests for the court to refuse at this stage to hear Mr H&#8217;s application and I accordingly intend to list that application for a final hearing having determined the question of jurisdiction in the affirmative. </p>

I observe however, that it is clear that Mr H, who is without the benefit of legal advice, also considers that his application for a declaration of parentage prefigures his resuming a role in T&#8217;s life.   In these circumstances, it is only right that the court makes absolutely clear to Mr H that whilst I am satisfied that the court has jurisdiction to deal with his application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 55</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> and that it is appropriate for the court to hear and determine that application at a final hearing, <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> the court decides to make a declaration of parentage in his favour that declaration will <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>of itself mean that Mr H can resume a role in T&#8217;s life and will <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> confer upon Mr H parental responsibility in respect of T nor any other legal rights in respect of her. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">T became the subject of care proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and placement proceedings under Part 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> in 2015.   Mr H is not named on T&#8217;s birth certificate.  However, following the DNA paternity test dated 16 November 2015, to which I have referred and which indicated that Mr H is the birth father of T, he was made a party to those care proceedings.  On 6 April 2016 District Judge Greensmith (as he then was) made a final care order and placement order in respect of T.  Mr H sought permission to appeal the placement order.  On 26 July 2016 His Honour Judge Duggan refused Mr H permission to appeal.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">During the case management stage of this application a question arose as to whether His Honour Judge Duggan had, during the course of the aforementioned care proceedings, directed the local authority to cause T&#8217;s birth certificate to be amended to record Mr H as her birth father, Mr H asserting (initially to CAFCASS) that Judge Duggan had made such an order in July 2016.  However, an investigation of the court file reveals no such order made by Judge Duggan, who was in any event dealing with Mr H&#8217;s application for permission to appeal the placement order rather than the substantive care and placement proceedings themselves, which as I have stated were heard by District Judge Greensmith (as he then was).  The order of Judge Duggan dismissing the application for permission to appeal the placement order contains no order relating to T&#8217;s birth certificate and a transcript of the final hearing of the care and placement proceedings before District Judge Greensmith contains no reference to amendment of T&#8217;s birth certificate.  In addition, there is no record of any application being made by Mr H for a declaration of parentage in respect of T prior to the application currently before this court.   </p>

We have no problems or issues with this because we believe it is important that T should know her full life history and all information should be correct and full without any "gaps".  We have already started doing some very basic life story work with T, and she already knows that she was a special baby who did not come out of "mummy's tummy" We have shown her pictures of Mr H and R holding T and she has enquired as to who is holding her, to which we have given her a honest answer. We do not intend to keep anything a secret from T and will tell her about Mr H and R and her adoption as she grows up. With that in mind we again emphasize that we do not object to Mr H&#8217;s name been placed on T's birth certificate.&#8221; </p>

It provides the status of the adopted child and of the adoptive parents. The effect of an adoption order is to extinguish any parental responsibility of the natural parents. Once an adoption order has been made, the adoptive parents stand to one another and the child in precisely the same relationship as if they were his legitimate parents, and the child stands in the same relationship to them as to legitimate parents. Once an adoption order has been made the adopted child ceases to be the child of his previous parent and becomes the child for all purposes of the adopters as though he were their legitimate child.&#8221; </p>

This is partly because it affects the status of the person adopted, and indeed adoption modifies the most fundamental of human relationships, that of parent and child. It effects a change intended to be permanent and concerning three parties. The first of these are the natural parents of the adopted person, who by adoption divest themselves of all rights and responsibilities in relation to that person. The second party is the adoptive parents, who assume the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to the adopted person. And the third party is the subject of the adoption, who ceases in law to be the child of his or her natural parents and becomes the child of the adoptive parents.&#8221; </p>

It is worthwhile picking apart what we mean by &#8220;natural parent&#8221; in this context. There is a difference between natural and legal parents. Thus, the father of a child born to unmarried parents was not legally a &#8220;parent&#8221; until the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1987/42" uk:canonical="1987 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Reform Act 1987</ref> but he was always a natural parent. The anonymous donor who donates his sperm or her egg under the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation"> Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990</ref>  is the natural progenitor of the child but not his legal parent: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 27</ref> and 28 . The husband or unmarried partner of a mother who gives birth as a result of donor insemination in a licensed clinic in this country is for virtually all purposes a legal parent, but may not be any kind of natural parent: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/28" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 28</ref>. To be the legal parent of a child gives a person legal standing to bring and defend proceedings about the child and makes the child a member of that person's family, but it does not necessarily tell us much about the importance of that person to the child's welfare.&#8221; </p>

Hogg J did not hear any legal argument as to whether a declaration pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 55</ref>A(1) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> was possible after an adoption order having regard to the effect of the adoption legislation with which she was concerned.

Ms Cavanagh and Ms Keehan are also correct that, by contrast, there is no provision in Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> that makes provision for the birth certificate to be <span style="font-style:italic">re-marked</span> with the word &#8220;Adopted&#8221; following the reregistration of an adopted child&#8217;s birth after a declaration of parentage has been made pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 55</ref>A(1) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref>.

I am not however satisfied that any of these matters constitute evidence of an intention on the part of Parliament&#8217;s to exclude birth parents, and thus a whole cohort of biological parents, from the operation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 55</ref>A(1) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>. </p>

It is not however, necessary to determine this point in the context of an application by a putative birth parent with respect to a living child in circumstances where an applicant in that position who asserts that they are the biological parent of a living child will, by definition, fall within the term &#8220;is&#8221; rather than the term &#8220;was&#8221; by reason of the enduring nature of biological parentage.   </p>

The applications for permission to appeal made by Mr H during the proceedings leading up to that order were refused.  T is now settled in her adoptive placement and has been for nearly four years.  The statement of L makes clear that T&#8217;s adoptive parents harbour a concern that if Mr H&#8217;s application is granted it has the potential to cause disruption in the future should Mr H wish to cause difficulties.   However, it is also clear, as set out above, that the adoptive parents believe it is important that T should know her full life history, that all official information in respect of her should be correct and without gaps and that, in this context, that they do not object to Mr H&#8217;s name being placed on T&#8217;s birth certificate.  On behalf of the adoption agency, L also makes clear that she considers it would be in T&#8217;s interests to have a corrected birth certificate, albeit that she does not advocate for that course.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is plain that there is potential for disruption to result from the determination of an application by a birth parent for a declaration of parentage in respect of an adopted child.  The potential for such disruption is brought into focus by the nature of an adoptive placement.  As I have noted above, the authorities make clear that adoption orders are intended to be permanent and final and the family unit thereby created is intended to be inviolable and autonomous with respect to the decisions made as to what is in the best interests of the child in the light of the circumstances that exist from time to time, free from State interference or interference from legal strangers (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Adopted Child: Contact) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] Fam 210" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] Fam 210</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (A Minor) (Adopted Child: Contact)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] Fam 283" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] Fam 283</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Oxfordshire County Council v X, Y &amp; J</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 272" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 272</ref>).

Further, the effect of the rules in Part 8 of the FPR is that the adoptive parents will be amongst the automatic respondents to the application for a declaration of parentage in respect of a child who has been made the subject of an adoption order (notwithstanding the difficulties with the adoptive parents being served with the application in a closed serial number adoption case). In addition, if a declaration of parentage is made in favour of a birth parent with respect of a child who has been made the subject of an adoption order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>, pursuant to s FPR r 8.22(1) the declaration in favour of the birth parent made by the court must state the name given to the child by the adoptive parents if different (in circumstances where, if the child is known by a name other than that which appears in that child's birth certificate, r 8.22(1) requires that other name must also be stated in any order and declaration of parentage), which order would, by FPR r 8.22(2), have to be sent to the Registrar General within 21 days beginning with the date the declaration was made for the Registrar General to consider whether re-registration should take place under the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/20" uk:canonical="1953 (1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953</ref>.

However, the adoptive parents are now aware of Mr H&#8217;s application and, moreover, have expressed qualified support for the aim that Mr H seeks to achieve by that application insofar as it relates to the amendment of T&#8217;s birth certificate.  In these circumstances, whilst certain of the matters set out above will fall for further careful consideration by the court when deciding whether to grant the declaration sought (in particular in the context of considering the issue of public policy pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/58/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 58(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>), they are less powerful as reasons for refusing at this stage to hear the application where the application has already caused a degree of disruption to the equilibrium of the family which the adoptive parents have, to their credit, met with a degree of child centred equanimity.  </p>

In addition, there is plainly benefit to a child having access to accurate genetic information.

Within this context, I remind myself that DNA testing has already taken place in this case that shows that, as a matter of fact and as recognised by the adoptive parents, Mr H is the biological parent of T.   </p>

Against this however, the strict application of the current rules in this situation will result in T&#8217;s adoptive name appeared on the declaration of parentage.   Within this context, it will be important ahead of the final hearing of Mr H&#8217;s application to establish whether a declaration of parentage pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 55</ref>A(1) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> is <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> way of achieving this agreed aim.  For example, by HM Passport Office Form GRO185 an application can be made to re-register a child&#8217;s birth to add the details of the natural father.  Within this context, it is my intention to direct the adoption agency to make enquiries of the Registrar General to establish whether this procedure can be utilised to amend the birth certificate without the need for a declaration of parentage and whether, the Registrar General would also, as a matter of practice, add the word &#8220;Adopted&#8221; to upon reregistration following the use of this procedure where the child has been made the subject of an adoption order by the court. </p>
