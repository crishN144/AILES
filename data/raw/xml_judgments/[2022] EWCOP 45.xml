	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Prior to the events I describe below, Anna lived independently in her own flat in the community. Matters came to a head at the very end of last year when she was admitted to a local general hospital suffering from acute confusion and high blood glucose. She was subsequently admitted to critical care with developing cardiorespiratory failure secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis. At that time Anna had been without insulin being prescribed for several months.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In very simple terms the issues are these. Anna suffers from mild learning disability. There is a suggestion that she may also have a personality disorder. In the past, she has been very difficult to engage and manage in her diabetes care. Those responsible for that care are clear that her continued health- indeed, her survival- depends on their ability to ensure she receives regular administration of insulin. However, experience has shown that this is near impossible in the community. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Therefore, the Applicants initially applied to this Court for an order that Anna be admitted to a care home placement for assessment. I granted that application. It was hoped she would only need to be in the care home for a few weeks, following which a care plan in her own home could be formulated following the assessment process. That has not happened and, at the moment the Applicant considers it necessary for AH to continue in a care setting possibly in the long term.</span></p>

There have been considerable difficulties with capacity evidence in this case- the details of which I will address later on. However, in order to obtain a definitive capacity assessment the Court directed a single expert report from Dr Camden-Smith. There was some delay in this, for reasons I will not explain here. The matter was listed for a one day hearing today to deal with the issue of capacity alone. </span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">&#8220;[Diabetes Nurse] had a case discussion with Dr A, Diabetes Consultant. Dr A. confirmed capacity assessment had been completed yesterday (25.01.2022) by a junior doctor on the ward. Doctors focused on Anna&#8217;s understanding of outcome of not accepting insulin and effects of this. Anna is knowledgeable about Ketoacidosis. [Nurse] informed Dr A that the issues are around the barriers Anna is highly likely to put in place when discharged. Historically Anna has refused insulin from District Nurses and would not accept required amendments to the diabetic care plan despite risks to her safety. This needs to be discussed with Anna, to determine whether she will accept any changes to her insulin medication, and if she will accept involvement from the Diabetic Nurses, who she has previously refused to work with causing her to move her seek input from the Diabetic Consultant in Blackpool&#8230;&#8230;. Whilst the outcome of the Capacity Assessment was that Anna has capacity in this area, members of the MDT expressed concerns about this and that the hospital had not created the detailed, easy read version of a care plan for Anna&#8217;s insulin upon discharge and had potentially failed to ask detailed questions covering the proposed clinical intervention required / diabetic care plan.&#8221;</span></p>

Yesterday Anna demonstrated she needed insulin therapy and District Nurse input for insulin therapy, in agreement with this. Capacity assessment documented on Anna&#8217;s inpatient notes on 25th Jan at 16:07, looked at understanding the diabetes and need for treatment, completed by Dr A. Dr confirmed Anna was able to demonstrate understanding of her diabetes, she is aware of T2 following testing and understands the risk of not taking her insulin. Anna demonstrated ability to retain information, was able to make informed decisions based on the information and can provide reasoning for refusing, Anna refused to give her own insulin, due to needle phobia, which Dr A stated contributed to her weighing information. Anna is able to communicate her needs in full. Anna stated she wishes to allow the District Nurses to administer her insulin to help manage her diabetes.&#8221;</span></p>

Anna has previously stipulated where the District Nurses can park, have to provide name of person administering insulin and telephone 30 minutes before arriving. District Nurses previously stated they did not have capacity to meet these requirements. Anna continues to blame the District Nurses for not meeting her requirements and provided this as a reason for her declining health, [the locality lead] expressed her view that this highlights lack of capacity. Anna has repeatedly stated that her recent hospital admission is the District Nurses fault, which is why the care agency was presented as an option for administering Anna&#8217;s insulin, because Anna was declining District Nurse involvement. However, Anna has now expressed she wants them involved in her care again. It was highlighted within the MDT that this is a fundamental part of discharge planning around who will provide this care in the community, and assessing her capacity against this.</span></p>

Anna has historically had issues with rigid thinking, and this has been exacerbated since injuring her shoulder and furthermore since additional care agencies become involved. Concerns were raised that the more people become involved, the more paranoid Anna can become, and will decline multiagency information sharing. Anna previously would allow information sharing between District Nurses but not care providers. [service manager] felt the LD nurse involvement around health has been a positive step for Anna.

Staff need to be very open and honest when information has to be shared with other professionals. It is also important for staff not to have conversations amongst themselves when she is present or in her hearing as she is likely to misinterpret the information she overhears. Sometimes people with paranoid personality disorder do need either anti-depressant medication or small doses of anti-psychotic medication during stressful periods although of course this is unlikely to alter the underlying disorder. At this stage I would not recommend any medication.</span></p>

The Learning Disability Psychologist plans to carry out this assessment in the near future. Reason for referral this episode is that Anna is presenting with a consistent obsessive delusion which has become all-consuming for her. Due to her inability to emotionally regulate, both obsession and delusion are not unusual for her, but my current concern is that these &#8220;beliefs&#8221; are affecting her health and wellbeing, both physically and mentally, to the extent that she claims she has made herself homeless (as she is afraid to return home) and she has also received a verbal caution from the police for harassing/stalking a staff member who has chosen not to work with her anymore. The staff member had explained to Anna why she could not work with her anymore (witnessed by me and the staff members manager) and Anna was understandably very upset. That same evening, Anna went to the staff member&#8217;s house, who in turn contacted the police. Anna was quite scared as a result of the police intervention but following this, she has &#8220;not gone home&#8221; and is consistently saying that she and the staff member will &#8220;be together again&#8221;, &#8220;will live together&#8221; and will &#8220;go and see a solicitor together&#8221;.

[AH&#8217;s] care team hypothesise that her increasing demands regarding her care needs have been precipitated by the presence in her building of a woman with substantial physical disabilities who required high levels of care (including 24 hours 1:1 care) and [AH&#8217;s] desire to have the same level of care as this resident&#8221;.</span></p>

In assessing AH&#8217;s capacity, the primary decision is whether AH is able to decide to reside at the care home. However, that decision involves an ability to understand why she is there. For the reasons given by Dr Camden-Smith, AH is unable to understand that, and that is because of her learning disability along with traits of personality disorder and autism.</span></p>

Put another way, she is incapable of understanding the issue because of her learning disability and other features identified by the expert.</span></p>

He concluded that she did not lack the capacity to make the relevant decisions. However, I had before me an assessment from a clinical psychologist, Ms Guzman. She approached the assessment of capacity in what I consider to have been a more appropriate way, and certainly closer to that adopted eventually by Dr Camden-Smith. She focused on AH&#8217;s long standing and inflexible thinking style and her inability to accept that there is anything about her that needs to change (viz. mental health).</span></p>

It also meant that I was not able to reconfigure these proceedings under s.21A of the MCA, thereby entitling AH to non-means tested legal aid. Fortunately, due in part to the Trust&#8217;s willingness to help with funding and AH falling below the threshold whereby she would have to fund her own legal team, this did not have any adverse effects on AH. </span></p>
