A month later he had a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (&#8220;PEG&#8221;) tube inserted which was used to give him Clinically Assisted Nutrition and Hydration (&#8220;CANH&#8221;). On 27 March 2020 Mostyn J held that AF lacked capacity to decide whether to continue to receive CANH via his PEG, and found that it was in AF&#8217;s best interests for him to do so. </p>

After an overnight admission to hospital the blockage resolved and he was discharged back to the care home. On 9 October 2020 the PEG tube fell out. It is likely that the bumper which helped to keep the tube in place, failed due to wear and tear. AF was taken to the Emergency Department of the Applicant Trust&#8217;s hospital and was admitted under the care of the gastroenterology team. A feeding tube was inserted, not for the purpose of administering hydration and nutrition, but to maintain the patency of the PEG tract. AF is able to consume food orally and sometimes does so, but with no gastrostomy in place he was not receiving sufficient nutrition to sustain life. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">On the day of the hearing before me AF was in hospital again. He had been admitted late on 28 October when very unwell with pneumonia. He was administered antibiotics and monitored. I heard evidence from Dr B, a Consultant Gastroenterologist who has assessed him clinically in hospital, that he was responding well to treatment and that it was likely that he would become clinically well enough to undergo re-insertion of a PEG tube towards the end of his current in-patient stay, within a few days. This would avoid the need to re-admit him on a subsequent occasion. Dr B was an impressive witness who gave clear, fair-minded evidence. She told me, under questioning by all parties, that the procedure to reinsert the PEG tube would be more straightforward than </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in">the initial insertion because AF had a patent PEG tract. The procedure would therefore be similar to, and carry no more risk than, an endoscopic examination of the kind routinely undertaken for a biopsy. The risk of significant complications by way of perforation, aspiration or infection would be as low as 1 in 2000. It is a five-minute procedure, and is done under light sedation not general anaesthetic, such that the patient typically has no recollection of the procedure after it has been completed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">The advantage of a PEG reinsertion is that it will last usually for two to four years, it can be used both to continue CANH and the administration of medications that AF needs. A BG would need replacing every 3 months and whilst that can usually be done in the care home, it is, like the PEG re-insertion, an unpleasant experience for the individual undergoing it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">Dr B&#8217;s clear evidence was that AF is in a good condition nutritionally and is physiologically robust such that when he recovers from his pneumonia, as she fully expects he will, it is likely that he will be fully restored to his pre-pneumonia condition. She would expect, other things being equal, that with continued CANH he could live for a few more years yet. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">The PEG tube had been in place since 2016 and, as noted, they usually last for two to four years before requiring replacement. Therefore, in March 2020 it could have been expected that re-insertion would soon be required. However, the Court in March 2020 was not made aware of that expectation and therefore the order made did not expressly cover the need for reinsertion of the PEG tube. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">I should note that shortly after his most recent admission with pneumonia, a junior doctor decided, after consultation with the family, to put AF on an end of life pathway, Dr B told me that she would not have done so, but would usually wait for 24 to 48 hours to determine whether a patient was responding to antibiotics before making a decision of that kind. When she reviewed AF on the morning of 29 October he was responding well and, in consultation with the admitting consultant, but without discussion with the family, AF was taken off the end of life pathway. By the time of the hearing AF had had four to five doses of antibiotics, his C-Reactive Protein and white cell count were falling significantly, and the signs were that he would make a good recovery. Dr B advised that AF&#8217;s pneumonia was probably unrelated to the failure of his PEG tube or the insertion of the BG. It was coincidental. </p>

Similarly, there was no argument against approaching AF&#8217;s recent hospital admission for pneumonia as a change in circumstances that required a best interests evaluation, in particular given SJ&#8217;s position that treatment for it should cease. It might have been contended, but was not, that it was implicit in Mostyn J&#8217;s determination that re-insertion of the PEG was in AF&#8217;s best interests because it was necessary to ensure the continuation of CANH. The focus of the evidence before me was therefore on developments since Mostyn J&#8217;s judgment and the parties sensibly agreed that I need hear oral evidence from only two witnesses, Dr B and SJ. Hence, I was able to hear this case within one day and to give my determination whilst reserving this judgment for the reasons I have given. </p>

Those findings cannot be altered by subsequent events and there is no new evidence to demonstrate they could now be challenged.

Mr Beck asked him whether he wanted to continue to be looked after at the care home to which he appeared to nod &#8220;yes&#8221;. AF was asked whether he was &#8220;OK with [the PEG] in your tummy?&#8221; to which he &#8220;appeared to nod in the affirmative.&#8221; It is fair to note that on follow up questioning AF appeared to become confused and no reliable response could be elicited. The accounts of those who see AF daily were that he continues to enjoy listening to music and the radio, and having poetry read to him. He responds to these activities with evident emotion on occasions. He exercises choice, for example about whether to have the radio or television on, and at what volume, by using hand signals such as a thumbs up or thumbs down gesture. He enjoys watching films, especially cowboy films. He appears to remain attentive throughout a film and occasionally makes brief comments about them. On return to the care home from hospital on 20 October he gave fist bumps to members of staff. When Mr<span style="text-decoration-line:line-through"/>Beck asked AF how he felt about being back at the care home AF responded with what &#8220;sounded like a very positive affirmation &#8230; I could hear a distinct laugh or chuckle which sounded joyful.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">Very sadly JS has been unable to share in these kinds of interactions since she last saw her father in December 2019. She lives in Spain and the Covid-19 pandemic has prevented her from visiting him at the care home. She told me that arrangements for a video call, or similar, had been thwarted because the care home would not allow them to be conducted privately (this is not accepted by the care home). She gave powerful evidence to me about events in 2016 and her firm belief that her father had the PEG inserted at that time against his will. As she gave evidence it was painfully evident that she deeply mourns the loss of the man her father once was. However, for the reasons given, she cannot speak to his current condition and apparent wishes and feelings, however difficult they are to discern. The care staff and Mr James Beck were able to give the court up to date evidence. Their accounts add to the evidence that Mostyn J received that AF&#8217;s situation is far from that of a &#8220;body in a bed&#8221; &#8211; the situation that, prior to his stroke, AF had said he wanted to avoid. AF&#8217;s life is grossly diminished from the one he enjoyed before his stroke, but even so he has a life which appears to give him some stimulation and some pleasure. He gives no indications of being a man who wants to die or to resist being treated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">Taking into account all the relevant circumstances and the views referred to, I am quite satisfied that it is in AF&#8217;s best interests to undergo re-insertion of a PEG and any necessary ancillary procedures and I declare that such PEG insertion shall not be undertaken until such time as AF is in the opinion of his treating gastroenterology team medically fit to undergo the procedure and that exchanging his present balloon gastrostomy for a PEG is, in the opinion of his treating gastroenterology team, clinically indicated. I am also quite satisfied that it is in AF&#8217;s best interests to undergo active treatment for his current chest infection which, for avoidance of doubt, includes intravenous antibiotics and repeat blood tests. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">The active treatment and proposed reinsertion of the PEG tube does not constitute aggressive treatment, it interferes only very modestly with his bodily integrity, it carries an extremely low risk of complications and it is highly likely to succeed in returning him to the condition he was in until 9 October 2020. AF shows no indication of wishing to die and as Mostyn J found, any past views he expressed about not wishing to be a &#8220;body in a bed&#8221; do not apply to his current condition which is of a man who, notwithstanding his grossly restricted existence, can take pleasure and stimulation from activities, culture, and human interaction. </p>

However, all parties agree that there ought to be an ongoing care plan, in accordance with guidance from the BMA at section 2.7 of its document, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">CANH and adults who lack the capacity to consent &#8211; guidance for decision-making in England and Wales.&#8221;</span><span style="color:#FF0000"/>The Trust has agreed to write to the GP and CCG to inform them of this judgment and to ask them to use their best endeavours to ensure advance care planning now takes place, the CCG will be asked to put advance care planning on the agenda for the forthcoming best interests meeting that has been convened to determine whether AF should change GPs.  </p>
