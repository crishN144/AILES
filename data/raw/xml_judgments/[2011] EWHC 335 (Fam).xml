	    <p style="text-align:center">This judgment is being handed down in private on 24th February 2011. It consists of 22 pages and has been signed and dated by the judge.  The judge hereby gives leave for it to be reported.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:center">The judgment is being distributed on the strict understanding that in any report no person other than the advocates and their solicitor may be identified by name or location and that in particular the anonymity of the children and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This matter concerns two boys A (13 years) and B (8 years). Their parents are C and D, who I shall hereafter refer to in this judgment as the mother and father. The court is concerned with the mother&#8217;s application for leave to remove the children from the jurisdiction to live permanently with her in south USA.  The application is opposed by the father.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">These cases are very difficult, particularly when they are finely balanced, as this case undoubtedly is. There are powerful arguments advocated by the parties on paper and in oral evidence in support of their respective positions. The court has been greatly assisted by the parties having legal representation of the highest standard. There is no middle ground and inevitably one party is going to find the court&#8217;s decision very difficult.</p>

The father is in finance and has international offices in Europe, America and Asia. He said he spends about 40% of his time attending meetings within his organisation and the balance is meeting with managers, clients, accountants and auditors. He doesn&#8217;t work remotely via a computer; most of it is face to face.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The family lived together in London until the breakdown of the parents&#8217; relationship in 2005. On separation they agreed a shared care arrangement whereby each child spent an equal amount of time with each parent; during term time this was done by the children moving between their parents&#8217; homes each week and the school holidays were shared equally. There were times when they were flexible in the arrangements to accommodate the other parent&#8217;s commitments. </p>

She is separated from her husband and lives in north-east USA. In 2008 the father and X got engaged, no date was set for a wedding. The father would spend time with X, mainly in north-east USA which he combined with working there too.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In late 2008 the father applied to vary the term time arrangements to provide for the boys to spend alternating 2-week periods in term time with each parent, with the holiday periods remaining the same (divided equally). The mother&#8217;s response was to propose that term time be divided as to 20 days with the mother and 10 with the father (&#8216;20/10&#8217;). The father agreed to try this from September 2009, subject to it being reviewed at some stage. In practice the father&#8217;s parenting time during the school term runs from Friday after school until the Monday the following week, so the father has two weekends and the intervening week. The father said he only ever intended this to be a temporary arrangement, which he agreed to avoid a contested hearing and that he wanted it reviewed. In November 2009 Cafcass provided a short wishes and feelings report. This indicated that A wanted to continue to trial the 20/10 term time split for the time being, although he was keen to ensure there would still be flexibility. B was reported to say that he preferred to move to an equal division of time. A was then aged 11 years and B 6 years. The father agreed the 20/10 regime should continue, albeit not without some reservations.</p>

He has three children, two are around the same age as A and B and a third child who is between them. They live with their mother in central USA. During term time Y sees his children every other week for five nights, from Thursday to Tuesday. He pilots his own jet and travels to see them in central USA.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2010 the mother informed the father about her wish to move to live with Y in south USA and take the children with her. She set out the details in an email and said that she had not spoken to the boys about this. The father responded on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July setting out that he did not consider the move to south USA would be in the best interests of the children and suggested getting specialist advice to help them work out what the best way forward was. At the end of that email he said &#8220;Can I ask that you do not discuss this at all with the boys until we have worked out and agreed what is best for them.&#8221; The children were due to go to the father after school on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July. The mother responded to the father&#8217;s email on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July at 14.49, she did not agree to the suggestion of specialist help but suggested dates for a meeting between the parents. She did not respond to the father&#8217;s request about not speaking to the boys. The father sent an email in response 16 minutes later at 15.05, just before the boys pick up time from school, asking her to confirm that the boys were not aware of any plans and that she had not discussed her plans with them. The mother sent an email at 15.09 chasing the father to confirm what time he was free for a meeting but made no reference to whether she had discussed her plans with the boys. The father sent a further email at 15.21 asking the mother to respond regarding what had been said to the boys, he said &#8220;it is imperative I know before seeing the boys&#8221;. At 15.40 the father sent an email saying as he had not heard he assumed she had spoken to the boys and asked for a response as he commented &#8220;I need to know what they know&#8221;. The father set out in an email on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July why he thought he needed to know what had been said to the boys, the mother responded on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July in an email which included the following &#8220;Finally, you seemed distressed that I had spoken to the boys about this before you&#8230;As you often don&#8217;t choose to answer my emails and I was not sure you would respond given my past experiences and there was a small window of time due to a short parenting week, and a long delay in your response to me, I chose to gently introduce the idea to the boys to hear their views before I submitted the relevant paperwork by July 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>. Your choice to discuss this with the boys immediately upon handover on Monday without meeting with me first to hear what I had said to them, was entirely your decision&#8221;. Complaint had been made of the father that he raised this issue with the boys at the earliest opportunity after collecting them; the father denies raising it straight away but accepts he did speak to them about it.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have set this email exchange out in some detail as it is a shining example of the mother and father simply not communicating effectively or acting in a way that promotes the best interests of these children. The father should have responded earlier than 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July; the mother should have responded to his request for information as to what the boys had been told; neither parent should have discussed this issue with the boys until they had had a chance to speak with each other. There can have been no doubt that what the mother was proposing was going to be a contentious issue. It was clearly a matter of some importance to the children as well as the parties. The mother accepted in her oral evidence it would have been better for the father to know what had been said to the children prior to picking them up so, from the children&#8217;s perspective, there could have been an agreed message to the children from the parents about this issue. This was even more important as, if I have understood the sequence correctly, this was the start of the father&#8217;s parenting time which led onto (either immediately or very soon thereafter) his extended summer holiday period. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The parties met in September and October to discuss the application and explore ways to resolve the issues between them. Those discussions were not successful. A considerable amount of oral evidence was given about the context and content of these meetings. It was suggested on behalf of the mother that the father had, in effect, agreed to the move to south USA in principle providing arrangements could be made regarding his time with the children. The father&#8217;s case was that he did not consent to the move but was exploring what the options were. The meetings were not successful in finding common ground; further emails were exchanged between the parties. In one dated 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October the mother stated &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe any further face to face meetings is helpful or necessary&#8221;. A meeting with the respective legal teams was requested by the father&#8217;s legal team on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October; it was set up for 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October. On the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October the father&#8217;s solicitors rang to cancel the meeting as the father could not attend, no further meeting was arranged. A letter was sent by the mother&#8217;s solicitor on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December suggesting mediation, which had apparently been canvassed at the hearing before Mr Justice Mostyn on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December. That letter was responded to on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December but for various reasons it was not pursued. The reality is these parties have never come to terms on this issue. I accept the analysis of this aspect of the evidence set out in paragraph 53 of the closing submissions on behalf of the father. </p>

But the court&#8217;s powers to ensure the children&#8217;s continuing contact with both parents after separation or divorce is necessarily circumscribed. The court has the power to support the father who seeks to maintain or extend his relationship with his children through contact.  However, if in the aftermath of separation the father takes employment abroad or marries a woman whose employment takes her abroad or who marries a woman whose every connection is with another jurisdiction, the father will accompany her there and the consequential loss or diminution in his contact with the children of the prior relationship cannot be surveyed or controlled by the court.  These are the tides of chance and life and in the exercise of its paternalistic jurisdiction it is important that the court should recognise the force of these movements and not frustrate them unless they are shown to be contrary to the welfare of the child.&#8221; (para.12) </p>

She had been seeing him since early 2009 and this was the first relationship she had had since the breakdown of her relationship with the father in 2005. It was the first time she had introduced another man to the children. She was asked in oral evidence whether they were planning to get married, she replied &#8220;In a perfect world, yes, but, you know, I think that it's step by step and you need to be really practical about this.  You know, there is an integration period between -- if we were to be granted leave we have to integrate his family, my family, our lifestyles.  I'd like to be with him for the rest of my life.  Now, whether that means that we're married or not I don&#8217;t know, but that's my feeling about it.&#8221; She said it was going to be difficult for them to move to the next stage of their relationship if they were still living &#8220;inter-continentally&#8221; she said &#8220;...I think we have done very well over the last couple of years going back and forth. It hasn&#8217;t been easy but we&#8217;ve been committed to it, and committed to each other, and committed to the relationship, and committed to the children, and we&#8217;ve done it the best way we can. But, you know, we need to be realistic. The relationship won&#8217;t continue over at least an integrated relationship, there would be no purpose. Why would we continue to fly back and forth? It doesn&#8217;t make sense any more. I don&#8217;t want to go on about this, but I feel it has gone on for a long time.&#8221;</p>

As she commented in her oral evidence the person who looks after both her and the father at the airport remarked that as the father flies in she flies out. When Miss Eaton QC suggested to her the various scenarios of dividing the children&#8217;s time here between the father and the mother so that she could maximise her time with Y in south USA she said &#8220;This is not about how many evenings I spend with Y, and therefore this is not relevant to me because it is not about how many nights I spend with him.  It's about integrating families in a way that is based on love, in a family situation, it is not how much I can see my boyfriend in the evening.&#8221; It was put to her that if the boys remained in England and the division of the school term time was adjusted to 50/50 (two weeks on two weeks off) she would have more time available to see Y, she said she did not consider such a change was in the interests of the children.</p>

In his oral evidence he was able to give more details about the amount of time he had seen A and B, in England, Europe, the Caribbean and the USA and the amount of time they had spent at his home in south USA. He confirmed during term time he always travelled to central USA to see his children, holiday time was spent in various locations. He agreed he needed to travel for his work, and estimated about 6 &#8211; 7 days per month. He agreed, subject to his time constraints, he could travel to England with relative ease as he had his own plane. Resources are not an issue.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">If there were no other considerations I accept the next stage in their relationship would be for one of them to move to base themselves with the other. However, it is of note that due to the domestic and commercial logistics of their lives, in particular the amount of travelling they do, wherever they are based, individually or together, there will be considerable periods of time when they will not be together due to other commitments. So whilst I take into account what the mother says about it not being about the time they spend together it is about integrating the families, the fact is that each month there are likely to be significant periods when they are apart and their children are only likely to be together during holiday periods, as they are now. During school term time Y is likely to be away for over half of each month. In addition, on the mother&#8217;s case, the children will be with their father for 10 days of the month, which may or may not overlap with the time Y is away. Mixed into that would be the mother&#8217;s absences due to her commercial and business commitments. This aspect of the mother&#8217;s case needs to be considered in this important context.   </p>

However, again this must be looked at in the context of the evidence in this case. This is a very international family who undertake a lot of travel. As B observed to the independent social worker, in one of his more dramatic moments, he said he had spent half his life on a plane, this was not said as any complaint but as a fact of life. Travelling is very much a feature of all their lives, both for the children, their parents and Y.</p>

She accepted in evidence that she had significant financial resources available now but said she needed to retain and build on them for her financial security. Her case that she needed to be based in the US to pursue her future business interests and opportunities was somewhat vague. She was not suggesting that if she was based in London she would be prevented from pursuing these opportunities, she said she needed to be based in America but gave little detail other than expanding her business in America which did not seem to be dependent on her living there. Some of the projects she is involved in now are based in London and some are based abroad.   She produced three letters, two of which suggested being based in the US would make it easier to pursue her business interests. Having considered the evidence on this aspect it has to be looked at in the context that if the mother&#8217;s application is refused she is still likely to, and will be able to, spend significant periods of time abroad, whether for work or pleasure, or a combination of the two. She will be in a position to exploit the US market, whether she lives there full time or not.</p>

There is no doubt Y&#8217;s home is very pleasant, there are good schools and the weather may well be considerably sunnier than it is in London. However, the evidence also demonstrates that the children have very good homes in London and holiday homes in the Caribbean, they are very well established in the English education system where they have been all their educational lives and have flourished under that regime. There is no identified opportunity that is offered in south USA that is not available in London. London is a known quantity in all aspects of the children&#8217;s lives. Part of the mother&#8217;s case emphasises the importance for the children of seeing their parent&#8217;s being happy and settled and the mother&#8217;s happiness would be significantly enhanced if she was able to settle in her relationship with Y in south USA. That needs to be balanced with other relevant considerations, in particular the impact of the move on the children&#8217;s relationship with their father.  </p>

Much has been made in the oral evidence of the fact that the father does not sign the homework book for the children or do much homework with them. When they are with the father much of it is done with the nanny employed by the father who the children have known for a number of years. Although this is less so with A who, he says, does a lot of his homework unsupervised. It may well be that the nanny helps with or supervises much of the homework when the children are with the father but that did not diminish the importance of the children being able to spend significant periods of time with the father during the school term time with him in his home. He gave evidence of the routine during the time the children were with him which is something the children have known virtually all their school lives. When they are with him he spends most evenings with the children when he gets back from work in the early evening, talks about the day with them, discusses what they have done, plays with them, baths B and reads to them. There have been times when he has work commitments in the evening, when he has not been able to attend school events but that has not diminished the significance for the children of them being able to spend time in their father&#8217;s home during term time. It is of note that the independent social worker commented on the &#8220;seamless&#8221; way the children regarded the arrangements and, unusually in her experience, there was no hint of things or equipment being left in one home or the other. The children regarded each home and each parent as equal.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In his oral evidence the father explained that it was not going to be logistically possible for him to have 10 days every 30 days during the school term time in south USA. It is agreed he has no business interests there and it was not pressed that he could effectively operate his business &#8216;remotely&#8217; during that time. His case is that he can&#8217;t run his business that way, it is very dependent on face to face contact and he can&#8217;t be out of the running for such long periods at a time. It is possible in London as that is one of the centres of his business. Europe, where he also has offices, is not that far away. What was suggested to him by Mr Cobb QC was that now his relationship with X was over, and he accepted that about one third of the four months he spent in north-east USA each year was attributable to his relationship with X, he could simply move that time (estimated to be 35 days) to be in south USA with the children. The suggestion being that the 35 days would equate to the weekday time within the 10/20 regime during the school term time (there are about 7 or 8 of these over a year) and the weekends could be spent at his property in the Caribbean. That way he would not exceed the maximum number of days in the US for tax reasons. In my judgment this suggestion fails to recognise (a) the proximity of the father&#8217;s work in north-east USA. He said he went into his office each day when he was in north-east USA with X. That would not apply in south USA. The extra time attributable to X was not identified as being specific time periods or suggested as being compatible with the school term dates; (b) the mother in her own oral evidence accepted that travelling to the Caribbean each weekend, either end of the father&#8217;s 10 day parenting time, was not in the children&#8217;s interests. She even retreated from it being a good idea for one of those weekends. I accept the father&#8217;s evidence that if the move to south USA did take place his parenting time during the school term would probably be once a month for the weekend or possibly twice every five weeks.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied on the evidence I have heard that the father would not be able to replicate the current term time parenting time he has with the children, either in quantity or quality, in south USA. The position in terms of quantity is outlined in the previous paragraph. The commitments to his business and the logistics of the location of south USA, however &#8220;brilliant and creative and totally capable&#8221; the mother may regard him to be, means that he will not be able to spend the 10 day time periods in south USA during the school term. The position in relation to the quality of the time is also, in my judgment highly relevant. It is of significance that the current term time parenting is in his main home with known structures in place that have enabled the children, in the words of the independent social worker, to move in a seamless way between each home. The children have not only been able to experience time with their father but it has been in a place that is his home. That would not be the case in south USA. It would either be in a hotel or other accommodation that would be of a different quality, it would not be his home and he would either have to create a temporary structure out there or transport the relevant people who work with him in London to south USA for the time he is there. This was perhaps most vividly brought into focus when the father was asked about various scenarios by Mr Cobb QC. It was put to him that he could continue to operate his business in north-east USA if he was in south USA, as he could fly up for the day for appointments. It was suggested that if he did not have the structures in place in south USA the children could return to be with their mother and/or be looked after by those employed by her to do this in the mother&#8217;s household. Under the current regime that would be absorbed by those in the father&#8217;s home in London. </p>

I did not regard this to be the case, when considered in the context of all the evidence regarding the father&#8217;s very strong relationship and time with the children. He gave compelling evidence of his day to day involvement with the children when they were with him during the school term time as set out above.

The quantity and quality of the father&#8217;s time with the children is important. In London they spend time with the father in his home where he has structures in place to care for the children. That simply cannot be replicated in south USA or anything like it. In all likelihood the father would be in accommodation or a hotel where he does not spend any time other than when he had the children. His home life would not be there, neither would his work or social network.  The time the children spent with their father would be very different than it has been to date, they would not be sharing his home life in the way that they do now. As the independent social worker said you would not be comparing like with like it [time in south USA] would be of a &#8220;very different quality and nature because of course the father would only be going to south USA for the purpose of seeing A and B. In London as well as obviously the important time with the boys he has his own friends here, his own network, his business.&#8221; She observed &#8220;the whole concept would be different.&#8221;</p>

They both accepted in evidence their communication needs to improve. Both gave the attitude or actions of the other as the reason why this is so. They have both said things in the context of this difficult litigation that have not helped. The mother in her statements and in her discussions with the independent social worker has been very critical of the father (for example where she has suggested he does not prioritise the children). The father&#8217;s behaviour to the mother on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2011 was totally unacceptable. There is, in my judgment, a real risk that with increased physical distance and the consequent logistical difficulties in making the arrangements for the division of time the children spend with each parent if they move to live in south USA the fragility of the parents&#8217; communication would result in them spending less time with their father.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The reality, in my judgment, is that if they move to south USA it is very likely the father would spend significantly less time with the children, possibly only one or two weekends a month. That would significantly reduce the time he spends with the children, it would severely limit the opportunity he has to be involved with the day to day life of the children, in particular their school life in the widest sense. Such a reduction in quantity and quality of his time with the children would be a significant change from the current shared care arrangement and would not, in my judgment, be in the children&#8217;s best interests. Although the independent social worker did comment on the current strength of the children&#8217;s relationship with their parents despite the periods they spent apart from them (half the school holidays or during the 20/10 split in term time) the time spent with their father, if the children did go to south USA, would be of a different quality than it is currently. It would be likely in time to distance the children from their father, have an adverse impact on the strength of their relationship with their father and, as a result, cause them distress which would not be in their interests.</p>

The difficulty with that is that whilst it may be possible to replace the time on a numerical basis it would, from the children&#8217;s perspective, be very different from the time they have with their father now, not only in frequency but also the fact that it would be out of school term time. That would further distance the father from the involvement he has had in their lives (particularly their day to day lives) under the current shared care arrangement.</p>

As a result any evidence of the children&#8217;s views as reported by the parents has little, if any, weight as the children, particularly A, would have been very alert to what that particular parent would have wanted them to say.

For the reasons outlined above, I do not regard the evidence that the father (or the mother for that matter) has limited time away when the children are with them as being significant. The significance is not about quantity, but quality and quantity. The father has relied on the nanny employed by him but it has been in the context of the children being in the father&#8217;s home and no criticism has been made of what the nanny has done. I agree the father has no real plan for replacing the nanny, although he did suggest that another member of his household who is known to the children and has been away with them on a number of occasions would take over her role.  It was not suggested to the father that he would take steps to replace the nanny in a way that was other than in the children&#8217;s interests.</p>

Since the hearing concluded the court has been informed that both children are likely to be offered a place at one of the schools in south USA.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Having carefully considered all the evidence and the welfare checklist I have come to the clear conclusion that the welfare of each of these children is met by the mother&#8217;s application being refused. I recognise that this will be devastating for the mother but I have come to this conclusion primarily based on the evidence that the children are thriving under the regime the parents have devised in this jurisdiction and the adverse impact on their time and relationship with their father if they did move to south USA. For the reasons set out above I do not believe it can be effectively replicated if the children move to south USA and that any different regime will not meet the children&#8217;s needs. With the welfare of these children as the lodestar by which I am guided I am satisfied that the move to south USA would not meet the welfare needs of these children, however disappointing that decision will be for the mother.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the event that the application is refused the father seeks an adjustment of the division of time between the parents in term time from the 20/10 regime to an equal division (two weeks alternating). The father says (a) he entered into the current regime as a temporary measure that would be reviewed (b) the setting up of schedules of time with each parent is more complicated under the 20/10 regime than under an equal division of time (c) the children will benefit from spending equal time with each parent (d) it is what the children want although the father accepts (as does the independent social worker) they were not specifically asked about this. The mother objects, she says the current regime works and is in the best interests of the children.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have considered the welfare checklist in reaching my decision. In my judgment the children&#8217;s interests are best met by the current regime remaining in place for the following reasons: (a) It has been shown to work, the children have been described as thriving under it; (b) In the circumstances of this case the court is unlikely to get any further relevant information from seeking more information as to the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings. As set out above these children have already been over exposed to the dispute between these parents and further delay to seek their views will risk them becoming further involved with no obvious benefit. Both children are very close and loyal to each of their parents. (c) An equal division of time would have the advantage of simplicity in terms of the division of time and thereby reduce the conflict, but that is only one of the considerations. (d) The children will be acutely aware of the impact on the mother of her application being refused. To increase the amount of time the children spend with their father at the same time may send a confused message to the children and cause further uncertainty and conflict which would not be in their interests. The father&#8217;s application is therefore refused.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As I have already set out above I am greatly concerned that these children should not have mixed messages about the outcome of this case. One of the striking and very positive features of this case is the wealth of evidence that rightly pays tribute to each of the parents&#8217; ability to contribute to the care of the children. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is therefore incumbent on these parents to work together to ensure that the children are given the same message by each parent. There are no winners and losers in this situation, all the court has endeavoured to do is reach conclusions on the evidence that are in the best interests of the children. Both these parents have to take responsibility to protect the children from their ongoing communication difficulties and take steps to improve their method of communicating with each other, which can only benefit the children.</p>
