	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This hearing concerns a 93-year old lady with a diagnosis of severe dementia, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">To resolve these issues, there are before me 2 lever arch files of evidence, reports, records and authorities.  On 2 September 2014 District Judge Maughan, sitting in the Court of Protection in Birmingham, made an interim declaration that Mrs L lacks capacity to litigate and to make decisions as to her residence and as to arrangements for her care.  At the same time, she transferred the above issues about deprivation of liberty to a High Court Judge.  The Local Authority has been represented before me by Miss Hirst of Counsel, and Mrs L (through her adult daughter and litigation friend PC) by James Gatenby of Counsel.  I am grateful to them both for their written and oral submissions, which I have found most helpful.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The parties&#8217; positions, perhaps unusually, are as follows.  The Local Authority says that the arrangements, which I will come to, amount to a deprivation of Mrs L&#8217;s liberty.  It is said on behalf of Mrs L that they do not.  The case has been heard on submissions, but I have read a quantity of evidence about Mrs L and about the practical arrangements for her care and safety set out in one of the lever arch files. None of that material is in dispute.  Indeed, as well as competing Skeleton Arguments, counsel have volunteered an agreed statement of facts and issues.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As I have said, Mrs L is 93. She was widowed in 1976 and has lived since about that time, 39 years, in her current home, the upper floor flat in a 2-storey building. She has 4 adult daughters, 3 of whom live in England and one abroad.  Her daughter PC is, as I have said, her litigation friend.  If I may say so, the family seem to have done extraordinarily well in caring proactively for Mrs L, who was diagnosed with dementia in 2004.  Since that time, her condition has deteriorated, and understandably is deteriorating.  Her family have adapted her furniture and routines to take account of all her needs.  She fell twice in 2013, the first time injuring her hip and requiring an operation.  The second time in November 2013 she suffered no injury, but became disorientated and wandered away from her home very unsuitably clothed into the local town.  She was returned home by the Police or Social Services.  This event led to the involvement of the Local Authority. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">At that time, the garden at Mrs L&#8217;s home was not enclosed.  In the light of Mrs L&#8217;s having wandered off, the family arranged for a fence and two gates to be erected, and for the garden to be generally improved.  The gates are side by side: one to use on foot, and the other a double gate to admit vehicles, presumably for the benefit of the young couple who live with their children in the ground floor flat.  The pedestrian gate latch is of the kind often seen on bridleway gates, having a vertical metal lever on the gate, which is pulled away from the gate post to open the gate, and which springs back to engage with a clip on the gate post in order to re-close the gate.  The double gates are secured by a metal throw-over loop, which holds the two central uprights together.  The front door of Mrs L&#8217;s flat which leads into this garden area is locked with a Yale lock, which Mrs L can and does operate herself.  This enables her to have access to her garden as and when she wishes it.  All agree that she gets great pleasure from being able to go out and enjoy the garden. </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The Local Authority have undertaken assessments of the safety of the above arrangements.  They have concluded that whilst neither of the gate latches lock, they are quite stiff and heavy to operate.  There was an occasion when Mrs L was observed to open the pedestrian gate when asked to do so.  This was before a wedge was added to the gate by Mrs L&#8217;s downstairs neighbours (to stop their young children getting out) which has made the gate more difficult to open.  The garden is felt by everyone to be sufficiently secure, although with an unavoidable risk that someone might leave the gate open.  At night, there are door sensors which switch themselves on in the evening and off in the morning.  They would be activated if Mrs L were to leave the property at night, although she has not in fact done so in the 6 months or so since they were installed.  An alarm call would automatically be made to one of her daughters, who lives nearby.  If that daughter were not available, the call would re-route go to the emergency services.  This would enable Mrs L to be guided safely back home.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mrs L is happy and contented where she lives.  A care package is provided for her by the Local Authority&#8217;s specialist dementia carers, who visit her 3 times a day.  She is orientated within the property, steady on her feet, motivated to engage in simple activities, and has a clear interest in her garden.  There is a documented history of her strong sense of belonging in her current home, and of her fierce sense of independence.  She displays an acceptable level of mobility.  Her immediate environment can be seen to give her significant pleasure and stimulation.  She is able to enjoy the company of her cat.  All agree it would cause her distress to be moved to residential care.  All agree too that the current arrangements of family and Social Services working together are in Mrs L&#8217;s best interests and work well. </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The facts on which the Local Authority relies in particular for saying that the arrangements amount to a deprivation of Mrs L&#8217;s liberty are: (a) that the garden gate is kept shut, thereby preventing or deterring Mrs L from leaving the property unless escorted; (b) that the door sensors are activated at night, so that Mrs L could and would be escorted home if she left; and (c) that there might be circumstances in an emergency, say if the sensors failed to operate at night, when the front door of the flat might have to be locked on its mortice lock, which Mrs L cannot operate (as distinct from the Yale lock, which she can).  She would then be confined to her flat.  These arrangements are said by the Local Authority to be integral to its care plan for Mrs L, which is overseen by her social worker.  The Local Authority thus asserts that it is responsible, as a public body, for a deprivation of Mrs L&#8217;s liberty.</span></p>

It exercises those duties through social workers and carers, who in this case are working with the family; but if the family were not willing to work with those carers, then the Local Authority, on behalf of the State, would have duties to make other arrangements.

He points to a multitude of little safety strategies which the family have put in place and of which I have read in the bundle.  So he maintains that on the facts the family are effectively the prime movers.  At its lowest, it is clear that the family are acting and planning hand-in-hand with the social workers and carers.  Therefore Mr Gatenby submits that there is on the facts an absence of a controlling State hand in the dynamics of the relevant relationship, which element he says is necessary (or should be necessary) to make the arrangements capable of being properly imputed to the State.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In these circumstances, my decision is simply that there is no deprivation of Mrs L&#8217;s liberty.  This is not per se because Mrs L is in her own home; nor because she wishes to be there.  Those features alone would not necessarily stop particular arrangements amounting to a deprivation of liberty.  Rather it is a finely balanced decision taken on all the facts of the particular case.  The question of the court&#8217;s authorising the arrangements concerned does not in the circumstances arise, although I would have authorised them if it did.  The question of Mrs L&#8217;s up to date best interests is better considered back in Birmingham by the District Judge, and I anticipate that it should be capable of being dealt with by consent. </span></p>
