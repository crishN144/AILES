I gave permission to appeal on 11 June 2021 and the matter comes before me six months later on the substantive appeal.

It does not make separate, or different, provision as to the length of skeleton arguments. That is unsurprising. It would be extraordinary if, on appeal, litigants are entitled to file skeleton arguments limitless in length, whereas for the substantive hearing below they are confined to 20 pages. It would similarly be extraordinary if appeals to the Court of Appeal, which are governed by separate rules, are subject (as they are) to strict limits as to the length of skeleton arguments, but appeals heard by a High Court Judge are not. The same must apply to appeals to a Circuit Judge from a decision made at District Judge level.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">22. "Like any judgment, the judgment of the Deputy Judge has to be read as a whole, and having regard to its context and structure. The task facing a judge is not to pass an examination, or to prepare a detailed legal or factual analysis of all the evidence and submissions he has heard. Essentially, the judicial task is twofold: to enable the parties to understand why they have won or lost; and to provide sufficient detail and analysis to enable an appellate court to decide whether or not the judgment is sustainable. The judge need not slavishly restate either the facts, the arguments or the law.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in">"The exigencies of daily court room life are such that reasons for judgment will always be capable of having been better expressed. This is particularly true of an unreserved judgment such as the judge gave in this case &#8230; These reasons should be read on the assumption that, unless he has demonstrated the contrary, the judge knew how he should perform his functions and which matters he should take into account. This is particularly true when the matters in question are so well known as those specified in section 25(2) [of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]. An appellate court should resist the temptation to subvert the principle that they should not substitute their own discretion for that of the judge by a narrow textual analysis which enables them to claim that he misdirected himself."</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">115. It is also important to have in mind the role of a judgment given after trial. The primary function of a first instance judge is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way. He should give his reasons in sufficient detail to show the parties and, if need be, the Court of Appeal the principles on which he has acted and the reasons that have led him to his decision. They need not be elaborate. There is no duty on a judge, in giving his reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his case. His function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to support his view, not to spell out every matter as if summing up to a jury. Nor need he deal at any length with matters that are not disputed. It is sufficient if what he says shows the basis on which he has acted."</p>

GK is an insulin dependent diabetic who has had a number of admissions to hospital for hypo/hyperglycaemia; stress exacerbates her condition. PR has Tourette&#8217;s syndrome and a diagnosis of ADHD. In March 2019, their child was born. In November 2019, they separated. In December 2019, PR applied for a child arrangements order which resulted in interim orders being made in March 2020 and June 2020 providing for the child to see PR on an unsupervised basis but not, at that stage, overnight. In November 2020, GK terminated those arrangements unilaterally. The proceedings had been case managed to a fact-finding hearing on 14 and 15 January 2021, GK having raised wholesale allegations of rape, domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour. </p>

Both parties were represented by counsel, but the task before him was unenviable. The bundle consisted of over 1000 pages. The parties had put in lengthy witness statements, including a 52-page statement by GK filed in June 2020. The judge had little pre-reading time. These challenges are familiar to all judges practising up and down the land in the field of family law. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:-0.49in">&#8220;Ms Jones has invited me to make comment on the use of Scott Schedules (i.e. a table identifying the allegations and the evidence relied on in support) in cases involving this category of domestic abuse. Having given the matter considerable thought I have come to the clear conclusion that it would not be appropriate to give prescriptive guidance. Whilst I entirely see the advantage of carefully marshalling the evidence and honing down the allegations, I can also see that what I have referred to as a particularly insidious type of abuse, may not easily be captured by the more formulaic discipline of a Scott Schedule. As I have commented above, what is really being examined in domestic abuse of this kind is a pattern of behaviour, possibly over many years, in which particular incidents may carry significance which may sometimes be obvious to an observer but to which the victim has become inured. It seems to me that what is important is that the type of abuse being alleged is made clear to the individual who is said to be the perpetrator.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:-0.50in">An intense focus on particular and specified incidents may be a counterproductive exercise. It carries the risk of obscuring the serious nature of harm perpetrated in a pattern of behaviour. This was the issue highlighted in the final report of the expert panel to the Ministry of Justice: <span style="font-style:italic">'Assessing Risk of Harm to Children and Parents in Private Law Children Cases' </span>(June 2020). It is, I hope, clear from my analysis of the evidence in this case, that I consider Scott Schedules to have such severe limitations in this particular sphere as to render them both ineffective and frequently unsuitable. I would go further, and question whether they are a useful tool more generally in factual disputes in Family Law cases. The subtleties of human behaviour are not easily receptive to the confinement and constraint of a Schedule. I draw back from going further because Scott Schedules are commonly utilised and have been given much judicial endorsement. I do not discount the possibility that there will be cases when they have real forensic utility. Whether a Scott Schedule is appropriate will be a matter for the judge and the advocates in each case unless, of course, the Court of Appeal signals a change of approach.&#8221;</p>

Since Scott Schedules had been prepared and the case has been managed by reference to them, I did not dispense with them but, at my invitation, the parties prepared short narrative summaries of their respective cases about the allegedly coercive and/or controlling behaviour of the other. The summaries were very different in style and illustrated the complexities involved in presenting allegations for a finding of fact hearing such as this one where there are overlapping allegations by the mother against the father of coercion and control, physical violence against the mother, physical violence against the child, and allegations by the father against the mother of control, fabrication, and abduction. How can the party alleging a pattern of coercion and control over a relationship that has lasted several years present that case for a finding of fact hearing in a way that is proportionate and manageable, and without giving a day by day account of the whole relationship?</p>

 <span style="color:#000000">&#8220;26. Patterns of behaviour are formed from many individual incidents of conduct. It is difficult therefore to separate the pattern from the specific events said to establish the pattern. In this case every one of the mother's allegations is denied by the father. The court cannot make findings about a pattern of behaviour without evaluating the evidence in relation to specific incidents that allegedly contributed to that pattern. The difficulty is in identifying a limited number of incidents that would, if proved, establish a pattern of behaviour. Some specific instances of behaviour will not constitute abuse themselves and may appear to be relatively trivial if looked at in isolation but are in fact important evidence of a pattern of abuse, or the effects of abuse, when set alongside other findings.</span>

It also runs the risk that incidents which may appear trivial are overlooked and not relied upon. In some cases, a Scott Schedule may be appropriate, for example if the complainant alleges a small number of specific incidents without asserting a pattern of behaviour. But in a case such as this, I am doubtful as to the utility of a Scott Schedule.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">For matters of this gravity, GK was entitled to have the case, and the hearing, managed in such a way as to enable her to participate as fully as possible and give oher best evidence. The judge, as the transcript shows, was fair and courteous throughout, and tried his best to make the parties feel comfortable. But I am left with the uneasy feeling that GK was not afforded the opportunity to give evidence in the most appropriate form and, in a case where witness presentation was of the utmost importance to the judge, that in itself risks undermining the conclusions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The essence of the submission on behalf of GK is that the judge failed to consider the general context of coercive and controlling behaviour, and weigh up the allegations of sexual assault by reference to the totality of the evidence. PR submits in response that these were findings of fact made by the judge, and the appellate court should (as the case law makes clear) only rarely interfere with such findings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In my judgment there is some force in the submission that, contrary to the judge&#8217;s stated intention at the outset of the judgment to view the &#8220;broad canvas&#8221; of the evidence, he in fact adopted a linear approach to the allegations. From paragraphs 32 to the end, the judge carefully considered each allegation, or group of allegations, but to my mind he did not satisfactorily explain how all the allegations, and relevant evidence, impacted on each other in a holistic way. That is particularly important, in my judgment, when a significant aspect of the asserted case is a pattern of behaviour which does not easily lend itself to an analysis of specific incidents, some of which may individually be of relatively little import but cumulatively are destructive, undermining and intimidating. True, the judge referred to controlling and coercive behaviour, but in my opinion, he did not draw all the strands together and survey how all the evidence interlocked.</p>

Nor is mention made of medical records in which GK reported emotional, physical, and sexual domestic abuse at the hands of PR. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is, too, some merit in the submission that at times the judge appears to have minimised the seriousness of the sexual abuse allegations. For example, he says &#8220;I would not be surprised if a healthy young man were to ask repeatedly for sex after a period of abstinence&#8221; which could be construed as mitigating, or excusing, inappropriate behaviour, particularly in the context of the other allegations. Elsewhere the judge suggested that &#8220;inexperienced young men and women in their first sexual relationships commonly miss cues and misunderstand responses&#8221; which, again, could be read as exculpating certain types of behaviour. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">A number of specific allegations were grouped together by counsel for GK, and that approach was adopted by the judge. GK&#8217;s allegations against PR included words or phrases such as: &#8220;dirty&#8221;, &#8220;fat&#8221;, &#8220;a tramp&#8221;, &#8220;fucking stupid&#8221;, &#8220;worthless&#8221;, &#8220;fat bitch&#8221;, &#8220;fucking die&#8221;, &#8220;I fucking hate you&#8221;, &#8220;I will fucking drown you in court&#8221; and &#8220;Not even your fucking dad wants you&#8221;. The judge found that unkind things were indeed said, but concluded that none of them, whether individually or collectively, amounted to coercive control. In one passage of his judgment, he refers to them as &#8220;shouting, name-calling, accusations of ungratefulness, asking [GK] to leave the home and so on. They are the stuff of many a &#8220;matrimonial row&#8221;. Again, I tend to the view that the judge was underplaying the significance of such words. At any level they are cruel and undermining, but in the context of the various other behaviours identified by GK could clearly constitute controlling and coercive conduct. I am a little troubled by the judge&#8217;s assessment of GK as having a &#8220;capacity to feel victimised where a more robust (or simply perhaps more honest) person would see her interlocutor simply had a different point of view&#8221; and &#8220;M has a tendency to hyper-defensiveness and a capacity to build a case on microscopic detail which others may be able to deal with by the possession of broader shoulders&#8221;; such comments suggest that her own sensitivities were in some way contributory to the behaviour complained of. I am troubled also that the judge at para 30 refers to many of the incidents as being &#8220;minor or even petty, but the real question for any future court having regard to the child&#8217;s welfare is whether the words or actions alleged show a course of conduct by which [PR] is <span style="font-weight:bold">deliberately</span> [my emphasis] coercive, controlling and undermining of [GK] so that domestic abuse becomes a serious issue ion this case&#8221;. I cannot accept that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">intentional</span> misconduct is a pre-requisite for a finding of abusive behaviour. In this regard, I was referred to <span style="font-weight:bold">Re T (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/1889" isNeutral="true" canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 1889" court="EWCA-Civil" year="2017" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">2017] EWCA Civ 1889</ref></span> in which it was said at para 42 that: &#8220;&#8230;none of the authorities require that a positive intent to molest must be established&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The thrust of the complaint is that the judge did not weigh in the balance what is said to be corroborative evidence from the police records, (including 4 statements taken from GK, and an interview with her, as well as a summary of an interview with PR), medical records, and a witness statement from Ms H in support of GK. Counsel for GK pointed to certain parts of the police evidence which are purportedly consistent with her account to the family court (I have already referred to some of these). On the other hand, counsel for PR says that there are parts of the police evidence which are not consistent, and complaints by GK were made late. The police disclosure is not before me, and I can make no findings. But more importantly, although it was before the judge, he undertook no analysis of the police disclosure in his judgment. He was not assisted by counsel, in that no questions were put to GK in cross examination about her reports to the police. Indeed, the transcript suggests that she had not been given the police disclosure. That being so, I do not see how the judge could have said in a brief sentence in the judgment that there were &#8220;different accounts&#8230;in both her police and family court statements&#8221;. In the absence of any analysis of the extensive police records, and how that affected his overall assessment, and given that GK was not asked questions on this topic, in my view the judge fell in error in reaching this conclusion. The same applies to the medical records, as to which the judge makes no mention. These are highly significant matters, particularly in a case where the judge was strongly influenced by his impression of each party as a witness. I am less persuaded by the submission as to Ms H, who was not called by GK to give oral evidence.</p>

GK&#8217;s counsel presented a schedule and mounted a case based on the allegations contained in the schedule. But it is apparent from the judgment that in the course of her written evidence GK had raised a number of other serious allegations. The judge referred to three at the start of his judgment: (i) that PR threatened to choke GK in her sleep until she did not wake up, (ii) that shortly before separation he threatened to kill her on several occasions, and (iii) that on five occasions he covered GK&#8217;s nose and mouth while she was in bed and snoring or breathing loudly. The first was in fact dealt with by the judge. The second and third do not appear to have been so. I do not think the judge can be criticised for not directly addressing these, as they were not advanced at the hearing in the Scott schedule, but my sense of unease about how the hearing unfolded is only heightened. If the court is required to survey the totality of the evidence, allegations such as these would have been directly relevant. I accept that it was GK&#8217;s counsel who put forward a Scott schedule omitting these allegations, probably in order to try and make it manageable, but to my mind the unsuitability of a Scott Schedule approach in this case becomes all the more clear. </p>
