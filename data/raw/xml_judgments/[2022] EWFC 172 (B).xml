Can the LA be disprove the explanations provided by the parents for the injuries sustained by A or not?  If the Local Authority cannot so disprove, then it will follow that threshold has not been crossed given that there are no other concerns alleged.

Additionally, that the parent who inflicted the injury did so by exerting pressure or otherwise assaulting A in a manner that they would have realised was excessive and inappropriate.   The non-perpetrating parent should have been aware that the injuries had occurred by reason of the child&#8217;s reaction to normal handling after infliction of the injuries and should have sought medical assistance sooner than 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.

They accept that it is extremely unfortunate and somewhat embarrassing that A was subjected to three accidental episodes in such a short space of time.

It is for the local authority to prove its case.   It is not for the mother to disprove it.   In particular, it is not for the mother to disprove it by proving how the injuries were in fact sustained.   Neither is it for the court to determine how the injuries were sustained.  The court&#8217;s task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability.   Where as here there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not has the possible alternative explanation been proved but rather it should ask itself in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability.&#8221;</p>

Dr Saggar explained that A may also  have inherited Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (&#8220;HSD&#8221;) from his Father, who was diagnosed by Dr Saggar upon examination as having suffered from HSD. Accordingly,   the twins had a just greater than 50% chance of inheriting this condition. Upon examination A was found to have with some characteristics, including a Beighton score of 6 out of 10, compared to his brother of 4 out of 10, and other minor features. </p>

If A suffered from some form of lowering of bone density and thus bone fragility, as a consequence either of the genetic mutation found of the Variant of Unknown Significance or because of HSD, then the question arose as to whether or not this was of clinical relevance. The key question to consider was whether A might suffer fractures that children without such abnormalities would not suffer. The evidence therefore concentrated both on the mechanism and the level of force from the known accidental events. If A did suffer any reduced bone density it was agreed to be at the very mildest end of the spectrum and that an excessive force, more than rough handling, would still be required.</p>

The papers did tend to indicate that children with osteogenesis imperfecta, agreed to be an umbrella term for reduced bone density, may because of the BMP 1 variant suffer reduced bone density that would cause fractures that would not otherwise have been sustained in a child without such a variant.  Additionally, consideration was given as to the impact of HSD and various studies again tended to suggest that there was some connection between HSD and bone fragility. However, A had not suffered any further known fractures since April 2021, a factor considered important by both experts, notwithstanding that A had not suffered any similar accidents and was somewhat cosseted by his current carers.</p>

	    <p class="Kings-Advice-Number" style="margin-left:0.49in">The Clinical Geneticists essentially agreed with each other, although I found that Dr Saggar was perhaps more cautious in the way in which he approached the scientific uncertainties that undoubtedly surrounded this relatively new area of medical research and expertise.  Dr Irving was more firmly of the view that there was no evidence that this child had reduced bone density or that he had any predisposition to fractures from a lesser force.   Dr Saggar whilst tending to agree with the evidence of Dr Irving was also of the view that there may have been a small and mild reduction in this child&#8217;s bone fragility which would not have caused spontaneous fractures and nor would his bones fracture easily.   The consensus emerged that the likelihood is that the mechanism of causing such fractures would not alter, but what would potentially alter was a reduction in the level of force that needed to be applied for fractures to take place.   Dr Saggar accepted that the variant that he had found in A was a Class 3 variant, likely to be benign, but he could not exclude that it had some clinical impact.   Additionally, he was of the view that this child probably did suffer from being on the Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder. My note that summarised the essence of Dr Saggar&#8217;s evidence is as follows:-</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="Kings-Quote" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>&#8220;If you have bone fragility but no other features of OI it is not known if fractures can happen without a force that is not normal.   What I can say is it won&#8217;t be rough handling and you will need some form of excessive force, but it may be of a lesser force and type that would cause a fracture.   I accept that this is a single copy gene which makes it much less likely that it will have an impact on bone fragility, but if he has bone fragility in the absence of classic OI it will be less severe so you will still need a force that is more than rough handling.&#8221;</p>

However, the possibility of clinical significance still remained low. </p>

Dr Barnes gave helpful evidence, deferring where appropriate and was conscious not to stray outside the area of his expertise.    In terms of dates of the fractures, Dr Barnes conceded he could only give very broad timescales of less than 10 days on acute injuries, where there was no evidence of healing, to ones where he saw some healing, and some callouses.   There was no remodelling of any of the bones which would cause there to be a longer time period for these fractures.   The upshot of his evidence was that the acute fractures of the third, fourth and fifth posterior ribs, the right humerus and the right femur could have occurred in terms of dates consistent with the episodes on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.   The non-acute injuries of the seventh, eighth and ninth lateral rib fractures, the left femur and the right tibia could be consistent with having occurred on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March episode.   Of course, radiologically they could have occurred at any time in between those dates as well as on those dates themselves.   His evidence was to clarify that the acute rib injuries were not close to the spine and were next to each other.

Dr Cartlidge considered the clarification by Dr Barnes of the position of the third, fourth and fifth rib fractures not being fully posterior fractures. His view changed so that the mechanism could include a fall from the changing table as well as a squeezing action.   Additionally, there would not necessarily be a bruise from the fall if the surface upon which the child fell was relatively flat and substantial. The metaphyseal fractures would likely require a twisting force to be applied. Grabbing a child in panic in an attempt to prevent a fall could be consistent with such a force.  Additionally, the child&#8217;s presentation as described by the parents immediately following his fall and  at  the hospital, was consistent with an acute event of rib fractures having occurred at the time of this fall on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.</p>

In his written evidence Dr Cartlidge was clearly of the view that in the absence of bone fragility the three episodes would not sufficiently explain how it was that A sustained such injuries.   However, upon cross-examination of his reasoning, the impression I had from Dr Cartlidge was that so much was unknown about the precise details and mechanisms of the falls sustained, the grabbing actions in a split second by adults, and the potential for twisting actions within such falls. He was essentially telling this Court that whilst the descriptions were outwith his usual experience of how such injuries are caused, he was nevertheless in the territory of making educated guesses about precisely whether or not these episodes could account for the injuries themselves. He was not critical of the adults&#8217; difficulty in recalling the mechanisms with precision, regarding such vagueness as understandable.  I found his evidence to be refreshingly objective and very helpful to this Court.   The key evidence he gave was:-</p>

	      <p class="Kings-Advice-Number" style="margin-left:0.49in">This is an extremely helpful analysis of the extent to which the Court is assisted by expert evidence.   There are clearly severe limits to the assistance that the experts can give to the Court.   Dr Cartlidge said that it does come down to the interpretation of the three events and the difficulty in recalling details of events at a time when adults would not have appreciated the significance of them and that they happened with such speed.   He would not expect lay witnesses to have a precise recollection of the mechanisms involved.   Mildly fragile bones will fracture more easily, but excessive force would still be required.   He did not agree, however, that excessive force would necessarily mean non-accidental injury, as accidental injuries as described in this case could still involve excessive force.   Dr Cartlidge was therefore able to contemplate that the metaphyseal fractures were capable of being caused if the limbs were grabbed in attempting to prevent this child falling and that rib fractures could well be caused as a consequence of a fall and an impact. Dr Cartlidge essentially deferred to the court, who would hear and judge the totality of evidence in assessing if such accidental events could cause the injuries found. Thus, this expert evidence must be weighed very carefully against the lay evidence I was to later hear.</p>

	    <p class="Kings-Advice-Number" style="margin-left:0.49in">Before turning to the lay evidence, I also heard from a treating clinician, Dr D.   Dr D&#8217;s evidence concerned the information imparted to and from the parents at the hospital in the days following the final episode on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.   In short, I did not find any of the evidence that Dr D gave to be of concern and relevance in relation to the parents&#8217; conduct.    Indeed, the more I was directed to the medical notes and the entries in relation to the parents&#8217; conduct at the hospital, the more it struck me that their behaviour was entirely inconsistent with that of a perpetrator. In particular it became clear that it was the parents who were directing the medics to investigate potential rib fractures and carry out x rays.</p>

They were calm, appropriately upset, displaying an eagerness to furnish the Court with a true account and to avoid embellishing their evidence to assist what might be perceived by themselves as their own case. I did not find, notwithstanding extensive challenge to their evidence, any relevant inconsistencies. Their descriptions of the presentation of their child and the detail of the accounts of the three episodes had a glaring absence of inconsistencies, either in their individual accounts or between each other. The pain they both felt at their child&#8217;s injuries and their separation from both twins was palpable.</p>

They did not believe that any injury had been sustained at that time and it was only when they were confronted by the multiplicity of fractures that they began to contemplate its relevance.   They both however did accept that perhaps they were embarrassed to explain that a further episode of accidental injury had occurred in such a short space of time in the context of having told the hospital of the events of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March and 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.   Such embarrassment I found to be entirely plausible and consistent with a non-perpetrating parent.

They were and are in a stable and loving marriage supported by extended family members. They were clearly thrilled at having given birth to twins, whom they loved and adored.   Their living arrangements were less than ideal, they having decided to stay through lockdown with the maternal grandmother, who had recently suffered bereavement.   This was a small apartment, but not one that was overly cramped or caused too many difficulties.  What is clear however, is that the size of the living accommodation would not have easily allowed for non-accidental injuries to be inflicted upon this child without the other adults being aware of such infliction.</p>

The maternal grandmother again gave honest evidence that did not seek to embellish, exaggerate or minimise.   The cumulative  evidence of the extended family was that the parents had the sort of glowing references that sat comfortably with the impression that the parents  made upon this Court.</p>

They rely upon the evidence of Dr Cartlidge that even if the force was reduced by a small degree, the force would still need to be excessive.  The LA therefore concentrated upon the detail of the three accidental incidents.   They contend that the injuries cannot have occurred by the mechanisms described in the three episodes.   There was simply, they contend, an absence of descriptions that would allow for the sort of twisting force which would account for the metaphyseal fracture. The absence of bruising and the two falls described on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March and 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April would not account for the rib fractures seen on x-ray.  They do concede that there is potential for the acute rib fractures to have been caused by the fall on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, but in the context of multiple inflicted fractures the likelihood that they were caused by squeezing should prevail. </p>

The Local Authority&#8217;s position is that this non-disclosure demonstrates a lack of candour.   Additionally, they point to the circumstances in which the injuries occurred, namely that these were first time parents caring for twins, sleep deprived with the father having to combine contributing to childcare with continuing to work from home.   The relevant period being during Covid lockdown may have added to their stress.  Finally, that the non-perpetrating parent has failed to protect the children from the actions of the perpetrator as they would have known from the excessive crying that something had taken place.</p>

The Guardian was struck by the clarification and circumspection that emerged from the expert oral evidence, when set against their written reports.  The Guardian is driven to the view that the Local Authority have failed to discharge the burden of proof placed upon them and failed to prove that these are non-accidental injuries.</p>
