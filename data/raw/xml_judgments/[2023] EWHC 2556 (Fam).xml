She is a patient on the paediatric intensive care unit at the Queen&#8217;s Medical Centre, Nottingham. IG is the much-loved child of devoted parents, and equally dearly loved by her siblings. Her parents are with her at her bedside as much as possible. I have seen photographs and videos of this beautiful child which are a reminder, if anybody needs one, that this case is about the precious life of a very young person, a family member and an individual in her own right.</p>

Following a review by a Consultant in Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes on 11 October 2023 (before my judgment was handed down), it was confirmed that diabetes insipidus was no longer present. The Consultant had confidence in the previous diagnosis and stated that this is a picture frequently seen in children with progressive brain failure. The Consultant confirmed that IG&#8217;s brain function continues to deteriorate. </p>

Prior to determination of the application, these invasive procedures were in fact implemented following a deterioration in IG&#8217;s condition during the course of these proceedings. Due to that deterioration in IG&#8217;s presentation, the Trust, on 27 September 2023, amended its application, seeking authorisation to remove critical care. On the Trust&#8217;s case, there is no prospect of recovery, her life expectancy is very limited, the multiple treatments she receives are causing her a high level of pain and suffering, and there is no discernible quality of life or interaction by IG with the world around her. </p>

She was born in good condition, needing no resuscitation. She was almost immediately found to have a tetralogy of Fallot which is a combination of heart defects. She developed oxygen requirement and bilious vomiting, and was diagnosed with intestinal malrotation where the gut is not twisted correctly, for which she underwent a corrective surgical procedure. An MRI of her brain revealed congenital hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluid in the brain.  A shunt was fitted. She went on to develop seizures. Further inquiries led to a diagnosis in June 2023 of Combined D-2, L-2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is characterised by epileptic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, abnormalities in the brain, developmental arrest, and early death.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After birth, frequent episodes of profound desaturation (that is to say, insufficient oxygen in the blood) and bradycardia (drop in heart rate) occurred and required bag mask ventilation for increasingly long periods of time, measured in hours. These took place sometimes several times a day (1-7 is referred to in the evidence). Until her recent deterioration, she on 8 occasions required PICU or NICU ventilation. On three occasions, she had cardiac arrests and needed CPR. No clinical way has been found to avoid these episodes. Recent therapies (medication, use of citrate and a ketogenic diet) have led to a reduction in the frequency of the desaturation episodes, but the overall prognosis is unchanged, and the plan is being implemented as a compassionate measure rather than in expectation that it will lead to improvement.  She was last extubated on 31 August 2023, and a semi-permanent Hickman line was inserted. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She has challenging IV access, which is problematic in an intensive care setting where lines are required for life sustaining treatment. Apart from the Hickman line, other IV access has been required via needle insertion into veins. These processes, I am satisfied, cause pain and risk infection. On 10 occasions she has needed the drilling of a needle into her bones, often when awake, which again is a painful experience. She has a triple lumen line into her neck.</p>

She has two nasal tubes, one for ventilation and one for feeding. Pain medication has increased; she is on eight medications for her comfort. She had further major episodes on or around 8 September and 25 September, each lasting 3 to 4 days, characterised by multiple desaturations and significant blood pressure support.  She has fever spikes which are indicative (as I find) of brain deterioration, and are not markers of infections as the parents suggest. On 10 September 2023, and again on 7 October 2023, she required a blood transfusion. As outlined above, she had a diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus on 9 October 2023 when the matter was heard. A subsequent review of IG on 11 October 2023 confirmed that this was no longer present, but that her brain function was continuing to deteriorate. </p>

Other than E-Coli detected on one occasion on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>August 2023, there has been no detection of any infection. Over the past few days, antibiotic treatment (which might have suppressed an infection) has been withdrawn and there are no markers of infection. Multiple tests have been carried out, including by a specialist microbiological team. I am satisfied that for over a month she has not had any infection which has caused or contributed to her presentation.</p>

It is of note that whereas her previous intubations lasted 3 to 4 days, this one has lasted a month, indicating the extent of her deterioration. Sadly, she is not, as the parents suggest, showing signs of improvement. There is no doubt in my mind that her presentation is on a rapid downward trajectory. She is now at the very limits of what is medically achievable for her.  </p>

IG&#8217;s mother (&#8220;M&#8221;) did not attend either in person or remotely. She preferred, entirely understandably, to be at IG&#8217;s bedside. That has been the case at every hearing. F attended in person. I adjourned the application to 27 September 2023, and gave directions to enable the family to obtain legal representation. It has been scandalous that, until recently, parents of children in these immensely difficult serious medical treatment cases have not been entitled to public funding. Fortunately, by a change to the regulations which came into force on 3 August 2023, it is now available on a non-means-tested basis for parents faced with applications for the withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining treatment in respect of their child.  </p>

The most recent MRI scan is from June 2023; it has simply been too dangerous to do another MRI scan since then. The severe hydrocephalus had not meaningfully improved since the insertion of the shunt, which means that the underlying problem is one of brain development rather than a fluid blockage. Compared to a healthy child of the same age, IG has a large volume of fluid, and a severe lack of brain tissue. The brain tissue which remains is severely compromised. Any updated scan would be unlikely to show any material difference. A paediatric neuroradiologist from the Trust has explained these matters to the parents.</p>

It might prevent immediate death due to a desaturation episode, but other organ systems would in turn be affected and death could be a long, drawn out, uncomfortable process. </p>

His written evidence concluded: &#8220;Very sadly, further ventilation, painful procedures, or resuscitation is not appropriate. This is on the basis that physiological deterioration is occurring regardless of treatment, and that the severity of her progressive neurological condition is such that she can no longer benefit from continued life&#8221;. He said orally that having heard the evidence of Dr E, his view remained the same. In answer to a question from me, he stated that in his view the treating team has tried everything possible for IG, and that there is no gap in the medical evidence before me which needs to be filled. </p>

I detected a sense of frustration with the treating team (particularly Dr E) who he believes could and should be doing more. He described IG as a fighter, who interacts with them. He believes she experiences pleasure, and he was adamant that she does not experience any significant pain. His view is that any minor distress is outweighed by the benefits of prolonging life. He would like more clinicians to look at her, different treatments to be considered, and for IG to be afforded time to try and undertake some form of recovery. In his view, she is showing signs of improvement.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As against that, the medical evidence is unanimous and clear. I accept what I was told by Dr E, Dr S and the nurse. I am satisfied there is no gap which needs further inquiry. Tragically, IG has an incurable condition which, combined with her other morbidities, will lead to a fatal deterioration within, at the most, a few months even if she receives ongoing full critical care, and probably a few days if invasive interventions are withdrawn. Beyond prolonging life, which in itself has a value and to which I pay high regard, treatment is futile. There are no curative therapies. IG is progressively deteriorating, and highly unstable. She has reached the limit of what medicine can achieve. She will not recover from, or even have minor improvement to, her life-limiting conditions. Her short life has consisted of cycles of stability, punctuated by episodes of acute care associated with painful stimuli, leading to the most severe episode of all in early September from which she has not recovered. Physiological deterioration is occurring regardless of treatment. Cardiac treatment will not address the underlying incurable disease. Nor, on the evidence, is it a feasible option as it is clear no cardiological treating team would be willing to provide any cardiac intervention. CPR would be without any purpose for the reasons outlined by Dr E. The parents&#8217; belief that her presentation has been caused by infections since early September is not supported by the evidence. The current fever spikes are not symptoms of infections, but a consequence of the progression of the mitochondrial disorder and evidence of ongoing damage to the brain. The reality in this case is that infection is not a cause of IG&#8217;s multiple diagnoses, but a consequence thereof.  Tracheostomy ventilation is not practical or realistic. Whilst the ketogenic diet and administration of citrate may have some effect on reducing the number of desaturation episodes, they are still occurring.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although F&#8217;s case, as presented through counsel, advanced the proposition that the causes of IG&#8217;s presentation are unclear, how the various morbidities interlink is unclear, and whether alternative treatment may provide better results is unclear, I do not agree. The medical evidence about this little girl is compelling. All her issues are interlinked, and her diagnoses and conditions, viewed in the round, lead to her current presentation. I am satisfied that there is nothing more than can be realistically done by the treating team. Similarly, on occasion questions were put to witnesses about the hypothetical treatment for a child not suffering from IG&#8217;s particular conditions, but ultimately the clinicians, and the court, are concerned with this particular child with this range of presentations. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept that, at least in theory, IG may have some level of awareness of the world around her, but in my judgment, if so, it is at the barest minimum. At her best, she is stable, but that is far from a settled state. She seems to derive comfort from M stroking her hair, but I accept the clinical observations that she does not follow with her eyes, does not respond to stimuli, and her limb movements are not purposeful. I do not think she experiences any meaningful quality of life, and sadly she never will.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I take the view that the parents do not recognise the pain she is suffering, perhaps because, as the Guardian put it, they see IG through their own lens. That is completely understandable. They are hoping against hope for something positive to emerge. However, the evidence clearly establishes that she experiences significant pain and distress several times a day, and each painful episode lasts up to ten minutes. It has been observed by Dr E, other clinical team members, the nursing staff and the Guardian, all of whose evidence I accept. The descriptions of her wincing, struggling to breathe, gasping and developing tears in her eyes are vivid. Such pain is caused by her multiple treatment interventions including invasive ventilation, suctioning, use of IV lines, blood tests and the like. It will continue for as long as the interventions continue.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With a heavy heart, I have come to the conclusion that the burdens of invasive treatment outweigh the benefits. In short, the significant pain experienced by this lovely little girl is not justified when set against an incurable set of conditions, a very short life span, no prospect of recovery and, at best, minimal engagement with the world around her. In my judgment, having weighed up all the competing considerations, her best interests are served by permitting the Trust to withdraw invasive treatment in accordance with the care plan presented. That plan envisages weaning her off intubation within 1 week, and facilitating the use of a non-invasive ventilation for up to a week after extubation. I am quite sure that the Trust will, as they say, do everything they can to care for IG with compassion, providing her with treatment to alleviate pain, and making her as comfortable as possible. That can take place at home or at a hospice, as the parents may elect.</p>

I know that this will come as a heavy blow to the parents. I know that they love IG dearly and want the very best for her. I sincerely hope that they will be able to spend as much time as possible with IG. </p>
