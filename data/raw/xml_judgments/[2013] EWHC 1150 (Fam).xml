In simple terms this represents the embodiment of the principle of open justice in a free country. An important aspect of the public interest in the administration of criminal justice is that the identity of those convicted and sentenced for criminal offences should not be concealed. Uncomfortable though it may frequently be for the defendant that is a normal consequence of his crime. Moreover the principle protects his interests too, by helping to secure the fair trial which, in Lord Bingham of Cornhill's memorable epithet, is the defendant's "birthright". From time to time occasions will arise where restrictions on this principle are considered appropriate, but they depend on express legislation, and, where the Court is vested with a discretion to exercise such powers, on the absolute necessity for doing so in the individual case</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221;.</span></p>

Their dependent status has been &#8211; according to the Crown &#8211; horribly exploited by their mother to make these fraudulent benefit claims.  This is a powerful reason for concluding that they should have protection from widespread public knowledge of those alleged activities.</span></p>
