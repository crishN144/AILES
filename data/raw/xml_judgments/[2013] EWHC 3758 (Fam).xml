SM is the mother of all four children.  LM is the father to JMM and EMM.  SN is the father to AMN and RMN.  Both fathers are represented in these proceedings, as too are the maternal grandparents, RM and AM.  Their son, JM (also known as SC, but to whom I shall refer as "JM" throughout this hearing) is represented by counsel, Ms. Bradley.  He has not attended at court and is not fit to do so.  </span></p>

SM has always recognised that she is unable to care for her children and has effectively consigned each of them to her parents' care, either from birth or certainly from very early in their lives.  </span></p>

On 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2011, he was discharged, and an agreement was made with the mother that she would live with EMM at her parents' home.  In the event, the mother chose to go to be with her partner, LM, and EMM went to live with his grandparents, joining his sibling JMM, and his half-siblings AMN and RMN.  That arrangement came about therefore, in effect, by default in the sense that it had never been the subject of any professional assessment.  </span></p>

It was evident that the mother had longstanding emotional and mental health difficulties.  LM, her partner, had been convicted of a sexual assault on a 13-year old girl.  There were, I remind myself, at that time concerns that LM may have also acted in a sexually inappropriate way to other younger girls.  Those allegations have not been pursued by the Local Authority.  Later, when I come to evaluate the issues of sexual abuse in this case, I will disregard those allegations altogether.  I will do so because they have nil evidential value in that context.  However, as allegations surrounding the family, they ought, in my view, to have, matters that I have referred to, triggered a high level of proactive social work involvement.  </span></p>

AM and RM, the maternal grandparents, had three other children:   AM, to whom I will return in detail in due course, and twin boys, RM and JM.  The twins had celebrated their 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> birthday by a macabre killing.  Involved with a third man, they had gone to the home of an aged, extended family member, their sister's grandmother, entered her home and, in a joint enterprise, killed her by strangulation.  They were later seen on closed circuit television laughing and joking as they divided the spoils of her meager belongings amongst themselves.  Following a trial in which all three were convicted of manslaughter, the twins received sentences of 12 years' imprisonment.  Reports describe them as having learning difficulties and personality disorders.  </span></p>

As he later confirmed to a psychiatrist, S referred to "shadow people", who are, apparently, dark entities with malevolent intentions.  C apparently relates to a popular film about a detective who battles dark and supernatural forces.  In any event, both twins were released on parole on 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2011.  They were considered to be "high risk" in the community and needing constant supervision.  By the conditions of their licence, the brothers were prevented from seeing each other - a condition which had its roots in violent arguments which had taken place between the two when in custody together.  They were excluded from the local area of Enfield, and they were to remain on licence for an extended period.  </span></p>

In fact they were vociferously and volubly opposed to what they perceived as the injustice of them.  The maternal grandfather told a Hackney social worker that the probation services were biased against his sons, in consequence of &#8220;the high level of publicity that had surrounded the case&#8221;.  Despite the fact that there were four children under age eight years living at their home, they apparently wanted the boys to come home, particularly over the Christmas period.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">What was emerging clearly was a troubling inability on behalf of the maternal grandparents to focus on the children's needs.  An indication that this might well have been a problem in the past with their own children ought at the very least to have been signalled by the fact that their eldest daughter, AM, and, as I understand it, the twins (although information is contradictory) had each spent some time in Local Authority care.  There were clear warning signs that the maternal grandparents' attitude to sexual abuse of minors was problematic.  Notwithstanding LM'S conviction for a sexual offence against a minor, neither grandparent believed him to present a risk of any kind, and liberal periods of overnight contact were being encouraged between LM and his son, JMM.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Against this backdrop, it is, to say the least, profoundly depressing that the Social Services' response appears to have been, at best, minimal.  For months three local authorities - Hackney, Enfield and Haringey - jostled amongst themselves as to who had responsibility to lead child protective measures.  It follows that without a lead there can scarcely be focus.  Quite how significant that failure was will become clear when I come to determine the disputed allegations in this case.  By my calculation, at least six months were lost on this issue.  I can see there are many reasons why Local Authorities in this climate might wish to avoid the burden of responsibility for a case like this.  It inevitably absorbs already stretched resources, both financial and in terms of personnel.  I have not permitted court time to be deflected into an investigation as to whether any particular Authority was acting unreasonably or was wrong in law.  There have been too many other pressing issues in this case directly concerned with the welfare of the children now that need to be considered as a priority.  I do not therefore condemn any one of those Local Authorities, but I do send this signal:  that if Local Authorities seek to evade responsibility for child protection to avoid costs, they are likely to face liability in negligence, administrative law and under human rights legislation.  As the family courts embrace the opportunities and advantages that greater transparency may bring, Local Authorities who behave in that way will not be able to avail themselves of the cloak of anonymity under which, in the past, they might have found refuge. </span></p>

A section 7 report was prepared, and two section 37 reports.  Ms. Briggs, counsel on behalf of the Local Authority, has told me on a number of occasions during the course of this hearing that she has used her best endeavours to track down that section 7 report.  It finally emerged some time this morning,  I have had a chance to read through it and will refer to it.  </span></p>

They concluded, however, that the children should remain with their grandparents.  Quoting from the second of the two reports, which I take to have been prepared sometime in early May or late April 2012 (for, like so many other documents presented in this case, it is undated) the author concludes as follows:</span></p>

These adults have made significant allegations in relation to the treatment that they received at the hands of their parents and parents' friends.  It should also be noted, however, that these three children suffer from significant personality disorders and this fact will have a significant bearing on the reliability of the allegations.  However, the allegations remain concerning and will need further assessment."  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The Guardian has condemned the analysis in this report as superficial.  But, in my view, the real flaw is that there is an absence of analysis altogether.  The language is telling.  It refers vaguely to "some issues", "significant allegations", the ubiquitous "concerns".  These are gateways to analysis, they are not, in and of themselves, analysis, and they are certainly not conclusions.  Section 37 reports are prepared for courts in order that they can consider risk and what, if any, intervention is required under the available legal framework.  They are not discussion documents or a vehicle in which to pour professional angst.  Issues must not only be identified or raised, they must be thought through, evaluated and placed in the wider context as it is assessed at the time.  Simple report is rarely valuable; it must be challenged, and an expressed willingness to participate must be measured against evidence of past participation.  In other words, at the interim stage the full panoply of risk assessment has to be deployed.  Absent these conventional tools any risk assessment is of limited value, perhaps meaningless.  </span></p>

This, I am afraid, will not do.  The fact is that the Local Authority failed to analyse the evidence that was already available to it.  Ms. Briggs talks of the need for &#8216;close scrutiny of all historical facts&#8217;; the need for &#8216;primary material&#8217;; for a &#8216;definitive history from source material&#8217;.  The court, she submits, must be persuaded that the child's welfare demands immediate separation.  But section 38(2) is an interim protective measure.  Of course the best possible evidence is required, both to establish it and the proportionality of intervention, guided by the section 1(3) criteria.  It is the two in combination that point to what the child's best interests require, or even, to adopt Ms. Briggs' term (itself gleaned from the authorities) &#8216;demand&#8217;.  Evaluation of risk requires balancing the two seperate sections:  the reasonable grounds for believing that the children had sustained significant harm within the definition of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, analysed within the welfare checklist criteria, to evaluate whether or how best a child can be protected until such point as the evidence is fully marshalled and, if necessary, put to the assay in cross-examination.  Ms. Briggs put the test too high.

However, it would be fair to say that the children would be at greater risk of suffering significant harm if they were removed from their grandparents' care to reside with their mother or their mother and LM, as SM is struggling to resolve her mental health problems.  Furthermore, due to LM's conviction, the Local Authority would recommend that he only have supervised contact with the children.  [Later:]  In conclusion for the reasons above outlined, the children are well placed and settled at their grandparents' home.  No concerns have been identified from any of the agencies involved, and the children and reports have in fact been very positive.

They abandoned that ambition on the eighth day of this hearing; as I recollect it, shortly before the grandfather gave evidence.  SN, represented by Ms. Kirby, also abandoned his aspiration to care for AMN and RMN.  LM could not countenance withdrawing his application to care for JMM and EMM, along with SM, even though SM recognised the futility of it.  Given that the Local Authority's plans for JMM and EMM contemplate adoption, it is, to my mind, entirely understandable that LM feels as he does.  I will address his application in more detail in due course, but it is only fair that he should know at this stage that I consider his case to be entirely unrealistic.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"RM had very little to say about the childhood issues experienced by the twins.  He thought they were not very serious or worrying, and from his narrative one would not have been able to understand their difficulties at that time.  There was a feeling from his narrative that he had not really thought of the reality of the homicide.  He had only attended court for a few days of the trial and it was as if he had left it up to his wife to practically and psychologically deal with the situation.  Just as with AM, he knew that the twins were not meant to be given access to the internet, that the telephone provided had internet access disabled, but clearly this was easily reversed.  RM had a very passive approach to dealing with this issue.  He did not seem to understand that for a young man who had been unable to control his behaviour to such an extent that he committed a homicide, that the temptation of using the internet on a mobile phone was going to be difficult to resist.  He simply explained this issue away as 'he's an adult', without understanding how he was creating a high risk situation.  In a similar manner, RM seemed to have limited understanding of the issues shown by the twins and he needed significant prompting in order to provide the information at interview.  He seemed to construct RM's difficulties as surrounding the single issue of his deliberate self-harm, rather than thinking about the totality of their problems.  He seems to have had more contact with JM and saw his issues as being very serious.  With SM there was a limited description of her issues and he seemed to think that her drug use was serious, simply because she used cocaine, rather than looking at the problem as a whole.  Whilst I do not expect Mr. and Mrs. M to have the level of understanding of psychological issues exhibited by professionals in this case, I was struck by his very limited understanding.  There was also a very passive acceptance that SM simply kept on having children that she could not look after and that they would in turn be placed with the grandparents.  In the same way as RM seemed to understand his children's difficulties as being centred on a single issue, he thought the cause of the difficulties was entirely due to the genetic contribution of the maternal uncle.  This could not be correct and he was unable to see that there might have been any contribution to their difficulties from the way in which they were raised."  </span></p>

For example, although the grandmother was able to agree with me that she had been na&#239;ve and had problems with boundary setting, the grandfather completely distanced himself from the idea that he and his wife had made any contribution to the difficulties shown by their children.  This is going to make it extremely difficult and probably impossible to offer any form of intervention which would increase their level of insight and improve their parenting style."  </span></p>

I can do this relatively briefly.  Dr. McClintock observes, at E138:</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"The relationship between SM and LM is co-dependent and unstable.  He acts as her 'carer', and it seems that he is there to provide practical and emotional support, helping with housework, soothing and reassuring SM when she is distressed, and helping her to have some kind of routine to her life.  In turn, SM finds that his attentions sometimes have a smothering quality.  This irritates her.  She sometimes feels that they should separate, and in fact there have been separations and reconciliations in the past.  It seems, however, that physical aggression from SM to LM has been common, and he has simply accepted this, feeling that it is preferable for her to assault him rather than take her anger out on herself by self-harm.  SM helps LM by reading documents for him, and they travel together in case he gets lost.  The couple were unable to attend their first appointment with me reportedly because SM had a migraine and LM was not able to make the journey to Harley Street on his own.  They have a highly enmeshed relationship, and I think this is compounded by their financial situation with State benefits being linked to the maintenance of this relationship and their respective roles as carer and cared for.  There are tensions within this relationship because of the power imbalance, but the emotionally dependent traits to LM personality have meant that when the relationship has ended or there have been threats of separation, he has harmed himself or threatened to do so.  This relationship is so dysfunctional that these parents would be unable to provide an emotionally safe and nurturing environment in which to raise a child.  This is a product not just of their independent psychological difficulties but also the manner in which they interact."</span></p>

They relate to sexual abuse, failure to protect and inability to set appropriate sexual boundaries.  Ms. Briggs addresses each of these allegations individually in her very detailed written submissions.  Ms. Fotrell, on behalf of the Guardian, approaches the issues thematically.  Ms. Bradley, on behalf of JM (also known, as I have said, as SC), attacks the credibility of SM as a witness, emphasising her defensiveness, her unresponsiveness (as it is perceived to be) in the face of challenging cross-examination.  She points to lack of detail in the allegations.  She seeks to identify motive for making false allegations.  Ms. Bradley contends that when factoring each of these features into an evaluation of the evidence, there is, as she puts it, insufficient evidence to support the making of the findings sought.  Ms. Brooks employs a similar strategy.  </span></p>

With some hesitation, it seems to me safe to say that this is now a settled area of law.

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened.  The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1.  The fact either happened or it did not.  If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof.  If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened.  If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened."  </span></p>

The grandfather did that in evidence, even though he knew this to be one of the very criticisms that the Local Authority had leveled against him, and which he had denied through his counsel, Ms. Brooks.  But in the witness box he was unable to hold back those criticisms which came flowing forth.  He criticised the mother for not coming to their house often enough.  He claimed the children did not notice her absence at all.  The court has heard that AMN in particular is in fact very fond of her mother and disappointed when she does not see her.  It is also recorded that the grandfather has been negative towards the mother at contact, and I have been taken to a write-up of a particular session in which it is clear that he spoke about her in front of the children in the most extraordinarily negative terms.  I accept entirely, as Ms. Brooks properly points out, that in extensive notes on contact this is only one session.  But it does not, to me, lessen the impact of it.  </span></p>

SN relationship with the maternal grandparents has been observed by a number of professionals to be extraordinarily close.  I have seen that for myself during the course of these 10 days.  Just as they emit coldness to the mother, they radiate warmth to him.  Despite the compelling body of evidence which I have summarised, so much of which, as I have stressed, is ultimately not in dispute, SN does not offer a single word of criticism of the grandparents.  On the contrary, he considered them suitable to raise his children:  the M family, surrounded by paedophiles (to quote RM), the family that has produced four psychologically disturbed children, now adults, two of whom are killers; a home in which the grandparents, it seems to me, must be driven to accept, even if they cannot articulate it, that they failed to protect their daughter AM from rape and from paedophile grooming.  None of this elicits any criticism from SN.  It is chilling to see the Svengali-like hold that the Ms have over him, even allowing that he may suffer some intellectual limitation.  Why the mother should be regarded by her own parents in this way and yet support them in their wish to care for her children is a conundrum I have not been able to resolve.  I simply observe - and it may be classic understatement - that it only points to a highly dysfunctional household.  </span></p>

It begs the question, it seems to me:  what was happening in this household to cause the manifestation in each of the children of such profound and violent unhappiness?  It is in that context, as I say, having regard to the wider picture, that I&#160;come to evaluate the allegations of SM.  </span></p>

She had historically referred to her brother going beyond touching her sexually and said that he had masturbated in front of her.  She did not make that allegation in front of me.  But what most struck me in her evidence was her insistence that JM appeared to feel that what was going on was "normal".  I&#160;sense that on some level too had thought that it might be.  She struck me as feeling guilty about the relationship and confused, though of course she has no need to, and I emphasise that because I know she is listening to this judgment.  Normality, for the reasons I have already alluded to, was an elusive concept in the M household.  It struck me that SM wanted to minimise the abuse.  She made no complaint that her parents actually knew what was going on.  She did not even say that they ought to have known.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Interestingly, JM made an allegation that he had been abused by a woman who had stayed at the home in a camper van.  He said that his parents had known of it, and told Dr. Taylor that they had "closed their eyes".  That, I find, to be a telling phrase, because it chimes with what had happened to AM, where I find the parents must have closed their eyes to what was happening.  Whether JM was sexually abused by the woman in the camper van or not, I am not in a position to determine.  Nobody asked me to determine it.  But what struck me as odd in the grandmother's response was that she said it could not be true because there was no room for the camper van in the garden.  Somewhat bizarrely, she accepted there was a woman with daughters in a camper van, and that they were there in consequence of the connection with the grandfather's bike club, which we know had become a conduit for paedophile visits.  SM does not say that her parents closed their eyes to her abuse, she is entirely silent on it, but her entire description conveys precisely that impression.  There is a congruity therefore between what SM is describing, what must have happened to AM, and what JM himself actually articulates.  </span></p>

He denied having witnessed this happening, but considered that it might have happened in some way quite naturally between brother and sister.  This seemed to me not only to reveal the grandfather's distorted thinking about sexual matters but his whole approach to sex in general.  The longer he remained in the witness box, the more he revealed himself to me to be a bullying egotist with no empathy for others whatsoever.  Dr. McClintock's assessment of his personality could not, in my view, have been more accurate.  Of course this too has forensic significance in the wider canvass, for only a parent who was completely impervious to a child's distress could let such things happen as occurred in this home and in this case.  I also agree with Dr. McClintock that the grandmother, while she may have some flicker of understanding of the needs of her children, has only the dimmest of sparks.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I turn now to TL.  TL did not want to attend court.  She had to be prevailed upon, by witness summons.  She had been provoked into making a complaint, she told the court, by an unexpected encounter with RM when he was pushing a pram, in the sense that it was seeing him involved in the care of children that disturbed her.  No party suggested that she had any hostile animus to the Ms.  On the contrary, TL seemed to accept that they had taken her in and had looked after her.  She was one of a number of vulnerable young women to whom the Ms had purported to offer sanctuary.  As the grandmother said:  "All we did was to try and help her".  TL&#8217; complaint is limited to one incident of digital penetration whilst she was asleep.  I do not minimise it by describing it in those terms, but merely to emphasise how specific the allegation is.  It is not accompanied, for example, by threats of force, nor is it suggested that the grandfather persisted.  It was all over quite quickly.  TL is describing an episode 25 years ago.  She was challenged on time and dates, about which she was certainly unclear, and Ms. Brooks made appropriate forensic capital from that.  But the account she gave of inappropriate comments earlier in the evening, the suggestion of playing an adult game, exploratory sex which extended to digital penetration, all this is classic sexual paedophile behaviour.  It is, sadly, known to those of us who practice in these courts.  I do not consider that it would be known to TL.  I considered her account entirely separately from any other evidence in the case, before ultimately then placing it in its wider context.  I am bound to say that I found TL to be an honest, indeed a brave and compelling witness.  </span></p>

I am unclear for what reason Mr. RM should be able to recall such an apparently uneventful evening 25 years on, and in such detail.  I find myself entirely sure of the honesty of TL complaint.  That she made no complaint the next day because she did not think she would be believed, is a point emphasised by counsel.  But there was really no point in her complaining.  She told me that AM had asked her if she had enjoyed herself, which she took to be a direct reference to RM&#8217;s assault on her, and indeed I am satisfied it was.  There was in TL' account both sadness, extreme distress, embarrassment and a sense of betrayal - all of which served only to make it more compelling.  I find the grandmother did say those words and I am therefore left only to conclude, as Ms. Brooks recognised, that this goes beyond merely closing her eyes, which she did in the case of her own daughters, but had progressed to, in effect, collaboration.  She knew all too well that her husband was sexually interested in young women and under-age girls.  They are a dangerous couple and a serious risk of both sexual and emotional harm to any child.  SN I hope will listen to this judgment with great care.  </span></p>

In some ways it is difficult to understand why it is that RM disputes MB&#8217;s evidence, for he told me that he would often be flirtatious in a purely verbal way to those whom he perceived to be in need of cheering up, or those who were not as good looking as RM apparently perceived himself to be.  MB does not describe herself as being a child at the time that RM would say things like:  "Give me a kiss", or:  "Slap her arse".  Essentially she told me she found him creepy.  I found her reliable.  Though I&#160;do not in any way wish to trivialise her complaint, it is at a wholly different end of the spectrum to those others that I have been addressing.  </span></p>

It has been a laborious exercise.  It has not been undertaken earlier, as I see it, by any other professional at any other stage.  It ought to have been.  Cases like this require that kind of rigour throughout.  Those working these cases must put them together and must look at all the facets of the evidence in order to evaluate the big picture.  I hope that is not perceived as a counsel of perfection, and I say it conscious of the enormous pressures that are on social work time.  But it is only through that forensic rigour that the right long-term and interim solutions will be arrived at.  In the exercise I have not found it necessary to make findings, for example, about the man who has become known as T or the allegation of rape by Y.  They are, it seems to me, superfluous to the issues that I have to address, and I make no findings either way.  </span></p>

The linear model proceeds by evaluating and then eliminating each individual option in turn before selecting the option at the end of the line, without evaluation of its own internal merits or de-merits, simply on the basis that it is the only remaining outcome.  Much therefore depends on which end of the line the selector starts the process.  Conventionally those judges who deploy a linear approach start, for understandable reasons, with the option of rehabilitation to a parent and end with the option of a care or adoption order.  If, however, for the purposes of observing the dangers in the process, one were to start at the other end of the line and look at long-term foster care or adoption first, and were then to rule that out on the basis that there are risks and negatives attaching to it, the linear approach would soon arrive at 'rehabilitation to a parent' as the only remaining option and select that without any consideration of whether that is in fact the best outcome for the child.  All will agree that such an approach would be untenable.  I hope, however, that this example demonstrates how inappropriate the linear model is for a judge who is tasked with undertaking a multi-faceted evaluation of a child's welfare at the end of which one of a range of options has to be chosen."  </span></p>

It is also clear that they are children who are claimed within the extended family.  They have, I am confident, a secure relationship with their father, who has, despite his limitations, which he has recognised, a great deal to offer them.  So too does the mother.  It is plain the children enjoy their contact with her.  It is plain, particularly in Angel's case, how important her mother is to her, and I am particularly keen to do all I can to promote that relationship, knowing how the mother struggles with her own psychological problems to keep focused on a relationship which I have no doubt is just as important to her as it is to AMN.  </span></p>

The risk they represent to these children is not only high, it is insidious.  I find on my own evaluation, supported by the professional assessment, that they are wholly ignorant of their grandchildren's emotional needs.  That causes me to wonder what it is that they have to contribute in contact.  I am not wholly convinced that they can be, as it were, some kind of sprat to catch a mackerel, i.e. that if they come to contact they will ensure the mother attends, and that sufficiently justifies their own attendance.  Both the social worker, who impressed me in the course of her evidence, and the Guardian, who has plainly reflected very carefully on this issue and on the case generally, think that these children need contact with their maternal grandparents, albeit limited to twice per year.  The Guardian has met the children on several occasions and has a real knowledge of them.  It is ultimately for that last reason that I have deferred to professional recommendation rather than to superimpose my own instinct, which may or may not have had some support from the independent social worker, David Ryan.  But in making the Special Guardianship orders in respect of these two children, I cannot emphasise with sufficient force the need for this contact to be kept under constant, vigilant and informed review.  </span></p>
