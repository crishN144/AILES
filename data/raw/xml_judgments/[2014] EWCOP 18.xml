She was married twice; by her first husband she had two children, a son (&#8220;PK&#8221;) and a daughter.  By her second marriage she had three daughters, including &#8220;TT&#8221; and &#8220;AF&#8221;.  In spite of spending the majority of her life in England, she is said to have retained her interest in German life, enjoyed watching German television, and continued to eat German food.

In or about 2007 or 2008, UF was formally diagnosed with dementia, which had superimposed upon a longer-term anxiety.  In the years which followed that diagnosis, UF received a home care package which comprised four visits per day, with carers preparing her meals, prompting her with medication, and doing household tasks.  In 2011, she was assessed by her GP as suffering moderate vascular dementia, but still retaining sufficient competence to grant a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA).  In the following summer (2012), and following a further assessment by her GP who was concerned about a deterioration in her condition, TT moved in to care for UF and assist her in her daily life.  This arrangement was not altogether successful, and by the end UF was verbally and physically aggressive towards TT.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In September 2012, UF entered into a LPA concerning her property and affairs, appointing two local solicitors as her attorneys; this was certified by her GP in October 2012 and registered in January 2013.  In the meantime, and during the last weeks of November 2012 concerns were raised by adult social services about the deterioration of UF&#8217;s mental health. She was said to be verbally (and even physically) aggressive to TT and her carers.  An enhanced care package involving daily visits from a care agency was implemented.  On 23 December 2012, the local mental health team assessed the situation; they understood that the family were expressing concerns about their ability to cope with UF, and as a result UF was admitted to the local hospital under <span style="font-style:italic">section 2</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> </span>(admission for assessment).  There remains some controversy within the family, and between family members and the local authority, about the appropriateness and/or need for this admission; it is not necessary for me to determine the issue.  The admission was short-lived, and she was discharged back to her home in early January 2013.</p>

In early February, the family (though not AF) indicated that they could no longer cope with UF and she was placed at The Elms, a residential care home (with approximately 18 residents) in the same town as Ridgeways; The Elms specialises in the care of older people with dementia.  UF was placed initially in a &#8216;crisis&#8217; bed but has now been there for 17 months.  PK and his full sister also live in the town.  </p>

She is an articulate woman who expressed her point of view with vehemence.  Her opinions (expressed both in writing and in oral evidence to me) tend to be dogmatic; she has a confident and unshakeable belief in the correctness of her own opinions, and believes that she has a particular and unique ability to assess the situation concerning her mother.  She told me, when cross-examined by PK, that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I feel I know her </span>(i.e. UF) <span style="font-style:italic">better than anyone.

AF is unrepentantly critical of X County Council, and separately (and in similar measure) of the care regime at The Elms.  Her evidence on some key issues lacked a degree of objectivity or nuance; this was not at all surprising given her understandable emotional investment in the issue and the outcome; however, I was left by the end of the hearing considering that I should treat her opinions with a little caution.</p>

She went further in questioning (albeit not formally challenging) the capacity declarations made by Holman J. at a hearing earlier this year.  On that particular issue, I note a potential inconsistency in her evidence: in her statement filed in November 2013 she stated, in terms, that she believed that UF had capacity to make decisions as to her future residence, yet in a subsequent statement (May 2014) she indicated that she believed her mother had lacked capacity (fourteen months earlier) to enter the LPA in September 2012.  AF has maintained that her mother is agoraphobic; no other person with whom Mr. Watkins consulted (family, medical or other professional) has verified this opinion/diagnosis.  I wondered whether she had invented or exaggerated this in order to lend weight to her argument that UF should be living in her own home.  She spoke in disparaging terms about The Elms, believing that her mother has been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">completely suppressed in almost every way</span>&#8221; while residing there (she has, as it happens, separately made a number of formal complaints about the care offered to her mother).

UF was initially apparently vague as to where she physically was at the time: she asked Mr. Watkins &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">where are we now</span>&#8221;?  Later in the interview, UF told him that she wished to live &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">in my own home</span>&#8221; and named the street on which it is situated.  When asked to describe the house at Ridgeways she could not remember it, but thought that it had three or four bedrooms (it has three).   Interestingly, in the <span class="legdslegrhslegp3text">same conversation, UF told Mr. Watkins that she had not been to AF&#8217;s house, and that she had spent Christmas &#8220;</span><span class="legdslegrhslegp3text" style="font-style:italic">at home</span><span class="legdslegrhslegp3text">&#8221; with her children.

Indeed, there seems to be no dispute between the parties that if UF is to remain, as in my judgment she should, at The Elms then Ridgeways would have to be sold.</p>

I would have been likely to agree.</p>
