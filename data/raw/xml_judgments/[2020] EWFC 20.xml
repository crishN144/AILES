	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.49in">These care proceedings concern W, a girl aged 9, nearly 10.   W&#8217;s parents, who were married, are Polish nationals and W was born there.   Following the separation of the parents in Poland in April 2016, contested contact proceedings there resulted in an order providing that W live with the mother with contact to the father.  The father&#8217;s parental responsibility was limited to decisions about medical treatment and education.   Following the breakdown of the father&#8217;s contact with W, the mother brought her to the UK in June 2018 where they have remained since.  That was done without the father&#8217;s agreement, although he was aware the mother planned to relocate and acquiesced once the move had taken place.  The mother did not tell the father of her and W&#8217;s location within the UK. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.49in">On 28 February 2019 the police attended at the mother&#8217;s home.   There had over the preceding month or so been a number of referrals from concerned neighbours about the mother&#8217;s mental health state.  The mother was found to be suffering a delusional psychotic breakdown.  The police exercised their protection powers and removed W.  She has been in foster care since. The mother was sectioned and spent time at a local psychiatric hospital.  The local authority issued these proceedings on 15 March 2019 and W was made subject of an interim care order.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.49in">The parents accept that at the point the proceedings were issued, W was suffering, or was likely to suffer significant harm by experiencing her mother&#8217;s frightening psychosis.  The threshold criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> are therefore accepted.   The mother disputes allegations of neglect and harsh discipline of W. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.49in">Because W had been in the UK for 9 months I found her to be habitually resident here and declared that this court had jurisdiction.  The Polish authorities were given early notice of the proceedings and have assisted with advice from time to time.   There has been no challenge to the court&#8217;s jurisdiction and no request to transfer the proceedings to Poland under Article 15 of B11a.   Instead the father has come to the UK as necessary to attend hearings and (with his parents) for assessment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.49in">The mother seeks the return of W to her care, supported by the maternal grandmother who has since came to the UK and lives with the mother in her flat.     The mother points out that W was in her primary care down to the end of February 2019 and that she has now recovered her mental health with low risk of relapse.  She has had a positive parenting assessment.  The mother would either remain in the UK with W or, if W wished, return to Poland. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.49in">The common professional view of the local authority, the court appointed psychologist, Dr Jefferis, and the children&#8217;s guardian, is that W&#8217;s best interests would best be served by returning her to Poland under her father&#8217;s care with a child arrangements order.   All the professionals share concerns about the mother&#8217;s attitude towards the paternal family and contact between them and W and aspects of her parenting and personality.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.49in">That said, the local authority accept that the mother has made a good recovery from her psychotic illness and would be able to meet W&#8217;s day to day care needs.   Given that the issue is with which of two potentially viable parents W should be placed, the case has taken on the hallmarks of a private law dispute. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.49in">By October 2017 the Polish Court had a more favourable view of the father.    However the mother continued to obstruct contact and in June 2018 moved to the UK with W.   That was not a child-focused thing for her to do.   The father took a rather laid-back attitude until he found out in March 2019 that the mother was ill and W had been removed into foster care.  Since then he has engaged well, shown commitment to W and been assessed positively as somebody who could care for W in Poland. </p>

I give permission for him to remove her from the UK to Poland.   He must make sure W has contact with her mother, with a one month gap in direct contact to allow W to settle and thereafter supervised contact.   Supervision is necessary because the mother is likely to be upset by this decision, may continue to undermine W&#8217;s relationship with her paternal family.    </p>

She worked in marketing in the UK for some years.   However, she finds it easier to express herself in her native language when stressed and so used an interpreter at times during the hearing.   The father&#8217;s English is limited.   I should say that W has very good command of English and no professional saw the need for an interpreter when speaking with her.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.49in">Dr Doherty accepted there was a risk of relapse in the mother&#8217;s mental health.  The diagnosis was more likely to be depression with an acute psychotic episode than schizophrenia (although the latter was not discounted).   The mother was driven by her delusions which were terrifying for her and W (involving microphones in her flat and snipers trying to kill her).  The mother had recovered by June/July 2019 (following a second admission to hospital in May) and had developed good understanding of her condition.   Her memory of events for some time before the acute episode may have been affected by her depression.   There is a risk of relapse if W is not returned to her care. </p>

There was concern that W&#8217;s experience of the acute episode and lack of subsequent explanation may have left her worried about returning to her mother&#8217;s care and the possibility of relapse.

They may regard the whole bundle of rights and responsibilities which the law attributes to parents as a cake which can be sliced up between the parents: one parent having the custody slice, with the package of rights which that entails, and the other having the access slice, with the different package of rights which that entails. This is by no means an unusual way of looking at the matter. Alternatively, the state may regard the whole bundle of parental rights and responsibilities as inhering, and continuing to inhere, in both parents save to the extent that they are removed or qualified by the necessary effect of a court order or an enforceable agreement between them</span>.&#8221; </p>

Nevertheless, should the decision in relation to residence of the child make other orders impractical to achieve for instance in relation to contact&#8230; the mother should have informed the father that there is a need to change arrangement in relation to the contact due to relocation. Subsequently, should the father disagree with the same he ought to apply to the court to vary the Court Order.

Dr Jefferis had the impression of a degree of minimisation by the mother of the extent and severity of her mental health difficulties, which begs the question whether she would be able to fully recognise symptoms in the future and the extent to which W had been adversely affected by her mother&#8217;s illness. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.49in">The father talked about the failure of the contact order made in September/October 2017.   He said W expressed the view she did not want to see him but the mother would not let him engage with her to talk to her about this.    Both parents made recordings of his attempts to collect W.  It seems the police were routinely involved in attempted handovers.    </p>

About this incident he told me she had tried to create a situation.  He didn&#8217;t grab her arm.   The mother had tried to grab his phone from his inside pocket (it was being used to record) and he instinctively placed his hand to stop her.  She started behaving &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">like an actress</span>&#8221; shouting, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">why are you twisting my arm</span>&#8221;, and then going to W&#8217;s room saying to her, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">look what he did to me</span>&#8221; and falsely accusing him of bruising her.  He thought the mother had hidden microphones to incriminate him (and that may have related to her later claims that microphones were hidden in the house). </p>

He thought she would need some help to become emotionally stabilised.  He said she sometimes struggles to cope with difficult situations, giving as an example getting very upset if she loses when playing a game and requiring a lot of effort talking to her to get her back to a more settled state.   This reflected Dr Jefferis&#8217; own observation of contact and demonstrated, he thought, some level of insight by the father.   The father thought W had some similarities to him &#8211; they are both stubborn, although W lacks his patience.   </p>

Dr Jefferis asked the father&#8217;s view about contact with the mother should W be living with him.  He did not see this as problematic although was a little cautious about sleepovers initially.   He thought the first contact should be supervised but that supervision would not be needed in the long-term, although he could not rule out a risk of abduction.  He seemed less concerned about a risk of manipulation of W by the mother during unsupervised contact because, he said, he would have the opportunity to correct any misinformation.   Dr Jefferis thought the father somewhat na&#239;ve about the measures that might be needed to safeguard contact. </p>

Instead he continued enforcement proceedings in Poland, the sole purpose of which seemed to be to fine the mother for each missed contact.   That seemed to me rather pointless in the circumstances.    </p>

It was a clear attempt to manipulate the situation.  Thus it was that the father learned for the first time that W was in foster care, enabling him to contact the Consulate who within a few hours had located her.</p>

They spoke positively about their recently resumed contact with W after a 4 year break.  They were delighted when W came and hugged them at their first visit and quickly became settled and comfortable.  Dr Jefferis described the observed contact session with all members of the paternal family as relaxed and lively with W appearing very comfortable.   The grandparents described how they would be in the background but available to provide support. </p>

His account was coherent.  This reflected my impression of him as a witness.   Dr Jefferis thought he showed signs of attunement in W&#8217;s emotions.  Although the family were not motivated to criticise the mother excessively, there was consistency in conveying an impression of the mother as someone with an abrasive interpersonal style who tends to rub people up the wrong way and a tendency therefore to isolate herself. </p>

An attempt to move from supervised to unsupervised contact with the mother in the community in January resulted in concerns that she had used the opportunity to influence W, so that contact reverted straightaway back to supervised.   Ms Kinloch-Jones complains on behalf of the mother that she has not had the same opportunities for unsupervised contact as the father, possibly giving the father an opportunity to influence her and leading W to favour him.  No concerns have been raised, as they have been with the mother, about the father&#8217;s unsupervised contact with W. </p>

Of greater concern were some bizarre or unusual themes in her narratives with a disconcerting quality, suggesting to Dr Jefferis disruptions in attachment security through frightening behaviour by a parent or insensitive or unavailable parenting (physically or emotionally).    W also made a number of representations of the child acting in a parentified manner, taking charge of situations normally managed by responsible adults, suggesting she has experienced lapses in parental availability or competence leading her to develop am unhealthy degree of self-reliance and not trusting adults to act in a responsible manner. </p>

She tended to allocate to groups of adults (including grandparents and her foster carer) in a way that suggested several adults with whom she has affectionate relationships, but with rather weak primary attachments &#8211; so probably not a really robust and secure attachment to either parent.

It was notable when I asked the mother towards the end of her evidence whether she could find anything positive to say about the father her response was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">What can I say about him?

However, I was very concerned about the maternal grandmother&#8217;s vitriol in respect of the paternal family, much of it based it seems on unsubstantiated and third hand tittle-tattle.   It was equally concerning that the mother signed up to the grandmother&#8217;s negativity so unquestioningly and without any apparent insight into the potential impact of this attitude on W&#8217;s relationship with her father.   I do not consider that grandmother would act as a positive emotional support but would rather reinforce the mother&#8217;s negative attitude towards contact, restricting her ability to gain insight and increasing the risk, if W were to live with her mother, of contact with the father being further obstructed. </p>

It remains of concern however that W had the impression (as I accept) that her mother had hit her.

On 10 January W&#8217;s school sent an email to say that W had had a very difficult day at school. She had a meltdown in class, became very tearful and unable to focus in her learning.  She told the teacher that, at contact, her mum had told her that, if she went to live with her dad, her mum would not see her again.   She reported that her mum would not be able to go to Poland as she had started a new job and had signed the contract, meaning that she would not be able to take time off every month.   W said her mum had been waiting a long time for a job like this and it was important.   She on went to say that she was scared about seeing her dad, although it was not clear why.   She was trying to be brave and keep her feelings inside.   She was encouraged by the teacher to talk about her feelings and worries. </p>

W&#8217;s report of the conversation is coherent and consistent with the mother&#8217;s attitude generally.  It is the sort of behaviour I am sorry to say is to be expected of her.   The reported discussion gives the context for W feeling scared about seeing her father.  The emotional impact on W of what her mother said is self-evident from the school&#8217;s report.  It is a further demonstration of the mother&#8217;s lack of insight into the consequences of her actions.    This is not something that happened at a time when the mother was unwell. </p>

This is again a clear example of the mother using her 9 year old child to further her own ends, this time evidence gathering, without appreciation of the confusion and emotional harm such behaviour causes. </p>

That means that W may have unrealistic worries about her mother becoming ill again.    That could lead to W not wanting to live with her for fear it could start all over again (as she has said) or wanting to live with her to protect her, which does not appear to be what she is feeling (indeed she didn&#8217;t seem very interested in knowing more about her mother&#8217;s condition).      </p>

In her &#8216;letter to the judge&#8217; she did not express a clear view, saying she had been in care for a year (to the day), that wanted me to decide and that it was complicated for her to decide about everything.

It is noticeable that the mother does not appear attuned to that wish.  She paid little regard to whether W wanted to move to the UK in the first place.   Even now her plan would be to remain in the UK with her mother and W, unless it became clear W wanted to return to Poland.   I wonder what freedom W might feel she had to express a clear wish to return to Poland if in her mother&#8217;s care or whether she would simply put up with staying here. </p>

That said, I am conscious of the risks of the decision to the mother&#8217;s mental health as identified by Dr Doherty.   Before this judgment is shown to the mother (initially in draft) I would ask that her legal representations, in conjunction with the social worker, liaise with her mental health team and adult social services to ensure that the mother is given all support necessary to deal with what will be a very unwelcome decision for her. </p>

During the afternoon of 17 March I received an email from Mr Alloway asking that I give an immediate direction to the mother&#8217;s solicitors to release W&#8217;s passport to enable her to travel back to Poland before flights there from the UK stop on 20 March as a result the Covid 19 pandemic).  I listed the matter for an urgent hearing on 18 March when Ms Kinloch-Jones attended in person with the mother and her solicitor, while the other advocates attended by telephone. </p>

The guardian was very clear that on a welfare basis W should be returned to Poland now.  The plan had been for a return on or about 20 March in any event but the current health crisis and the prospect of Poland closing its borders and incoming flights made it imperative that arrangements be made immediately.  Ms O&#8217;Hara pointed out that if W does not go now it is not clear when she would be able to go.  She would have to remain in foster care in uncertain circumstances.   She may not even be able to have contact with her mother here given the health situation.  W had been clear she wanted a decision earlier that </p>

She was obviously disappointed by it, but it is to her credit that she wanted to work with the order proposed and to work with the father and the Polish authorities to improve her contact with W.   She did not oppose the immediate release of W&#8217;s passport to enable her to fly to Poland. 171) Ms Kinloch-Jones raised three matters: </p>

I am not aware of any such principle and the prohibited steps order shall remain in force until further order.   That will enable reconsideration whether the order is still required rather than impose an arbitrary time limit unrelated to the circumstances requiring protection.   If matters settle to the point that risk of removal from the father&#8217;s care is no longer significant I hope the parties will be able to agree relaxation of the prohibited steps order. </p>

Ms Kinloch-Jones asked me to order the father to meet those costs in full, particularly given that he was pursuing enforcement of missed contact in Poland by way of fines.   Mr Alloway said the mother should pay the cost of supervision.  I have no information about the parties&#8217; financial resources or needs, now or when the mother relocates to Poland as she now plans.  I said that as a matter of equity the cost should be shared between the parties equally unless and until the Polish Court, seized with information about the parties&#8217; financial resources and needs, orders otherwise. </p>
