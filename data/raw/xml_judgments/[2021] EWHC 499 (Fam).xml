	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This is the latest stage in a protracted piece of financial remedies litigation between Ms Kicinski (&#8220;the Wife&#8221;) and Mr Pardi (&#8220;the Husband&#8221;). Although the marriage has ended, I will continue to refer to them as Wife and Husband for the sake of simplicity. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The Wife appealed a decision of Recorder Allen QC (&#8220;the Judge&#8221;) dated 16 July 2020. Permission to appeal was granted by Mr Justice Cohen on 26 August 2020. The substantive appeal is listed for 2 days in April 2021. The matter listed before me was whether a stay should be granted to the Wife to allow her not to transfer certain monies from a Swiss account pursuant to the order under appeal. The hearing was also listed to consider the Husband&#8217;s applications (made by way of his Respondent&#8217;s Notice dated 21 September 2020) to set aside permission to appeal or alternatively to attach conditions to permission. However, the Wife&#8217;s grounds of appeal have somewhat narrowed since the grant of permission to appeal. In those circumstances, Mr Webster QC, on behalf of the Wife, suggested that if the court had time, and had been able to read into the case, it would be efficient for me to deal with both the stay and the outstanding points on appeal. Mr Brooks, for the Husband, agreed that I should deal with the appeal if there was time to do so. As it turned out, the issue around the stay and the appeal were largely intertwined and having read into the case I decided the just and proportionate approach was to determine the stay and the appeal, and I therefore deal with both in this judgment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">One part of the financial dispute concerned approximately &#8364;8m in cash and securities in four Swiss bank accounts in the Wife&#8217;s sole name. The funds in these accounts were transferred during the marriage from the Husband&#8217;s uncle and aunt, Angelo Montone and Helge Peterson (&#8220;U&amp;A&#8221;) to the Wife. U&amp;A executed notarised deeds of gift and made gift declarations when donating the funds to the Wife. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">After the divorce proceedings commenced there were tax problems centring on those funds. U&amp;A had not paid tax on the funds in Italy (although they have subsequently done so). The Wife had not initially declared the funds to HMRC. In 2018 the Wife made a voluntary disclosure to HMRC and entered into a contractual disclosure facility &#8211; Code of Practice 9 (COP 9), making a full report to HMRC. After the October 2019 hearing a settlement was reached between the Wife and HMRC, with the Wife making a payment on account of &#163;260,000 in full and final settlement of her tax liability. It should be noted that these events became an issue in the proceedings with the Husband arguing that the Wife was not beneficially entitled to the funds and that the Wife&#8217;s selfreporting to HMRC amounted to &#8220;conduct&#8221; within the meaning of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25(2)</ref>(g). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 6 December 2018 the Wife was served with a notice of claim instituted by U&amp;A in Lucca, Italy for her to return the Swiss funds to them. The U&amp;A instructed an Italian lawyer, Avv Grisanti, in those proceedings. The Wife instructed Withers Solicitors (in Italy) with Withers also acting for her at that stage in the English proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The final hearing of the financial remedies proceedings was listed before the Judge on 21 October 2019 for 4 days. The Wife gave evidence and was cross examined. However, at the same time, negotiations were going on outside court. On the morning of the fourth day the parties had reached an agreement and both counsel (Mr Dyer QC for the Wife and Mr Brooks for the Husband) asked the court to approve the agreement as a Rose order (I will return to the meaning of that term below). The Judge made the said order that day. The U&amp;A were not represented in the English proceedings. However, it is clear from emails that have been put before the Court that there were discussions between those acting on behalf of the Husband and the U&amp;A&#8217;s Italian lawyer about the terms of the agreement. </p>

There was an argument about agency between the Wife and Withers. Mr Brooks argued that the Court had no power to order the Husband to give an indemnity to a third party, namely Withers. The Judge found he did not need to determine that issue but said that his provisional view (J80) was that Mr Brooks was correct and the court did not have jurisdiction to order a party to the marriage to indemnify a non-party in respect of actions by another non-party. </p>

It would be a clean and complete break with no outstanding contingent liabilities. She perfectly reasonably based that understanding on the fact that she believed, and the Husband had entirely supported that belief, that the U&amp;A would withdraw all proceedings against her and would enter into the deeds in respect of her and Withers.

However, the matters that Mr Brooks referred to, such as the timing and method of the withdrawal of Italian proceedings, go to the method of implementation of the terms of the agreement, not its substantive form. In fact, the U&amp;A did not withdraw the proceedings at all, they continued to trial, but the action was dismissed. Although the U&amp;A were not party to the English proceedings, and were not themselves represented, the Wife certainly proceeded on the basis that they would enter into the deeds and the Husband gave every indication that he was proceeding on the same basis. Given the relationship between the Husband and the U&amp;A, not just in terms of their being relatives but also the mutual financial support which is shown by the background facts, and the involvement in Avv Grisanti in the agreement that had been reached (albeit not formally), it was in my view wholly reasonable for the Wife to have placed full reliance on the U&amp;A abiding by what she and the Husband had agreed.  </p>

It would not, in my view, make sense for such an additional requirement to be imposed. It may be, particularly in this area of litigation, that it is foreseeable that one party to the agreed order will seek to renege upon it before it is executed. That does not mean that the change that then occurs is not significant even if to some degree foreseeable. It might well on the facts have been not wholly unexpected that Mrs Thwaite or Mr Bezeliansky would have reneged on part of their respective agreements.

This may or may not be a remote possibility.  However, this has been a highly acrimonious and litigious process. It is not possible to know the degree to which U&amp;A are acting independently of the Husband, but plainly their financial interests are very closely intertwined. The fact that the U&amp;A have not agreed to enter into the deed in respect of Withers, and that the Husband was not agreeing to indemnify Withers, or the Wife for any liability from Withers, in itself shows that the risk the Wife perceives cannot be considered fanciful. </p>

Further, the U&amp;A were not parties to the agreement and were not represented in the English proceedings. This is true, but only to a limited extent. There was a clear understanding in the Heads of Terms that the U&amp;A would waive any liabilities and that was a fundamental part of the deal that had been made. I note that the reference in square brackets at the end of clause 1.2, to which Mr Brooks refers appears to be referenced to &#8220;effecting&#8221; paragraph 1, i.e. to be concerned with the implementation of what had been agreed, rather than the Italian lawyers not having agreed the substantive issues. </p>

This is closely linked to the first issue because if there is a significant change then it becomes more likely that it would be fair to vary the order in a way that reflects the changed position. Mr Brooks argues that one reason it would be inequitable is that the Wife is now seeking an indemnity in different form from that she sought before the Judge. He says that the argument before the Judge concerned an indemnity to Withers, whereas she is now seeking a wider indemnity from the Husband. In my view this is a misreading of the indemnity sought. </p>

All Mr Webster has done is cut down the indemnity by removing the parts which would have applied to Withers directly. This can be shown to be correct by the textual exercise of removing those parts of the indemnity before the Judge which apply directly to Withers. What is left is an indemnity from the Husband to the Wife covering the Wife being liable to Withers. </p>

The Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Rose</span> was concerned to cover the situation where the parties had effectively reached an agreement but had not signed up to a fully worked out document. The Court did not wish the parties to be able to change their positions subsequently and avoid what they had agreed when faced with the immediacy of the court hearing. That is particularly important in a field where feelings often run very high and it is hard to reach an agreement other than &#8220;at the door of the court&#8221;. Equally, in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Thwaite</span> the Court wanted to ensure that where one party had failed to fully comply with an executory order, the other party did not have to pursue potentially expensive and complex further litigation.

I appreciate that there must be very considerable judicial discretion in a determination as to whether a particular course is or is not inequitable. However, in my view it is plainly inequitable to leave the Wife exposed to a contingent liability in circumstances where she is entering into a clean break settlement and therefore would have no ability to recover any money she had pay to Withers. In respect of the position of the Husband, if the U&amp;A have no intention of suing Withers then his liability does not arise. It may be that the very fact of the Husband giving the indemnity reduces the prospect of the U&amp;A pursuing Withers. Further, in my view it is appropriate to take into account the very closely intertwined financial relationship between the Husband and the U&amp;A in determining whether it is equitable to require the Husband to give the indemnity. As the Judge said at J63, it is not possible to make findings about the degree to which the U&amp;A act independently of the Husband, but I can take into account the fact that the Husband has been seeking to recover funds effectively on behalf of the U&amp;A; that he is said to have been supporting them financially whilst their funds were frozen in Switzerland; and that he is apparently their principal legatee.  </p>

However, as I have found for his client the costs order below must be set aside in any event. If there are further submissions on costs I will deal with them in writing.  </p>
