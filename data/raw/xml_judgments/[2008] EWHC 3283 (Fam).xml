	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The claimant, S, was born on 28 September 1990. She has had a difficult and damaged childhood, having in recent years had little effective support from her family. On 17 July 2004 her mother (the only person with parental responsibility) agreed to S being accommodated by Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council (which I shall refer to as the local authority) pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. But thereafter she seems to have played no effective role in S&#8217;s parenting. She was, so it is said, unable to meet her daughter&#8217;s physical, educational, health or emotional needs or to participate in working with the local authority in order to ensure a plan was devised by which those needs could be met.</p>

A joint report by a child and adolescent psychologist, consultant speech and language therapists and a sensory occupational therapist dated 23 February 2007 described S as an &#8220;extremely vulnerable, needy and young girl, who has no family support at all&#8221; and diagnosed her as having the following difficulties: (i) autism (having primary areas of impairment in communication, social interaction and stereotyped behaviour, and restricted interests including an inability to cope with an unpredictable environment) and (ii) early attachment disorder. Well before that the local authority had acknowledged (in the words of the trainee social worker who was S&#8217;s allocated social worker) that &#8220;though S is nearly sixteen, she is still a very vulnerable child.&#8221;</p>

By the time she was 15 she was frequently absconding from foster placements, was involved in various inappropriate and exploitative sexual relationships with a number of older men (which led to her making allegations of sexual assault) and had attempted suicide on a number of occasions. On 10 November 2005, when she was still only a few weeks past her 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday, she gave birth to a daughter, L. By then, of course, she had been accommodated by the local authority for almost 16 months.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Care proceedings in relation to L (MA06C01017) were issued by the local authority on 12 January 2006. L was removed from S&#8217;s care the following day. S was not competent to give instructions and the Official Solicitor was appointed to act on her behalf in March 2006. It became apparent to the Official Solicitor that S was an extremely vulnerable young person, in respect of whom nobody had been exercising parental responsibility for some time, and that she was herself suffering significant harm. On 21 June 2006 the Official Solicitor wrote formally to the local authority, inviting it to issue care proceedings in respect of S and putting it on notice that an application for judicial review might follow a negative decision. The local authority replied on 28 June 2006 confirming its decision not to commence care proceedings in respect of S. The Official Solicitor considered that the local authority&#8217;s decision was irrational.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Supported by the Official Solicitor, S made an application for judicial review (CO/5791/2006) on 10 July 2006. It sought, in effect if not in form, to compel the local authority to commence care proceedings in relation to S. Under the umbrella of the judicial review proceedings, S served draft Particulars of Claim (and on 27 July 2006 amended draft Particulars of Claim) setting out her claim for relief under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>. The matter came before Bennett J on 18 July 2006 who made an order by consent consolidating the Human Rights Act claim with the application for judicial review and directing the local authority to file a Defence to the Particulars of Claim by 11 August 2006. A Defence was duly served on 26 August 2006. No purpose would be achieved by my seeking to analyse it in any detail. It contained no admissions of any substance and consisted of a mixture of denials, non-admissions and, in paragraph 4, details of the positive case being made by the local authority that it had properly carried out its duties and responsibilities in relation to S. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By then matters had got worse. S went missing from her foster placement on 25 July 2006. Three days later, on 28 July 2006, she was placed in secure accommodation by the local authority. On 31 July 2006 the local authority &#8211; having finally realised, as the Official Solicitor would have it, the inevitability of the need for a care order &#8211; commenced care proceedings in respect of S (MA06C01270) and obtained an interim care order. Thus, as the Official Solicitor saw it, the two applications &#8211; the application for judicial review and the Human Rights Act claim &#8211; had fairly quickly achieved their initial objective.</p>

At the same time Black J made an order giving directions in the care proceedings, consolidating the Human Rights Act claim with the care proceedings and allocating Her Honour Judge Kushner QC as the section 9 judge to hear the consolidated proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the hearing before Black J the Legal Services Commission suspended S&#8217;s public funding certificate in respect of the Human Rights Act claim on the basis that the benefit to S of the claim continuing was not sufficient to justify funding the claim. The Official Solicitor disagreed, taking the view that the case appeared to raise issues of wider public interest justifying an extension of funding. The case went before the Public Interest Advisory Panel of the Legal Services Commission on 27 March 2007. It concluded, having heard representations on behalf of S, that the case did have a significant wider public interest &#8211; whereupon further funding was approved. </p>

I have been case managing the Human Rights Act claim ever since: the first hearing before me (by video link) was on 29 June 2007. The care proceedings in respect of S remained with Judge Kushner. They culminated in a final hearing on 20 September 2007 and the making on the same day (just a week before her 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday) of a final care order in respect of S. By then, of course, the care proceedings in respect of S&#8217;s baby, L, had long since been concluded, a final care order and a placement order having been made on 30 October 2006. L has since been adopted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the de-consolidation of the care proceedings and the Human Rights Act claim (in relation to which, as will be appreciated, there had never been any originating process), S issued on 9 July 2007 a Part 7 claim form in relation to the Human Rights Act claim (7MA90644). Much time during the latter part of 2007 and the earlier part of 2008 was, unavoidably, taken up in a massive disclosure exercise which was much more complex and took much longer than had originally been envisaged. (As I remarked at one hearing, the real challenge of the disclosure exercise became &#8220;an exercise in establishing what was not there.&#8221;) Partly in consequence of this, inadequacies in the existing pleadings became apparent, so on 11 April 2008 I directed that the case was to be re-pleaded. I directed S to file Particulars of Claim by 28 April 2008 and the local authority a Defence by 27 June 2008 &#8211; all this in contemplation of a further case management hearing before me on 3 July 2008 and a final hearing fixed for 10 days starting on 10 December 2008. (The case had previously been fixed for a final hearing for 15 days starting on 7 April 2008 but I had been compelled to vacate that date at a hearing on 8 February 2008.)</p>

Further information was supplied to me on 1 July 2008, in the light of which I agreed to vacate the hearing fixed for 3 July 2008. In due course I also vacated the final hearing fixed for December 2008.</p>

Efforts made by the [local authority] to encourage [S] to attend school were wholly undermined by the absence of any assessment of her learning difficulties and a personal education plan. A report commissioned by an educational psychologist prior to 25 January 2006 ought to have been a baseline objective in helping to meet [S]&#8217;s educational needs. Further [S] was effectively denied the right to an education and/or access to an educational institution.&#8221;</p>

Counsel, solicitors, and guardians ad litem or next friends have opportunities which the court lacks for prolonged and detailed consideration of the proposals and possible variations of them in relation to the attitudes of the other parties and the apparent strength and weakness of their respective claims. When the matter comes before the court, the terms of settlement are in final form and the time for consideration is of necessity less ample. The court accordingly must rely to a considerable extent on the views of those whose opportunities of weighing the matter have been so much greater. Expressing a view on whether the terms of a proposed compromise are in the interests of a minor is a matter of great responsibility for all concerned. The solicitors must see that all the relevant matters are put before counsel, that the right questions are asked, and that the guardian ad litem or next friend of the minor fully understands and weighs counsel&#8217;s advice when it is given. Counsel has to discharge what in my judgment is one of the most important and responsible functions of the Bar, that of helping those unable to help themselves; and the guardian ad litem or next friend must understand the advice given and carefully weigh the advantages of the proposed compromise to the minor against the disadvantages.&#8221;</p>

Yet they remain of high importance in the due administration of justice. They provide an important illustration of what all lawyers know, namely, that justice according to law is a co-operative process to which solicitors, counsel and judges all make their contributions. No judge can perform his duties adequately and efficiently without the great assistance from counsel and solicitors that is traditional. The gratitude for this assistance that is sometimes expressed from the Bench is genuine indeed: and correlative to that gratitude is the duty of the Bench to take whatever steps may be appropriate to see that the ancient standards are fully maintained.&#8221;</p>

Important elements in my evaluation of the Compromise from this perspective were (a) the fact that S had not expressed, and so far as I could see, was unlikely in future to express, any wish to &#8216;go public&#8217; with her story &#8211; contrast the &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>competent&#8217; Angela in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Roddy </span>&#8211; and (b) the very considerable value to S (and I am not talking here only about pecuniary value) of the arrangements comprised in the Compromise.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is, as Mr Field has correctly argued, nothing contrary to public policy in the inclusion in a compromise of litigation of such a confidentiality clause, and the same must go whether the litigant is an adult or a child. The protection for the child-litigant is, of course, the necessity for judicial approval before the proposed compromise can take effect, but it is axiomatic that, in exercising this very anxious jurisdiction, the court is concerned with &#8211; and concerned only with &#8211; the welfare, the best interests, of the particular child. The court is not concerned with, and, save insofar as they may indirectly further the welfare of the child, cannot put into the balance, the interests of third parties or of the world at large. In assessing a proposed compromise the court has to evaluate the benefit it is going to confer on the child. Now &#8216;benefit&#8217; is a wide and elastic concept and it is not, of course, to be assessed in merely pecuniary terms. Moreover, benefit can be found in circumstances which would leave the untutored layman puzzled (two striking examples in very different areas of the law can be found in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Clore&#8217;s Settlement Trusts, Sainer v Clore</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1966] 1 WLR 955" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1966">[1966] 1 WLR 955</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">In re Y (Mental Patient: Bone Marrow Donation)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] Fam 110" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] Fam 110</ref>). But however far one can legitimately take the concept, the irreducible requirement is that the compromise must be for the benefit of the child concerned.

I do not seek to depreciate the very real difficulties that all too many local authorities have to contend with, but surely (to adopt the language of the great Brandeis J so many years ago) the remedy for these ills is not the enforced silence of judicially conferred anonymity but rather the disinfectant power of exposure to forensic sunlight.</p>

The fact that these are not care proceedings can hardly be an argument in favour of anonymity. The fact that there may be no public interest in naming the local authority is, with respect, to put the boot on the wrong foot: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Disclosure)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/411" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 411 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 411 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 142" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 142</ref>, at para [125]. And the confidentiality clause, as Mr Field himself accepts, does not preclude publication of the order, which of course naturally names the local authority. The simple fact, as pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B, X Council v B </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2007/1622" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 1622 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 1622 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 482" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 482</ref>, at para [14], is that &#8220;current practice shows that local authorities involved in care cases are increasingly being identified&#8221; &#8211; and if in care cases then surely so in other types of case involving children, whether in the Family Division, the Administrative Court or elsewhere. </p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In the case of S she was allocated a trainee social worker &#8230; The dominant factor in the allocation of that worker appears to have been the local authority&#8217;s policy (replicated nationally) to the effect that whilst only qualified social workers would be appointed to cases where there were proceedings before the court (to ensure standards and quality in reports prepared for the court process) unqualified social workers could work <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> cases. The incorrect assumption developed from this practice appears to have been that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> cases are inherently less serious or complex. Even if that were generally true (which we doubt) it is not universally true and the allocation of a worker should be informed by an analysis of the reasons for and background to the initial accommodation, measured against a formalised assessment structure. [The trainee social worker] eventually left this local authority at least in part, because of the stress and complexity of her workload. A periodic review of the suitability of an identified worker to continue to work the case should be mandatory (or at the very least identified as best practice). It is within the experience of every judge within the family court justice system that some cases commence on an apparently simple basis but develop (perhaps unexpected) complexities. That applies at least equally to the circumstances of &#8216;accommodated children&#8217;. In her meetings with her line manager [the trainee social worker] did not volunteer the difficulties she was experiencing. There were however in this case virtually no case notes kept by her. Much effort has been made at the discovery stage to identify those notes until the Defendants were driven to acknowledge that they simply do not exist. Competent line management review and appraisal would have signalled that the worker was not coping with this case. That there was a problem with recording of notes was in fact noted &#8211; though not acted upon. The real issue however is that in the absence of any recordings the team manager could not evaluate whether S&#8217;s needs were being met at all. It is easy to see from this point in the case how whilst significant resources were deployed, they were never targeted effectively. Nobody in the social services had ever properly addressed the question which comprises the first paragraph of any care plan: what are the identified needs of the child? This of course ought to have been picked up by the statutory review process and the IRO.&#8221;</p>

The only existing psychological assessment of S to date reveals her have &#8220;early attachment disorder&#8221;, &#8220;autism&#8221; and &#8220;cognitive difficulties&#8221;.  Her behaviours are, in our submission consistent with such diagnosis. That assessment was ordered by the court following the birth of S&#8217;s child L (now adopted). It ought (as set out in the Particulars of Claim) to have been the base line analysis of S&#8217;s needs as an accommodated child herself. The speed with which this crucial information was obtained within the court process for L throws into stark relief the deficiencies of the investigations within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> processes. Structures are in place, in this respect, for looked after children, pursuant to the Review of Children&#8217;s Cases Regulations 1991 (Arrangements For Placement of Children (General) Regulations 1991), which impose a duty on the social services department to consult with all the appropriate agencies and individuals. The absence of proper records in S&#8217;s case rendered it impossible to assess whether or to what extent this was done. It is clear however that information from other services was not transmitted to the review meetings.&#8221;</p>

They may sometimes wish to avoid the instigation of care proceedings where they run the risk of adverse findings being made against them, sometimes with a potentially adverse impact upon other children within the family. The very fact that a parent is unable to care for a child at home ought perhaps to signal that they may not always be well placed to exercise their PR in a child&#8217;s best interests at all points within his or her period of accommodation. When such parents do not (as in S&#8217;s case) regularly attend the review process that ought, in our submission, to be regarded as a &#8220;trigger&#8221; to alert the IRO to consideration of the need to instigate proceedings. The absence of parental input in circumstances where PR is not shared with a local authority should be seen as powerful evidence pointing to the local authority&#8217;s need to acquire PR. The alternative is that the &#8216;accommodated&#8217; child whose parents have disengaged is left in a legal limbo.</p>

The inappropriate use of it fails to respect or protect the autonomy and rights of the child (as here in S&#8217;s case). If it were to become a device to circumvent the scrutiny of the court and the CAFCASS appointed guardian that is likely to excite either judicial review and Human Rights Act applications or may well lead to pressure for legislative reform to curtail the local authority&#8217;s exercise of its <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> jurisdiction (the undesirable consequence of which might in fact be an increase in the number of care proceedings issued). For this reason it is important that the scheme under which accommodated children are assisted should be clear and effective. They require the same access to professional expertise stimulated by independent scrutiny as those children who find themselves subject to proceedings.
