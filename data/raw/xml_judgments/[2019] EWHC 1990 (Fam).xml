Central to that exercise, and for reasons which will become clear (see particularly [118] below), it was necessary to engage the maternal grandfather fully in those discussions.

Materially, they do not actively oppose the continuation of a worldwide travel ban on an interim basis, but would wish it to be relaxed to allow for one one-week trip to Egypt in September 2019; they propose that there should be a court review of the arrangements for any further travel thereafter.  Mr Ekaney QC and Dr. Proudman for the mother submitted that this proposal would most closely achieve proper observance of X&#8217;s and the mother&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8</span> rights, while protecting X&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Article 3</span> rights.  Mr Ekaney significantly concedes that as X grows older, so the risk that she will be subject to FGM in Egypt becomes greater.  Thus, he accepts, what may now be appropriate (in relation to travel and/or safeguards) may not be so when she is, for instance, 9 years old.  In those circumstances, the mother&#8217;s lawyers advocate that there be <span style="font-style:italic">one</span><span style="font-weight:bold"/>visit permitted now, and for the court to reassess the matter once everyone has an objective experience of how this can be achieved.   </p>

In her written report, filed in advance of this hearing, she maintained that position.  Her main concern was that the mother and X would be prevented from leaving Egypt at the end of any stay.  Having heard the evidence given before me, and shortly before she gave her oral evidence Ms Odze signalled that she had changed her view, and recommended that X be permitted to travel to Egypt on two or more occasions each year, subject to satisfactory safeguards being in place for the trip.  After the adjournment (see [8] above), Ms Odze revised her view again; she was less than assured that the safeguards proposed by the parents were &#8216;satisfactorily&#8217; evidenced. She recommended a further adjournment to allow for more information to be obtained about the arrangements for travel to Egypt, alternatively a decision &#8216;in principle&#8217; subject to further detail being provided.  </p>

Professor Bradley (see [76] below <span style="font-style:italic">et seq</span>.) rightly warned that a serious danger of classification is that one type of FGM may be seen as &#8216;less bad&#8217; than another; she told me that in some respects labelling the mutilation in this way &#8220;is not helpful.  It might appear that some cutting is not as harmful as others.  That understanding needs to be dispelled. All of what is described above is abusive, harmful and serious ill-treatment.  &#8230; Type 1 is not &#8216;lighter&#8217; than the others&#8221;.  This advice was material in the instant case: in a conversation in her college in December 2018 the mother wrongly referred to Type 1 as &#8220;not the worst level&#8221; (see [52] below). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">While the practice of FGM is heinous and abhorrent, and its practice impossible to justify, it is important to understand how and why its practice is supported in Egypt as in other parts of the world. The justifications and motivations are generally based on a belief that FGM brings status and respect to the girl, it preserves a girl&#8217;s virginity/chastity, it is said to be part of being a woman, it is a rite of passage, it gives a girl social acceptance, especially for marriage, it upholds the family &#8220;honour&#8221;, it cleanses and purifies the girl.  Some who support the practice have sought to eliminate risks of infection (by, for example, carrying out the procedure in a medical environment) and this gives the appearance of legitimising FGM.  The experts commissioned in this case (see below) have advised me that FGM signifies a woman&#8217;s subservience and obedience to men.  Although large numbers of the Egyptian population apparently believe that FGM is a religious requirement within the Hadith, there is no religious imperative or expectation &#8211; either in the Christian or Islamic faith.  </p>

On the evidence before the judge she was "not aware of the kind of marriage contracted" by the parents.

She then discovered that she was pregnant and decided to remain in England to give birth. As set out in the judgment, following X's birth in England the mother raised the issue of FGM with a health visitor. The mother was intending to return to Egypt with X and, it would appear, wanted to discuss concerns she had about FGM. This led to the involvement of social services and the police and, about two weeks later, to an application for and an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2003 Act</ref>.

The father&#8217;s other sister is now aged 15 and lives at home with her parents (the paternal grandparents of X).  The paternal grandfather is retired; he formerly worked at the local university. I do not believe that the paternal grandmother worked outside of the home.  The father&#8217;s family live in a rural governorate in Egypt, whereas the father lives mainly, and has until recently worked, in Hurghada on the Red Sea coast.

The paternal grandmother underwent FGM as a young person (when she was &#8220;ten or eleven&#8221;).

Dr. Fahmy was less sure of the mother&#8217;s free-will in this regard and speculated that the father had sought to influence the mother by sending her YouTube videos and Website discussions about Islam.  Dr. Fahmy understood that it was in in this way, that (according to the father) &#8220;she was convinced&#8221; to wear the veil. In 2018, the mother commenced a college course to study to be a teacher; she had to suspend her studies in December as her funding was withdrawn.

The referral arose in this way.  On 11 October 2016, at a routine home visit, the mother is reported to have discussed with her health visitor that she was planning to travel to Egypt with X from December 2016, for a period of 6 months (later reduced to 3 weeks).  In the conversation, the mother is reported to have said that X&#8217;s father and her family &#8220;are expecting&#8221; [X] to undergo FGM during her and her mother&#8217;s planned visit to Egypt&#8221;; separately it is recorded that the paternal family had &#8220;assumed&#8221; that X would be circumcised (subjected to FGM).  The mother had continued (according to the report): &#8220;[X]&#8217;s father &#8230;has said that he did not realise that it [FGM] was illegal in the UK and all of the females in his family have undergone the procedure.&#8221;  The mother reported that the father had allegedly told her that X &#8220;did not have to have it [circumcision] done&#8221;.  It was further reported that the father had apparently told the mother that he thought that FGM should be &#8216;legalised&#8217; and undertaken in a hospital.

On 18 November, at a further health visitor visit, the mother is reported to have said that the father &#8220;has assured her that her daughter will not undergo this procedure&#8221;.   The mother had a general awareness of FGM from her own life in Egypt; she told me (though the father did not confirm this, he did not dispute the mother&#8217;s account) that earlier in the relationship he had specifically asked her whether she had undergone the procedure herself.  The health visitor told me, and I accept, that the mother was knowledgeable about FGM and had researched it.  To her credit, the mother gave the health visitor the impression that she wanted professional help. </p>

Given the imminence of the mother&#8217;s proposed trip to Egypt, a travel ban was also imposed.   That interim position was maintained until May 2017 when Russell J commenced the first final hearing. </p>

Quite apart from the difficulties of recalling precise words used (see [31](ii) above), it has been difficult for the parents to clarify or revise their position on FGM and the risks to X, (particularly where such changes may be said to have indicated a retreat from the original statements), without attracting considerable suspicion, anxiety and, it may be said, criticism on the part of the professionals, who believe them to be minimising the risk, dissembling, or misleading.   </p>

In that respect, I have been reluctant to draw an adverse conclusion against them for correcting their earlier comments.  However, in other respects, I find that the parents <span style="font-style:italic">have</span> sought to row back from their original comments in order to divert or allay concern, and/or because they have become frustrated by the court process, and are keen to be reunited.  An illustration of this is the report of a discussion between the mother and the social worker on 8 December, wherein the mother is reported to have said that it was <span style="font-style:italic">she</span> who assumed that FGM would be carried out (i.e. not the paternal family).  In this regard, I accept that the mother had earlier accurately reported the father telling her that it was <span style="font-style:italic">his family</span> who would either &#8220;expect&#8221; or &#8220;assume&#8221; (I am unable to find which word was used, as both are reported to have been used) that X would be having this procedure during her visit in December 2016.   </p>

He was clear about this. While the Local Authority alighted on this evidence as indicative of the father&#8217;s unreliability, it is more likely in my judgment to be explicable by the fact that issues of female circumcision were not widely discussed across the generations or genders within the traditional family (per Dr. Fahmy), and that the father was making assumptions, little appreciating the significance of his statements.  The father has nonetheless been consistent in asserting that X would not be cut.  He disputed that he had suggested that X would be cut, or that FGM should be legalised and performed in hospitals. </p>

At that time, he must have known, of course, that his wife had indeed undergone the procedure, and bore the physical and deep emotional scars of the same.

The medical report (undated, and unsigned) confirmed that the father&#8217;s sisters had not been subject to FGM.  However, there is no detail in the report as to the qualifications or expertise of the doctor, the nature of the examination, the results of the individual examinations, the methodology or the findings on examination. The family&#8217;s evidence is that the paternal grandfather organised this medical examination without the knowledge of his wife, the paternal grandmother.  Much focus was brought upon this incident in the oral hearing and the evidence was not entirely satisfactory; this is one of those aspects of the evidence which (as I earlier indicated ([31](iii))) has been overly contaminated by repeat questioning.

Prior to the 2018 referral, the mother had been consistent in expressing her opposition to FGM; since then, she has similarly consistently indicated her opposition.  In my judgment, her consistent position is altogether a more reliable indicator of her true views, and I am therefore satisfied that her outburst does not show a fundamental change of attitude, nor that she harbours a lurking ambivalence about the unacceptability of FGM.  However, it does tend to indicate that the mother (possibly like many others) may hold (or have held) the erroneous view that certain types of FGM are less unacceptable than others. The mother is, I accept, embarrassed and ashamed now by her comments, and recognises her stupidity.  I am prepared to accept her comment: &#8220;it is so contrary to what I believe&#8221;.  </p>

The mother doubted that she had ever said this, but surmised that if she had said so &#8220;I may have been thinking that the family may be more secretive now because they know I am aware, and I oppose FGM&#8221;.  I find that this conversation did take place.  It raises the index of concern about the mother as a protective influence. </p>

The mother told me that she would do whatever it takes to protect X from undergoing FGM, and I believe that that indeed is her firm intention.  I accept that she does not want her daughter to be circumcised or cut.

He accepted that his wife was right to raise her concern about FGM with the health visitor (&#8220;of course&#8230; [X] comes first&#8230; [X]&#8217;s safety is our priority&#8221;), even though he had expressed his frustrations at the consequent court process. The father told me that he had reached out to local NGOs in Egypt to learn more about FGM; while this may have shown willing to demonstrate his opposition to the practice, it was, in truth, a rather superficial exercise.  He did not, for example, engage in any support group or initiate any activity which advocates against FGM.    On 21 March 2019, the father signed a formal statement (attested to by a lawyer) confirming that he did not oppose X&#8217;s worldwide travel; this was a response to the expressed concern that he would seek to stop X from leaving Egypt should she travel there. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The Local Authority&#8217;s concern is rooted in the inconsistencies in the accounts given by the mother and father to social workers and professionals about FGM, and its incidence in the paternal family.  This lack of clarity demonstrates a lack of appreciation of, or concern about, the seriousness of FGM, and the risks to X by a trip to Egypt.  Miss Markham asks me to accept (as I do) the accuracy of the note of the health visitor, the police officer and the social worker. As earlier explained, I suspect that some of the early comments were made naively and/or from a position of ignorance &#8211; the mother reporting some of what the father had said which may, or may not, have been accurately interpreted or understood. </p>

Miss Markham questions the reliability of the parents, drawing specific attention to the assertion in the mother&#8217;s most recent statement about contacting the police station in Hurghada which, on probing, was found not to be true (see [58](ii)).  Further, while not doubting the maternal grandfather&#8217;s integrity, the Local Authority raises significant question about his naivety in the role he is to perform, and the consequent risks which are likely to arise for X.  The Local Authority point out that he has not done any separate factfinding, or independent researches.  Miss Markham does not doubt that the maternal grandfather <span style="font-style:italic">intends</span> to keep X safe; he has just underestimated the challenges of doing so.   All of the experts in the case say that what is required is a clear and cogent safety plan, and that, says the Local Authority, is lacking.  The Local Authority are concerned about the robustness of the supports on the ground in the event of a problem.  </p>

Her approach was more investigative; she defended this as the approach most likely to yield the information required from the paternal family.  Having read and heard her evidence, I am entirely satisfied as to the effectiveness of her methodology in this case.

She felt that while the family do not see FGM as violation of rights <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>, they acknowledge the harmful effects of it.  She felt that the paternal family had become somewhat &#8220;enlightened&#8221; to the issue of FGM over the last two years, and to the gravity of the practice.  While some of their views about FGM are evidently insupportable, their apparently enlightened understanding of the crime offers X at least some protection; further, it complements the fact that X is (in Dr. Fahmy&#8217;s view) <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> &#8220;yet in the high-risk age category for FGM in Egypt, which is 9-12 years&#8221;.  That said, FGM Types 1 and 2 are &#8216;widespread&#8217; in Egypt; there are a number of misassumptions and beliefs surrounding the practice which help to support its ongoing observance, and the government bodies are described as &#8220;ineffective&#8221; to eradicate FGM.  Professor Bradley shared the view that 9-12 years of age was the critical and most vulnerable age-range; the paternal grandmother was cut when she was in this age bracket. </p>

However, from literature and other research it has become clear that in society now when the woman in the household has undergone a painful FGM &#8220;she&#8217;s not going to circumcise her daughter because she does not want to inflict the same pain on them&#8221;.  Professor Bradley confirmed that she too regarded it as highly significant that the paternal grandmother had experienced such trauma through circumcision &#8220;this is in line with what we know about triggers for mind-set change&#8221;.  In summary, Dr. Fahmy, in her oral evidence opined that X would be at &#8220;low risk&#8221; if she were to travel to Egypt for a short holiday &#8211; particularly given (a) her young age, (b) the attitudes of the paternal family (against FGM), (c) the experience of the paternal grandmother, and (d) the aspiration of the father to reside ultimately in the UK. </p>

Professor Bradley confirmed that that situation may change over time, and that &#8220;we are really focusing on the medium to long term&#8230; as the child gets older, if the plan is to go ahead to continue to travel to see her family in Egypt, then I would argue that that risk needs to be continuously assessed each trip&#8230; a similar approach to the approach that&#8217;s been taken in this instance&#8221;. This view was confirmed by Ms Sabin-Quarm: &#8220;if she keeps going there, she&#8217;s going to come into that age group where it would be the time that she should be cut&#8230; so the risk will be there as she grows.&#8221; </p>

She nonetheless took the view that the risk was &#8220;high&#8221;.  In reaching this conclusion, Ms Sabin-Quarm had used and relied heavily on a &#8216;FGM risk assessment tool&#8217;.  I felt that this tool (which seeks to elicit yes/no answers to a series of pre-prepared questions) while useful undoubtedly as part of an assessment methodology, focused somewhat too heavily on the contextual or (what we came to know as) the &#8216;macro-risks&#8217; in the case, without looking sufficiently at the specific and individual (or &#8216;micro-&#8216;risks&#8217;) of the individual case.  Ms Sabin-Quarm placed heavily reliance on the tool; the consequence was that her conclusions were a little more formulaic and less nuanced than the more quantitative evaluation undertaken by Dr. Fahmy and Professor Bradley. Ms Sabin-Quarm&#8217;s report was also light on detailed and fact-specific analysis; by applying the risk assessment tool somewhat rigidly, her conclusion ended up being, in my judgment, overly risk averse.  She took the view that no travel would be safe for the whole of X&#8217;s minority (&#8220;X needs to be safe&#8221;); in making this recommendation there was no recognition of the likelihood of the risk changing over time.  </p>

She initially supported the travel ban, expressing her concern that the mother is sufficiently vulnerable that the father may be able to persuade her to remain living in Egypt with X (and that this would be contrary to X&#8217;s best interests).   At the hearing before me, she was particularly impressed by the evidence of the maternal grandfather, and specifically of the dire consequences for him (and for his family back in England) of him failing to comply with his undertakings.

The evidence is that the paternal grandmother has been cut.  She described the experience as traumatic.  Dr. Fahmy and Professor Bradley regard this feature as of great significance in importing an inherent <span style="font-style:italic">protection</span> into the situation, rather than a factor pointing towards its repetition.    There is no evidence that the father&#8217;s sisters, or nieces have been cut; the Local Authority did not, in fairness, set out to prove, nor did they claim, that they had been.  Although the medical evidence produced (see [47] above) is unsatisfactory, in the absence of any affirmative evidence that these younger females in the family have been cut I must proceed on the basis that they have <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> in fact been cut.  This would suggest that within the family, the practice probably (i.e. on the balance of probabilities) stopped with the paternal grandmother.  Consistent with this break in traditional practice is the fact that the father&#8217;s sisters have benefited from a good quality education unlike their female forebears, including a university education for his older sister; the father told me that his younger (teenage) sister aspires for a professional career as a doctor.  It was reassuring that Dr. Fahmy had been left with the strong impression from the paternal family that they were &#8220;very aware of the dire consequences which they face if they contemplate the circumcision of X&#8221;. </p>

As I have earlier indicated (see [54]), the mother&#8217;s outburst in December 2018, which may have suggested otherwise, was probably no more than an ill-judged rant.  I regard the mother as being independent minded, and not likely to be suborned to the will of the father; he too has demonstrated (through his marriage to the mother) a capacity to act independently of (and possibly defiantly to) his parents.  Both parents have been co-operative with the Local Authority, during an excessively long legal process.    The mother is assessed as an excellent carer for her daughter. </p>

It is liable to change, and requires regular reassessment.  Risk is highly sensitive, and rarely static.  Courts and parties should be alert to the possibility that as or when new evidence emerges, and/or the contextual or individual characteristics of a given situation shift, so the index of risk is likely to shift.  The likelihood of an event coming to pass may increase or subside; the consequence or &#8216;impact&#8217; of an event &#8211; if it was to occur &#8211; may also change over time.   The most obvious illustration of this on these facts is that the <span style="font-style:italic">risk</span> of harm will change as X grows older; she will in a few years&#8217; time enter the age-bracket when she is statistically far more vulnerable to genital cutting.

Having done so I have reached the conclusion that the risks identified are sufficiently significant as to justify the imposition of a worldwide travel ban at least at present time.  There are many &#8216;contextual&#8217; high-risk factors surrounding FGM in Egypt, and there are few &#8216;standard&#8217; safeguards available, given the relative impotence of the law enforcement agencies, and the low numbers of prosecutions.  The incidence of FGM (92%) in Egypt (the country where the father lives and to which the mother would inevitably be drawn) weighs heavy in the balance.  The lack of effective enforcement of the domestic law in Egypt, and/or of the recognition and enforcement there of orders made (or undertakings given) in this country, is a significant concern; it appears from the expert evidence I have received that the state is still failing to protect young Egyptian women (see [93]-[96] above).  The availability to the mother of FCO or police may be vulnerable to circumstance (see [103]-[105]).  All of this plays out against a backdrop, as Mr Ekaney is right to remind me, of a societal expectation of female circumcision, even if that is &#8211; among younger generations &#8211; a changing expectation.   </p>

First, X&#8217;s age puts her outside of the age at which young females are conventionally cut in Egypt.  Secondly, I am entirely satisfied that <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> parents do not wish X to be circumcised or cut, and are against the practice of FGM for their daughter and generally.  In short, I accept their evidence on this, on which they have been broadly consistent.  The maternal grandfather is, I am satisfied, equally resolutely opposed to circumcision of his granddaughter.  Thirdly, the mother is, I accept, an &#8220;exemplary mother&#8221; who is bonded closely with her daughter; this operates as a significant protective factor.  Fourthly, I accept Dr. Fahmy&#8217;s opinion that the fact that the paternal grandmother has been cut (with painful and long-standing traumatic consequences) is a factor which is likely to <span style="font-style:italic">reduce</span> the incidence of it in younger generations within the paternal family.

This assessment is supported by the view of the maternal grandfather who described his surprise at first meeting the father as to how similar he was to many young English men (&#8220;well-presented, fashionable &#8230; into music and movies &#8230; quite a liberal man &#8230; he is not the type of person who would break the law&#8221;).  I am satisfied that it is material that in marrying the mother, an English woman and a recent convert to Islam, he had demonstrated an independence of mind and an ability to break with tradition; he told Dr. Fahmy that his own mother had opposed the marriage initially (the mother said that the paternal grandmother did not speak to her son [the father] for five months after the wedding) although was now accepting of it.  These are all factors which may point against the perpetuation of the historic and barbaric practice within the paternal family.  </p>

The father told Dr. Fahmy, as he told me, that he wanted X to be raised in England.  These assertions, if sincere, would tend to militate against the perpetration of FGM on X in the event of a visit to Egypt; the commission of such an offence would be likely irredeemably to damage the father&#8217;s prospects of ever coming to visit, let alone live in, the UK. </p>

The specific arrangement proposed and discussed in this judgment, encircled with clear precautionary measures, appropriately balances the crucial rights &#8211; the protection of X&#8217;s rights under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 3</span>, and the preservation of her rights (and those of her parents) under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">ECHR</span>.
