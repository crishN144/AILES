DCJ Corrie found that the abuse had continued beyond the end of the relationship by the use of secret CCTV recordings in the house they had shared, installing a hidden tracking device in her car, publishing details of the mother&#8217;s whereabouts on Facebook, sending harassing text messages, and making persistent &#8216;silent&#8217; phone calls, to both the mother and to her friends CD and DD.</span></p>

The order provided for the children to live with their mother, and for the father to send birthday and Christmas cards to the children.  I declined to make an order limiting the father&#8217;s ability to apply to the Court in future pursuant to section 91(14) of the Children Act 1989.

The report of the DAPP worker in July 2019 suggests that the father strongly maintained that the finding of rape was untrue, and did not accept the other findings.  He is reported to have suggested that the cause of the relationship breakdown was the mother&#8217;s erratic behaviour, that she was physically aggressive to him, and that she had made up the allegations against him in order to obtain legal aid.  It was reported that he repeatedly suggested that she had been unfaithful within the marriage.  The reporter concluded that he </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;showed no insight or accountability in relation to any of his own behaviour being abusive&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> in his past relationships, and that he had been controlling.

I refused the father&#8217;s application for the children to live with him, or for direct contact between him and the children.  The final order provided that he may send the children cards for Christmas and their birthdays.  The decision was reached having regard to all the evidence, which included an updated assessment from Professor Perkins, who had also prepared a report for the hearing in 2018. Professor Perkins detected a limited shift in acknowledgment, but still raised significant questions about the extent to which the father had developed a genuine ability to reflect on his own actions.  Direct contact between the father and the children was still assessed as high risk.  Professor Perkins wrote: </span></p>

Although he used the word reflection many times, there was limited (but some) evidence of this in the assessment.  However, he has committed himself to 12 months dynamic psychotherapy through ELFT which, if it goes ahead, and if he engages with, could be very helpful in these regards.&#8217;</span></p>

The father has throughout the proceedings remained immovable on the question of the need for him to undergo any kind of work, therapeutic or otherwise, which might start him on the road to re-establishing contact with his children.  It is right to acknowledge that in his final submissions he said that if Professor Perkins suggested a course he would go on it, but Professor Perkins&#8217; evidence was that he had explored the question of various therapies with the father, even those which may not require an acceptance of findings, and he found the father to be wholly resistant to it and not accepting of any need for self-reflection.  In the circumstances, the Court has in my judgment taken all necessary steps to facilitate contact as can reasonably be demanded in the circumstances of the particular case, and there is nothing more that could reasonably be done.</span></p>

In particular, the risk is that he may seek to undermine and destabilise their placement with the special guardians, and that if he has contact with the children he will find it challenging to manage his feelings and emotions about his situation, is intent on developing his relationship with them and, having had no treatment to address this, is likely to be unable to either control what he says to them, so as to protect them from emotional harm.  &#8230;</span></p>

The father has persisted in his allegations against [DD] and the mother, and has persisted in his allegations that [CD] and [DD] have influenced the children against him.  He has in the past installed a tracker on the mother&#8217;s car.  He does now admit sending harassing text messages and having installed CCTV surveillance, but continues to deny any controlling behaviour.  Findings were made about him making anonymous calls to [CD] and [DD].  Those calls continued until May 2019.   The father contacted social services and made allegations about mother&#8217;s care of the children while in the home of [DD] and [CD].  The father&#8217;s character is that he pushes and persists.  He knows where the children go to school and has persuaded A &#8217;s school to respond to his requests for information every fortnight.  He said that he has made the same arrangement with B &#8217;s school.  In my judgment, the risk to the children if contact were allowed to progress without evidence of an acknowledgment from the father of these behaviours and a fundamental change, then the risk squarely remains that he may take steps to try and influence the children to see things from his perspective or otherwise take steps that would have the result of interfering with, undermining or destabilising their placement with their special guardians.&#8217;</span></p>

It may be that there is one substantive live application but that a person&#8217;s conduct overall is such that an order made under s 91(14) is merited. This situation is anticipated by Guideline (6) of Re P: &#8216;In suitable circumstances (and on clear evidence), a court may impose the leave restriction in cases where the welfare of the child requires it, although there is no past history of making unreasonable applications&#8217;. </span></p>

Those interests are served by the making of an order under s 91(14) in an appropriate case not only to protect an individual child from the effects of endless unproductive applications and/or a campaign of harassment by the absent parent, but tangentially also to benefit all those other children whose cases are delayed as court lists are clogged up by the sort of applications made in this case, applications which should never have come before a judge.</span></p>

The risk that harm may arise to a child under the age of 18 unless the making of applications is restrained is not qualified by words such as &#8220;serious&#8221; or &#8220;significant&#8221; and neither is the degree of harm that a child may experience. I observe that, insofar as the risk that harm may arise to a child is concerned, section 91A(2) sits a little uneasily alongside guideline 7 of the Re P guidelines which states that there must be a &#8220;serious risk [my emphasis] that, without the imposition of the restriction, the child or primary carers will be subject to unacceptable strain&#8221;. Correctly applied to a child&#8217;s circumstances, section 91A(2) gives a court greater latitude to make section 91(14) orders than the Re P guidelines do. Thus, in coming to my decision in this case, I have applied the new statutory approach to harm set out in s.91A(2) rather than guideline 7 of the Re P guidelines and, in so doing, I have adopted the ordinary civil standard of proof. That course is consistent with the modern approach of the Court of Appeal in Re A as outlined above.&#8217;</span></p>

I appreciate that represents a longer period of time.  While there were no findings of physical abuse directed towards B, she is no less affected than her brother as a result of the abuse that was directed towards him and to her mother, and of spending her early years in a domestically abusive household and subject to the emotional abuse of the stalking and harassment of her mother and carers that followed.  In addition, there are difficult issues to confront around identity as it was previously alleged that B was conceived as a result of the father raping the mother.  </span></p>

It would cause harm to both children if it were the case that after A&#8217;s sixteenth birthday, the father gained an unlimited right to apply to the Court in respect of B.  The restoration of his right to make an application to the Court should be assessed in all the circumstances that pertain at the time, with particular focus on the father and progress he has made.  It should not in my judgment arise simply because one or the other child has reached a particular age or stage of schooling.</span></p>

On the one hand, it would give them an opportunity to see the application that was being made, and to make representations to the Court on the question of whether or not permission should be given.  On the other hand, it would bring stress, anxiety and uncertainty which would affect her and the children.  On balance, [CD] would prefer not to be notified of any future applications before a decision has been made, and says she trusts the Court to make a decision about whether to give permission, without hearing from her or her husband at that stage.</span></p>
