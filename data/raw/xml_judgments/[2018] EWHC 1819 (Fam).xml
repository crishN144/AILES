	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> On 27 June 2018, I handed down a judgment following a fact-finding hearing in care proceedings concerning Z, a little girl now aged 22 months. On 16 August 2017, Z&#8217;s sister, X - then an eight-day old baby &#8211; collapsed at about 23.00 at the home she shared with her parents and sister and died at 00.06 on 17 August 2017. The cause of X&#8217;s death was severe brain and spinal injuries caused by a shaking injury with impact. Alongside these fatal injuries, X also sustained haemorrhaging to her eyes and bruising. Additionally, some 36 -72 hours before her death, X had also sustained head injuries, bruising and a metaphyseal fracture of her left femur.  On both occasions when she was injured, X was in the joint care of her mother, A, and her father, B. I found that X was injured by either her mother or her father on both occasions and, for the reasons set out in my companion judgment, I could not decide which of the two was responsible. Both her parents lied to me about what had happened in the family home to protect either themselves or the other parent.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact-finding hearing was beset by problems arising from the late disclosure of material held by Lancashire Constabulary [&#8220;the police&#8221;]. It was not evident until day five of the hearing that the police held material of potential relevance to the issues I had to determine. With the assistance of counsel and the officers assigned to the investigation into X&#8217;s death, the court was provided by day nine of the hearing with an additional 900 pages of material. The hearing itself was significantly extended by both the process of disclosure undertaken at court and by the need to allow counsel time to digest and take instructions on this material. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be obvious that the non-disclosure by the police of potentially relevant material could have both prejudiced the right of X&#8217;s parents to a fair hearing and deprived the court of information which might have shed light on what happened to X whilst in the care of her parents. That this could have happened in a case of such seriousness was bad enough but, in this case, the potential unfairness was magnified by the vulnerability of X&#8217;s mother who had been assessed as requiring the assistance of an intermediary throughout the hearing. Had it not been for the diligence of counsel and the time I allowed for instructions to be taken, the entire hearing might have been fundamentally compromised on fairness grounds. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the conclusion of the hearing, I directed that relevant orders and documents were to be disclosed to the police and invited them, together with the parties, to make submissions in writing (a) addressing what had gone wrong in this case and (b) making suggestions for how these problems might be avoided in the future. I have been provided with very helpful material from the local authority about its dealings with the police prior to and during the hearing, and with a statement from the Senior Investigating Officer [SIO]. I have received submissions in writing from the advocates and also from the SIO on behalf of the police. I indicated that I would give a judgment addressing the issue of police disclosure separate from my judgment determining facts in relation to the death of X. </p>

For family proceedings, it is governed by the Family Procedure Rules 2010 [&#8220;the FPR&#8221;] and the Protocol and it is reinforced by court orders on occasion. The criminal and family courts must be able to rely on assurances from the police that all relevant material has been disclosed. </p>

Within family proceedings, disclosure is taken to mean the production of copies of documents though this is, strictly speaking, a means of providing for the inspection of documents. Rule 21.1(1) of the FPR states that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">A party discloses a document by stating that the document exists or has existed</span>&#8221;. The next logical step in the process is the inspection of a document by a party when that document has been disclosed by another person [Rule 21.1(2)].  Thereafter, Rule 21.2 makes provision for orders for disclosure against persons who are not parties to the proceedings. The relevant provisions are as follows:</p>

One of the key objectives of the Protocol is to facilitate timely and consistent disclosure of information and documents from the police into the family justice system.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Alongside the Protocol, there is, in existence, a Lancashire Protocol relating to the disclosure of information to and from family proceedings dated May 2014. The parties to that protocol are the Designated Family Court Judge for Lancashire, the Crown Court resident judges, the Crown Prosecution Service, Lancashire Constabulary and the local authorities within Lancashire. This local Protocol was adopted by these agencies, as required by section 19 of the national Protocol. Its provisions mirror and, to some extent, build on the provisions of the national Protocol. Thus, paragraph 4.1 of the local Protocol requires the local authority, when seeking disclosure from the police, to state precisely what evidence and information is sought and, where appropriate, why it is relevant to the proceedings. Paragraph 4.2 reminds local authorities not to draw a request for disclosure any wider than is necessary and emphasises that requests or court orders should not be so broad as to ask for &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">any and all material from the police file</span>&#8221;.</p>

If the information sought relates to an ongoing inquiry/investigation, it is still expected that a &#8220;primary&#8221; disclosure of relevant material will be provided prior to any suspect being charged. The obligation to provide secondary disclosure of further relevant information will be ongoing. Finally, paragraph 2.5 of the local Protocol states that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">adherence to the procedures set out within this Protocol should ensure that ordinarily </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">it will not be necessary</span><span style="font-style:italic"> for a Court Order to be sought</span>&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Care proceedings in relation to Z were issued on 23 August 2017. The proceedings were urgent because the parents were on police bail with a condition that they should not have contact with Z save for that arranged by the local authority. On the same date the local authority solicitor sent the protocol form at Annex 1 of the local protocol (this form being similar to the Annex D form mentioned in the national Protocol). The form provided a brief summary of events giving rise to the proceedings and asked for the following information: (a) a PNC report for each parent; (b) all logs of incidents between the couple and/or referrals for domestic violence; (c) arrest sheets/charge sheets; (d) bail conditions; (e) any witness statements that would support domestic violence incidents; (f) post-mortem or extract of the same leading to arrest if available; and (g) witness statements regarding the arrest for murder if this would not be detrimental to the criminal investigation. Notwithstanding that request, the court made an order for disclosure on 25 August 2017, directing the police to provide to the local authority by 15 September 2017 all records and antecedents relating to the parents and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;all materials arising from its investigation into the death of [X]&#8221;</span>. The police were given permission to apply to the court to vary or discharge the order. I note that a police officer involved in the investigation attended court and was present during the hearing. The local authority solicitor emailed the police with details of the order on 30 August 2017 and also requested that she be informed of any difficulties with either the order or compliance with it. I observe that the order was drawn much wider than the initial Protocol request.</p>

Later that same day, the local authority suggested various amendments to the order dated 25 August 2017 and explained that the police had said they would not disclose all the information in their possession as it was feared this would jeopardise the criminal investigation. His Honour Judge Duggan, who made the order dated 25 August 2017, accepted the amendments sought to his order and commented in an email to the local authority that the order for police disclosure was to be complied with or was to be the subject of a reasoned police application. The chronologies provided to me do not clarify whether the judge&#8217;s comments were relayed either to the Detective Inspector/Detective Constable or to the SIO.</p>

On 13 September 2017, the Detective Inspector emailed the local authority explaining that, if more material was needed by the family court, the force solicitor would need to be instructed. The local authority solicitor responded that same day, stating that in her experience the court would be asking for <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;broader disclosure&#8221;</span> than had been provided thus far. She explained that, for example, photographs of the family home could be of great assistance since the conditions in the home might tell the court a great deal about life for the children. That email met with some success as the Detective Inspector indicated that photographs of the scene would be provided as soon as possible and also agreed to seek permission for the release of the recordings of the parents&#8217; interviews. His email said this:</p>

Following the hearing in September 2017, the police provided a large amount of redacted material to the local authority for onward disclosure to the other parties. At the hearing on 20 October 2017, the Detective Inspector attended and was represented by a solicitor. The police informed the court of the timetable for the filing of expert reports and, by a further order dated 25 October 2017, they were ordered to provide unredacted copies of the documents which had already been disclosed. </p>

The statement provided by the SIO recorded that, upon viewing the disclosure bundles provided to the local authority during the course of the investigation and comparing this to the volume of documentation recorded on the police case management system, it became apparent that there might be other documents that had some bearing or relevance to the proceedings that had not been disclosed. As a result of that review process undertaken by the police in conjunction with counsel, a significant amount of additional material was disclosed to the parties, that process being completed by day nine of the hearing.</p>

I observe that at no time prior to the hearing did Lancashire Constabulary notify the parties that there was further evidence which had not been disclosed because it was thought by the police to be irrelevant. Each tranche of disclosure which became available during the court hearing raised more questions leading to further enquiry being made and yet more disclosure following in consequence.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Much of what was disclosed was pertinent to the issues, such as the witness statement of the social worker who had concerns about the mother&#8217;s handling of Z and the statement from the maternal grandmother exhibiting a handwritten document dated 23 August 2017 containing the mother&#8217;s account of what was said to have taken place in the family home in the days prior to X being fatally injured. Additionally, a large tranche of material extracted from the parents&#8217; social media accounts was made available, which both confirmed existing witness evidence and shed light on the family dynamics before and after X&#8217;s death. I accept the submission by Miss Heaton QC that much of this material was greatly overshadowed in terms of significance by the late emergence of information about the clandestine resumption of the parents&#8217; relationship but, as she acknowledged, the situation might well have been otherwise. A crucial piece of evidence might have emerged at a very late stage, for example, which required further consideration by some of the experts and their recall to give additional oral evidence. The list of possibilities is infinitely varied. As it was, valuable court time over two if not three days was lost to the process of (a) checking and cross-checking what the police had which might be relevant and (b) taking instructions from clients.</p>

It also increased its resources within the Disclosure Team at Police Headquarters.

In 2017, training sessions were provided to staff within the Public Protection Unit, highlighting the guidance and procedures to be followed when matters came before the family court.

Serious and more complex investigations are managed by the Force Major Investigation Team which uses a different case management system known as HOLMES2. This is a Home Office system used by police forces nationally to manage complex and serious investigations to ensure that no lines of enquiry are missed. Within Lancashire Constabulary, the Disclosure Team did not have access to the HOLMES2 system and were thus unable to see the full list of material in the possession of the police relating to the death of X. The inability of the Disclosure Team to see the totality of the material possessed by the police was responsible for the inadequate disclosure received by the family court.</p>

These are training issues which need to be addressed. If this is not done, there is little prospect that, even with access to the correct data management system, disclosure officers will readily identify material relevant to family proceedings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This, in turn, gives rise to a more fundamental problem in respect of third-party disclosure from the police into the family court process. Simply put, disclosure is requested by those who don&#8217;t know what there is from those who don&#8217;t know what is needed. Thus, the parties to family proceedings don&#8217;t know what material is held by the police and so draft orders as widely as possible, imposing a significant burden on police disclosure officers. Conversely, the police have a poor understanding of the wide evidential canvas upon which the family court makes decisions and inevitably view the question of relevance through the narrow prism of criminal proceedings. In good faith the police provide what they think the family court needs but the reality is that they are ill placed to judge.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, it was also apparent that, notwithstanding the existence of the local and national Protocols, the family court made orders in the widest terms at the very outset of the proceedings. Paragraph 2.5 of the local Protocol, which expressed the hope that adherence to it would obviate the need for a court order, was simply ignored in this case. The national Protocol recognises that disclosure may take place via voluntary adherence to the Protocol but also accepts that orders for disclosure may sometimes be made. I do not know why immediate recourse was had to the making of a disclosure order, particularly in circumstances where the police confirmed at the hearing on 25 August 2017 that they would be in a position to provide disclosure within three weeks. My suspicion is that the making of an order in respect of police disclosure is seen as more likely to induce compliance on behalf of the police by requiring priority to be given to the disclosure task. If I am correct, this practice renders otiose those aspects of the local and national Protocols which suggest a voluntary route for disclosure into the family justice system (for example, paragraph 6 of the national Protocol). Whether or not a court order in every case requiring disclosure from the police is the correct course for the family court and the parties to family proceedings to implement - given that this undermines what the local Protocol intended to achieve and also cuts across the suggested voluntary disclosure route in the national Protocol - will be a matter for others to consider.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, what of the responsibilities of the parties to family proceedings? I have already acknowledged the significant burden on the local authority&#8217;s solicitor of liaison with the police about disclosure issues. In this case, the solicitor did remarkably well to obtain what was thought to be relevant at the time. However, one omission by the local authority was the failure to have a meeting with the police when this was requested on 19 March 2018. The purpose of that meeting was, in part, to ensure that the police had provided all the information the family court required. Such a meeting might have brought the existence of a large amount of undisclosed material to light though I note that even this might not have happened given that the Detective Inspector and his colleagues were unaware of the significance of the two separate data management systems being operated in this case.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other reason the existence of undisclosed material might not have been apparent is that the necessary forensic analysis of what had been disclosed was not carried out by the parties to these proceedings prior to the start of the fact-finding hearing. This might have made apparent some of the omissions in disclosure which emerged at the hearing itself. The current arrangements for public funding do not encourage advocates in the family justice system, who are often under considerable pressure, to analyse vast swathes of material in advance, for example, of a directions hearing. They simply do not get paid to do so. It is regrettably often only when the actual hearing is being prepared that anomalies in disclosure become obvious. To their credit, Miss Taylor QC and Mr Rothery both conceded that some of the evidential anomalies in this case would have been apparent from a close reading of the evidence as and when it was disclosed by the police.</p>

However, the applicant in public law proceedings - the local authority - must prove its case and, in so doing, must be alive to the strengths and weaknesses of all the evidence before the court. I regard that statement as supportive of the dicta of Ryder LJ in paragraph 36 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W (Care Proceedings: Functions of the court and the local authority)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1227" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1227" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1227</ref> namely, that proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> are quasi inquisitorial in that the judge has to decide both whether threshold is crossed and the basis upon which that is so, whether or not the local authority or any other party agrees. It seems to me obvious that a local authority, with the greater resources available to it, will bear the lion&#8217;s share of the burden of assisting the court to determine not only its application but also any other pertinent issues in a case. It does so by ensuring that the evidence - from whatever source - is complete and in order and it takes the lead in ensuring that case management directions have been complied with. For a local authority to act in that impartial manner in public law proceedings is to facilitate the court&#8217;s quasi inquisitorial role in a process which is fair to all parties. In saying this, I make it plain that the other parties to proceedings are not absolved from their duties to cooperate with the court and comply with the court&#8217;s directions. Rather, the onus on the local authority, as the state agent in care proceedings, to conduct itself fairly and to assist the court is necessarily greater. </p>

If it be thought that all the local authority requires from the police is material that will assist its case, that would represent a profound misunderstanding of the local authority&#8217;s duties to the court. </p>

The local authority should not content itself with disclosing the documents which support its case but must consider itself under a duty to disclose in the interests of the child and of justice documents which may modify or cast doubt on its case. The particular concern should relate to those documents which actually help the case of an opposing party. If there is any doubt about whether the information is relevant, consideration should be given to notifying the affected parties of the existence of the material. Whilst the temptation to invite costly, intrusive and pointless fishing expeditions should be avoided, there should be a presumption in favour of disclosure of potentially helpful information. If documents are obviously relevant and not protected from disclosure by public interest immunity, then the local authority should initiate disclosure.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The schedule suggested at (iv) above should, in practice, not be difficult to produce. During the course of the hearing in this case, I was provided with a number of schedules of the evidence in the possession of the police taken from both of the data management systems in operation in this case [Connect and HOLMES2].  I suggest that such a schedule should be provided 2 clear working days before the case management hearing to allow the parties to consider its contents. Though Francis J suggested that the schedule should be limited to the evidence and material relevant to the central issues in the family case, I have already commented that the police are ill-placed to judge what might be relevant. In my view, the schedule should contain all evidence and material in the possession of the police at that time. There should be no obligation on the police to produce any of this evidence/material for inspection until either agreement is reached between the parties and the police as to what is relevant or the court has ruled on the matter. That approach &#8211; whilst wide in initial scope &#8211; accords with FPR Rule 21.1(1) and Rule 21.1(2).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It may be a matter for consideration whether the court orders, at the case management hearing, the disclosure of <span style="font-weight:bold">all</span> relevant evidence and/or material in the possession of the police. This places the police under an ongoing duty to give effect to that order and promotes liaison with the local authority, in the first instance, since it is the party with the primary responsibility of getting the family case ready for a fact-finding hearing or a final determination. Though this proposal does not accord with the appropriately focussed application for disclosure commended in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H-L (A Child)</span> [see paragraph 12 above], it tackles the obvious problem I identified in paragraph 36, namely that the parties to the proceedings do not know what the police possess. However, I recognise that this suggestion is at odds with the provisions of both the national and local Protocols.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At (vii) the need for ongoing liaison between the local authority and the police was stressed. I agree this is vital and suggest &#8211; as does Francis J at (viii) - that the police should, in any event, produce an updating schedule of evidence/material 14 days before the IRH or directions hearing before any fact-finding hearing. This should be circulated to the parties and should identify: (a) what has been disclosed; (b) what has been deemed to be irrelevant; (c) anything which the court has ruled should not be disclosed; and (d) any new material or evidence and whether disclosure is opposed in relation to each piece of new evidence and, if so, on what basis. Having seen this schedule, the parties should let the local authority know what they consider to be relevant and, if there is agreement about this, the police should disclose the information to the local authority for onward transmission to the parties without delay. If disclosure is resisted, the police should make an application to the court.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An additional step which should take place 5 days prior to any IRH or directions hearing before a fact-finding hearing is for a meeting to take place between the local authority solicitor (with preferably the advocate conducting the local authority&#8217;s case) and the police disclosure team. The purpose of that meeting should be to check that the police disclosure is complete and to provide an update to the family court as to the progress of the criminal investigation and the prospect of charge and/or criminal trial. It is not primarily a meeting to provide to the police information about the family proceedings and I suggest that the parties must agree prior to this meeting what the police are to know about the family proceedings. This meeting should be authorised by the court as part of the directions at the case management hearing. If that meeting is unnecessary because full police disclosure has taken place, it can be cancelled with the agreement of the other parties to the proceedings. The meeting should be recorded in the interests of transparency.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ideally, such a meeting should involve all the parties to the proceedings, but I recognise that those advocates who are publicly funded will be unable to claim payment to attend. In those circumstances, the safeguards I have proposed &#8211; such as agreement as to what can be said to the police about the family proceedings and recording the meeting so as not to compromise the advocates acting for the local authority &#8211; should be adequate to ensure that the process of police disclosure remains fair and transparent. It follows that, in preparing for this meeting, the local authority should be mindful of its duties to ensure that full disclosure of relevant material takes place even if it considers that a particular piece of evidence requested on behalf of a parent is of little evidential value. It should come to the meeting having read and considered what has already been disclosed and having identified any anomalies or problems in the police disclosure. </p>
