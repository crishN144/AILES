In the following month, she gave birth to a baby girl (&#8220;LM&#8221;).  LM is the mother&#8217;s fourth child.  The mother&#8217;s older three children have been the subject of public law proceedings in this country, and are subject to public law final orders, all in kinship placements away from the mother.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment further serves to highlight how futile, and potentially damaging to the infant child, was the course which the parents embarked upon in June 2012.  I am advised that there are other parents who have considered leaving this jurisdiction (and indeed been advised by campaigning groups to do so, as the mother indicated she had been) to avoid public authority intervention in their lives, and to achieve some juridical advantage through process in the Irish Courts.  Quite apart from the fact that the parents themselves in this case apparently soon came to realise that this was not a good solution for LM or themselves, this judgment will underline how effectively the Courts of England and Wales and the Courts in Ireland, and the public authorities in each State, are able to co-operate to achieve the transfer of a child, and the public law proceedings concerning that child under the Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2003 (hereafter &#8216;BIIR&#8217;), where it is demonstrated to be in the interests of the child to do so.  The approach of the English Courts and the Irish Courts appears to be similar; the Irish Constitution exhibits no intention to establish Ireland as a sanctuary for families from other jurisdictions: see the Irish Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Nottinghamshire County Council v B </span>[2011] IESC 48 (at paragraph 72, per O&#8217;Donnell J.).</p>

An on-notice hearing took place on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012 and an interim care order was made by the Cavan District Court under section 17(1) of the Child Care Act 1991;  that order was expressed to run until 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2012, and it has subsequently been renewed by further orders made by that court.  Within the Irish proceedings, social work and forensic psychological assessments have been undertaken of the mother and the father, and a psychiatric assessment of the mother; LM had been represented by a Guardian ad Litem.  Unsurprisingly, at an early stage of the proceedings, the HSE made enquiries of X County Council to explore the possibility of LM being placed in the area of X County Council.  </p>

I note the mother&#8217;s position in this regard and discuss it further below.  That her acceptance of transfer is said to be conditional on the identification of a specific local authority as applicant in this country is of no real consequence, given that effective transfer relies on &#8216;acceptance&#8217; by one party only to the Irish proceedings; in the instant case, the HSE has indicated its unconditional acceptance. </p>

However, a question arises whether the function of a court in the requested State determining a &#8216;transfer request&#8217; is limited to a consideration of &#8220;best interests&#8221; only, or whether the court has a wider remit to review for itself all of the criteria for transfer.  In considering this question, I must be careful not to arrogate to myself a function properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the foreign court:  see Munby J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">AB v JLB (Brussels II Revised) </span>[2009] 1 FLR 517.  </p>

Article 15(1) appears to contemplate that it is in the courts of the Member State having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter, requesting transfer, that the question of whether the child has a &#8220;particular connection&#8221; with the court of another Member State which would be &#8220;better placed to hear the case&#8221; should be considered.  The role of the court of the requested State appears, by Article 15(5), to be limited to a consideration of &#8220;best interests&#8221; having regard to &#8220;the specific circumstances of the case&#8221;; the &#8220;best interests&#8221; evaluation will necessarily not be as profound as on a full hearing of an application for substantive relief with the benefit of the full evidence.  While not relevant for my determination on these facts, if a court of a requested State considered that, contrary to the determination of the requesting State, the child did not in fact have a &#8220;particular connection&#8221; with the requested State in accordance with Article 15(3), and/or that the court of the requested State was not in fact &#8220;better placed to hear the case&#8221;, it would surely reasonably easily reach the conclusion that it was not in the &#8220;best interests&#8221; of the child to accept the request for transfer, and would therefore decline it.</p>

In this case I welcome the willingness of the two local authorities to accept the nomination of relevant local authority within this process; additional hurdles would need to have been overcome had there not been this level of co-operation, given the limits of the court&#8217;s powers to make a care order in the absence of an application, and/or to require a local authority to take proceedings: see on these points <span style="font-style:italic">Nottinghamshire County Council v P</span> [1994] Fam 18, and <span style="font-style:italic">R v East Sussex CC ex parte W</span> [1998] 2 FLR 1082 (though see Ward LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D (A child)(Care Order: Designated Local Authority)</span> [2012] EWCA Civ 627, [2012] 3 WLR 1648 at paragraph 20, referred to further, below).</p>

For a very short time following her birth, and before her reception into the care of HSE, LM would have to have been regarded as &#8220;ordinarily resident&#8221; in Cavan, Ireland, where the mother was arguable ordinarily resident at the time of LM&#8217;s birth.  If so, then section 31(8)(a) is discounted and we revert to section 31(8)(b) as before.</p>

It is notable in this respect that the factors adumbrated in paragraph 9 of the &#8220;Norfolk&#8221; judgment (see p.537) as tending to show an ordinary residence in that county were held in the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 13, p.538) to be insufficient to classify this as an exceptional case justifying a departure of the simple test identified in the earlier decisions of the Court of Appeal.  On the facts of the instant case, the factors pointing towards ordinary residence in the area of Y County Council do not, when taken in combination, permit me to conclude that this case comes anywhere near the test of &#8220;exceptionality&#8221;;</p>

In her submissions, the mother broadly acknowledged these mis-representations.  The mother only has temporary accommodation in the area of Y County Council (she was described on the form as &#8220;staying on the sofa&#8221; with friends).  Moreover, she has an obvious and admitted record of &#8220;tactical&#8221; moves of home, and, had I been required to make a determination of the facts in this respect, I am not at all sure that I could have concluded that she is in fact &#8220;ordinarily resident&#8221; in the area of Y County Council in any event.  </p>

In my judgment, it is preferable for the courts of the Member State having jurisdiction as to the substance of the proceedings concerning LM to oversee the transfer arrangements (Article 15) rather than by exercising powers under Article 20 with the Regulation jurisdiction vested in this Court.  That said, I contemplate that the jurisdiction of the Irish Court will cease upon LM&#8217;s physical move to this jurisdiction, and the parental responsibility held by HSE will, I propose, be deemed to come to an end at the commencement of the directions hearing which I have directed pursuant to Rule 12.66(3) of the FPR 2010, as discussed above (see paragraph 44(2)).  As soon as the Irish Court has indicated its intention to effect the transfer, I invite the HSE to notify my clerk and I will fix the date of the hearing;  on that date, I will consider all applications for interim orders.  </p>

I would like to observe that there has been a good degree of co-operation between the Irish and English authorities in pursuit of an outcome which will promote the best interests of the infant child LM.  That co-operation has been significantly enhanced by the assistance offered to this court by the HSE which has co-ordinated and presented material to facilitate the speedy and informed resolution of this application.  The HSE still has an important role to play in achieving the transition of LM, and these proceedings, to this jurisdiction, but as indicated above its role will cease at the very point at which I next have cause to consider the application.  In the circumstances I wish to extend the gratitude of this court to the HSE, and those whom they instructed for the purposes of this transfer request hearing.  </p>
