Thus, in Bell v Kennedy (1868) LR 1 Sc and Div 307, 311, Lord Cairns, having held that it was unnecessary for him to examine the various definitions that have been given of the term "domicile", held that the question to be considered was in substance whether the appellant:</span></p>

All these cases turn on their own facts. In Irvin, the husband was found to have a resolve to return to this country to retire, as evidenced in part by his acquisition of a property in Brighton and his plan to return to a business consultancy there on retirement.

Moving to England to bring up your children is not of itself sufficient to result in the acquisition of a domicile of choice here. On the facts, however, Furse supports the wife&#8217;s contentions as it was held that the testator had acquired a domicile of choice in England because he intended to continue to live here on a farm so long as he was able to lead an active life. His intention to return to the USA if he could not do so was only on a vague and indefinite contingency.

In my judgment the return to the European Country in summer 2022 was meant to be for good.
