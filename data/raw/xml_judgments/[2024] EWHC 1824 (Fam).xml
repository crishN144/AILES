	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an appeal under Part 30 of the FPR 2010 (&#8220;the Rules&#8221;) against an order made by HHJ Cox sitting in the Central Family Court in private law proceedings which concluded with a judgment given on 10 November 2023.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Those private law proceedings relate to the children of the parties&#8217; marriage. There are two children. They are both of primary school age. Both attend a private school close to their home. The Appellant is their mother. The Respondent is their father. Both parties are in their forties. Both work and have careers. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties were married but separated in 2021 when the Appellant was forced to flee the family home. The Respondent's behaviour that day has rightly been described as extremely unpleasant and frightening. The evening before separation, the Respondent was verbally abusive. He took one of the children from the Appellant's room and locked them in the room with him causing significant distress to that child, before eventually allowing them to run back to the Appellant, shaking in fear. The Appellant had to lock herself and the children into her bedroom whilst the Respondent banged on the bedroom door. They were all terrified. Some of these events were witnessed by the maternal grandmother who was advised by the Appellant to leave the home, and she did. The next day, when the Appellant tried to leave with the children, the Respondent refused to allow them to do so, before eventually relenting, allowing them to leave.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent&#8217;s behaviour on that occasion was the final act of a pattern of angry, abusive and controlling behaviours. In her C1A the Appellant provided a schedule of 40 allegations which span almost the entirety of the marriage. They have been formally admitted by the Respondent. They are too numerous to set out in full in this judgment. However, they can be characterised as falling into five interlinked themes, namely:</p>

It was necessary for the Respondent&#8217;s contact with the children to be supervised for 19 months whilst he took anger management and domestic abuse courses to address those issues. Thereafter contact gradually increased and became less restricted. By the time of the hearing before HHJ Cox the children were having a mixture of staying and visiting contact with the Respondent. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Ground </span>1: The learned Judge failed in breach of strong guidelines in PD12J paragraphs 36-37 to give any or any sufficient weight to the impact of past and ongoing domestic abuse by the Respondent upon the Appellant&#8217;s mental health and well-being.  </p>
	    </content>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Ground 2</span>: The court placed too much emphasis on its perception of the Appellant&#8217;s resilience and the notion that therapy would be likely in the future to alleviate her symptoms.  </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Ground 3</span>: The court underestimated the Respondent&#8217;s propensity for angry outbursts despite evidence of his behaviours within the past few months when he was unable to shield the Appellant from the anger and resentment that he felt towards her. The court assessed the principal cause of the abuse as the parental relationship rather than the Respondent&#8217;s propensity for uncontrolled anger which would expose the children to an unreasonably high risk. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Ground 5</span>: The learned judge gave too little weight to the evidence that in her chosen location the Appellant would have family support whilst she would have none in London and was feeling lonely and depressed. </p>

The fresh evidence she wished me to admit is in a short witness statement which she has filed and is in the bundle before me.  It is said on the face of the notice to update the court on the relevant facts. By its very nature it is evidence which could not with reasonable diligence have been obtained for use at the trial.  The Appellant submitted that if admitted the evidence would probably have an important influence on the results of the case. The Appellant argued the evidence was clearly relevant because it shows the judge was wrong in her assessment of the impact on the children of the abuse and the emotional and financial impact of refusing permission to relocate. </p>

Within that document, he argued against remission and submitted that the last thing that was needed in this case was further litigation. His then position was that a rehearing would be financially ruinous to the parties and lead to considerable uncertainty for the parties and the children.

The written evidence before her was in the region of 2000 pages. She heard evidence from the parties and two Independent Social Workers. She had the benefit of written and oral advocacy on behalf of both parties from leading silks. This court does not have the benefit of transcripts of the oral evidence HHJ Cox heard. The judgment was truly extempore being given at the conclusion of the hearing. It is argued on behalf of the Respondent that given the judgment under consideration here was an extempore judgment, there will be points of detail which are missing from the judgment but that does not justify interference. HHJ Cox was entitled to make the evaluation she did and reach the conclusions she did. This was a balanced judgment. A reading of the judgment plainly shows that HHJ Cox did properly consider the impact of the domestic abuse on the Appellant.

The task facing a judge is not to pass an examination, or to prepare a detailed legal or factual analysis of all the evidence and submissions he has heard. Essentially, the judicial task is twofold: to enable the parties to understand why they have won or lost; and to provide sufficient detail and analysis to enable an appellate court to decide whether or not the judgment is sustainable. The judge need not slavishly restate either the facts, the arguments or the law. To adopt the striking metaphor of Mostyn J in SP v EB and KP [2014] EWHC 3964 (Fam), [2016] 1 FLR 228, para 29, there is no need for the judge to "incant mechanically" passages from the authorities, the evidence or the submissions, as if he were "a pilot going through the pre-flight checklist." </span></p>

I confine myself to one short passage (at 1372): &#8220;The exigencies of daily court room life are such that reasons for judgment will always be capable of having been better expressed. This is particularly true of an unreserved judgment such as the judge gave in this case &#8230; These reasons should be read on the assumption that, unless he has demonstrated the contrary, the judge knew how he should perform his functions and which matters he should take into account. This is particularly true when the matters in question are so well known as those specified in section 25(2) [of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]. An appellate court should resist the temptation to subvert the principle that they should not substitute their own discretion for that of the judge by a narrow textual analysis which enables them to claim that he misdirected himself."  It is not the function of an appellate court to strive by tortuous mental gymnastics to find error in the decision under review when in truth there has been none.

It is the first and last night of the show. iii) Duplication of the trial judge's role on appeal is a disproportionate use of the limited resources of an appellate court, and will seldom lead to a different outcome in an individual case. iv) In making his decisions the trial judge will have regard to the whole of the sea of evidence presented to him, whereas an appellate court will only be island hopping. v) The atmosphere of the courtroom cannot, in any event, be recreated by reference to documents (including transcripts of evidence). vi) Thus even if it were possible to duplicate the role of the trial judge, it cannot in practice be done. </span></p>

They need not be elaborate. There is no duty on a judge, in giving his reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his case.

In brief there were two overlapping reasons, namely (i) the emotional toll upon her of the abuse she had suffered in the relationship and (ii) the need to be nearer family and friends in her home area who can provide her with emotional and physical support and enable her to gain greater financial and emotional independence. The Appellant&#8217;s case was that that would provide the children with a better quality of life. The Respondent saw the desire to relocate differently, he saw it as based on the Appellant&#8217;s perceived needs and a desire to &#8220;whitewash&#8221; him from the children&#8217;s lives.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At paragraph 47 of her judgment HHJ Cox begins her analysis of the evidence in earnest. She starts with a consideration of the parties&#8217; financial positions and how that impacts on the children&#8217;s welfare and their parents&#8217; respective proposals for them. It was part of the Appellant&#8217;s case that the relocation she proposed was, from her perspective, a financial necessity and that &#8220;huge upheaval&#8221; cannot be avoided in this case because of the parties&#8217; financial circumstances. The Respondent was more optimistic about his finances. In essence, at paragraph 53 of her judgment, HHJ Cox considered the Respondent&#8217;s propositions about his past two years finances were reasonable and although she made no hard finding at this point in her judgment, she appears to have accepted his more optimistic outlook. HHJ Cox returned to the parties&#8217; finances at paragraph 106 and found that the Appellant&#8217;s pessimistic financial overview was not made out to the requisite standard.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At paragraph 55 of her judgment, HHJ Cox began to examine the parties&#8217; respective proposals and the issues of domestic abuse through consideration of Practice Direction 12J, the welfare checklist and the evaluation of the children&#8217;s welfare by the Independent Social Workers. In doing so she considered the wishes and feelings of the children as captured by the Independent Social Workers. The children, she found were well attached to each parent. They are happy and relaxed and at ease in each parent&#8217;s home. At paragraph 59 she said this:</p>

They would miss their school and their friends. She would feel hopeless if their father did not relocate with them. The younger child appeared angry at the thought of having to move without their father. At paragraph 67, the learned judge records that when the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings were put to the Appellant in evidence, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">she became visibly distressed and said the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings were obviously important to her, but that they did not understand the reality of the situation facing the family and that she could not explain it to them. By that, I understood her to be referring to her feelings of being powerless in the face of what she perceives as a financially unstable situation and of being controlled both financially and in terms of the continuing conflict between herself and the children&#8217;s father which she perceives, still, as being critical and abusive</span>&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I begin with paragraphs 8-10 of the judgment wherein HHJ Cox sets out the Appellant&#8217;s case and her emotional needs to distance herself from the Respondent and her need to be surrounded by the emotional support of her family. At paragraph 15 -16 she sets out the abuse the Respondent has inflicted on the Appellant and the children in the past. At paragraph 36 of her judgment, HHJ Cox finds that it is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">probable that the father&#8217;s behaviour as described and admitted in this case is best described as psychological, emotional or other abuse and threatening behaviour</span>&#8221;. At paragraph 67 of the judgment, HHJ Cox sets out her understanding that the Appellant feels powerless in terms of the financially unstable situation and being controlled both financially and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">in terms of the continuing conflict between herself and the children&#8217;s father which she perceives, still as being critical and abusive</span>&#8221;.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>At paragraphs 68 and 72 of her judgment, the learned judge finds that the parents are &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">largely and</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">in so far as they are able protecting</span>&#8221; the children from the continuing conflict between them. At paragraphs 82-85 of her judgment HHJ Cox considers the impact of the abuse upon the children in terms of their relationship with their father and the future risk he poses to them. At paragraph 84 of her judgment, HHJ Cox makes her findings in relation to the Respondent&#8217;s recent conduct. Those findings are set out in this judgment above. They have not been appealed.  However, nowhere in that paragraph of her judgment nor in the preceding paragraphs does HHJ Cox consider the impact of (i) the past domestic abuse and (ii) that found to have occurred in 2023, on the Appellant and her ability to care for the children. Instead at paragraph 88, she considers the impact of the abuse from the perspective of the Appellant&#8217;s ability to promote the children&#8217;s relationship with their father. At paragraph 90 HHJ Cox finds that the Respondent is not using the process to further the abuse nor is he motivated to do so and at paragraph 91 she finds that the Appellant&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">evaluation of his </span>[the Respondent&#8217;s]<span style="font-style:italic"> parenting capabilities is predicated by her experience of domestic abuse rather than the children&#8217;s experiences of him as a father</span>&#8221;.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>In this regard, HHJ Cox considered the Appellant&#8217;s perception of the Respondent&#8217;s parenting capabilities needs within paragraph 92. At paragraph 94, HHJ Cox then stated the following:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">In the future the children are likely to continue to suffer harm if mistrust and poor communication between the parents continues. I consider it will be of assistance if the children&#8217;s mother is able to undertake some therapeutic work in order to come to terms with the emotionally damaging experience that she has lived through and the domestic abuse she has suffered. It is not for her to mend herself because she has been abused, but the effects of trauma need to be ameliorated for her by learning how to manage its negative effects. It is a question of health rather than addressing harm which has been caused by someone else</span>.&#8221;</p>

I am aware that she is taking antidepressant medication, but I am not aware of any specific evidence that would demonstrate that she will not be able to manage her disappointment to continue to provide the excellent quality of care that she affords her daughters in every aspect of her parenting. I sincerely hope that the father will not see this decision as a demonstration that his assertions and criticisms of the mother during the course of these proceedings are justified. They are not. The mother had every reason to be cautious about the way in which the children began to rebuild their relationship with him and he still has work to do in management of the way in which he treats the mother of his children which should be with respect, courtesy and tact rather than with impatience, frustration and criticism which have all too often featured in his communications with her.</span>&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Standing back and looking at the judgment, I consider HHJ Cox fell into error when considering the issue of the effect of the domestic abuse on the Appellant. She considered it in the context of the Appellant&#8217;s ability to promote the children&#8217;s relationship with the Respondent. However, she did not consider the direct and continuing impact it was having on the Appellant herself despite the Appellant having displayed her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">hopelessness</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>in the witness box. She did not consider the likely indirect impact on the children if their mother continued to feel controlled and hopeless.  The learned judge considered whether the Appellant could manage her disappointment but did not consider, as in my judgment she ought, that the impact on the Appellant of not relocating might be greater than mere disappointment. There was no evidence that any therapeutic work the Appellant might be willing to undertake would have an effect or, at least, an impact in the timescales for these children. In the circumstances, I have decided that Grounds 1 and 2 are made out. I also consider Ground 5 is made out. The learned Judge considered the support the Appellant had in London in terms of friends or colleagues but failed to take into account that the support of friends etc may not meet the need of the Appellant  given the abuse she had suffered .The support of friends and colleagues, however close, sometimes just is not the same as that which family members can provide, especially in terms of emotional support. On those grounds, I find that the decision of HHJ Cox was wrong and cannot stand. There is thus no need to consider the other grounds of appeal. The appeal is allowed and paragraph 2 of the order of HHJ Cox is set aside as is paragraph 3 in part, namely paragraphs 7- 9 (which were stayed by Mr Justice Moor). </p>
