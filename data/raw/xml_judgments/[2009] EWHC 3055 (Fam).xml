N is a young boy who has two parents who love him but who have demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to put his needs first and who as a result of their relentless pursuit of their own agendas have caused him emotional harm and arguably that emotional harm is significant. This situation cannot be permitted to continue. The parents need to stop trying to score points against each other and examine instead their own actions to ensure that N and his needs are put first.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;She has in mind N&#8217;s oft stated desire for the litigation to come to an end so that he is not the focus of dispute between his parents. In her view, continuing litigation by either parent can only be detrimental to his welfare. There is no benefit to N in continuing litigation. On the contrary, she is clear that his welfare is being damaged by the on-going acrimony and the consequent stress and anxiety that the litigation causes to his parents. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">For that reason the guardian would suggest that now is an appropriate time for a section 91(14) order to be made, and for at least two years, this being, she says, &#8220;essential&#8221; to N&#8217;s future well-being. This will give N and his parents a breathing space to focus and concentrate on making the agreed arrangements set out in the consent order work, without the anxiety of ongoing proceedings or the constant stress of the threat of further litigation, and to focus and concentrate on making the time that N spends with each parent as enjoyable and stress free as possible. </p>

Ms JJ&#8217;s concerns about the parents, in the context of this &#8220;highly antagonistic litigation&#8221; having the capacity to undermine N&#8217;s wellbeing, were such that she was even considering whether the case was more appropriately a public law case.&#8221;</p>

His reaction to the guardian&#8217;s wise words, and the tone in which he chooses to present his most recent submissions &#8230; is a depressing and revealing commentary on his whole approach. Not merely, and most importantly, on his continuing failure to prioritise N&#8217;s welfare over his (the father&#8217;s) animus against both the mother and the guardian &#8211; indeed his animus against anyone who does not agree with him &#8211; but also on his relentless determination to pursue the litigation, as long as it takes, and by pressing every point, however trivial, technical or pettifogging, until he eventually has his way.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220; &#8230; it is high time that these parents &#8211; <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> of them &#8211; began to take several <span style="font-style:italic">and joint</span> responsibility as parents for N&#8217;s future. Parental responsibility, as defined in section 3 of the 1989 Act is not merely a platform for litigation, let alone for endless applications to the court of the kind pursued so relentlessly and for so long by the father. It is &#8220;all the rights, <span style="font-style:italic">duties</span>, powers, <span style="font-style:italic">responsibility</span> and authority&#8221; (emphasis added) which by law &#8230; a parent has in relation to their child. These parents &#8211; the father in particular &#8211; need to shoulder the burden of their parental duties and parental responsibilities. They have an obligation &#8211; a moral and parental obligation; not merely a legal obligation &#8211; to their son (never mind their obligation to the court) to discuss between themselves and to decide how he is to live and how he is to be brought up. They merely abdicate that responsibility if they come to court, particularly in relation to matters as comparatively trivial as some of those on the father&#8217;s list. And what do they imagine their son thinks of them, what do they imagine their son will think of them in future, as a teenager and later as an adult? </p>
		  </content>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; the more the court is drawn into the process of imposing solutions which the parents are unwilling or unable to agree themselves, especially the more trivial the issues to be resolved, the more impotent the parents will become in arriving at their own solutions, the more they will come to rely upon the court as a crutch, as a provider of answers to any and every question, however trivial. Far from encouraging them to assume the <span style="font-style:italic">parental</span> responsibilities which nature and the law have imposed upon them, and them alone, the court if it allows itself to be cajoled down this road will simply be encouraging them to avoid, indeed to shirk, their responsibilities. And how long is this process to continue? N is only a little over 8 years old. Is the court to remain involved until he is 16 or 18? Certainly not! </p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; there is the effect of all this on N. I need not repeat what the guardian has repeatedly, insistently and correctly said. Unless the court now disengages, and, more importantly, unless his parents now buckle down to the twin tasks of making the consent order work and, where appropriate, of giving it the necessary consensual &#8216;tweaking&#8217;, the future for N will, I fear, be bleak. For unless the parents do now buckle down, unless the court declines &#8211; resolutely and with immediate effect &#8211; to arbitrate where the parents refuse to agree, even though they can and should be able to agree, the process will continue until N simply &#8216;votes with his feet&#8217;, perhaps, and worst of all, until he abandons them both, pronouncing a &#8216;plague on both your houses.&#8217;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">There must be an end to this and the time is now ripe &#8211; some might think over-ripe &#8211; for that step to be taken and for the court to decline to adjudicate further on these issues. In my judgment I would be failing in my duty were I to tolerate the further procrastination which will be the inevitable consequence of a failure on my part to act decisively &#8211; and to do so here and now.&#8221;</p>

It is hard to see any necessity for an order beyond 4 years; however, with the Bar Mitzvah imminent in March 2014 (not May 2013) and bearing in mind [the mother&#8217;s] usual wrecking approach it might well be desirable to leave open the option of an application being made after November 2013, in N&#8217;s own interests.

The mother responded by indicating that she would agree a shorter period but would like that period to be of 4 and half years which would take N beyond his Bar Mitzvah. At the same time the father renewed his request for a 2 year period because of concerns he had about the fact the mother has now moved into her own accommodation with N.

The Guardian does not agree to a shorter order because she has made it plain that these proceedings need to end and that  both parents need to commit their energies to making the order of July 2008 work effectively. A period of time when either parent will need permission from the court to issue any further applications will give N the respite he wants and she remains of the view that the 4 years she has proposed is reasonable.  She does not accept either that a period of over 4 years is necessary. In her view, N will meet highly significant stages in his life at regular intervals and the parents will have to work together to reach agreement where necessary. She hopes that the provisions already made in the order to cover N&#8217;s Bar Mitzvah will cover this event.</p>

It seems absurd to have to hold a hearing on this; I see no reason why it cannot now be settled on paper, say with all Parties being allowed to make any further submissions on the point by email, up to Monday 4pm. I have discussed this with [the father] and he agrees it&#8217;s a reasonable way forward, and is content to let your Lordship decide on the basis of all submissions you have received in writing as at 4pm Monday.</p>

The stances are not the same of course but so what? &#8211; it&#8217;s perfectly normal in any kind of civil litigation, including family law cases, for a party&#8217;s contested trial stance to be different from what they are willing to accept in negotiations on a consent basis, thereby avoiding the burden of a trial and the risk of doing worse. Of course, negotiations in such case are often conducted, partly to avoid weakening one&#8217;s contested trial case, on a &#8220;without prejudice&#8221; basis &#8211; but [the father] has deliberately avoided that, considering with me that an agreement was more like to come with open proposals that could be put before your Lordship, and thus allow for your Lordship&#8217;s own input, from the beginning.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It will also be said that [the father] cannot both say he will never apply and that he might need to apply in relation to the Bar Mitzvah, for fear of [the mother] spoiling that occasion. That is a fair observation: the answer is that the Bar Mitzvah is of such fundamental importance to his son&#8217;s life in Jewish custom and tradition, that he could not risk anything affecting it adversely, even if that meant having to apply to the court as a last resort. It is the one thing not negotiable and the one thing for which he would apply. Of course, we all hope that no necessity would arise. It is submitted that this being such an important milestone in N&#8217;s life, there should not be a fetter on applying in relation to it, if need arose (and applying on short notice, which a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 91(14)</ref> bar could delay, if circumstances warranted). [The father] is suspicious about [the mother]&#8217;s motive in trying to extend the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 91(14)</ref> period beyond the Bar Mitzvah.

In this case for once the Guardian and Father are now at one; in my respectful submission [the mother] has not provided any good reason, or reason at all, for the Court to depart from the Guardian&#8217;s position, and I would ask your Lordship to make the order accordingly.</p>

Even assuming that the words were genuinely meant by the father at the point when he authorised Dr Pelling to put them forward on his behalf, I can have not the slightest confidence that on some future occasion, when it suits him, the father will not repudiate them. Thus far, my view as matters stood on 16 November 2009. But the second point, of course, is that made by Mr Holden in paragraph 6 of his email of 19 November 2009, a point to which Dr Pelling had no effective answer. Indeed, in his response to what Mr Holden had said, Dr Pelling, as we have seen, acknowledged that there might be circumstances in which the father would apply to the court in relation to N&#8217;s Bar Mitzvah &#8211; an acknowledgement that simply cannot be squared with the father&#8217;s previous unequivocal and unqualified statements that he &#8220;will not be making any further private law applications or having any further involvement in private law proceedings concerning his son&#8221; and that he &#8220;has quit a corrupted system and will have nothing more to do with it, permanently.&#8221;  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In the first place, the mere fact that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> order I am making is time limited to a period of four years does <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>mean that I am accepting that there will, either at the expiry of that period or at any time thereafter, be any justification for either parent making any application to the court. Quite the contrary. I repeat what I said on an earlier occasion as set out in paragraph [6] above. And I endorse the guardian&#8217;s observation in the last paragraph of the email of 19 November 2009 quoted in paragraph [21] above. Any future application by either parent must be justified, and the mere fact that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> order may have ceased to bite is not, cannot of itself be, any justification for a further application.</p>

Whilst the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> order remains in force no application can be made without the prior consent of the court. But even after the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> order has ceased to bite the court will, of course, still be able to exercise the powers which I analysed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re N, A v G and N </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2009/1807" uk:canonical="[2009] EWHC 1807 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWHC 1807 (Fam)</ref>, [2010] 1 FLR xxx, at paras [219]-[234] &#8211; in particular, the power of summary dismissal of an application which is unmeritorious or the pursuit of which is not in the child&#8217;s best interests. Given the history of the litigation to date I anticipate that any judge in future, even if the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> order has expired, will wish to scrutinise with an appropriately questioning and sceptical eye any application by either parent which is not securely founded on some <span style="font-style:italic">really material </span>change of circumstance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, both parents would do well to bear in mind the limited ability of the court to resolve parental disputes as to the arrangements for a Bar Mitzvah: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (Maintenance Pending Suit) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/1834" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 1834 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 1834 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 1674" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 1674</ref>, at paras [34]-[35]. And in any event, such profoundly important <span style="font-style:italic">religious </span>matters are surely far better resolved within the community, if need be with the assistance of the parties&#8217; religious and other advisers, than by a secular court. I would be very disappointed indeed were I to learn that some dispute about N&#8217;s Bar Mitzvah had become, for whatever reason, the occasion or the excuse for further litigation. And N would surely be more than disappointed &#8211; he is likely to feel embarrassed, perhaps even angry and humiliated &#8211; if it becomes apparent to him that his parents are not able to agree even on that.</p>
