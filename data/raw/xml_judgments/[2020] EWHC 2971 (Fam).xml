He also says that he further consented to the mother and child going to India for one month in October 2018 for Diwali.

For her part she says that she is surprised by the father&#8217;s application given the lack of interest the father had shown P since her birth. She says that the date of separation was much earlier than December 2018; rather, it was around June/July 2018.   </p>

A Scott Schedule of allegations has been prepared and replied to, but has not yet been considered at a fact-finding hearing. Due to the alleged domestic abuse, the mother says she fled to India in November 2017 for a period of four months as she had no support in the UK. Following further alleged domestic abuse, she says that she fled definitively with P to India again in October 2018.  </p>

The mother says that she was aware of the father&#8217;s trip but that he showed no interest in P during this time. He says that when he went to India, the mother brought P back to the UK and that when he returned to the UK the mother took P back again to India. This is disputed by the mother who says she brought P temporarily back to the UK in April 2019 for just under two weeks. This was done because P was not permitted under Indian immigration rules to stay in India for more than 180 days.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On 26 November 2019 the mother applied to the Family Court at Chelmsford using Form C100 for a specific issue order for &#8220;permission to change jurisdiction of the child&#8221;. This was an unusual form of words, but it is evident that what the mother was asking for was a declaration that P was habitually resident in India. She had been told by immigration authorities in India that she needed such a declaration or order before the immigration status of P in India, a British citizen, could be regularised. Within the application form the mother raises the issue of habitual residence writing: &#8220;the father is an Indian national and the child is temporarily in India on a visa. The mother seeks to allow her to remain&#8221;.     </p>

The order from that hearing records that the court was satisfied that it had jurisdiction based on habitual residence. I questioned counsel as to how that view could have been formed when the child had been living in India for over a year (save for two weeks in April 2019). It seems probable that the circuit judge was not alerted to this issue because the mother&#8217;s application notice states that &#8220;the mother is the only person caring for the child&#8221; and of course the mother was in the jurisdiction. This statement was significantly inaccurate because the child was in fact being cared for by the maternal grandmother in India.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">Thus, the father did not in his application seek that the child be made a ward of court. He sought, in effect, an inward return order and a contact order. His application for an order that the mother be made to return to the United Kingdom, if she were not already here, was not legally tenable and I need say no more about it. </p>

The position statement prepared in advance of the hearing by counsel then representing the mother runs to only two pages and does not raise the issue of jurisdiction although counsel reserved her &#8220;position to amend her positions&#8221; (sic).  </p>

To that end, where the situation concerned is that of an infant who has been staying with her mother only a few days in a Member State -- other than that of her habitual residence -- to which she has been removed, the factors which must be taken into consideration include, first, the duration, regularity, conditions and reasons for the stay in the territory of that Member State and for the mother&#8217;s move to that State, and, second, with particular reference to the child&#8217;s age,  the mother&#8217;s geographic and family origins and the family and social connections which the mother and child have with that Member State.  It is for the national court to establish the habitual residence of the child taking account of all the circumstances of facts specific to each individual case.&#8221; </p>

Now, it might be said that the recitals in the orders of 7 and 16 September 2020 provide compelling evidence that, at least at that time, the mother accepted the jurisdiction of the English court. However, as I have explained above, the origin of these recitals is extremely unclear, and it would not be justifiable for me to rely on them to fix the mother with an unequivocal acceptance of the English jurisdiction. On the contrary, it is clear that at the time she was contesting the jurisdiction of the English court. In my judgment those recitals cannot be used by a process of relation-back to fix the mother with unequivocal acceptance of the English jurisdiction on 26 August 2020. Neither can the fact that the mother applied for some kind of declaration on 26 November 2019 be taken as an unequivocal acceptance by her of the jurisdiction of the English court to deal with all child arrangements and specific issues in relation to P. I have explained above how her application was completely misconceived. At its highest it was for a declaration of some type. </p>

The article by its terms provides a legal machinery for the bringing to an end of the retained jurisdiction of the original member state in favour of the second member state where the child is habitually resident.

Moreover, the provisions of the Brussels IIa Regulation on recognition and enforcement are applicable only to judgments delivered by the courts of the Member States (see the order of 12 May 2016, <span style="font-style:italic">Sahyouni </span>(C&#8209;281/15, EU:C:2016:343, paragraphs 19 to 22), and the judgment of 20 December 2017, <span style="font-style:italic">Sahyouni</span> (C&#8209;372/16, EU:C:2017:988, paragraph 27)). It is also common ground that the application of Article 11 of that regulation, dealing with the return of the child, assumes that the removal or retention of the child occurs from one Member State to another. In sum, it is germane to enquire, not about geographical scope of the Brussels IIa Regulation in its entirety, but about the applicability of each of its provisions.&#8221; </p>

The father&#8217;s application was made to the High Court pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction although it sought no more than a specific issue order (namely the return of the child) and a contact order. It did not seek wardship. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re N</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2020/35" uk:canonical="[2020] EWFC 35" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWFC 35</ref>, following the Supreme Court decision of  <span style="font-style:italic">Re NY (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2019/49" uk:canonical="[2019] UKSC 49" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] UKSC 49</ref>, I held at [9] that an applicant seeking an inward return order would need to demonstrate strong reasons of exceptionality to justify applying to the High Court to exercise its inherent powers rather than applying to the statutory Family Court to exercise its statutory powers. I observed that it was hard to conceive of circumstances where approaching the High Court would be justified. It has not been explained to me what the exceptional circumstances are that justify approaching the High Court. At all events, approaching the High Court did not create any additional ground of jurisdiction. Even if the father had confined his application to no more than a bare order for the return of his daughter that would have been covered by Brussels 2: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Children)</span> at [29].  </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[The] inherent jurisdiction should not be exercised in a manner which cuts across the statutory scheme. If, as Lady Hale and Lord Toulson suggest, the use of the inherent jurisdiction is not reserved for exceptional cases, the potential for it to cut across the statutory scheme is very considerable. I have no doubt that it would do so in this case. In the first place, it would fall to be exercised at a time when the child will have been with her mother in Pakistan for at least two years, and will probably have become habitually resident there. Secondly, it seems plain that if an application under the inherent jurisdiction had been made by, say, an aunt or a sister of the respondent, there could be no ground for acceding to it. It is necessary to make this point in order to remind ourselves that it is to protect her relationship with the child on the basis that she should be regarded as a co-parent that the appellant is invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The real object of exercising it would be to bring the child within the jurisdiction of the English courts (i) so that the court could exercise the wider statutory powers which it is prevented by statute from exercising while she is in Pakistan, and (ii) so that they could do so on different and perhaps better principles than those which would apply in a court of family jurisdiction in Pakistan. Thirdly, this last point is reinforced by the consideration that the appellant&#8217;s application in the English courts is for contact and shared residence. This is not relief which the statute permits to be ordered under the inherent jurisdiction, in a case where there is no jurisdiction under the Council Regulation or the 1996 Hague Convention. I do not accept that the inherent jurisdiction can be used to circumvent principled limitations which Parliament has placed upon the jurisdiction of the court. For these reasons, in addition to those given by the judge and the Court of Appeal, I do not think that an order for the child&#8217;s return could be a proper exercise of the court&#8217;s powers.&#8221;  </p>
