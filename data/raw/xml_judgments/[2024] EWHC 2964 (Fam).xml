	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An issue has arisen between the local authority and the heath board as to which statutory body is responsible for the care and treatment of SB and under what legal framework. This issue culminated in the local authority seeking a declaration and ancillary orders from this court, in short form, that because SB was detainable under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983 (&#8216;the 1983 Act&#8217;), the court did not have jurisdiction to grant a DoL pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. In practical terms, the thrust of the local authority&#8217;s case was that it was the responsibility of the health board, pursuant to the provisions of the 1983 Act, to make provision for the care and treatment of SB, and not the responsibility of the local authority even with the benefit of a DoL, if authorised by the court.</p>

It asserted that this court had no jurisdiction to determine whether SB detainable in a hospital pursuant to the 1983 Act; it had no jurisdiction to exercise a reviewing or supervisory role of the decisions made by clinicians and professionals under the 1983 Act; and that for the court to make a declaration or findings as to whether SB was detainable under the 1983 Act put pressure on the health board to change its position, or otherwise, was an abuse of process.</p>

In 2020 SB&#8217;s parents separated and the mother left the family home. These events greatly distressed SB who felt she had been abandoned by her mother. This distress was considerably exacerbated when SB became aware that her mother had given birth to a baby. Overlaying this was the alleged sexual abuse that SB had suffered by an older male relative which had repeatedly taken place since she was 12 years of age. The perpetrator was arrested in May 2024 and is the subject of an ongoing police investigation.</p>

SB later said that she was having issues with a woman (&#8216;woman A&#8217;) in Wolverhampton and wanted to go to her to &#8216;sort things&#8217;. The police held each arm to prevent her from falling and tried to walk her to her father&#8217;s car. SB stated she did not want to go home. When asked why, she stated &#8216;I don&#8217;t know&#8217; or &#8216;just because&#8217;. SB resisted, dropped to the floor, and kicked a police officer 3 times. SB was restrained.  SB was placed in the back of a police vehicle and arrested for assaulting a police officer and returned home. Once home SB was de-arrested.  </p>

The police attended and found her father was driving behind her trying to encourage her to get in the car. SB assaulted the police officer with the baseball bat and was arrested and taken to St Asaph police station. SB was handcuffed and restrained using limb restraints.  The custody officers refused to have her in detention and she was taken home. Her father refused to have her home because he could not keep her safe. SB was taken into police protection and was transported to a local police station. Whilst there, SB flooded the bathroom and assaulted police offers. SB was placed in the back of a police van in the car park.  A mental health assessment was completed by Dr Hales (consultant CAMHS and adolescent forensic psychiatrist). SB wrote that she wanted to go to Manchester to get to a named woman (&#8216;woman B&#8217;) to rape and murder her. Dr Hales&#8217; opinion was her differential diagnosis would be of &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">ASC and trauma leading to emotional dysregulation&#8217; </span>and that SB did not fulfil the criteria for detention under the 1983 Act.

Multiple traffic officers were deployed and SB was followed for a lengthy period before being stopped. SB would not leave the vehicle and a window was smashed to support removing her from the car. SB was placed in police custody and kicked the legs of two police officers when being transferred. A shard of glass was removed from her pocket. SB was taken to a local police station and placed under police protection. SB attempted to grab the water pipe valve and a police officer was required to hold her. SB kicked this police officer 10 times prior to another officer coming to assist. A search was completed during which she kicked staff. A social worker attended to work on a plan to support SB to return home with care assistance. SB asked to go to the toilet and kicked the shin of the police officer and damaged a door. SB was placed in limb restraints.  </p>

A member of the public intervened and SB was placed on the floor where she repeatedly pinched a member of staff. The police were called. SB was hitting and kicking staff. When the police arrived, SB was assaulting staff and was restrained. She kicked at the police and was put in leg restraints. SB was placed in police custody. Her father attended. SB was charged with a number of offences including common assault.  SB was taken to a local hospital for a mental health assessment but appears to have been transferred back to a local police station. Dr L and another section 12 approved doctor spent three hours with her and agreed she needed further assessment in hospital to rule out psychosis. SB was moved to the section 136 suite at a local hospital awaiting a PICU placement.</p>

The gatekeeper, usually an experienced consultant psychiatrist, determines, inter alia, the type of specialised mental health required and not the placement or hospital. If commissioning is confirmed by NHS Wales JCC, the gatekeeping team will seek an appropriate bed at a named hospital. Whereas in England, the need for Tier 4 CAMHS services is determined in accordance with the NHS England Service Specification for Tier 4 services and must comply with the National Referral and Access Process which must be made via an Access Assessment. If a Tier 4 CAMHS service is agreed as being appropriate via the Gatekeeping or Access Assessment process, the authority to detain a child or young person does not commence unless and until the managers of the named hospital accept the application and complete the statutory form.</p>

It is important to note that in Wales, individualised support is available to all persons with mental health needs who have received secondary mental health services, whereas the provisions of s.117 is only available to those who have been the subject of s.3 detention. This individualised support is provided for in the Mental Health (Wales) Measure 2010 (which is primary legislation in Wales), and includes the right to have a Care and Treatment Plan. This is separate and distinct from s.117 aftercare. The Measure is supplemented by the Mental Health (Care Co-ordination and Core and Treatment Planning) (Wales) Regulations 2011. SB is a relevant patient for the purpose of the Measure.</p>

Ms Sutton made the general point that the opinion of a medical practitioner that a child or young person satisfied the criteria of s.3(2) of the 1983 Act was a starting point, and not the conclusion, of a process which could lead to their compulsory detention in a hospital under the provisions of the Act. She made the specific submission that the opinion of Dr Vaidya, that SB was detainable under s.3 of the Act, was at variance with the opinions of eight other consultant psychiatrists including SB&#8217;s treating psychiatrist Dr Hales.</p>

If Parliament in an area of concern defined by statute (the area in this case being the care of children in need or trouble) prefers power to be exercised administratively instead of judicially, so be it.

The court will not ordinarily entertain a claim for judicial review in respect of a decision not to allocate medical resources to a particular case, here the relevant decision being not to admit a child or young person to a Tier 4 CAMHS bed following an Access Assessment (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Central Birmingham Health Authority ex parte Collier</span>, Unreported, 6 January 1988 and <span style="font-style:italic">R v Cambridge Health Authority ex parte B</span> [1995] 1 WLR 898). The court may, and in cases such as this one often does, join NHS England (and sometimes the relevant Clinical Commissioning Group) where the circumstances are such that the court may wish to invite reconsideration by the NHS Trust of the decision not to make Tier 4 inpatient provision for the subject child. By way of example, this step was taken by Sir James Munby in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X</span> [2017] EWHC 2036 (Fam). Alternatively, the court may consider directing a direct a single joint expert qualified in Tier 4 CAMHS to provide a second opinion, albeit that the efficacy of this approach is likely to be limited by the fact that upon receipt of the report the court&#8217;s powers to give effect to an expert recommendation contrary to the position taken by NHS England are limited for the reasons I have already.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The leading authorities are abundantly clear that this court has no role to supervise or review decisions which have been entrusted by Parliament to another public authority. The 1983 Act is an obvious example where Parliament has provided for a statutory code in respect of the detention of people with a mental disorder for treatment in hospital.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Schedule 1A of the 2005 Act makes statutory provision for finding that a person is ineligible from being deprived of their liberty under the 2005 Act, where in case E, they could be detained under the provisions of the 1983 Act. This express statutory provision enables the Court of Protection to consider and determine the question of whether a person could be detained under s.2 or s.3 of the 1983 Act. It is limited to the exercise of determining the specific question of whether a person is ineligible to be detained under the provisions of the 2005 Act. I cannot see any basis for concluding that this provision is to be read as having a wider application, and, in particular, to permit the court to determine whether a person is &#8216;within the scope of the Mental Health Act&#8217; when exercising its powers under the inherent jurisdiction.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no authority for the proposition that a court contemplating the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction to deprive a person of their liberty had jurisdiction to encroach upon the issue of whether a person was detainable or could, or would, be detained in a hospital under s.3 of the 1983 Act. In the absence of clear authority, I am satisfied that for this court to make findings and/or declarations about whether SB was detainable under s.3 of the 1983 Act would be to exercise an impermissible supervisory or review function of the clinicians and mental health professionals acting pursuant to the provisions of the 1983 Act. This court has no jurisdiction to make such findings or orders.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, and in any event, even if this court did find favour with the opinions of Dr Vaidya over those of Dr Hales and made a finding that SB was detainable under s.3 of the 1983 Act what would that achieve? It would not, of itself, lead to SB being detained in a hospital for treatment under the 1983 Act. It might lead to the clinicians and professionals charged with making the decision to detain her under the 1983 Act, to change their professional opinions and decisions. However, to make orders in these circumstances would, as Hoffman LJ set out in <span style="font-style:italic">ex p T</span> (above), be an abuse of process.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If the court did make such a finding, and then went on to make the declaration initially sought by the local authority that the court could not then exercise the inherent jurisdiction to authorise the deprivation of liberty, SB could find herself in a position where she was not afforded protection by being detained for treatment in a hospital nor afforded the protection of being deprived of her liberty in a safe place. This would be an intolerable and unconscionable state of affairs.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An issue was raised at the conclusion of the hearing by the local authority as to whether the court should give judgment on the contested issues in light of the local authority&#8217;s concession not to pursue its application. I recognise the force of this submission, but I am satisfied that in light of the important matters raised in this case it is clearly in the public interest for the court to set out its analysis of and conclusions about the application made by the local authority.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have set out above, the behaviours exhibited by SB between April and October this year were extremely challenging and they placed herself and others at a real risk of very serious harm. As noted in recent weeks, her behaviour has been very markedly less challenging and she has been compliant with her prescribed medication, but these are early days.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SB will require a safe, secure and supportive placement outside of a secure hospital. She will need to remain compliant, for the foreseeable, with taking her prescribed medication. The health board have agreed to provide outreach and community based psychiatric services and support to SB. The local authority is seeking to identify a suitable, secure residential placement for her. It is clear that SB will require a very good deal of support and therapy to enable her to return safely to live in the community and to lead a happy and stable life. </p>

Such an order is both necessary and proportionate having regard to the aim that is sought to be achieved, namely, to prevent SB, in the interim, causing harm to herself or others, pending her imminent discharge into a community placement.</p>
