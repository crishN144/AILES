If the group in question is not static over time, as human society is not, then the relevant collective knowledge and learned experience must be passed on from generation to generation if the group is to continue to benefit from its accumulated institutional memory.  In this case, to the detriment of the children who are the subject of these complex proceedings, it has become apparent that in the now thirty-two years that have passed since the publication by Dame Elizabeth ButlerSloss in 1987 of the Cleveland Enquiry Report, much of the accumulated institutional memory of how to deal in an assiduously open minded, procedurally fair and forensically rigorous way with allegations of child sexual abuse has been lost, at least to the majority of those professionals and police officers involved in this case.  </p>

The activities may involve physical contact, including assault by penetration (for example, rape or oral sex) or non-penetrative acts such as masturbation, kissing, rubbing and touching outside of clothing. They may also include non-contact activities, such as involving children in looking at, or in the production of, sexual images, watching sexual activities, encouraging children to behave in sexually inappropriate ways, or grooming a child in preparation for abuse. Sexual abuse can take place online, and technology can be used to facilitate offline abuse. Sexual abuse is not solely perpetrated by adult males. Women can also commit acts of sexual abuse, as can other children.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Where sexual abuse has occurred, it is not commonly witnessed by an independent third party.  Beyond issues of social stigma, perpetrating adults are often reluctant to make admissions in the context of family proceedings in circumstances where they face, or may face, criminal prosecution.  The alleged victims of sexual abuse are often vulnerable children with other difficulties that can affect the credibility of their allegations, which allegations often emerge a considerable time after the alleged abuse has taken place, and therefore long after any physical evidence that may have existed has disappeared.  The allegations may emerge in a piecemeal fashion, with children often not reporting events in a linear history, reporting them in a partial way and revisiting topics more than once. Such children may, whether by reason of their age, or the impact of the alleged sexual abuse or other difficulties, be idiosyncratic, inconsistent or unreliable historians.  The age, psychological state and/or views of the child may mean, as in this case, that the court does not hear their accounts challenged forensically in cross examination and, accordingly, is deprived of one of the key forensic tools for testing the truth of a disputed account before the law.  The child may suffer from psychological sequalae that may or may not be the product of sexual abuse but which, in any event, makes the assessment of their reliability even more difficult.  It is not unknown for children to lie about having experienced sexual abuse or to fabricate allegations of the same.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">More generally, human memory is not a single, simple system. What is remembered of an experience by a child or young person will not be a complete picture akin to a photograph or CCTV recording and will vary depending on the age at which the experience took place.  What an adult may consider to be a key element of a remembered experience, and therefore key to assessing the reliability of the memory, may not be significant from a child&#8217;s perspective.  The physiological processes involved in the encoding, storage and retrieval of memories are susceptible to internal and external influences.  Within this context, children&#8217;s accounts can be affected by their level of functioning, their emotional state and their levels of suggestibility.  It is also possible for a child to &#8220;remember&#8221; an event that has not in fact occurred, or which has not occurred precisely in the way remembered.  The child&#8217;s recollection of past experiences can be influenced by the process of questioning the child.  I deal with this issue in detail at paragraphs [571] to [587] below. </p>

In cases of alleged sexual abuse, there is a significant forensic tension between the need to provide understanding, support and care for children who may have been sexually abused, where the presence of a supportive nonabusing adult who listens without judgment and takes seriously what the child is saying is essential to that child&#8217;s current and future wellbeing, and the requirements of the legal process for establishing the truth or otherwise of those allegations in a court of law.  That difficult forensic tension falls to be addressed in this jurisdiction by the careful, rigorous and diligent application of comprehensive statutory guidance and good practice principles born out of long experience.

Medical evidence in cases of alleged child sexual abuse is rarely definitive and very often non-specific, ambiguous, equivocal or, on occasion, controversial.  Within this context, experienced medical professionals and experts in the field may reasonably reach different conclusions on a given physical presentation.  Research and practice as between jurisdictions may differ in this regard.   </p>

In the circumstances, when determining whether sexual abuse has taken place and, if so, who is responsible for perpetrating that abuse, it is vital that the court remain acutely conscious of the forensic difficulties outlined above.  As Holman J observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Leeds City Council v YX &amp; ZX (Assessment of Sexual Abuse) </span>2008 EWHC 802 (Fam) the task of the court in cases of this nature is not so much akin to putting together a single jigsaw puzzle in which all the pieces are present, but rather: </p>

Despite the fact that the use of the term &#8216;disclosure&#8217; to describe a statement or allegation of sexual abuse made by a child has been deprecated since the publication of the Cleveland Report in 1987 (see Paragraph 12.34(1) of that report), due to it precluding the notion that the abuse might <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> have occurred, nearly every professional who gave evidence in this case, including the investigating police officers, used the term &#8216;disclosure&#8217; to describe what the children had said [...], or to describe what they understood the children to have said to others.  Within this context, where a witness has used the word &#8216;disclosure&#8217; that word is used in this judgment when quoting passages of documentary or oral evidence from that witness.  Otherwise, this judgment uses the term &#8216;allegation&#8217;.  Before too much approbation is heaped on those witnesses, I note that both Government guidance and publications from the NSPCC now use the word &#8216;disclosure&#8217; even when speaking of matters that have not yet been the subject of proof to the requisite standard.  Finally, I pause to note that very few of the professionals, police officers and allocated social workers who gave evidence in this case had heard of the Cleveland Enquiry, much less were aware of its recommendations, and the guidance and good practice it underpins.  This is a topic that, unfortunately, I must return to at several points during this judgment. </p>

Still less does it follow that there is no value in oral evidence. But research confirms that people do not in fact generally rely on demeanour to detect deception but on the fact that liars are more likely to tell stories that are illogical, implausible, internally inconsistent and contain fewer details than persons telling the truth: see Minzner, "Detecting Lies Using Demeanor, Bias and Context" (2008) 29 Cardozo LR 2557.

But to attach any significant weight to such impressions in assessing credibility risks making judgments which at best have no rational basis and at worst reflect conscious or unconscious biases and prejudices. One of the most important qualities expected of a judge is that they will strive to avoid being influenced by personal biases and prejudices in their decision-making. That requires eschewing judgments based on the appearance of a witness or on their tone, manner or other aspects of their behaviour in answering questions. Rather than attempting to assess whether testimony is truthful from the way it is given, the only objective and reliable approach is to focus on the content of the testimony and to consider whether it is consistent with other evidence (including evidence of what the witness has said on other occasions) and with known or probable facts.&#8221; </p>

The credibility and reliability of that parent should not be assessed simply by reference to, as it was termed historically, &#8216;the cut of their jib&#8217;.  This of course operates in both directions.  It is as problematic to rely on an impression that a witness has an &#8216;honest&#8217; tone or manner as it is to rely on an impression that the tone or manner of a witness appears &#8216;dishonest&#8217;.

They may arise for a number of reasons.  One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability.  Another is that they are lies told for other reasons.  Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or recollection of the person hearing or relaying the account.  The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the &#8216;lie&#8217; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is "capable of amounting to a corroboration". In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Middleton</span> [2001] Crim.L.R. 251. In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court.

Within this context, whilst not directly applicable in these proceedings (and again ever mindful of the observation of McFarlane LJ (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re R (Children) </span>that it is fundamentally wrong for the Family Court to be drawn into an analysis of factual evidence in proceedings relating to the welfare of children based upon criminal law principles and concepts), I also note that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/33/section/34/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 34(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/33" uk:canonical="1988 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Criminal Justice Act 1988</ref> abrogated the rule that required the court to give a jury a warning about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated evidence of a child, and that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1994/33/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 32</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1994/33" uk:canonical="1994 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994</ref> abrogated the rule which previously required juries to be given a warning (and magistrates to warn themselves) about the dangers of relying on uncorroborated evidence in a case of alleged sexual offences.  The court does however, retain a discretion in such cases to give warnings in respect of witnesses (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Makanjuola</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 WLR 1348" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 WLR 1348</ref>).   A warning will be given where there is an evidential basis for suggesting that the evidence of the witness may be unreliable, for example an admission by a witness of a previous lie or the giving by a witness of other evidence that is clearly unreliable (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Makanjuola</span>). The focus is on the individual witness, avoiding invoking stereotypes or broad generalisations.   </p>

That of course is only another way of saying that when a person is dealing with a considerable mass of facts, in particular if those facts are of such a nature as to invite reprobation, nothing is easier than confusion of mind; and, therefore, if such charges are to be brought in a mass, it becomes essential that the method upon which guilt is to be ascertained should be stated with punctilious exactness&#8221;. </p>

Within this context, it is well recognised that it is important, forensically, in a case of alleged sexual abuse, to examine the first point in time at which a child gives an account or accounts of alleged sexual abuse, the precise circumstances in which the account or accounts arose and how those were treated subsequently by those to whom they were made.

It is a fact that children&#8217;s accurate memories can be wholly usurped by a wide range of external and internal factors, such as suggestive questioning or confirmatory bias. The Court must keep firmly in mind the work of, for example, Professors Ceci and Bruck (Jeopardy in the Courtroom: A Scientific Analysis of Children&#8217;s Testimony (1995 &#8211; American Psychological Association)).

One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people's memories are unreliable and believe our memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate.  </p>

In fact, psychological research has demonstrated that memories are fluid and malleable, being constantly rewritten whenever they are retrieved. This is true even of so-called 'flashbulb' memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event. (The very description 'flashbulb' memory is in fact misleading, reflecting as it does the misconception that memory operates like a camera or other device that makes a fixed record of an experience.) External information can intrude into a witness's memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory).&#8221; </p>

The obligation to believe a complainant appears to have had its origins in a Special Notice from 2002 concerning rape investigations, thereafter appearing in an HMIC report in 2014 and in 2015 in Home Office rules governing the recording of crime statistics.   The primary motivation for the policy appears to have been a desire to address the evidence that a fear of disbelief or being blamed for what had happened was a barrier to complainants coming forward and reporting crime, especially alleged sexual offences.

Mr Bagchi and Ms Bains have drawn the court&#8217;s attention to a paper by Ceci and others entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Children&#8217;s Suggestibility Research: Things to know before interviewing a child </span>(Anuario de Psicolog&#237;a Jur&#237;dica 25 (2015) 3-12) in which Ceci and his fellow authors highlight the operation of &#8220;confirmation bias&#8221; in the context of allegations made by children, being a tendency, identified in the research, for a person to be biased towards information that confirms their own personal beliefs.  In the paper the authors note, in the context of research by Bruck amongst others, as follows with respect to the potential consequences of confirmation bias when interviewing children: </p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;A persons&#8217; established beliefs are often difficult to change and resist contradictory evidence (Ross, Lepper &amp; Hubbard, 1975).  This phenomenon, referred to as &#8220;confirmation bias&#8221;, can have especially detrimental effects when working with child witnesses.  If an interviewer enters a room, prepared to question a child, and brings along pre-established beliefs about the case or the accuracy and credibility of the child, the interviewer may unintentionally put disproportional weight on some statements the child makes while ignoring others.  If the interviewer&#8217;s initial suspicions are incorrect, this could create a false report.  Confirmation bias is potentially a problem for all people who may interact with a child witness, even professionals in the field of forensics, human development and social science.  In fact, experts tend to be more confident in their evaluations of witnesses than others, despite not necessarily being more skilled at distinguishing accurate from inaccurate statements (DePaulo et al., 2003; Wessel, Drevland, Eilertsen, &amp; Magnussen, 2006).&#8221; </p>

The Guidance has been formulated and refined over the years by those with particular expertise in the field, including specialists with a deep understanding of how children perceive, recall and articulate their experiences. It would be unrealistic to expect perfection in any investigation.

Did they act, inadvertently or deliberately, to put words into the child&#8217;s mouth by suggesting the answer to a given question? Did they inadvertently or deliberately encourage the child to exaggerate for reward? Did they cause the recorded account to be inaccurate or unreliable?  Did they act to assume an outcome?  Did they fail to take account of the needs of the child such as to make what the child has said unreliable?  This is not an exhaustive list. </p>

Before turning to them, it is important to note at the outset that, as with the allegations made to the foster carers and to the learning mentor, the task of evaluating the credibility and reliability of the ABE interviews is one for the court.  In A London Borough Council v K &amp; others [2010] EWHC 850 Baker J (as he then was) observed as follows in respect of the use of expert assessments of reliability: </p>

They are, so far as I am aware, unused in criminal proceedings in this country, and I see strong arguments for imposing restrictions on their use in family cases as well.  As recognised by those who have devised criterion-based content analysis, and as acknowledged by Dr De Jong in evidence, statement validity analysis is not designed to be used in a forensic context.  There is a risk that its alleged scientific formulation will give it an over-elevated status.  Furthermore, there is a danger that some courts, faced with these difficult decisions, will subconsciously defer to the apparent expert.  That danger has been recognised in a number of cases in which the courts have emphasised the discrete roles of the expert and the court.  In the case of the veracity expert, the danger is particularly acute.  The ultimate judge of veracity, i.e. where the truth lies, is the judge and the judge alone.  He cannot delegate that decision to any expert.  I acknowledge that a child psychiatrist such as Dr De Jong may be able to point out some features of a child's account that add or detract from authenticity, as she has done in this case.  But, in my experience, many of these features should be obvious to judges in any event.  No expert, however experienced and however well briefed about the case, will be in a position to say where the truth lies.  Only the judge sees and hears all the evidence.&#8221; </p>

Detailed medical and forensic evidence may support this statement, as may a psychological assessment of the child or the confession by a perpetrator.  Physical signs alone are on rare occasions sufficient to make the diagnosis.&#8221; The Handbook of Best Practice in Children Act Cases 1997 notes that there is often a tension between a positive clinical finding of sexual abuse, and judicial findings that sexual abuse has not occurred and that, within contested cases, clinical methods will inevitably be subjected to scrutiny. </p>

In contrast, Mr Hadley and Ms Higgins on behalf of the local authority submitted that risk and protective factors are properly to be weighed in the balance when considering the inherent probability or improbability of a particular event, especially when the court has been enjoined in reaching its findings of fact to consider the wide canvass of evidence, including the wider context of social, emotional, ethical and moral factors (see <span style="font-style:italic">A County Council v A Mother, A Father and X, Y and Z</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/31" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 31 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 31 (Fam)</ref> at [44], <span style="font-style:italic">Re U (A Child)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] Fam 134" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] Fam 134</ref> at [26] and <span style="font-style:italic">Re H and Others (Minors)(Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] AC 563" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] AC 563</ref> at 591). </p>

Further, in considering the proposition that certain risk factors may increase the likelihood that the child abuse alleged has taken place, the court must bear in mind that risk requires quantification before significant evidential weight, let alone determinative evidential weight, could be attached to a given risk.  Within this context, by themselves, the presence or absence of risk factors for abuse proves nothing. [...] </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">However, whilst considerable caution must be exercised where a given risk factor has not been formally quantified (again, in particular an alleged and admitted parental history of being sexually abused), I am satisfied that if in a case of alleged sexual abuse the court finds on the evidence, to the requisite standard of proof, that a relevant risk factor is present (for example, a parent has extensive substance abuse issues and lax sexual boundaries) the court is entitled, to the extent that the court sees fit in the particular circumstances of the case, to take account of such matters when evaluating the probability that the parent committed the sexual abuse alleged.  Such an approach is consistent with the authorities cited in the foregoing paragraphs.  Within this context, as Mr Vater and Mr Watson point out in their written closing submissions, an allegation that is inherently improbable in relation to one alleged perpetrator might be less inherently improbable in relation to another.  To utilise the same example, it is more improbable that a tee-total parent with well demonstrated sexual boundaries would sexually abuse his or her child than a father or mother who drinks to excess or takes drugs and who has a history of demonstrating a lack of control or inhibition or lax sexual boundaries. </p>

Their behaviour is always an abuse of power and usually a breach of trust.  They destroy families and blight childhoods.  They create dread in their victims by convincing them that the consequences of speaking out will be worse than the consequences of silence.  They create guilt in their victims by persuading them that they have somehow willingly participated in their own abuse.  They burden their victims with secrets.  They poison normal relationships, trade on feelings of affection, drive a wedge between their victims and others, and make family and friends take sides.  They count on the failure or inability of responsible adults, both relatives and professionals, to protect and support the victims.  Faced with exposure, they commonly turn on their victims, try to assassinate their characters, and get others to do the same.  Most often, their selfishness is so deep-rooted that they ignore other people's feelings and are only capable of feeling pity for themselves.&#8221; </p>
