Other members of the paternal extended family live nearby.  The mother was born in the UK in 1972. The parties married in Germany in 1994.  B was born in 1996 and R in 1998.  It is agreed by all parties that R suffers from ADHD and has some difficulties with verbal communication and is also taking medication to help him concentrate.  For the purposes of these proceedings, R has been assessed by a psychologist, Dr Fiona Scott, who has concluded that in a number of respects he is functioning at the age of 10 to 11, some 12 to 18 months below his chronological age.  It was suggested at an earlier stage in R's life that he might be on the autistic spectrum.  Dr Scott observed some features associated with that condition, but noted others were absent and reached a clear conclusion that he was not autistic.  R&#8217;s problems, however, were sufficiently marked to cause his parents to send him to a specialist boarding private educational placement in Wilhelmsdorf in Germany.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The parents' marriage broke down in 2003 and they were divorced later that year.  After divorce, both children remained in the principal care of the mother, but with regular staying contact with the father every fortnight on alternate weekends and for one half of the school holidays.  The father makes financial provision for the children and contributes to the cost of R's education.  Both parents have subsequently remarried: the father to a woman by whom he has had two further children and the mother to a man ("Mr J"), a soldier, by whom she has had another child, A, now aged four and three quarters.  The mother, Mr J and the three children lived at Oberried, also in southern Bavaria.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">According to the mother, and corroborated by both B and R, this second marriage was characterised by domestic violence perpetrated by Mr J on the mother and also on the children, in particular R and A.  The mother in her affidavit in these proceedings has described a pattern of domestic violence and, in talking to her own solicitor, B has confirmed this account.  As described by the mother and B, the level of violence was significant and disturbing and has manifestly, to my mind, had a profound effect on their lives.  According to B, who was evidently close to and caring towards her siblings, R and A, she took steps on occasion to protect the younger children from exposure to domestic violence.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Shortly before Christmas 2009, the mother consulted a lawyer in Germany about a divorce.  Over Christmas, in fact on Christmas Day itself, there was another serious act of domestic violence allegedly inflicted by Mr J on the mother in which (on her account, unchallenged in these proceedings) she sustained injuries to both her knees.  Following this assault, the mother and the children went to register a complaint at a local police station.  The mother drove to the police station with excess alcohol in her bloodstream, as a result of which she was subsequently convicted, fined and banned from driving for several months. However, the police took her allegation of domestic violence seriously, arranged accommodation for her and the children in a refuge and arrested and charged Mr J.  He was then excluded from the matrimonial home for a period, but subsequently the mother allowed him to return.  Although Mr J, according to B, was "fine and nice" for a short while, further domestic violence allegedly ensued.  It is to my mind significant that B, in speaking to her lawyer acting in these proceedings, was extremely critical of her mother saying:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">"I was really annoyed with my mum, the way she used to let Mr J back into our lives.  It wasn't right.  I know she had a real difficulty about leaving him.  She did try, I know she did, but she was not able to.  I always worried about her going back to him."</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 22 March 2010, the mother brought B, R and A to this country without telling either the father or Mr J.  The first the father knew about it was when the maternal grandmother telephoned him later that day.  The following day he rang the mother on her mobile telephone and she told him that she was not returning the children to Germany, and he indicated his objections.  On the following day, the father sent a text message to the mother in German, which, translated, reads:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">"If you are prepared to bring R back and see to normal contact with me for B I will drop the matter. Otherwise it starts now." </p>

	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The father says that he was under enormous pressure when he sent that message.  The mother did not respond and he subsequently contacted the German Central Authority. Solicitors were instructed on behalf of the father via the UK International Child Abduction Unit.  Attempts to secure the voluntary return of the children failed, and these proceedings were duly started by Originating Summons on 23 April 2010.</p>

The mother started a new relationship with another man and the children started attending a comprehensive school.  The father was not consulted about this choice of school.  There is some evidence of the children settling down there; B in particular has made a number of friends.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 29 April 2010 the application came before Sir Christopher Sumner, sitting as a deputy Judge of the Family Division, who made various directions, including joining the children as parties, a direction that an officer from the <span style="font-style:italic">Cafcass</span> High Court Abduction Team be invited to represent R, and a direction that both children should be represented by Miss Nina Hansen of Freemans, a firm specialising in child abduction work.  At the outset of the hearing before me, Mr Devereux raised the objection that, insofar as the effect of this was that B would be instructing Miss Hansen direct, it was outwith the provisions of the <span style="font-style:italic">Family Proceedings Rules</span> 1991, as amended.  In the event, no party sought to argue before me that this difficulty was insuperable.  All parties agreed that it could be overcome by the court taking a further step, although they did not agree precisely what that step should be.  In view of the shortage of court time and the need to avoid superfluous (albeit academically interesting) legal argument, I took the pragmatic step with the agreement of all parties of directing that Miss Hansen should continue to represent B as litigation friend and thereby continue to instruct Mr Scott-Manderson QC.  I shall briefly return to this point later in the judgment. </p>

In the event, however, the final hearing did not proceed on that date and instead His Honour Judge Knopf, sitting under section 9 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Senior Courts Act</span> 1981, adjourned the hearing to 4 and 5 August 2010, gave permission for the instruction of Dr Scott to carry out an assessment of R, directed that the Central Authority should liaise with its German counterpart pursuant to Article 55 of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span> to obtain information about the protective measures available in Germany and information concerning services available to the mother and children on their return to that country, and made an order for interim contact between the children and their father.  A final directions hearing took place before the President on 27 July 2010 and the final hearing was listed before me. A few days before the final hearing, following receipt of the final <span style="font-style:italic">Cafcass</span> report from Ms Jolly, Miss Hansen concluded that she should not continue to act for both B and R, and accordingly <span style="font-style:italic">Cafcass</span> Legal were invited to step in at short notice to represent R.  </p>

Mr Scott-Manderson QC on her behalf argued in favour of this course, supported by the mother.  The father, through Mr Devereux, opposed the application.  In the event, I concluded that B should not attend the hearing.  I did, however, agree to see B briefly to explain my decision.  I have also told her that I will see her at the conclusion of the hearing to inform her of my decision on the application for summary return.</p>

Mr Devereux submits that the rationale for this omission would appear to be that (a) Hague Convention proceedings are <span style="font-style:italic">sui generis</span> and not welfare based proceedings and (b) to permit a child to instruct a solicitor directly will almost certainly cause delay which might otherwise cause breaches of treaty obligations in terms of ensuring the proceedings are completed with due expedition.  On the other hand, in a jurisdiction where a child&#8217;s wishes, feelings and objections to its summary return are a central issue within the proceedings, it might be thought anomalous that the child who is capable of giving instructions does not have the right to instruct a solicitor direct.  Furthermore, in many cases, (including this one), applications are made for the summary return of children both under the Hague Convention and under the inherent jurisdiction.  Under the current rules a child can instruct a solicitor directly under the latter, but not under the former.</p>

I was told by counsel that it is not unknown for this lacuna in the rules to be overlooked in Hague proceedings, but the terms of the rule are clear.  The irregularity was met in this case by taking the pragmatic approach of appointing Ms Hansen as litigation friend for B at the hearing, but of course by that stage she had already carried out a very considerable amount of work on B's behalf.  Mr Devereux submits that there is an urgent need for this lacuna to be considered by the Family Proceedings Rules Committee which is undertaking a radical redrafting of the rules. In the light of the great emphasis now being given to children's objections under Article 13 as set out elsewhere in this judgment, I hope that the committee will find time to review this matter in the near future. </p>

In her closing submissions, Ms Honeyman drew my attention to the fact that at no stage had the question of whether R should be a party been actively considered by a judge.  The order made at the first directions hearing by Sir Christopher Sumner contains a recital to the effect that the parties had been "notified that... Miss Hansen&#8230;are [sic] intending to apply for leave for the children to be separately represented" and an order that there be "leave for the children, R and B, to be joined as parties and to be represented at the final hearing unless the Plaintiff takes steps in opposition to this grant of leave by 4.00pm on 7 May 2010".  By a second order made on the same day, the learned deputy judge ordered that an officer of <span style="font-style:italic">Cafcass</span> High Court Abduction Team be invited to represent R and that both children be represented by Miss Hansen.  Ms Honeyman expressed concern that well-established practices had not been followed in this case.

Ms Honeyman submitted that in this case the decision to join R (and B) was taken before either was seen by <span style="font-style:italic">Cafcass</span>.

By virtue of Article 11(2) of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span>, there is a presumption (in EU cases) that a child should be given an opportunity to be heard unless it appears inappropriate to the court having regard to the child's age or maturity.

The child's objections exception is entirely separate from Article 13(b).  The question of whether a child objects to being returned and, if so, whether he or she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views are questions of fact which are peculiarly within the province of the trial judge.  The return to which the child objects is that which would otherwise be ordered under Article 12 of the Convention: that is to say an immediate return to the country from which the child was removed or retained.  There is no particular age that a child is to be considered as having attained sufficient maturity for his or her views to be taken into account.  It is permissible for the court to focus specifically as to whether the child has reached a stage of development at which, when asked the question, &#8220;Do you object to a return to your home country&#8221;, he or she can be relied upon to give a reliable answer, which does not depend on instinct alone, but is influenced rather by the discernment a mature child brings to the question&#8217;s implications for his or her best interests in the long term and the short term.  All these are well-established propositions which have been reiterated in a number of authorities, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (A Minor) (Abduction: Custody Rights)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] Fam 242" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] Fam 242</ref> sub nom <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">S v S (Child Abduction)(Child's Views)</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">[</span>1992] 2 FLR 492 and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re T (Abduction: Child's Objections to Return)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 2 FLR 192" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 2 FLR 192</ref>.</p>

The court is entitled to take into account the various aspects of the Convention policy alongside the circumstances which gave the court a discretion in the first place and the wider consideration of the child's rights and welfare.  I would, therefore, respectfully agree with Thorpe LJ in the passage quoted at paragraph [32] above, save for the word 'overriding' if it suggests that the Convention objectives should always be given more weight than the other considerations.  Sometimes they should and sometimes they should not.</p>

As is clear from the earlier discussion, the Convention was the product of prolonged discussions in which some careful balances were struck and fine distinctions drawn.  The underlying purpose is to protect the interests of children by securing the swift return of those who have been wrongfully removed or retained.  The Convention itself has defined where a child must be returned and when she need not be.  Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously.  The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary. But the further away one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weight those general Convention considerations must be.</p>

In consent or acquiescence cases, on the other hand, general considerations of comity and confidence, particular considerations relating to the speed of legal proceedings and approach to relocation in the home country, and individual considerations relating to the particular child might point to a speedy return, so that her future can be decided in her own country.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In child&#8217;s objections cases, the range of considerations may be even wider than those in the other exceptions.  The exception is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and, secondly, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views.  These days, and especially in the light of Art 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child&#8217;s views.  Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so.  Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child&#8217;s objections, the extent to which they are &#8216;authentically her own&#8217; or the produce of the other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier.  The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry.  But that is far from saying that the child&#8217;s objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances. </p>

These are no longer &#8216;hot pursuit&#8217; cases.  By definition, for whatever reason, the pursuit did not begin until long after the trail had gone cold.  The object of securing a swift return to the country of origin cannot be met.  It cannot any longer be assumed that that country is the better forum for he resolution of the parental dispute.  So the policy of the Convention would not necessarily point towards a return in such cases, quite apart from the comparative strength of the countervailing factors, which may well, as here, include the child&#8217;s objections as well as her integration in her new community. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This lucid analysis provides sufficient guidance for the exercise of discretion in most cases.  But for Mr Devereux it leads to what he calls "the second problem" which can be summarised thus: in a case involving a number of siblings does the court (a) establish whether or not the gateway to discretion is open in the case of each child before going on to consider the exercise of discretion; or (b) consider the position of the sibling group together and exercise a discretion "in the round"?  Mr Devereux submits that "radically different approaches" have been adopted in various cases.  He submits that the principal authority for option (a), on which he relies, is the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Zaffino</span> case, (<span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>), in particular the observations of Wall LJ (as he then was) at paragraph [34], which Mr Devereux argues remains good authority on this point, notwithstanding the fact that its approach to the exercise of discretion was based on the test of exceptionality subsequently rejected by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M (Abduction: Zimbabwe)</span>.

In the leading judgment, Ward LJ concluded that: (1) the older child had a clear and reasonable objection to return which had to be taken into account (page 211); (2) in the exercise of its discretion those objections outweighed "the spirit and purpose of the Convention", so that looked at in isolation it would not be right to order the return (page 213A - D); (3) however, were the court to order the return of the younger child, that would be a factor to bring into the balance in exercising its discretion whether or not to order the older child's return notwithstanding her objections (page 217 F - G); (4) there was a grave risk that returning the younger child without his older sister would place him in an intolerable situation and as a result the Article 13(b) defence was established in his case (page 219 A - C); (5) the exercise of discretion must be taken in the round and in the circumstances of that case the older child's objections should not be overridden to remove the intolerability of the younger child to face returning alone (page 219 D - E).</p>

The child&#8217;s place within the family, and the consequences of the exercise of discretion on that child, must be considered." The fact that the courts then proceeded to take a different approach in the exercise of discretion is, in my view, attributable to the difference in the facts and circumstances in respect of cases which are clearly distinguishable.  Unlike <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re T</span>,  it was not contended in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Zaffino</span> that the return of the second child would have put him in an intolerable situation because, in that case, the child was returning to four of his siblings and his mother.  On the contrary, in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Zaffino</span> it would have been the older child who would have been in a difficult position if her brother had been returned with her because she would then have been separated from all of her five siblings.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The obvious consequence of Article 11(4) of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span>, is to narrow the scope for a successful deployment of the defence under Article 13(b) of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span>. Mr Devereux submits that its impact goes further.  He contends that it is also relevant to the exercise of discretion under the child's objection defence because the policy of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span> is to buttress the policy of the Convention.  If adequate arrangements are in place to secure the protection of the child from a grave risk of harm or other intolerability, that must, submits Mr Devereux, be a relevant consideration when exercising the discretion on the defence of child's objections.  Mr Scott-Manderson QC submits that this is a misreading of the Regulation. He points out that Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M (Abduction: Zimbabwe</span><span style="font-style:italic">)</span> identifies very different approaches to the exercise of discretion under, on the one hand, Article 13(b) and, on the other hand, the child's objections defence.  Baroness Hale held that, where a court has concluded the Article 13(b) gateway is crossed, it would be inconceivable that the court would nevertheless order the child to return to "face his fate" whether for policy reasons or any other grounds.  On one view there is barely discretion at all.  Either the situation is intolerable (a high test) or is not.  The impact of Article 11(4) is to focus attention on designing arrangements to make tolerable what would otherwise be intolerable.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the mother, Mr Gupta submits that the carefully-crafted provisions of Articles 11(6) - (8) of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span> have an impact on every exercise of discretion whether to refuse to return a child under the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span>.  Under Article 10 of the Regulation, in cases of wrongful removal or retention of a child, the courts in the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention retain jurisdiction (until certain conditions are satisfied) to determine matters relating to the exercise of parental responsibility, that is to say welfare decisions.  Article 11(6) - (8) lays down a procedure to be followed in the event that the courts of a Member State to which the child was abducted refuse to order his return.  The effect of these provisions is that, whatever decision is made about summary return, the ultimate welfare decision will be taken by the courts of habitual residence, in this case Germany.  Thus, submits Mr Gupta, the court or state to which the child is abducted (the "requested state") can exercise its discretion to refuse to return the child safe in the knowledge that a welfare based enquiry will be undertaken promptly in the Member State of origin with the full cooperation and assistance of the courts in the requested state.  He therefore argues that the effect of 11(6) - (8) of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span> is to widen the discretion not to return a child under the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span>.</p>

Mr Devereux submits that in most cases it would be impractical for a decision to be taken about the welfare of children while they are staying in another country.  Thus, he submits, the effect of Articles 11(6) - (8) of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span> is to narrow the scope for a discretionary refusal to return under the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span>.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Scott-Manderson QC adopts a middle way between these two propositions.  Directing my attention again to Thorpe LJ's observations in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Vigreux</span> case at paragraphs [36] &#8211; [37] (which on this point is not, he submits, undermined by the subsequent decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M (Abduction Zimbabwe</span><span style="font-style:italic">))</span>, he submits the courts can take Article 11(6) - (8) into account in exercising its discretion under the Hague Convention, but should be careful not to attach too much weight to this factor.  Once again, I prefer Mr Scott-Manderson QC's arguments.  It seems to me that those provisions in <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span> are primarily designed to make practical arrangements to meet the situation where the Member State of origin retains welfare jurisdiction but the &#8220;requested state&#8221; has exercised its discretion under Article 12 or 13 of the Hague Convention to refuse to order the return of a child.  The fact that such arrangements have been made by detailed provisions in <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span> does not in my judgment affect the exercise of discretion.  Indeed, as Thorpe LJ pointed out in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Vigreux </span> case (at paragraph [36]) the detailed procedure set out at Article 11(6) - (8) may take rather longer to bring about a determination of welfare issues than would be achieved by a swift return under the Hague Convention.</p>

It is too early to assess with confidence the precise impact of this decision.  The limited academic comments so far available suggest a divergence of views. Before me, Mr Scott-Manderson QC submitted that the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">II Revised</span> are part of a scheme of European law which is encompassed within the framework of the ECHR.  The provisions of both the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span> therefore have to be implemented within that framework.  In particular, Article 13(b) has to be interpreted within those confines and, when it is not so interpreted, as in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Neulinger</span> case, the courts of the &#8220;requested state&#8221; will be in violation of Article 8 of the ECHR.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"> Clearly there will in due course be a case in which the court has to grapple with Mr Gupta&#8217;s submission that Article 20 provides a further defence to an application for summary return; that the combined effect of Article 20 and the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Neulinger</span> decision has "a knock-on effect on the court's approach to the historically high and virtually unobtainable threshold cases where Article 13(b) has been found"  (as Mr Gupta put it); and Mr Gupta's interesting proposition that, where an EU Member State of origin retains the welfare jurisdiction, the existence of the provisions in Article 11(6) - (8) means that a summary return is not "necessary" within the meaning of Article 8 of the ECHR.  That will, however, only arise in cases where the other defences raised under the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span> fail and, as will become apparent, this is not such a case.  I will, therefore, refrain from further comment on the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Neulinger</span> decision, save for two brief observations.  First, I endorse the observation of McFarlane J in an unreported decision, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">N v N</span>, (decided on 25 September 2007), that it is essential for the groundwork for such a submission to be laid in the evidence. Secondly, my preliminary view is that it will be an extremely rare case where a court concludes that: (a) a child has been wrongfully removed in breach of a parents' rights of custody; (b) none of the defences in Articles 12 or 13 is established; but (c) nevertheless an order for the summary return of the child would infringe Article 8 of ECHR.</p>

In her first affirmation dated 21 June, Mrs Hansen recorded that B "appears to be a normal thirteen and a half year old, and quite clearly understood the reason for these proceedings.  She was keen to talk about her position."  Miss Hansen was clear as to her wishes. "B said she wanted to stay in England and to stay with her mother.  She wanted holidays with her father, but she did not want to live with him and she did not want to return to Germany.  I asked why this was and she told me that she really enjoyed her new school.  She said it was &#8216;cool&#8217;. She wants to be an air stewardess when she grows up and therefore the language skills she will get by continuing her education in English would greatly assist her."  B proceeded to give Miss Hansen a detailed account of the alleged incidents of domestic violence perpetrated by Mr J on the mother, R and A. Miss Hansen concluded her first affirmation in these terms: </p>

She would simply refuse to live with her father who could not even send her clothes over to her.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In her second affirmation dated 28 July 2010, Mrs Hansen recalled an account of a further conversation that she had with B on 14 July 2010.  Prior to this meeting, B had had some contact with her father for the first time in several months. According to Miss Hansen, "B told me her views had not changed at all since she had last been to see me.  She said &#8216;I still want to stay here.&#8217; I asked why and she said, &#8216;this is my home, this is where things are good, this is where I am settled.&#8217; I suggested that it was quick to feel settled and she said &#8216;yes, but I have my aunts here and my grandmother and we used to come here all the time.&#8217;  The children came almost every year with their mum to stay with their aunt or grandmother.  Their relatives also came to Germany to visit. &#8216;To me it felt like I was coming home. It may have something to do with that my mum is from here and she is very comfortable here and of course that gives us all the feeling of being happy.&#8217; B said &#8216;I do not want to go back to Germany and I will not be going back. I refuse.&#8217;  I asked B how she would feel if her brother was sent back, would she then go back?  She replied, &#8216;I will not let my brother going back; I will not let him go.&#8217; She said &#8216;if my mother went back and A went back and R went back, I would feel as if I was forced to go back I suppose.  I would then have to go; but I would be really angry with my dad.  I&#8217;m not sure how I could continue a relationship with him.&#8217;&#8221;  Speaking of her life in England, B said to Miss Hansen: "there is none of the disruption my life in Germany had ...Germany for me is just an aggression;  it&#8217;s between my parents, between my mother and Mr J, and all the time we are in the middle.  I really find it difficult .... I was really annoyed with my mum the way she used to let Mr J back into our lives. It wasn't right.  However, I know that she has a real difficulty about leaving him.  She did try I know she did, but she was not able to. I always worried about her going back to him.  Here we feel safe and happy." Later, Miss Hansen records B adding: "I wouldn't go back to Germany if I had to live with my dad.  There were lots of different reasons, but he wouldn't have the space for me either in his house or indeed in his family."  B added: "I want to continue with the life in [Devon].  Here I don't need to worry about R and A as I know they are safe and happy.  I only wish that I could settle things with my dad so that he would be happy for us and support us (that is me R and A), rather than this."  Miss Hansen concluded her second affirmation by saying: "in the last couple of months B seemed to have become a much more confident and happy person ... What had not changed was B's attitude towards a return to Germany.  If anything, her objections have strengthened as time has gone on."</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In her oral evidence, Miss Hansen confirmed that B had attended court on the morning of the hearing, had spoken to Miss Hansen and remained opposed to returning to Germany.  Miss Hansen described her opposition as being to a return to Germany itself, but acknowledged that for B it was linked to the circumstances in which she left and the uncertainty about what would happen if she returned.  Miss Hansen was closely questioned by Mr Devereux about the extent of the documentation that B had seen for the purposes of giving direct instructions to her solicitor.  She replied that B had seen the affirmations she had prepared on her behalf.  She had not shown her any other document, unless B had asked to see it.  In response to my enquiry about her own experience in representing children, Miss Hansen stated that she had been a member of the children&#8217;s panel for 18 years, and throughout that time she had represented children in public law proceedings. For the last five or six years she has also represented them in <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span> proceedings.  Over those 18 years, she has represented over 200 children of whom probably 20 were Hague proceedings.  Over 50 per cent of her work is representing children.  She thought she had acquired experience in gauging whether she should or should not show documents to those children she represents.</p>

She felt protective towards her younger siblings and was worried about what would happen to them.  She had found it distressing when she was unable to protect them.  To Mr Devereux, Miss Hansen added it was a very large part of B's thinking that her mother has not been able to protect herself or her children from Mr J in Germany and that putting distance between them would be the best way of getting protection.  Miss Hansen said B was concerned that if they return to Germany Mr J might come into contact with the family again because of his wish to have contact with A and for that reason "he wouldn't disappear".  B described how Mr J only complies with "orders he agrees with".</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Miss Hansen said in chief: "I do see it as &#8216;objections&#8217; in Hague Convention terms.  It could not be clearer.  Her reasons for not going back are clear and cogent.  It is exactly what an adult would say."  Miss Hansen also described B as "not happy" about the prospect of being separated from R. Cross-examined on this point by Mr Devereux, she added that B's reasons for not wanting to return were "thought-out factors".  She did not think that B was exaggerating to &#8220;beef up her case&#8221;.  Mr Devereux pointed out what he characterised as inconsistencies in B's statements: for example whether or not B has actually seen the fight between her mother and Mr J on Christmas Day 2009.  Miss Hansen thought that there had been some misunderstanding over interpretation of what B had said about that in her first affirmation.  Mr. Devereux put it to Miss Hansen that there was an inconsistency between what B had said about going back as recounted by Miss Hansen in her two affirmations and her oral evidence.  As summarised by Mr Devereux, she had initially said she would not go back (first affirmation, paragraph [17]), then that if her mother and children went back, she would have to go back (second affirmation, paragraph [8]), then that she definitely would not go back (oral evidence).  Miss Hansen acknowledged that B had said different things, but did not think that this amounted to a level of inconsistency that undermined the force of her objections.  By the date of the hearing, her views had evolved, so that she was clear she does not want to go back and will not go.  Miss Hansen did not think this indicated a lack of maturity.  On the contrary, she thought it showed a capacity to reflect on things.  Furthermore, Miss Hansen did not agree with Mr Devereux's proposition that B's expressed antipathy towards her father as a result of his attempts to force her to return was a sign of immaturity - in Mr Devereux's words, an inability to separate emotions and feelings towards her father from an understanding of thought processes.  Miss Hansen interpreted B as saying that, if her father forced her to do something that she really did not want to do, she would not be interested in a relationship with him.  Miss Hansen discussed with B the undertakings that the father had offered.  B still objected to returning.  Miss Hansen thought that these were her own ideas and not merely aligning herself with her mother.</p>

He submitted that it was an overwhelming case for moving to the discretion stage.  Mr Devereux demurred.  He returned to his theme that there were material inconsistencies in what B had said that were relevant when determining whether there was any objection and also at the discretion stage, if that stage was reached.  I think Mr Devereux overstates the significance of the so-called inconsistencies. At no point has B said that she would go back, save at one point when she indicated that, if the rest of her family were forced to go back, then "I suppose I would then have to go".  Such a return would manifestly be under duress and could not remotely be described as indicating a willingness to go or anything other than an objection.  In any event, B is now saying that she will not go in any circumstances.</p>

It has been previously established, and is accepted by all parties in these proceedings, that he suffers from ADHD.  This should not prevent him from retaining or considering information when making a decision, but it may mean that he does not take in, or appropriately attend to, everything that is said to him.  Dr Scott commented that it had also been suggested that he was on the autistic spectrum, but as already stated Dr Scott concluded that he did not have this diagnosis, although he has some features commonly associated with it: for example, a tendency to talk quickly about matters of interest to him.  Dr Scott's tests revealed that he is functioning adaptively at roughly 18 months below his chronological age.  She added, however, that this does not equate to delayed development or learning disability, but does indicate that he should not be assumed to be socially, communicatively or adaptively as competent as other 12 year olds.  Intellectually he is at the low average level.</p>

He said that he disliked his stepfather and did not feel safe with him, that he does not want to leave his mother and did not want her to return to Germany because he was worried about the way they used to live.  He described to Miss Hansen how he had been hit by Mr J, and as stated above B confirmed that this had happened. He also told Miss Hansen that he did not want to live with his father, although he said he was happy to visit Germany for a holiday and "expressed real joy in spending time with his father".  In her oral evidence, Miss Hansen spoke of her preliminary conversation of R saying that he had complained of bullying and the atmosphere at his German school where the other children made him feel angry and unhappy.  She said that B had told her that R did not want to go back and wants to stay her.  B had said that R does not like his school in Germany and did not like boarding.</p>

On the first occasion, on 4 June 2010, he reiterated some of what he had said about the school to Miss Hansen, although he did not use the word &#8220;bullying&#8221;.  He also repeated what he had said about ill-treatment by his stepfather.  He said that he would like to stay in England, and that the school here is better because there are subjects that are not available in Germany.  He said that the weather was better. He shrugged his shoulders and said he "did not know" how he would feel if the court made an order that he had to return to Germany, even if this meant he did not have contact with his stepfather or return to his old school.  When Ms Jolly asked him if he had any worries about returning home without his mother and sisters, he said he did not have any such worries but seemed to think that they would return with him.  In general conversation at the end of this first visit, Ms Jolly elicited the information that R supports Bayern Munich and was intending to support Germany in the World Cup which was then about to start.</p>

However, he was somewhat less forthcoming in this second conversation.  When Ms Jolly asked why they were meeting again, R said it was because his father was horrible for wanting him to return to Germany.  Her report continues: "asked what he would do if the judge said he had to return to Germany, R made an open gesture with his hands and said &#8216;don't know&#8217;.  He screwed his nose up and pointed his thumb down when asked how he would feel if he had to return.  He again replied he did not know what he would do if he had to return.  R said he knows his mother and B would like to remain in England. Before I even completed the question about any worries he may have that he could return without them, R immediately replied &#8216;don't know&#8217;&#8221; whereupon he changed the subject.</p>

However, whilst she recorded that R has said he did not want to return to Germany, it seemed to her that his views were rooted in a need not to return to a particular situation rather than the country itself.  Furthermore, he did not say categorically what he would do if ordered to return and she thought he might be sufficiently biddable to be persuaded with reassurance.  Ms Jolly thought, however, that he should not be made to feel undue pressure to impart his views because he seemed to be "very conflicted and feel that he is being expected to choose between his parents".  It was Ms Jolly's opinion that R's express views could not be taken as &#8220;objections&#8221; in Convention terms.  She sought to distinguish between an objection and a preference, but to Mr Gupta she accepted that his views were "rooted in reality" and acknowledged that the question whether he had objections which ought to be taken into account was a matter for the court.</p>

Mr Gupta, however, reminded me of the dictionary definition of &#8220;objection&#8221; as "the action of stating something in opposition to a purpose or thing".  He submitted that Ms Jolly&#8217;s assessment on this point had fallen into the trap identified by Wilson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W</span>.  Ultimately, this is, as Ms Jolly acknowledged, a matter for the court, and in my judgment, looking at the totality of the evidence, R has clearly indicated that he is opposed to returning to Germany, most obviously by his thumbs down gesture in the second interview.

Even where an embryonic defence is made out, it may well be neutralised by undertakings or other protective measures that are or can be put in place, and to buttress such measures the court should be proactive and instigate steps in Germany via the European judicial network.  In this case the father is willing to undertake not to pursue any <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> applications in relation to the children; not to separate the children from the mother pending an <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> hearing in Germany; not to go near any address at which the mother and children will be residing, save for contact; not to promote or encourage any criminal prosecution of the mother for child abduction, and to use his best endeavours to withdraw the complaint already made; to provide reasonable accommodation for the mother and children pending an <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> hearing; and to pay for maintenance at an agreed rate.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On the specific issue of domestic violence, Mr Devereux submits that the court is not in a position to embark on a fact-finding exercise about it.  He submits that the court should tread cautiously, bearing in mind what he identifies as inconsistencies in the evidence about such violence put before the court by the mother and B.  The father is, of course, not the perpetrator of the alleged violence, and the court cannot utilise undertakings to achieve any protection for the mother and the children.  Mr Devereux points out, however, that the German legal system affords remedies to victims of domestic violence, reminds me again of the provisions of Article 11(4) of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span>, and submits that the mother has demonstrated, after the incident at Christmas 2009, that she is able and willing to use court orders to achieve protection for the family.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of B, Mr Scott-Manderson QC whilst resting his case principally on the objections defence, contends that there is a real risk that the disruptions caused by violence that have so scarred the family would re-enter the lives of the children on their return to Germany, and that this will impact severely on B.  He submits that no child should be required to undergo the stresses and strains that an attempted summary return may invoke in the circumstances which pertain in this case.  B has endured life experiences that no child should be expected to endure, and Mr Scott-Manderson QC reminds me of Baroness Hale's observations in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>), at paragraph [52], that:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is, however, another aspect to the Article 13(b) defence that gives rise to greater concern in this case.  Were I to conclude that B's objections are sufficient to justify a refusal to return her, the question then arises whether by returning R alone, without B, his mother or A, I would be giving rise to a grave risk of harm or placing him in an intolerable situation.  The authorities cited by Ms Honeyman demonstrate that this is a potential conclusion, depending on the facts of the case.  In this case I find that, B and R are close in age, 19 months apart, and full siblings who have always lived together.  Ms Honeyman reminds me that it is recognised that the sibling relationship is generally the most enduring of all human relationships and of great importance and value to children.  Here B and R have gone through difficult life experiences together.  It is to my mind noticeable that R was confident in the first meeting with Ms Jolly that if he returned his mother and sister would accompany him, and particularly striking that in the second interview he demonstrated (by answering "don't know" before she had even completed the question) that the prospect of returning without them is extremely difficult for him.  Ms Jolly concluded that "potentially summary return may place R in an intolerable situation if separated from his sibling, particularly B whom he has lived with all his life, and from his mother ...To separate the siblings could be a breach of their right to family life."</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Scott-Manderson QC submits that all these considerations are engaged when a court is considering how to exercise its discretion in respect of B&#8217;s objections.  On the one side, there is a very important matter of the policy under the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span> reinforced by <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span> to protect children from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal and to ensure their proper return to the state of their habitual residence.  On the other hand, as Mr Scott-Manderson QC submits, B's objections have real weight and substance. I find that they are rooted in the reality of her life, a considered appreciation of the advantages of her life in England, and a mature and sober assessment of the damaging effect that domestic violence has had on her life in Germany.  B believes that, were she to be returned to Germany, there is a real risk that domestic violence will return to her life.  She does not trust her mother's capacity to protect her and her siblings from that violence, unless there is a significant distance between them and Mr J.  Mr Scott-Manderson QC submits that the availability of legal measures to protect the family is not a complete answer to her objections.  As B told Miss Hansen, she is "worried that if her mother went back to Germany they would end up in the same predicament with Mr J and she [is] worried for R's and A's safety".  On the other hand, as she also told Miss Hansen, "here I don't need to worry about R and A and I know they are safe and happy".  She has a real direct experience of violence being perpetrated on her mother and the children.  She recognises the risks, and feels the need to protect herself and her siblings.  Mr Scott-Manderson QC submits that B's objections have not been shaped by pressure from her mother, but are authentically her own; driven by her own life experiences. Furthermore, they coincide with some, though not all, of the other considerations relevant to her future welfare.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Devereux in response relied again on what he described as the inconsistencies in B's attitude to return.  As I have already indicated, I think he significantly overstates the importance of those alleged inconsistencies, if indeed they can properly be so described.  He is on stronger ground when he identifies other welfare considerations which he suggests point in favour of a return.  He rightly reminds me that B has spent almost all her life in Germany.  As a result, she has strong family links in Germany as well as a network of friends.  He points to concerns about the quality of the education she may receive her, citing a poor OFSTED Report on her school in Devon.  Most important of all, he says, is the significant damage that will be caused to B's relationship with her father if she is not returned summarily.  These factors, combined with the availability of protective measures in Germany which he says is relevant to the exercise of the discretion on the child's objections to defence even if, as I conclude, Article 11(4) of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span> only applies to the Article 13(b) defence under the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span>, plus the general policy considerations underpinning the Convention, should, Mr Devereux submits, lead the court to order B's return.</p>

I agree that a preponderance of the factors identified by Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M (Abduction: Zimbabwe</span>) point in favour of refusing to return B to Germany on the grounds of those objections.  Those objections are, I find, strong, clear, considered, consistent, congruent with many of her welfare interests, and authentically her own. But of course I am not considering B's objections in isolation when exercising the court&#8217;s discretion.  I have to consider them alongside R's position and the discretion that arises as a result of my decision to take account of his objections (as I have found them to be) and also my finding that to return R alone would place him in an intolerable position.</p>

On behalf of the mother, Mr Gupta is less inhibited.  He submits R's objections, like his sister's, are rooted in reality, namely his experience of abuse, his views about his school in Germany and his preference for life in England.  Mr Devereux, on the other hand, points persuasively, in addition to the factors he identified in respect of B, to R&#8217;s clear association with  Germany, (demonstrated by his support for the German football team), and the fact that his functioning difficulties are being addressed with well-established professional support in that country.</p>

Thus, once the court has made the finding that a return would place a child in an intolerable situation, it is highly probable, indeed almost inevitable, that it will exercise its discretion by refusing to return the child.  In this case, therefore, I conclude that R cannot be returned alone.  The ultimate question is whether I should order that both B and R should return or exercise my discretion by refusing to return either of them.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"> In exercising my discretion, I have not for one moment forgotten the very important policy under the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention</span> as well as the general principles of comity.  I have also carefully considered one final authority Mr Devereux deployed in his well-argued and comprehensive submissions on his client's behalf, namely <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">TB v JB (Abduction: Grave Risk of Harm</span><span style="font-style:italic">)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 515" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 515</ref>, in which the Court of Appeal (Laws and Arden LJJ, Hale LJ, as she then was, dissenting) reached the opposite conclusion.  However, although I have carefully considered that authority, and in particular Arden LJ&#8217;s analysis, it seems to me that it is of limited relevance to the decision I have to take. First, as Mr Scott-Manderson QC points out, and as the case title selected by the court reporter implies, it is primarily a decision about 13(b).  The court at first instance had found that a return to New Zealand would expose the children to psychological harm as well as being contrary to the elder child's objections.  The majority of the appellate court held that the judge had failed to take account of protective measures that could be implemented in New Zealand, that no grave risk of harm arose, and that the older child&#8217;s objections were outweighed by other factors, including the need to keep the siblings together.  Secondly, I remind myself that the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">TB v JB</span> is nearly ten years old and the intervening years have undoubtedly seen an evolution in the court's approach to children's objections for the reason identified by Baroness Hale in both <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>) and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M (Abduction: Zimbabwe)</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>) at paragraphs [57] and [46] respectively, and latterly by Wilson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">supra</span>) at paragraph [17]. Finally, it is important to note that, for all the citation of authority that characterises abduction cases in this jurisdiction, in most cases the outcome ultimately turns on its own facts.</p>

For, as stated above, under Article 10 of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels II Revised</span>, it is the German court that retains jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility until the children acquire habitual residence in this country, or unless the jurisdiction of the English court is prorogued under Article 12(3) (as to which, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re I</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2010/10" uk:canonical="[2010] UKSC 10" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] UKSC 10</ref>), or unless the jurisdiction were to be transferred pursuant to Article 15.
