He has mild learning difficulties and suffers from a paedophilic disorder.  He has a history of fire-setting and self-harm and a tendency to try to make contact with children for sexual gratification, though there is no suggestion that he has ever committed any offences of that kind.  He maintains contact with his mother, with whom he spends the weekend every three weeks.</span></p>

After 18 months, he was discharged into supported residential care.  In 2005, a guardianship order was made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.7</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>, allowing the local authority to determine where he should live, and a number of placements followed.  Efforts were made to reduce the level of supervision, but after an increase in sexualised behavior, one-to-one supervision was reintroduced.  Even then, in 2010 he was found to be dropping notes for children, despite being supervised in the community.  This led on one occasion to an angry relative trying to lure him to a meeting with a view to harming him.  He had to leave the home he was in and has been resident in his current placement since September 2010.</span></p>

In form, this is a challenge to a standard authorisation granted by the local authority to the management of the residential placement as long ago as April 2013.  N&#8217;s application was issued in April 2014, just as the authorisation was about to expire.  Since then, the deprivation of liberty has been authorised by interim orders of the court.  In July 2015, the Official Solicitor was once again invited to act on behalf of N.  I comment at the end of this judgment on the length of time it has taken to resolve the matter.</span></p>

N&#8217;s application was made in July 2014 and dismissed by the First Tier Tribunal in September 2014.  His appeal against that decision was dismissed by the Upper Tribunal in March 2015.</span></p>

I have heard evidence from three witnesses: DM, the local authority&#8217;s specialist care manager, who has known N since 2009, and bases his own assessment on that of a multi-disciplinary team; MM, a registered mental health nurse, who carried out a capacity and best interests assessment in June 2015; and Dr Richard Noon, consultant forensic psychiatrist jointly instructed by the parties, who carried out a capacity assessment in March 2016.  Although the emphasis varied between the witnesses, each of them considers that N&#8217;s learning disability, combined with his paedophilic disorder, makes him unable to understand and weigh the risks that he poses to himself and others if he was unsupervised in the community.  Although N has undertaken three SOCSET sexual offending courses, they have not achieved any real change in his thinking.  The professionals all consider that he would be likely to succumb to temptation if he was not supervised, and that this could lead to serious consequences for him in the form of criminal sanctions or reprisals.</span></p>

I note, however, that when speaking to MM he described his feelings for children as natural, saying that everyone has them to some extent.  Also, for some years, he has expressed a wish to adopt a child, despite being repeatedly counselled that this is unrealistic.  These are to my mind clear examples of his inability to understand the issues that have to be considered when making decisions about his care arrangements.  I note Dr Noon&#8217;s view that they might also be an example of minimization, but he too considered that N&#8217;s paedophilic disorder probably also affects his capacity, though the fundamental difficulty springs from his learning disability.</span></p>

He draws attention to the fact that he has not offended and shows some recognition of his situation by looking for support when he wants it.  Also, he says (and has said to professionals) that he has shown that he understands that his feelings about children are wrong and that they would lead to punishment if acted on.  Mr O&#8217;Brien accordingly argues that while N&#8217;s capacity may be affected by his conditions, it has not been shown that he lacks capacity.</span></p>

His learning disability deprives him of insight into the persistence of his paedophilic disorder.  For him to go into the community alone would not be merely an unwise decision, but an action taken without any real understanding or balancing of the risks he poses and the risks he faces.</span></p>

The boundaries that are being set allow N to develop in a way that he is not able to achieve for himself.  The level of risk if he was unsupervised is real and the nature of the risk is serious.  It could lead to N being returned to a prison or hospital environment indefinitely, quite apart from the risk of a violent response from others.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The central question is whether the measures are proportionate to the risks, also taking account of the benefits of more freedom.  These are not negligible, but they are in my view markedly outweighed by the need to reduce the risk to N&#8217;s wellbeing from a lack of supervision.  I accept that it is a serious infringement of liberty to be unable to go into the world as and when one chooses, but instead to have to fit around the availability of others and be limited in where one goes.  The presence of constant supervision is also a real infringement of privacy.  I also accept that N has not engaged in any obviously risky behaviour for the past six years.  However, that is best seen as showing the success of the supervision arrangements, rather than showing them to be unnecessary.  Overall, I conclude the arrangements that are in place are proportionate and necessary.  There is no lesser form of interference, in the form of medication or treatment, that could be offered.  My conclusion is that nothing material has changed since the hearing before Moor J.   I also take note of the fact that N&#8217;s mother, who takes a close and sympathetic interest, does not think it would be right to remove supervision.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">There is, however, agreement that the efforts to relax supervision whenever possible should continue.  The granting of a deprivation of liberty authorisation permits controls but does not compel them.  Furthermore, a search is now going on to find a smaller, more domestic placement that might be more suitable for N.  A potentially suitable placement has been identified and it is currently considering whether it can offer a place to N.  The fact that it will be possible for him to be supervised where necessary will not make it any harder to find a suitable placement, and may in fact make it easier.  I would encourage the local authority to continue with this process and hope that it is successful.  </span></p>

In response, Mr O&#8217;Brien argues that if the court is to authorise at all, it should only do so for a period of weeks to allow the local authority to pursue the normal statutory process.   He points out that a standard authorisation cannot be granted for more than one year: Sch. A1 paragraph 42.  So far, the court has already authorised an additional deprivation of liberty for 2&#189; years.</span></p>

I agree that the court should only extend the period of its authorisation for long enough to allow the local authority to get matters back onto a proper footing.  To deal with the possibility that N will again challenge the likely standard authorisation, I will direct that any such application should be referred to me on the issue for directions or summary disposal. </span></p>

The short answer is that the question of an extension for longer than 12 months should not have arisen at all because the proceeding should have been concluded within, say, six months.  </span></p>
