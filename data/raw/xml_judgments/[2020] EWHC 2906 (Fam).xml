	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The Appellant father is BSA and the Respondent mother is NVT. They have two minor children: K and A. The children live with their mother in the former family home and the father lives in Switzerland. In 2018 the mother commenced proceedings under Schedule 1 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. The parties agreed a consent order concluding those proceedings on 11 December 2018, the order being approved by DDJ O&#8217;Leary; this appears to have been made after an FDR. Both parties were represented, and the mother had leading counsel. In summary, the order recorded the parties&#8217; agreement that the father would make a housing fund of &#163;2.75 million available for the purchase of a new home for the mother and the children. It also makes provision for periodical payments and some other capital sums and a costs award.  Upon the father taking specialist tax advice, a further order dated 13 February 2019 was agreed specifying the mechanics of implementation. </p>

The deemed date of service was 9 March 2020, the Court having sent the notice on 6 March 2020. According to the chronology the father applied to renew his application for permission to appeal at an oral hearing on 16 March 2020. On 30 March 2020 Knowles J directed that the application for oral renewal be listed before her on the first open date after the Easter vacation. The hearing was given a time estimate of one hour for submissions with one hour for reading and one hour for judgement. She directed that an Essential Reading list be provided. No such list appears in the bundle provided to me or in the skeleton argument and so I have had to identify myself what appeared to be necessary to determine the application. The respondent was not required to attend. The stay on the order of HH J Oliver was reimposed.  </p>

Further submissions are included in the application to admit new evidence and to amend the Grounds of Appeal. A witness statement accompanies the application for disclosure of information about how the mother funded the litigation. Ms Julyan supplemented and expanded upon various aspects of the written documents during her oral submissions. Her principal focus during the time allotted to her submissions was on the application to admit further evidence/Disclosure and to amend the Grounds of appeal rather than on the substantive application for permission to appeal itself. For reasons which were not explained to me the father&#8217;s team had not complied with the direction given by Knowles J in her order of 30 March 2020 (which reflect FPR PD 30A4.14) to file a statement setting out the reasons why permission </p>

Although the application issued on 1 October 2020 is framed as an application for disclosure of information, in her submissions Ms Julian emphasised that it was in effect an extension of the application to admit further evidence in that it sought to uncover how the mother had funded the Children Act proceedings over the course of late 2019 and 2020 notwithstanding that the order for payment of a costs allowance had been stayed for the majority of that period. The effect of granting either application she submitted would require this hearing be adjourned in order to revise the Grounds of Appeal and to file a supplemental skeleton argument. She said that amended draft grounds had not been provided to the court because the father&#8217;s team were under the impression that the court had refused to accept such. I was unable to find any order and usually draft amended grounds would accompany the application. However during submissions Ms Julyan and I clarified that the nature of the draft grounds would be to the effect that the evidence demonstrated that the mother had misled the court as to her true financial position and that had the court been aware of the information now before the court it would not have been satisfied that the test for making a costs allowance order was met. </p>

Nothing in the evidence that the father seeks to admit suggests that this was wrong. The fact that the mother has remained represented throughout the Children Act proceedings does not prove that as of October 8, 2019 she was either misleading the court or was in a position to pay her solicitors. The payments that can be identified have been explained. The arrangements that the mother has been able to make to retain representation do not demonstrate that the basis for the order was wrong nor does the fact of representation alone have a material impact on the outcome of the appeal. The adverse effects of the stay of the order meant the mother would have been unrepresented had some means not been found to affect that. I do not know how that was done but it does not demonstrate that the basis upon which HHJ Oliver made his order was wrong and thus I do not consider that admitting that evidence would have a material impact on the outcome of the appeal. </p>

However to seek to deploy evidence of the outcome of proceedings in order to attack a costs allowance order would be to encourage an ex post facto assessment by which a party seeks to unravel interlocutory orders on the basis of what the final outcome was.

First, the matters said to have been breached by the father were recitals to the December 2018 consent order and thus not terms ordered by the court itself. They merely established contractual terms which might be enforceable in civil proceedings. Second, those matters went beyond the allowable orders the court might make in Schedule 1 proceedings. To allow enforcement of such terms would be going beyond that permitted by statute. Ms Julyan supplemented the Skeleton Argument. She submitted that the February 2019 order provided a mechanism by which a property would be purchased for the mother and children and provided on a long lease. This was not an order that the court could have made: she relied on paragraph 86 of <span style="font-style:italic">DN-v-UD</span> and the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> itself.

The order of December 2018 was a standard family court consent order. Rule 33 of the FPR 2010 contains provisions relating to applications for the family court to enforce an order made in family proceedings. Orders made pursuant to Schedule 1 fall within the ambit of that Rule. The agreement contained in the December 2018 order provided for the father to purchase a property for the benefit of the mother and the children and section 1(2)(d) of Schedule 1 gives the power to </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">make an order for the settlement of property for the benefit of the child. The recital to the December 2018 order fell squarely within what was lawfully permissible under Schedule 1. I accept the submissions made by the mother that this analysis accords with Chapter 24.43 of Rayden and Jackson on Divorce which states that, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">where an order of the court consists in part of a recital containing an agreement imposing an obligation on a party, and in part an order, the recital may be enforced provided the court would have had jurisdiction to make an order in like terms</span>&#8221;. The December 2018 order complies with this requirement.  In any event the December 2018 order contains other matters whether in the recitals or in the formal part of the order (including periodical payments) which plainly would permit the court to attach a penal notice to it. The penal notice that HHJ Oliver provided for was not limited to any specific paragraph of the December 2018 order but rather referred to it in its entirety. In addition, I accept, as submitted by Mr Day, that a penal notice is in effect a warning of the possibility of committal proceedings. Although it is part of the enforcement toolkit it is a precursor to true enforcement. The father&#8217;s arguments that the order is not capable of enforcement because it is in truth an agreement not susceptible to enforcement by committal could of course form part of a defence to an application to commit for failure to comply but I do not accept that there is any merit in the ground that the order of December 2018 could not properly have a penal notice attached to it. </p>

The father is very wealthy whereas the mother still owed large sums to her representatives (both Vardags and Russells) from the previous proceedings, which were meant to be paid by the mother.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Ground 4 asserts that the judge was wrong in making a costs allowance without the mother having given full and frank disclosure regarding her financial position. The father does not particularise in what way the mother&#8217;s disclosure is said to be lacking. It is of note that it was the father who was singled out for his lack of compliance with directions and omission of full and frank disclosure. The jurisprudence in relation to costs allowances sets out the approach that the court is required to take. It is not a requirement that an applicant makes full and frank financial disclosure. The court needs to be satisfied that the applicant requires costs allowance in order to provide equality of arms and that involves demonstrating that she is unable to obtain legal representation without a costs funding order. That requires some evidence of the individual&#8217;s current income and capital position and their inability to fund legal representation at the required level from their own resources, an inability to borrow the money or to secure funding from legal aid or other resources. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The father also submitted that the costs allowance order should not have been made until the mother had attempted to raise funds by way of a litigation loan. Though he accepted she had approached two lenders, he asserted this was a sham as those lenders had been previously approached by her in 2018. It is of note that some of the rejection letters exhibited to the mother&#8217;s witness statement explain the high improbability of obtaining funding for children proceedings from a litigation funder. That was a matter of fact for the judge who declared himself satisfied that the mother had looked at various lenders and who had taken account of her indebtedness in costs to her present and former legal advisers. I refuse permission to appeal in respect of this ground of appeal.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The final substantive ground sought to suggest that the judge was wrong to make a costs allowance order when the father had already offered to advance the mother the funds to cover her legal expenditure. The &#163;50,000 to be advanced to the mother formed part of the order of December 2018 and the terms of paragraph 5(vii) are outwith the mother&#8217;s ongoing need for monies to pursue her applications. It would have been wholly inappropriate for her to pledge any money received from the father for the benefit of the children to meet legal fees which were not the intended purpose of the monies. There was, in those circumstances, no need for the judge to deal with this submission in his judgment.  </p>

I dismiss the application for disclosure of the means by which the mother funded legal representation. I do not consider that the father has demonstrated a realistic prospect of success in relation to any of his grounds of appeal nor is there any other compelling reason to grant permission and I therefore affirm the decision of Mrs Justice Knowles to refuse permission to appeal. The stay on the order will be discharged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Day accepts that the starting point in relation to costs on an oral application for permission to appeal is that if the court does not request submissions from or attendance by the respondent costs will not normally be allowed to a respondent who volunteers submissions or attendance [FPR PD30A 4.22]. However he says in this case the court did in effect request submissions from the mother (the order is framed if so advised) and when the matter was listed for an oral hearing she was not required to attend. The order also said that she was not required to attend as the court had her written submissions under costs estimate. It noted that the father should be aware that, if unsuccessful, he may be required to pay her costs in connection with this appeal. Mr Day notes that CPR PD 52B para 8.1 supplements FPR PD 30 A. Whilst it notes that costs will not be awarded to the respondent where they attend an application for permission to appeal that is subject to the proviso where the court has ordered or requested attendance by the respondent or where the court has ordered that the application for permission to appeal be listed at the same time as the determination of other applications or where the court considers it just in all the circumstances to award costs to the respondent. Mr Day notes that there has been significant non-compliance by the father with the procedural requirements (for instance failing to provide the statement required setting out what points would be taken at the oral permission hearing) and that the late filing of the application of the 1 October 2020 with the associated application to adjourn this hearing meant that the mother&#8217;s team had to attend. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Ms Julyan submitted that the court ought to apply the usual rule for costs on oral permission hearing. She characterised the other applications as ancillary and only requiring a response by the mother in the substantive appeal had they been allowed. In relation to the amount of costs she referred to an earlier costs schedule which she thought had been served last week. I note that a costs schedule appears to have been served in June and it may be that which she was referring to. She said that costs schedule was substantially lower than this and that the increasing costs in the course of a week was inexplicable. She also noted that the costs schedule claimed for various items which appeared excessive including seven hours attendance at court for today&#8217;s hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case to make a costs order. The court in effect requested submissions from the mother in the paper application which were plainly of significant assistance to Knowles J in determining that, as they have been to me. Whilst the mother&#8217;s attendance at this hearing was not requested the listing of the two other applications in particular that of 1 October 2020 made her attendance in effect unavoidable. As the father submitted the effect of granting that application would have been to further adjourn the hearing of the appeal which has now almost reached the first anniversary of the making of the order under appeal. It was therefore entirely appropriate and indeed inevitable that the mother&#8217;s team would attend in order to oppose that course of action. I&#8217;m satisfied that they were right to do so. I&#8217;m therefore satisfied that the situation falls within that contemplated by both the FPR and the CPR and that it is just in all the circumstances to award costs to the mother. The disparity in the parties&#8217; financial positions adds further force to my conclusion that this is the just result. The costs schedule covers the period from February through till today, incorporating the written submissions on the original application for permission, the written submissions on the June application and the preparation for and attendance at today&#8217;s hearing. I note that Counsel&#8217;s fee for attendance today is &#163;1,250. I do not have a costs schedule from the father against which to benchmark the mother&#8217;s costs but they do not appear to me to be excessive given the amount of paperwork which has had to be considered in relation to these applications. Ms Julyan is right to point out that seven hours attendance by the solicitor for today&#8217;s hearing has not proven necessary, the oral submissions only lasting some two hours. Subject to that the other amounts claimed seem to me to be reasonable and so I will summarily assessed the solicitors costs at a total of  &#163;15,500 together with counsel&#8217;s fees of &#163;5,750 plus VAT making a total in my calculation of &#163;25,500. That will be payable within 14 days of today.  </p>
