The father made an application to Lord Brailsford, the Lord Ordinary, sitting in the Court of Session, on 25 January 2017. It may be helpful for me to set out the essential provisions in his fairly short order: </span></p>

He puts at the forefront of his case, understandably, the submission that in the circumstances it is appropriate and proper for this court, acting in comity with the courts of Scotland, to grant relief so as to make efficacious in this part of the United Kingdom the relief previously granted in relation to Scotland by Lord Brailsford.  </span></p>

It is perfectly apparent to me from the papers I have read, and also - and this is a significant matter - from the very fact that Lord Brailsford thought it appropriate to make such an order in Scotland, that this is indeed a case in which I should grant the relief sought without notice.  I am satisfied that if notice was given of this application to the mother there is, as Mr. Perkins&#8217; client fears, a very real prospect indeed that she would re-abduct the child, either taking the child abroad or moving to some other place either in this country or some other part of the United Kingdom.  </span></p>

The first will be a location order in standard form, including a passport order in relation to the passports both of the child and of the mother.  The other order is an order seeking disclosure in the usual form from the child&#8217;s school as to the child&#8217;s address and whereabouts; it being contemplated that this order will not be executed if, as is anticipated, the Tipstaff is able within short order successfully to execute the location order.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I mention one matter which arises as a matter of judicial comity.  There is, as I have mentioned, an order from the Court of Session requiring the delivery by the mother of the child&#8217;s passports to the Messenger-at-Arms.  The location order I am making, of course, requires the delivery of those passports and, as I have said, also her own passports to the Tipstaff.  That is an order which I make not with any intention of cutting across the order made by Lord Brailsford.  On the contrary, it is an order I make so as to enable his order to be implemented as it were, from his perspective, &#8220;outside the jurisdiction&#8221;.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">My assumption, although I stress it is only an assumption bearing in mind that this case has come on at short notice, is that, just as the Tipstaff has no jurisdiction outside England and Wales, the Messenger-at-Arms has no jurisdiction outside Scotland. So the passport order I propose to make is intended to make efficacious the order which the Court of Session has made in circumstances where, having successfully crossed the border, the mother has seemingly put herself outside the reach of the Messenger-at-Arms.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In the circumstances, Mr. Perkins suggests, and I agree, that the location order - which will be made in the standard form - should be understood as authorising the Tipstaff, having seized the passports, to retain the passports in his control until the return day which I agree with Mr. Perkins should be in seven days&#8217; time.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">For those reasons, and because an application of this kind arising as between Scotland and England is something I have not come across before - indeed Mr. Perkins with his great experience of these matters is unaware of such a case having arisen previously - it seemed to me appropriate to give this very brief judgment.  I shall direct that the judgment is to be transcribed as a matter of urgency at public expense.  </span></p>
