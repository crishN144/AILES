It is extremely important, Mr Gupta submits, that the father should not be put into such a state of mind that he feels compelled to move again.  I agree with Mr Gupta that transmission of information to the father in the United States must be dealt with sensitively and, if I am to exercise jurisdiction,  that the Court should move cautiously and slowly in relation to these children.</span></p>

She does not know whether they have in fact been living there since throughout the period since their removal and whether they can be said to be there as part of their settled order of existence, even if only on a temporary basis.  Mr Gupta submits that as at the date of their removal in late July 2008 the children were habitually resident within this jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  He submits that the mother has rights of custody as their mother (she has in English terminology, &#8216;parental responsibility&#8217; for them) and she did not consent to their removal, and if she did not consent the children&#8217;s removal, therefore, was wrongful within the meaning of the Hague Convention.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mr Gupta has referred me to authorities within this jurisdiction and also to decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Firstly, he refers me to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re A (Abduction:  Rights of Custody: Imprisonment) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 1 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 1 FLR 1</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.  In that English decision it was established that parental responsibility is not suspended by the parent being imprisoned.  Custody may curtail the practical impact of parental responsibility but the plaintiff mother is still entitled to consent to or to refuse the removal of her children from the jurisdiction.  The President of the Family Division, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, then the senior family judge in this jurisdiction, made it clear that the imprisonment of a parent did not in any way prevent that parent from having the right to object to the removal of the child out of the jurisdiction.  The point was also confirmed by Mr Justice Bennett, a very senior judge of the Family Division, in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re L (A child) [2006] 1FLR 843</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, &#8216;Imprisonment of a parent does not extinguish or suspend his or her rights of custody&#8217;.</span></p>

At their present ages, their wishes and feelings also may need to be taken into account as the mother recognises. Where children have not seen or heard from a parent for many years then they may need some professional help or other guidance as to the benefits or otherwise of resuming contact with an absent parent.  Furthermore, it seems to me that notwithstanding the very serious background here, and however reprehensible the mother&#8217;s crime may be (and I know nothing about the detail of it), it does not necessarily mean that these children should not see her. Furthermore, it seems to me highly likely that they will need to have some information about her in order to come to terms with this very significant aspect of their family history.  I say that without in any way prejudging the way that I or another Judge might look at this case when or if the merits come before the Court.</span></p>

Stephen Cullen was asked, in the event that an English judge makes an order for contact, what is  the likelihood of it being enforced in the United States under Article 21 of the 1980 Hague Convention. He responded that the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) requires that all &#8216;child custody determinations&#8217; from foreign countries be recognised and enforced unless such orders &#8216;violate fundamental principles of human rights&#8217;. English &#8216;child custody determination&#8217; could not violate fundamental principles of human rights.  An English order will be recognised and will be enforced as long as three statutory elements are satisfied (1) the English Court had jurisdiction to make the order (2) notice and an opportunity to be heard was provided to the father and (3) the order has not been subsequently modified prior to registration and enforcement.  The US liaison judges can assist in the process pursuant to the UCCJEA.  He has experience of foreign orders being enforced pursuant to Article 21; there are few reported cases but there are many cases at trial level where this happens.  Voluntary organisations such as International Social Services (&#8216;ISS&#8217;) could provide an assessment.  The fact that the mother is serving a life-term for murder would not affect the prospects of enforceability.  Since there are only the three limited defences as described above, the procedure under Article 21 for registration and enforcement of an English order is reasonably swift in that as soon as the English order is registered, then the father is notified by the Court and has 20 days from the date of notification to file and contest the registration.  The matter is set on an expedited calendar and resolved extremely quickly and he would anticipate it would be resolved in a matter of months. The fact that neither the UK nor USA has as yet ratified the 1996 Hague Convention, although each has signed it, has no relevance.  If the English judge stayed these proceedings and the mother was compelled to start proceedings in New York State:</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mr Hinchliffe submits that there are public policy reasons why the English Court should not rule in this case because it is now a US case, but the contrary argument is that the Courts of this jurisdiction have international obligations in a case of wrongful removal.  Even if the children are now habitually resident there (and as I have said I can see the argument as to the effect of the mother&#8217;s decision not to seek their return) then this is one factor of the many which have to be considered.  I do not accept Mr Hinchliffe argument that there is no substantial connection with England and Wales since the mother is here and, indeed, Article 12(3) of Brussels II Revised (in the context of prorogation), defines &#8220;sufficient connection&#8221; to include the fact that one holder of parental responsibility is habitually resident in the country in which jurisdiction is sought to be exercised.  As the Supreme Court said in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re I</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> there are many examples of cases where the country of jurisdiction and the country of the children&#8217;s habitual residence may be different. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> In my judgment, on a stay application the considerations which the Court would have to balance are that the father and the children have been living outside England and Wales for over two-and-a-half years and the mother now accepts certainly for the time being they should remain there.  On the other hand, the mother&#8217;s case is that she did not agree to the children being removed.  The argument against a stay, of course, is that the mother&#8217;s proceedings have been extant now in this jurisdiction for over three years and although little progress has been made, the mother has public funding, an established specialist team on board, and Cafcass represent the children, even though so far they have been able to do little.  An order made pursuant to Article 21 is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">prima facie</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and swiftly enforceable.  There is no way in which the Court in the United States can, and I say this without criticism, provide the kind of professional input which is possible in this Court.  Most importantly, there are presently no proceedings in the United States of America and it is in effect, impossible for the mother to litigate in the United States of America, a jurisdiction which she has not chosen but in which it appears the father has chosen to live.</span></p>
