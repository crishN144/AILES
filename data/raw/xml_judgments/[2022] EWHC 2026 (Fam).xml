A factor in this deterioration was that H felt that he had been overwhelmed by his brother&#8217;s pressure that the wealth should be divided as above. The potential for the nephews ganging up together, outvoting and side-lining Amanda should have been obvious. </p>

As I set out in my substantive judgment, H totally excluded W from any knowledge, let alone discussion, of financial affairs and kept her in the dark. Consistent with his approach to minimising taxes and to keep control himself, for only a short time during this very long marriage did W ever hold any property assets of any sort other than her own bank account which contained modest (in the context of this case) savings.</p>

Since the Co-Ed payments stopped, she has provided him with large sums of money and has paid from her resources much of his legal costs and living expenses including payments towards the maintenance orders I had made. It is W&#8217;s belief that H transferred money to Amanda expressly for the purpose of her paying it back to him, but there is no evidence to support her proposition that the payments made by Amanda to him come from funds recently provided by her father to try and deceive the court as to his true financial position.</p>

Mr Dearle says and I accept that he was told from the outset by Martin Clarke (H&#8217;s personal advisor) that this provision was intended solely to cover H&#8217;s legal costs, even though the nephews did not put that in writing until March 2022. In my judgment it would not have been proper for Mr Dearle to pay it out to H for him to pay W when he had received the funds on a different basis.</p>

That sum was credited on 24 March 2021 to the company holding the yacht which was wholly owned by another company which in turn was wholly owned by Co-Ed. </p>

I also should have been told by H, but was not told, that there was a sum still to be paid at the time that I conducted the March 2021 hearing, and it is very likely that I would have made an order preserving the retained money if I had known of it.</p>

Another is that where a spouse enjoys access to wealth but no absolute entitlement to it (as in the case, for example, of a beneficiary under a discretionary trust or someone who is dependent on the generosity of a relative), the court will not act in direct invasion of the rights of, or usurp the discretion exercisable by, a third party. Nor will it put upon a third party undue pressure to act in a way which will enhance the means of the maintaining spouse. This does not, however, mean that the court acts in total disregard of the potential availability of wealth from sources owned or administered by others. There will be occasions when it becomes permissible for a judge deliberately to frame his orders in a form which affords judicious encouragement to third parties to provide the maintaining spouse with the means to comply with the court&#8217;s view of the justice of the case. There are bound to be instances where the boundary between improper pressure and judicious encouragement proves to be a fine one, and it will require attention to the particular circumstances of each case to see whether it has been crossed</span>.&#8221;</p>

What happens if the person being encouraged says very politely &#8220;Thank you for your encouragement, but I have decided not to assist&#8221;? Or, as here, &#8220;I am only prepared to assist to such and such an extent&#8221;. Is the court supposed to ignore that stance and simply make an award on the basis that the assistance will be given? What happens if and when it is not? How is the court supposed to enforce its order? It could hardly be said that the payer is in wilful default justifying a penalty under the Debtors Act 1869. It is for this reason that I expressed the view during argument that often the so called &#8220;judicious encouragement&#8221; can turn out to be no more than mere empty rhetoric.</span>&#8221;</p>
