(These four males are described in this judgment as &#8216;associated males&#8217;; they are associated with Child G, but &#8211; as I explain a little below [17](iii) &#8211; have minimal associations with each other).

The application was listed for final hearing before me in Leeds on 19 October.  Interim injunctive orders had been made separately by both Keehan and MacDonald JJ, to protect Child G from those associations; interim Reporting Restriction Orders had also been made at those hearings, which had been held in public, to prohibit the publication of the names of Child G and the four males.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I granted the application of the Times Newspapers Limited to conduct the substantial part of this final hearing in public.  That said, early in the hearing, I was expressly invited by Ms Heaton QC to hold, and indeed did hold, a short private hearing in which only the representatives and parties to the wardship (counsel for local authority and counsel for Child G) were present in court, in conformity with the default rule under <span style="font-style:italic">rule 27.10 FPR 2010</span>.  In this short hearing, Ms Heaton advised me that Rotherham Council, having considered with South Yorkshire Police the evidence filed for this final hearing, no longer considered it appropriate to pursue its applications for injunctions, and would seek to persuade me to discharge the existing interim injunctions; Ms Heaton indicated that Rotherham Council would seek no further orders within the wardship.  I was advised that the Council nonetheless would seek lifelong extensions of the Reporting Restriction Orders.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before I had asked the accredited members of the press to withdraw from court for this short hearing, and having no hint of what was to be shared with the court, I enquired whether Ms Heaton had in mind the provisions of<span style="font-style:italic"> rule 27.11</span> and<span style="font-style:italic"> PD27B FPR 2010</span> (i.e. the ordinary expectation of the attendance in private hearings of <span class="para2text">duly accredited representatives of news gathering and reporting organisations);</span> she confirmed that she did.   It was apparent by the end of the short hearing that nothing of relevance to the litigation had in fact been said which could not, and/or should not, be shared with South Yorkshire Police, the associated males, and/or the press. I gave Ms Heaton time to apprise the other parties of what she had advised me.  Later in the public hearing, at my suggestion, she repeated that which she had told me in private.  I set out this history to highlight that I consider that it was unnecessary for the court to sit in private for that part of the case, and/or to exclude the press from attending.  It is unfortunate that by inviting me to do so, an appearance may have been given that information was given to the court to which the interested parties would be denied access.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application for the lifelong Reporting Restriction Order was essentially uncontentious insofar as it relates to Child G, The Times Newspaper Limited arguing that it was not necessary for such an order to be made, but it would not be of itself objectionable.  However, in relation to the four associated males, the order was opposed by The Times Newspapers Limited.  In the circumstances I heard evidence from the Detective Sergeant supervising the Child Sexual Exploitation Team and the Detective Chief Inspector responsible for managing the child sexual exploitation work of the South Yorkshire Police; I had received uncontested written evidence from the social workers.  I heard submissions from all parties, and representations directly from Mr. Andrew Norfolk a journalist at The Times Newspaper.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nobody can doubt the evil of child sexual exploitation; this occurs when a young person (or a third person or persons) receives a reward &#8211; which can be food, accommodation, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, affection, gifts, money &#8211; in return for performing, and/or others performing on them, sexual activities. In all cases, those exploiting the child/young person have power over them by virtue of their age, gender, intellect, physical strength and/or economic or other resources. Violence, coercion and intimidation are common, involvement in exploitative relationships being characterised in the main by the child or young person's limited availability of choice resulting from their social/economic and/or emotional vulnerability.  Child sexual exploitation is an increasing phenomenon affecting children and young people, male and female, of all backgrounds and from all communities right across the UK.  It has been a particular concern to local authorities in densely and multicultural urban areas of the country.  It has been, as the report of the &#8216;Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham&#8217; (August 2014) (Alexis Jay OBE) makes clear, a particular issue in Rotherham.  This hearing took place in a week in which the issue has been given further prominence by the convictions of eight males from Rotherham for offences of rape, indecent assault, and false imprisonment of teenage girls in that town over a four-year period.  The Times newspaper and Mr. Norfolk in particular have been instrumental in exposing and highlighting this pernicious activity in press coverage extending over nearly six years.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This Local Authority, as all local authorities, has a heavy responsibility for the safeguarding of young people from child sexual exploitation; the South Yorkshire Police, in common with its law-enforcement colleagues around the country, have a similar duty conscientiously to investigate and prosecute such sexual crimes.  These bodies have a collective responsibility to work in partnership in the discharge of their respective duties, to share information conscientiously, and to maintain clear focus throughout their investigations about their common objectives.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That this case concludes now with the local authority seeking no further injunctive order does not reflect a failure on the part of the safeguarding investigation; nor does it reflect an overly-hasty rush to justice without proper consideration of the evidence.  I am satisfied that Rotherham Council had proper cause swiftly to take steps to protect a young person when the evidence appeared to indicate that she was at serious risk.  I am equally satisfied that, on the evidence then available, Keehan and MacDonald JJ were right to make interim injunctive orders.  Having considered the totality of the evidence with care myself at this stage (and specifically the matters in [17] below), I am equally satisfied that Rotherham Council has taken the appropriate course in seeking no further injunctive relief now.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Child G is a white female young person, in her late-teens.  She first came to the attention of the social services of Rotherham Council in 2012, when safeguarding issues were raised by her school about her poor state of mental health and general vulnerability.  These concerns have only periodically subsided over the course of the last four years; cumulatively, the concerns have, over that period, somewhat increased.  For lengthy periods Child G did not attend school; on numerous occasions, she disappeared from home, and was reported to the police as a missing child. She has self-harmed in different ways, on many occasions; she has been known to misuse prescribed drugs, and use non-prescribed drugs.  Her mother and father struggled at times to manage her behaviours.  In 2014, reports were received that she was spending time in the company of, and indeed was in relationships with, an Asian man or men.  It was known that she had personal and sexual relationships, sequentially, with NN, HH, and LL (in that order).  There were concerns about the nature of those relationships; there was evidence that NN and HH physically assaulted her.  At one time she complained to the police that she was being controlled by HH, and that he had attended at her home uninvited; on occasion, HH caused criminal damage to her home.  It was known that he has a number of convictions, including for offences associated with drugs and violence. LL has convictions, but MM and NN do not.  Child G reported to the police that she was fearful of HH.

MM had been to the hotel with them, but had returned home.  Child G was not known to have an association with either LL or MM.  Among the items found with them in the hotel were vodka, cannabis, condoms, and Asian female clothing. Police protection was immediately sought for Child G.  The officers attending at the scene believed that she was the victim of child sexual exploitation by LL and potentially the other males; she was immediately conveyed to, and placed in, a safe house.  LL and MM were arrested on suspicion of trafficking for sexual exploitation contrary to <span style="font-style:italic">section 2</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">section 3</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2015/30" uk:canonical="2015 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Modern Slavery Act 2015</ref></span>.  They were interviewed under caution, and were co-operative.  LL maintained that he was Child G&#8217;s current boyfriend, MM that he had simply driven LL to the hotel, and had not met Child G before.</p>

In the final analysis, and with the benefit of further evidence, including more detailed information from the South Yorkshire Police, the authority is no longer of the same mind.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before leaving the substantive issues, I wish to raise a concern about decision-making in this case.  In September 2015, a dedicated team (the &#8216;Evolve team&#8217;) was set up in Rotherham to work with victims of child sexual exploitation; the team comprises social workers, police officers, representatives from Barnardo&#8217;s, a specialist nurse, a CAMHS worker and a Personal Adviser for Child Exploitation; the team operates from offices in the same building.   On 9 August, at a meeting between social workers and police, a plan to apply for wardship in relation to Child G was discussed, with a view to placing her in secure accommodation; the South Yorkshire Police knew of, and supported, this plan.  Following the incident described at [14] above, Rotherham Council resolved to issue wardship proceedings, but instead of applying for an order authorising secure accommodation, decided to seek injunctions against the four associated males.  By a lapse in communication within the team, South Yorkshire Police were not told of this change in approach.   A further meeting was held on 15 August between police officers and social workers; the plan to apply for wardship was again agreed between them, but the detail of the specific relief to be sought was not discussed.   On 17 August Rotherham Council social workers told South Yorkshire Police officers that the wardship application would be made on the following day.  On 18 August, the application was made. From that date, South Yorkshire Police became involved in the present litigation, specifically in relation to the application for Reporting Restriction Orders.  When South Yorkshire Police filed its evidence, it was apparent that, while it had concerns about Child G, it did not actively support the application for injunctions against the four associated males; it confirmed the position set out at [17](i)-(iv) above, indicating separately that there was currently insufficient evidence to justify a police application for a Sexual Risk Order (see [15](ii) above), albeit police enquiries and investigations were still ongoing.  Its formal position at this final hearing was &#8216;neutral&#8217; on whether the injunctions were granted or not.</p>

Lessons plainly need to be (and I am told have been) learned from the manner in which it brought the issue to court.  While well-intentioned, there was a failure in the collective responsibility to work in partnership, and the members of the team lost focus in their joint investigation &#8211; see again [10] above.  In future, there needs to be, and I am told there will be, full consultation not only between the safeguarding professionals of the team, but also between the legal services departments for the council and the police; this dialogue needs to be commenced at the outset of the investigation and be maintained.  Focused and clear lines of communication between the safeguarding agencies need to be observed at all times.  As a result of the lessons learned, Rotherham Council is to conduct a full learning review under the Rotherham Safeguarding Children&#8217;s Board, with the aim of establishing a more detailed protocol to address cases of child sexual exploitation.</p>

It should be noted that in this case neither HH nor NN have even been arrested, let alone charged or prosecuted for offences relating to Child G.  LL and MM remain on police bail and will be so for a further two weeks; no charging decision has yet been made.  By the Local Authority&#8217;s application not to pursue further its applications for injunctions in the wardship, and their associated application to discharge the orders without any determination of the evidence, no findings are sought against the four men in the family court, let alone made.   It follows that I must proceed to determine this application for a Reporting Restriction Order in respect of them on the basis that they are innocent of the wrongdoing of which they were originally suspected.  As is well known in family and civil law fields, the &#8220;law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1.

But as Ms McGahey QC observed in argument, and I accept, they would arguably be in a worse position were they to be named following this judgment, as they would not be able to point to any public recognition of their defence, or formal acknowledgment, record, verdict, or statement, of their innocence.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">(b) <span style="font-weight:bold">Interim injunctions</span>: I next ask myself what is the public interest in naming these four men in the press as persons against whom injunction proceedings were once brought, interim injunctions (without evidence being tested) once made, but in respect of whom in the end no findings were sought, let alone made?  In my judgment there is no, or if any, negligible, such public interest.  As it happens, the evidence reveals that MM had the most minimal involvement in Child G&#8217;s life having only met her briefly on the date in August when the police exercised their powers of protection.  On the other hand, there is a substantial risk that, given the strength of feeling in Rotherham and elsewhere about those who engage in child sexual exploitation and similar offences, they would be perceived to be perpetrators or likely perpetrators, and pilloried and/or targeted in their communities if they were known to have been under suspicion in this way.  As The Times newspaper observes in its own leader, to which I have referred earlier (see [34] above): &#8220;False rape and abuse accusations can inflict terrible damage on the reputations, prospects and health of those accused.  For all the presumption of innocence, mud sticks&#8221;.   There is, I acknowledge, an unfortunate truth within that remark.  I am satisfied that the rights enjoyed by the four associated males, and also to their wider families, to a private and family life would be significantly disrupted if they were to be named in the media.  There is an obvious risk of reprisals, which play out at worst by overt hostility in the community, damage to themselves or their homes, or at least by subtler forms of ostracism, difficulties in personal relationships, disruption to their employment or their prospects of employment. </p>

		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.95in">&#8220;It is a basic principle of the justice system in this country that justice is dispensed in public and restrictions should only be imposed where it is in the interests of justice to do so.  However, concerns have been expressed about the likelihood of an application for an order under <span style="font-style:italic">Part 2</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">2003 Act</span> drawing attention to the presence of sex offenders in the community. These concerns can be magnified if the application is for an order that can only be made in respect of convicted sex offenders if the police have concerns about the immediate risk they pose to the community. Whilst the police and the courts are, in fact, acting together to secure improved protection of the public (including protection of the offender from the criminal activity of others), any increase in public disorder not only diverts police resources but could encourage and allow the defendant to abscond from the arrangements the public protection agencies have put in place to manage the risks he or she poses. Therefore, it has become normal practice in some police areas, when applying for an order of this type, for an application to be made to the court at the outset of proceedings (in general with the support of the defendant) for an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Contempt of Court Act 1981</ref> prohibiting the publication of the defendant&#8217;s name and address.

The risk of &#8216;jigsaw&#8217; identification has to be carefully considered by judges and lawyers whenever a family judgment is being published, particularly where the judgment relates to families living in close-knit communities, as they do here (see, for recent examples <span style="font-style:italic">H v A (No 1) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/58" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 58" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 58</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">H v A (No 2) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/2630" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2630 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2630 (Fam)</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (A minor)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/2595" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 2595 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 2595 (Fam)</ref>).  Rotherham has already been named in press reports of the interim stages of this case, and there is therefore one significant geographic identifying feature already in the public domain.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The risk of &#8216;jigsaw&#8217; identification in this particular case is heightened by the fact that, according to MM &#8220;a large section of our community is aware that [LL] was dating [Child G] and thus it would not be a difficult task for people to establish the identity of Child G&#8221;.  Moreover, one of Child G&#8217;s friends is, to the knowledge of the police, aware of Child G&#8217;s association with all four of the males; she would readily be able to make the link between the four males and Child G.  She would, in this way, be alerted to the underlying concern of child sexual exploitation, about which she may currently be unaware.  This friend is not someone who is likely to have any interest in keeping the information about this association to herself; the speed and simplicity of communication through any one of the multiple forms of social media raises a substantial risk that within a short space of time the identity of Child G as the subject of suspected sexual exploitation would be widely disseminated.  There is no reason to suppose that there is only one friend who knows of these connections; the more friends that know, the greater the risk.  It is further known, separately, that a member of LL&#8217;s family knows a member of Child G&#8217;s family, and is aware of the connection between Child G and LL.  Naming LL from these proceedings would be very likely, through this connection, to advertise Child G&#8217;s identity to a wider circle of people. </p>

In the wake of those reports, the South Yorkshire Police and Rotherham Council have been making efforts to encourage victims of child sexual exploitation to come forward and report matters, so that measures can be taken to protect those victims. Anything which damages those efforts to build confidence in the local community, and in particular among the victims of child sexual exploitation hampers efforts to tackle exploitation in Rotherham.  </p>

Reaching out to these vulnerable people often living within hard to reach communities is undoubtedly built upon the foundations of trust and confidence in our service. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">An integral part of building trust is to reassure victims of the right to anonymity and this is often essential to victims having the confidence to come forward and speak with officers about what has happened to them</span>. I have no hesitation in saying that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">any &#8216;jigsaw identification&#8217; of Child G will seriously impact on the confidence of victims to come forward to the South Yorkshire Police and other forces nationally to report forms of abuse including child sexual exploitation</span>. In my professional opinion, this would have a detrimental effect on the fight against child sexual exploitation within our communities.&#8221; (emphasis by underlining added).</p>

There is a real possibility &#8211; i.e. one that cannot sensibly be ignored &#8211; that if the four associated males are publicly named, they may seek some form of retaliation against Child G for having exposed them through these proceedings.  At least two of these men are believed to have abused Child G in the past, emotionally and physically; the police have identified a risk that they in particular could turn on her in such circumstances.  While this unacceptable prospect has not been dominant in my decision-making, I cannot ignore it, and have accordingly given it some weight in my overall reckoning. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have indicated earlier in this judgment, there is a significant public interest in the investigation and detection of child sexual exploitation, in the state&#8217;s protection of its victims, and in the prosecution of those who perpetrate it.  There is national public interest in the incidence (indeed the prevalence) of this crime in the area of Rotherham.  For this reason, I decided that it would be right to hold the final hearing of these applications in public, and to name the relevant council.  I have no doubt that the media have an important part to play in raising public awareness of this particular type of offence, and in reporting on the court&#8217;s approach to it.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is rightly uncontroversial in this case that Child G&#8217;s identity should be protected now and for the future.  She is an extremely vulnerable young person; it would be devastating to her to be named publicly in the press as the subject of this application, and a strong deterrent to other young people who may consider coming forward to report offending of this type.  Having listened carefully to the evidence of the relevant senior officers, I am satisfied that if I named the associated males, Child G would be quickly identified in the local community in which she lives.  That is sufficient on its own to justify the anonymity of the four males.  However, quite apart from that factor, I have reached the firm conclusion that there is no true public interest in naming the four associated males, against whom, in the end, no findings have been sought or made.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8</span> rights of the associated males would be in my judgment significantly violated were they to be publicly exposed in the media as having been implicated to a greater or lesser degree, but not proved to be engaged, in this type of offending.  Their rights, on these facts, predominate over the <span style="font-style:italic">Article 10</span> rights of the press to report their names while not inhibiting the press from reporting more widely about this case.  I have cross-checked these conclusions against the measure of proportionality and have unhesitatingly concluded that no lesser order will suffice; the injunction will therefore extend for their lives until or unless earlier varied or discharged.  </p>
