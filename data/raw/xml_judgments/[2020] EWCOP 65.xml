	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This is the final hearing in Court of Protection proceedings concerning CVF. CVF is a 29 year old woman who is represented by Mr Hadden acting on behalf of the Official Solicitor. The Local Authority, the applicant is represented by Miss Sutton, and the third respondent, which are responsible for delivering mental health services to CVF, is represented by Miss Barbour. CVF&#8217;s mother, JF, who is the second respondent, represented herself.  </p>

I rejected this request as I agree with the Local Authority and the Official Solicitor that it is important that the proceedings come to an end due to the considerable anxiety they cause CVF. I have done all I can to ensure that JF could participate effectively today and I hope she feels that she has been able to do so.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The background to these proceedings is that CVF has diagnoses of diabetes, learning disability, emotionally unstable personality disorder, low self-esteem and feelings of abandonment. JF made a personal welfare application in January 2018. The application stated that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">CVF is a vulnerable women whose capacity to consent to sex, to make decisions in respect of contact with unknown men and to make decisions in respect of her care is in dispute</span>&#8221; and that it &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">would benefit CVF for there to be clarity in relation to her capacity and whether any best interest decisions need to be made. At present &#8230; there is a high level of police intervention and numerous safeguarding referrals due to there being no agreed position on CVF&#8217;s capacity</span>&#8221;. </p>

The declarations that I made were that CVF lacks capacity to (i) conduct these proceedings, and to make decisions regarding (ii) her residence; (iii) her care and support needs; (iv) the contact she has with others; (v) her internet and social media use and (vi) her property and financial affairs. I also declared that CVF has capacity to (i) consent to sexual relationships and (ii) make decisions regarding her medication.  </p>

However, the level of care has in practice been reducing over the months and it is now not at that level of 24/7 care. I note that the gradual reduction entirely accords with Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s recommendations and her view that there needed to be a reduction in support to enable CVF to improve her own independent functional skills. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">The final hearing has proceeded today by way of oral submissions and I have not heard oral evidence, but I have written evidence from CVF&#8217;s social worker, TF, and from KC (her specialist mental health nurse). I also have a series of attendance notes from Miss Moore, acting as CVF&#8217;s solicitor, through the Official Solicitor throughout these proceedings. All that material records the very great improvement in CVF&#8217;s psychological and emotional wellbeing over the last few months. She has become much more stable in her moods and behaviour and has been functioning much better. In practical terms, CVF has started doing some paid work and she has become considerably more self-reliant with cooking, cleaning etc. CVF has also become more stable in her emotional regulation and is less blown around by particular events. It is important both to praise CVF for the great work and efforts she has made in what has been described in the papers as her <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;extraordinary improvements&#8221;, </span>but to also be realistic that there have been ups and downs. Happily, the evidence suggests that CVF has been able to cope with those ups and downs far better than she had in the past. </p>

JF&#8217;s position is quite different regarding how CVF has been over the last months. Her view is that CVF is repeating a pattern of seeking a relationship and then allowing herself to be exploited through that relationship, both by her boyfriend and friends, in particular, one excarer. JF says that this pattern will lead to another crisis for CVF and she will run back to her mother. JF wants to prevent this pattern repeating itself.  </p>

Having heard JF&#8217;s submissions, it was not very clear to me why she felt CVF needed that level of care now as opposed to higher levels of care being restored if there was a downward move to a crisis. She also feels that she should remain in control of CVF&#8217;s finances as her property and affairs deputy and also be appointed as CVF&#8217;s welfare deputy. </p>

In particular, she criticises encouraging a sexual relationship and allowing CVF to travel to Spain on holiday with her boyfriend and ex-carer. JF feels that, again, she (JF) has been given inadequate support by the Local Authority and NHS Trust. She alleges that the Local Authority have not taken her concerns seriously about CVF&#8217;s boyfriend and have not properly investigated them. Miss Sutton however showed me the file note that made clear the Local Authority had indeed investigated those concerns and had acted with all due diligence in this regard. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The evidence is clear that CVF is now more stable and articulate, and better at dealing with emotional fluctuations and daily tasks. It is also the case that CVF doesn&#8217;t want 24/7 care &#8211; she feels it as being intrusive and stops her being independent. She wants more autonomy, and, in my view, she has a right to more autonomy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Having said this, I fully appreciate JF&#8217;s concerns. I suspect that CVF&#8217;s history of cyclical behaviour has something to do with relationships, often with boyfriends. In my assessment, JF is both a protective factor for CVF, the ultimate safety net, but also has not managed to allow CVF to gain greater independence and autonomy. This is a tension in many parent-child relationships, but it is magnified enormously in CVF&#8217;s case because of her diagnosis, behaviour and the family history. It is very important to make clear that when I say 8 hours of care a day is appropriate, that does not fix that level forever and is completely subject to review and CVF&#8217;s behaviour. The care plan unusually builds in a 3 month review process, due to CVF&#8217;s fluctuations and also and an automatic review if CVF&#8217;s relationship with J should fail, as that is clearly a risk factor. Those review provisions support a reduction of care and provide for a safety net now and in the future.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In summary, firstly, the reduction in care accords with CVF&#8217;s wishes and feelings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>. Secondly, it is the least restrictive option under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>. Thirdly it is proportionate under Article 8 ECHR. Fourthly, it accords with CVF&#8217;s best interests as in my view it is positively detrimental for CVF to have 24/7 care at the moment as all it serves to do is to make her feel undermined, triggers disruptive behaviours and reduces her motivation to become more independent and to improve functional abilities. Fifthly, to reduce the care in this way reflects the reality what CVF is currently receiving.  </p>

The fact is that all life involves risk, and the young, the elderly and the vulnerable, are exposed to additional risks and to risks they are less well equipped than others to cope with. But just as wise parents resist the temptation to keep their children metaphorically wrapped up in cotton wool, so too we must avoid the temptation always to put the physical health and safety of the elderly and the vulnerable before everything else. Often it will be appropriate to do so, but not always. Physical health and safety can sometimes be bought at too high a price in happiness and emotional welfare. The emphasis must be on sensible risk appraisal, not striving to avoid all risk, whatever the price, but instead seeking a proper balance and being willing to tolerate manageable or acceptable risks as the price appropriately to be paid in order to achieve some other good &#8211; in particular to achieve the vital good of the elderly or vulnerable person&#8217;s happiness. What good is it making someone safer if it merely makes them miserable?&#8221; </span></p>

That could be remedied in an order being limited, but (secondly) CVF is strongly opposed to her mother having a deputyship order over her so such an order would be contrary to CVF&#8217;s wishes and feelings. As I hope is clear from the earlier part of this judgment, although lacking capacity, CVF is very articulate and able to express her views. I therefore place a great deal of weight on her wishes and feelings and I would consider this to be the critical factor. That leads to the third point. Given her strong opposition to her mother having this power, it would be highly contrary to CVF&#8217;s best interests for this application to be allowed. CVF has made exceptional progress over the last 9 months, largely because she has been able to exercise more independence and autonomy, in part because of lockdown, and the pandemic has forced a situation where she has had less contact with her family.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I do appreciate the risks, but the reality is that there has been a positive experience for CVF over the last 9 months. If I were to appoint JF as a personal welfare deputy, that would be deeply upsetting and contrary to CVF&#8217;s emotional well-being. It also appears to be the case that over the last 9 months many of the things that have gone so well for CVF and enhanced her independence (travelling to Spain, work, engaging in relationships) are precisely the things her mother would think she should not allow as they are too risky. Therefore, the third reason is that such an order would be contrary to CVF&#8217;s best interests.  Fourthly, to grant the application would be an unnecessary and disproportionate interference in her Article 8 ECHR rights and there is no justification for such an interference on the facts of this case.  CVF must be allowed to retain and develop autonomy and take risks within the safety net from the Local Authority. I therefore refuse JF&#8217;s application. </p>
