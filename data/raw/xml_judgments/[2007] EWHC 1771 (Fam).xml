She concealed her pregnancy from everyone &#8211; it seems that L&#8217;s father was unaware of the pregnancy and remains unaware of his daughter&#8217;s existence. She did not seek any antenatal health care. She presented herself at hospital in labour, giving birth to L two hours later. She left hospital within two hours of L&#8217;s birth without seeing her, but having named her L, and requesting that she be adopted. And she has not seen her daughter since, refusing even to receive photographs of her.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The dilemma must, in fact, be a very old one. Although no statistics are available, many children must have been adopted over the years, outside their birth families, and with no knowledge by, or investigation of, other members of the birth family. Adoption exists to serve many social needs. But high among them has been, historically, the desire or need of some mothers to be able to conceal from their own family and friends, the fact of the pregnancy and birth. So far as I know, it has not previously been suggested, nor judicially determined, that that confidentiality of the mother cannot be respected and maintained. If it is now to be eroded, there is, in my judgment, a real risk that more pregnant women would seek abortions or give birth secretly, to the risk of both themselves and their babies &#8230; There is, in my judgment, a strong social need, if it is lawful, to continue to enable some mothers, such as this mother, to make discreet, dignified and humane arrangements for the birth and subsequent adoption of their babies, without their families knowing anything about it, if the mother, for good reason, so wishes.&#8221;</p>

I doubt that, in strictness, there is as a matter of law no power in the court to order a mother to disclose the identity of her child&#8217;s father. After all, the powers of a judge exercising the inherent jurisdiction are theoretically limitless, though in practice there are well recognised limitations on the exercise of the jurisdiction. But whether it is proper, whether it is appropriate and prudent, to exercise such a power, assuming it to exist, whether it is appropriate and prudent to attempt to compel an unwilling mother to disclose the name of her child&#8217;s father, is a very different thing. </p>

Like any other child, L should have the opportunity of growing up within her birth family if at all possible; so adoption should not normally be considered until all possible family members have been ruled out. It may be that there is &#8216;out there&#8217; a father who would want to and be able to bring her up. If her father cannot himself bring her up then it might nonetheless be appropriate for L to have contact with him, even if only indirect contact after she has been adopted. And even if she is to be adopted, then for the purposes of life story work L needs to know as much as possible about her father and his family, so that, for example, she can in later life, if she chooses to do so, try and trace him. Also she needs the emotional security of knowing that all this was investigated, along with any relevant medical, ethnic and financial/inheritance matters, before the final decision for her adoption was made. Her mother&#8217;s stance is denying her all these things.</p>

I confess that I find the idea very disturbing. There is something deeply unattractive and unsettling in the idea that a woman in the mother&#8217;s position should be cross-examined in order to compel her to reveal the name of her child&#8217;s father. And there is something deeply unattractive and unsettling in the idea that a woman in the mother&#8217;s position should be cross-examined (as on this hypothesis would almost inevitably be the case, for how else is cross-examination likely to elicit the relevant information) as to the nature, extent and duration of her relationship with the father. In relation to matters as personal and intimate as this we should be wary of seeking to open windows into people&#8217;s souls. And would it in any event be right to subject the mother to prying cross-examination on the (probably dubious) double hypothesis that she is at present not telling the truth but that, if cross-examined, the truth will out?</p>

I might, for all I know, be left with a powerful impression that she was not telling the truth, but that of itself would get us nowhere. Contempt could not be proved unless I was satisfied to the criminal standard &#8211; satisfied so that I was sure; satisfied beyond reasonable doubt &#8211; that the mother was telling lies. That, I suspect, is an unlikely outcome. And suppose that I was satisfied to the criminal standard that she was telling lies.
