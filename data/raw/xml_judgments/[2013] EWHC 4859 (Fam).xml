They are indeed caring for AM and AD at present.

I have pieced this together from the evidence which I have read and heard.  To a large extent, the history depends on the accounts given by the parents. Either one or both of the parents may have a substantial reason for lying about some of the events, to mask the truth about the true cause of the injuries to AD.  In the circumstances, I have to treat their uncorroborated word with caution, and have searched where possible for consistency and for other indicators which point to the truth.</p>

The mother told me that she was elated to have two children, and in particular a baby boy.  The father and maternal grandparents all told me in oral evidence that they thought that the mother was a very good and loving mother; the maternal grandfather described (evidence in chief) her as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">very brilliant</span>&#8221;, and the paternal grandfather called her a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">wonderful young lady</span>&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AD&#8217;s early feeding regime has been the subject of some scrutiny in these proceedings, given the suggestion made after his injuries had been discovered (and indeed the expert opinion offered: see Nussey) that he would have been likely to be vitamin D deficient at birth.  Although the relevant nutritional information cannot be verified by the Parent Held Child Health Record (the Red Book), which is missing, it appears likely that he was breast and bottle fed, dietary supplement being offered by the infant &#8216;formula&#8217;.  The parents report that when only a month or so old, AD suffered &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">extreme colic</span>&#8221; and reflux, for which the GP prescribed Gaviscon.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of vitamin D deficiency in AD (and indeed a potential diagnosis of rickets) was, I believe, first raised by one of the treating experts at Great Ormond Street Hospital.  It was when the mother consequently arranged for her own vitamin D levels to be tested, that this revealed an abnormally low level and, in October 2012, provoked an independent enquiry into this condition in these proceedings (see &#167;56 et seq. below). What is known is that by May 2012 AD was believed to have attained appropriate levels of Vitamin D &#8211; the test in May 2012 shows normal levels of alkaline phosphatase (the only abnormal test was haemoglobin).</p>

During the first months of his life, the parents appropriately sought medical treatment for AD for a tongue-tie; this was surgically released on 31 May 2012 at Queen&#8217;s Hospital, Romford.  On three occasions prior to 23 October 2012, AD was taken as an emergency patient to hospital:</p>

The mother describes how she felt that AD was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">disconnected</span>&#8221; from her during the admission, and was worried about &#8216;staring&#8217; episodes which were observed also by nurses.</p>

She told me that the family had been worried about AD having &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">different things one after another</span>&#8221;, adding &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">deep down we were not comfortable; we didn&#8217;t think he was ok &#8230;he wasn&#8217;t achieving his milestones, he was leaning forward, he would be so irritable&#8230;he wouldn&#8217;t want to make any effort to do things; he was lethargic</span>&#8221; (ibid).  She said that if anyone tried to encourage him to move he would cry.

The mother recalled that by the time of the key events (23 October), AD &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">could roll around at speed and was attempting to crawl.  He was attempting to pull himself up, and could at least lift his bottom off the ground when an object was close to him</span>&#8221;.

The father recounts that at about 4.30pm he left AD and AM in the master bedroom while he went to fill a bucket in the bath to wash AM.  He left AD sitting on the floor, propped up and surrounded by pillows.  He was out of the room only long enough for the bucket to part-fill with water.  He then heard AD cry &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not screaming, but quite a loud cry</span>&#8221;.  On returning to the bedroom, he says that he found AD lying on his right-hand side on the floor.  He said that he noticed that a Peppa Pig sit-on cart/scooter had moved; AD was lying close to the bed on his right hand side (facing away from the door), with his head about 12 to 15 inches from the table leg of the television table.  AM (who had been sitting on the bed) was standing by the door.  AD cried, he said for &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a few minutes</span>&#8221; (separately he estimated this at about 5-6 minutes).  He said that he picked AD up, and carried him straight away downstairs; having left the bedroom he went downstairs without delay (AM following) and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">by the time we were in the kitchen, he was not crying as loud; the crying stopped shortly after we got outside</span>&#8221;.  On this description I would be surprised if the crying was as long as 5-6 minutes.</p>

The father had not communicated a report of this event to the mother prior to that (in particular, he had not informed her when she had got back from work, although he had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">mentioned</span>&#8221; it to his father: see &#167;20 above).  This may suggest of course that he was trying to hide that something significant had happened at that time; or conversely that the incident was of no great significance and has been magnified in the minds (and histories) of the parents since the discovery of the serious injuries, desperate to find an &#8216;innocent&#8217; explanation for the injuries with which AD was later to present at hospital.  I return to this below.</p>

When the father mentioned the &#8216;4.30p.m. incident&#8217; to his father, the paternal grandfather said that he checked over AD&#8217;s head.  The paternal grandfather told me that he thought that the right hand side of the head (which is the side the father said he had found AD resting on the carpet in the bedroom) felt &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">soft</span>&#8221;, but in evidence acknowledged that (a) he did not compare it with the left side (which he did not in fact touch/feel), and (b) he was unsure that this was not just the ordinary feel of the baby&#8217;s skull at that stage of development.  In any event, and importantly, he said that there was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">no reaction</span>&#8221; from AD when he touched the right hand side; this would be likely to be inconsistent in my judgment with AD having suffered a major skull trauma to the right parietal bone by that time, and is in contrast the position in the hospital when AD reacted when the skull was touched.</p>

She said that the paternal grandfather was looking after AD when she returned.  She assumed the care of AD at once and decided to make him some relatively instant food &#8211; porridge mixed with yoghurt.  The mother described (witness statement) that he ate initially &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">enthusiastically</span>&#8221; (this was also the father&#8217;s recollection), and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">seemed to want several spoons</span>&#8221; (in fact ate 6-8 or 10 spoonfuls) before declining more.  He had been, she said, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">quite hungry</span>&#8221; at first.  The paternal grandfather told me that one of the parents (he could not recall which) had told him that AD had eaten &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">well</span>&#8221; at that point.

The notion that the s</span>kull fracture may have been caused by focal impact was advanced (on paper at least) by <span style="color:#000000">Dr. Cartlidge; he was in my judgment, less sure about this when asked in oral evidence.  The suggestion of a focal impact was discussed and </span>rejected at the hearing by Dr. Fairhurst who indicated in her view that the presentation of the fracture was likely to have been caused by contact with a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">completely flat surface or surface with some angle</span>&#8221;.  She went on to state that if the blow had been at a single focal point then she would have expected to see a depressed fracture with a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">stellate</span>&#8221; pattern of fractures radiating outwards, which she did not.</p>

He felt that the separation of the fracture margins was probably caused or contributed to by the intra-cerebral swelling / increase in subdural collections and that the diastased fracture simply indicated a severe impact or incident, whether accidental or non-accidental.  For present purposes, I do not need to resolve this possible difference of professional view.  Both agree that the force needed to cause this injury would be considerable. </span></p>

Both of these parents are intelligent and loving people; they are both from good professional families.  There have been no concerns about the care of their children before the injuries to AD. </p>

On the evidence, it appears likely that the father left AM and AD unattended in the master bedroom for a short period at that time in order to prepare the bathroom for AM&#8217;s bath.  I accept that when out of the room he heard AD crying, and returned to find him lying on his side.  I suspect, though do not find, that AD had toppled over from a sitting, not a standing, position &#8211; perhaps reaching for the Peppa Pig truck which as he tried to reach it, moved further out of his way.  I regard it as likely that AD cried out of shock/upset at toppling, than out of pain.  I find that AD was soon (i.e. within a matter of a few minutes) consoled.  </p>

On my assessment, the father chose not to 'let on' to his wife at the time that this incident had happened, not because he was hiding the infliction of grave injury upon AD, but because he believed that she would not have been happy to learn that the children had been left together unattended for any period of time (as she indeed later confirmed in oral evidence). </p>

Between them, and perhaps for different reasons, the parents then magnified this event into something it wasn't.  For the father, it was an opportunity to carve an innocent explanation out of the history, permitting him to avoid the unpalatable alternative conclusion that it was likely that his wife was responsible for the injuries; for the mother, it represented a potentially plausible history which would mask a grim truth.</p>

I accept their evidence about this; had AD been presenting grossly abnormally (as all the doctors had advised he would have done after the serious injuries), they would &#8211; it seems to me &#8211; have been sure to tell me. </p>

Even if &#8216;insufficient&#8217; or &#8216;deficient&#8217;, I accept Professor Nussey&#8217;s evidence that it was not of such a magnitude as to have played a significant role in bone fragility predisposing AD to any of the fractures (including the vertebral fractures).  It is clear from the evidence which I have heard and read that AD did not have rickets.  I therefore find that there was no medical condition predisposing AD to fracture.  The degree of force required to inflict these serious injuries is therefore of the degree postulated (i.e. significant force) by those who have expressed an opinion about it in these proceedings.</p>

It is likely, in my view, that the incident will have generated some abnormal noise of some kind &#8211; either from the mother, or from AD (Dr. Fairhurst suggested that he may well have screamed or cried before becoming unconscious: Mr Richards suggested that if he was not immediately unconscious he would have been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">inconsolable</span>&#8221;), or in the process of inflicting the injury itself.  There was no evidence of any of this from the father or paternal grandfather.

They may only be apparent now.  This is an important issue which will need to be the subject of assessment in the intervening period prior to the welfare stage.</p>
