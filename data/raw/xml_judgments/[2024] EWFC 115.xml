Save that I find it unlikely that the father went so far as to suggest marriage, I broadly accept the mother&#8217;s evidence.

Her evidence, which I accept, is that she contacted the father to let him know, speaking to him at a time when she was in Lebanon.

She then received a message from the father&#8217;s wife to the effect that if she were to keep the baby and seek financial support from the father, she (the wife) would try to take the child away from her.

As well as making his flat available to her, he has also provided the mother with ad hoc financial support and, as far as I am aware, he continues to do so.  This is not consistent with the notion that he is about to evict her onto the street.  I think it is likely that the uncle is deeply unhappy at having to house his niece rent-free for a prolonged period of time and that he has brought the proceedings in order to demonstrate that his charity cannot be relied upon.</span></p>

She has made applications for legal funding and asserted that she has no means of funding representation in these proceedings other than by obtaining funding from the father.  Her inability to pay for her solicitors has led to her acting in person for periods of time.  In the run up to the final hearing, however, the mother has been able to procure a form of litigation loan in the sum of &#163;136,292 from a lender, to whom she was introduced by a friend of hers.  The lender is not the mother&#8217;s friend and I consider it highly unlikely that he would have advanced such a large sum to her without any assurance of repayment.  It is likely, in my view, that in order to obtain this loan the mother will have prevailed upon an unidentified third party to provide Mr Forte with a guarantee.  My suspicion is that the third party in question is likely to be the mother&#8217;s uncle; whomever it may, I do not consider that the mother has been entirely open and honest as to the means by which she obtained this loan.</span></p>

I do not, however, find (as the father wishes me to) that I can infer from the mother&#8217;s lack of frankness that she has access to a significant pool of assets from which she could meet C&#8217;s needs or that she currently has an earning capacity.</span></p>

In the father&#8217;s first witness statement dated 30 December 2021, he sought to explain his failure to engage in the proceedings by reference to his mental health.  He related that he had been suffering from depression for a number of years.  This, he said, had become worse as a result of his business difficulties; in 2020 his mental health declined still further after a number of loved ones were killed in an explosion in Beirut harbour.  On his case, he was &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">toppled over the edge</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217; following the issue of these proceedings and the revelation that he might have a child with a woman he hardly knew who was claiming substantial sums of money from him.

Indeed, on 28 January 2021 (about a month after the date upon which the father had allegedly become confined in his Lebanese country house) his former solicitors wrote to Cellmark Diagnostics in connection with proposed DNA testing.  They stated that the father was in Lagos and provided a Nigerian telephone number for him.  I am entirely satisfied that his solicitors would not have made this positive assertion as to the father&#8217;s whereabouts unless it was based upon their current instructions and was true.  I do not accept the suggestion put forward by the father in re-examination that the letter might have been written on the basis of historic instructions given by him the previous month.  In any event, as I have said, the father himself accepted in cross-examination that he was travelling to Nigeria in that period, before appearing to back-track after the significance of this admission dawned upon him.

In this case the Child Support Act 1991 did not apply as the husband was habitually resident in the USA. The combination of: (1) incessant litigation, on which the trial judge found the husband thrived, (2) repeated defaults on the part of the husband with the maintenance obligation, and (3) the age of the child and the relatively short period until the maintenance liability expired, all militated strongly in favour of a capitalisation and the ending of financial links between the parties. In the overwhelming majority of cases, however, the risks and uncertainties inherent in capitalisation will lead the court, where it has jurisdiction, to make, or continue, a traditional order for periodic payments. In most cases where the court is considering a variation of a child maintenance order the Child Support Act 1991 will potentially apply in the sense that it would be open to either party to apply for a statutory assessment under the Act, replacing the order, once 12 months had expired following the making of the order. As a general principle, it would not be a proper exercise of the court&#8217;s powers to capitalise periodical maintenance and to abrogate that right. Therefore, it seems to me that capitalisation could only properly be considered where the 1991 Act could not apply, because, for example, one of the parents or the child is habitually resident overseas, or because the child is over 19.&#8217;</span></p>

According to the mother&#8217;s first statement (paragraph 26) in 2019 she had already sought immigration advice from Penningtons Manches Cooper, although as at 30 September 2020 they had been unable to progress matters due to unpaid legal fees.  On 21 December 2020 an order was made requiring her by 4 January 2021 to serve a letter from her solicitors setting out her immigration status and that of the child.  This was not complied with (although at some point in the early part of 2021 the father&#8217;s solicitors came off the record and he ceased to participate in the proceedings).  In December 2021 a payment of &#163;1,031.20 was made to the Home Office.  On 8 December 2022, the mother (by then instructing Levison Melzer Pigott in relation to these proceedings) filed replies to questionnaire in which she stated that she had made an application for indefinite leave to remain in the UK which was being processed by the Home Office.  She said she was unable to work, but that once granted indefinite leave to remain she would seek suitable employment.  In her statement dated 26 January 2023 the mother said that she owed her immigration solicitors &#163;5,000 and that her immigration situation was &#8216;pending&#8217; with the Home Office (the delayed resolution being caused by Covid).  </span></p>

At my request, enquiries were made with them to establish the position.  They communicated that the only applications made by them are (a) an application for British citizenship on behalf of C submitted on 30 November 2021 and approved on 26 January 2023, and (b) an application for British citizenship on behalf of the mother submitted on 10 October 2023 which remains pending and which is likely to be resolved by the end of this year.  The author of the letter said that so far as he was aware the mother had not made an application for indefinite leave to remain.  As a British Overseas Citizen, she has no right to work in the UK.  The mother explains that the payment of &#163;1,031.20 was made in connection with the renewal of her British Overseas Passport and/or that of C (although I have not heard submissions about this, I do not think it can be correct; so far as I am aware the status of a British Overseas Citizen is recognised by the grant of a certificate as opposed to a designated passport; moreover, the fee seems high if relates solely to the renewal of two passports).  </span></p>

The father invites me to find that at some stage the mother did indeed apply for indefinite leave to remain in the UK (as she previously said) and I should infer from her failure to provide proper disclosure that her application was successful and that she has accordingly been able to work in the UK for some time.  Having considered the matter carefully, I am unable to make that finding.  In my view, if such an application had been made it is highly unlikely that the mother&#8217;s present immigration solicitors would not know about it as there would be no reason for her to have concealed it from them and it might be relevant to her application for British citizenship.  Moreover, if the mother had the ability to apply for full British nationality, there would have been no reason instead to apply indefinite leave to remain.  In my judgement, the mother&#8217;s previous assertions that she did apply for indefinite leave to remain are likely to have been mistakes on her part.  I suspect she is also mistaken about the payment to the Home Office; this is more likely to have been made in connection with C&#8217;s application for British citizenship.  </span></p>

In her first statement she said that one option she had considered was setting up a small property management company.  Without access to capital, she is likely to find this difficult although she may well be able to persuade a friend or family member to invest in such a venture.  Although the evidence I have in relation to this issue is very limited, my best estimate is that within approximately 12 months from now she should be in a position to earn at least &#163;30,000 per annum net, probably by obtaining employment or potentially by pursuing the option upon which she previously alighted.</span></p>

It owned various subsidiaries, which in turn owned and managed several large buildings in Nigeria (five named buildings were identified).

So far as Property Services Ltd is concerned, Mr Shoyedi explained that the father had previously owned 50% of the shares.  By virtue of a company resolution dated 18 October 2012, Mr Shoyedi had been instructed to transfer the father&#8217;s shares into the names of his two sons, J and H.  Although the instruments of transfer had been duly executed, the processing and filing of these documents could not be completed by the Nigerian Corporate Affairs Commission as a result of unpaid taxes.

In my judgement, the decision to proceed with the transfer of the home at that stage was entirely connected to these proceedings.  The father and his wife knew about the final order made by DJ Mulkis and had decided to make an application to have it set aside.  In that context, he wished to divest himself of his assets in order to be able to present himself to the English court as a person who did not own any property of significance.  The earlier registrations on 13 April 2021 took place shortly after the court had made a declaration of paternity and were also made to reduce the father&#8217;s assets for the purposes of these proceedings. I do not accept that the transfers took place in the context of a financial settlement reached between the father and his wife in connection with divorce proceedings, which had yet to be issued, although it is highly likely that the father&#8217;s wife will have insisted upon the home being placed in her name in circumstances where the father&#8217;s infidelity had brought a degree of jeopardy to her situation.  It is also noteworthy that the notion that the father was capable in 2021 of negotiating a divorce settlement is wholly inconsistent with his case that his mental health was such that he was living in confinement and under constant supervision in a remote village.</span></p>

In my judgement, the timing of the registration is consistent with the father&#8217;s decision at that stage to apply to set aside the order of DJ Mulkis.

On the father&#8217;s own case, the property is worth $4.5m (more on the mother&#8217;s case).

The father&#8217;s stance in this respect is wholly inconsistent with his asserted financial situation.

I am satisfied that, contrary to his denials, the contract for sale of the X Hotel correctly records the fact that the father did receive the sum of $3,000,000 in connection with the sale.  The whereabouts of that sum has not been disclosed, but most likely it has been deposited into a bank account to which the father has access.</span></p>

The father&#8217;s other children have benefitted from private education (albeit in jurisdictions where this is less expensive) and C has been at a private school for the majority of her life in education.  She has just over one more year left of primary school and I am not convinced that it is appropriate for her to have to move schools now in circumstances when she will then face a further move a year later.  Thereafter, she will have seven years&#8217; worth of secondary education.  </span></p>

She will need to sit exams and may find it difficult to obtain a place at all.  Should she obtain a place, the fees will depend upon the particular school she attends.  I take judicial notice of the real possibility that school fees may rise after the next general election if VAT is charged upon them, although it has been reported in this context that a number of schools may avoid passing on the full extent of any such rise to the parents.  I have also taken judicial notice of the fees currently charged by some of the well-known London day schools for girls (the range of current fees charged appears to be between &#163;7,500 and &#163;10,000 per term).</span></p>

I will assume that by the time C starts school fees may have increased by 15% and will allow for 3% increases thereafter.  On that basis, I calculate the fees are likely to be:</span></p>

However, I am going to provide for the fees to be paid by the father in advance as a single lump sum and so the mother may be able to negotiate a discount by paying in advance.

A budget of this size will enable C to be brought up in circumstances which are not &#8216;out of kilter&#8217; with the father&#8217;s lifestyle.  It will allow the mother and C to live comfortably, but not luxuriously compared with the standards of living likely to be enjoyed by the families of other children at the type of school C will attend.  As well as covering the usual household outgoings, this budget will be sufficient to cover food, other household products, clothing, entertainment and transport for C and, at a relatively modest level, for the mother.  The mother should be able to employ a cleaner and, on occasion, a babysitter.  The mother and C should be able to enjoy holidays, albeit at a more modest level than that for which she contended in her Form E.</span></p>

In my judgement, it would be inappropriate to do so.  Although the budget of &#163;84,000 includes what is sometimes described as a &#8216;carer&#8217;s allowance&#8217;, it will not cover other expenditure which she may reasonably wish to incur but which should not be the responsibility of the father.  Additionally, in circumstances where the mother will be left without a home when her entitlement to occupy the home comes to an end, she should be able to save money which she earns so that she can house herself when the time comes.  I do, however, consider it reasonable for the mother to cover from her earnings any shortfall in the maintenance arising as a result of inflation.</span></p>

As this large sum is to be paid in advance and without any reduction for accelerated receipt, I consider it fair not make provision for estimated inflation but to require the mother to meet any increases in expenditure referable to inflation from her own income.
