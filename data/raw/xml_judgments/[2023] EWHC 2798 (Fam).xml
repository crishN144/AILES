Such extubation should take place by 12pm (noon) on Wednesday 8 November 2023. The Trust would endeavour to stabilise her after extubation and assess the next step, a process which they think could take a week or so. They would determine whether there are clinically available options for her compassionate care, and present such options to the parents. In other words, the Trust would be charged with determining the options, from which the parents could make an election. If clinically justified, the options could include a return home. </p>

It seems clear that in this period the Trust had decided that a home transfer would not be appropriate, but did not communicate this, partly because the Court of Appeal decision was pending. It also seems that communication between clinicians and the parents has become more challenging, although I understand they had a lengthy discussion on 6 November 2023 about these matters. </p>

That case was about revisiting earlier findings, and the making of alternative relief, an appropriate test for the hearing before me on 1 November 2023. But it is not appropriate here. Nobody is asking me to revisit my findings. The relief sought relates to implementation of my substantive order, not to undo my conclusions about life sustaining invasive treatment. It is for resolution of a misunderstanding arising between clinicians and parents from my original order. I have already determined that the Trust is entitled to extubate; now I have to decide how and when that takes place.  In my judgment, and in fairness to F&#8217;s counsel he did not demur, although any material change of circumstances may well be relevant, the test remains one of best interests. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In short, I accept the evidence of the clinicians. The wishes of the parents are a powerful consideration but not the only one. The presentation of IG is more complex than it was when the care plan was drawn up in terms of extubation aftercare. There are a number of factors which render extubation and palliative care at the family home all but impossible, and certainly contrary to IG&#8217;s best interests. It is too dangerous to do so given the clinical complications. I have to say that I am dubious that even at the hearing before me in October, extubation at home was clinically appropriate, but in my view, it is clearly not now, for the reasons given by Dr E. The requisite expert nursing staff cannot be easily arranged. The medical risks are significantly enhanced as a result of the delay since my original order in October. The potential harm to IG of complications and sudden agitation would be increased. The likely delay of arranging a care package at home would lead to ongoing pain and suffering. The hospice by contrast can receive IG straight away. In my judgment it is not in IG&#8217;s best interests for extubation to take place at home. </p>

That will not be available at home. I do not think, with the best will in the world, that it is practical or appropriate for the parents to take on the burden of substituted nursing care. It may also be that for the plan to work at home, there needs to be a close, constructive and engaged level of communication between the parents and the Trust/relevant clinicians, but, unfortunately, that does not appear to be the case. The sad fact is that IG continues to suffer, and a transfer home carries with it an unacceptable risk of precipitate events and consequential increased suffering. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, the care plan should be amended in the manner sought by the Trust. Ultimately, compassionate care will be driven by what is clinically available at the time. That will be a matter for the clinicians. At present, a hospice setting remains available and extubation should take place there unless the parents elect that it takes place at the hospital. The Trust is authorised to effect such extubation no earlier than 2pm on Thursday 9 November 2023. Thereafter, the clinicians will be entitled to decide on IG&#8217;s compassionate care and, where they offer options, the parents may so elect. The parents cannot make the clinical decisions. This is consistent with the approach referred to at para 50 of <span style="font-weight:bold">R (Burke) v General Medical Council  (CA) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] QB 273" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] QB 273</ref></span>.
