In broad terms, they suggest further adjournment for assessment of S&#8217;s mother, either in this country or in Pakistan, dependant upon the outcome of the mother&#8217;s Visa applications.  The third option, as suggested by the local authority and supported by the Guardian, is that final orders should be made on the basis that S would remain, as now, living with foster parents under a long-term arrangement.  </span></p>

He identifies that there was, unfortunately, poor school attendance which negatively impacted upon S&#8217;s education.  There were times, sad to say, when she was hungry because she had been inadequately fed.  S required dental treatment indicating there had been poor dental care; and there were occasions when the condition of her school clothing fell below an acceptable standard. Therefore, in very broad terms, and without ascribing responsibility in the fullest sense to the father, because he was undoubtedly ill, S was neglected. She suffered significant harm. In April 2011 she was received into voluntary care.  </span></p>

She went on to explain that she was struggling (financially) to provide her younger daughter A with food, clothing and education.

Miss Cronin observes that the parents would be unable to meet those financial requirements; a fact which is borne out by the entry clearance officer&#8217;s adjudication.  However, Miss Cronin advises that the mother&#8217;s application was lodged before July 2012 and therefore falls to be decided under the old and more lenient rules.

As this case demonstrates, delays are endemic in immigration decision-making.  Miss Cronin believes that with prompting from the Court, and perhaps also a Member of Parliament, entry clearance managers are more likely to give the mother priority. Miss Cronin was reasonably confident of an outcome within as short a period as six weeks.  But there is, in reality, no means of knowing how or when the mother&#8217;s application for entry clearance will have been definitively resolved.</span></p>

Since April 2011, when she was received into voluntary care, S has been waiting for a decision as to what the long term plan for her should be.

Recent evidence, particularly since the November hearing, suggests that S has been extremely unsettled as a result of the continual uncertainty about the long term plans.</span></p>

That was not to be.  In advance of that hearing, S had a discussion with an advocate from NYAS. Most unfortunately, and quite wrongly, she was led to believe that a decision had been made at some stage during last autumn.  As a result of being told that certain things would happen which did not come to fruition, S became distressed and her behaviour has deteriorated.  In November, she told her foster mother that she wanted to kill herself after a visit from her guardian &#8211; who is, I would observe, a very empathic, wise and child-focused individual.  That I believe epitomises the degree to which S has become anxious as the result of continuing uncertainty.  </span></p>

In the result, S was extremely distressed and ran away from her foster carer&#8217;s home.  She did not go far and was found in hiding.  But that is another indication, to my mind, as to how unsettled S has become. Her foster mother reports that her behaviour has become increasingly difficult over recent months.  </span></p>

Indeed, she was inclined to sweep aside the problems identified by the local authority and the guardian as being of very little consequence. A prime example was her all too ready assertion that there had been language difficulties when the mother had said over the telephone in 2011 and 2012 that she was not prepared to have S living with her in Pakistan.

To perpetuate the current contact arrangements would not be beneficial to S in my judgment; it would be confusing and troubling. She would not be clear about what is going to happen and why.    </span></p>

There will be telephone contact as the local authority suggests.  For now, that cannot simply be when S picks up the phone. There has to be a degree of restriction around telephone contact, again, so that the message for her is clear.  Contact will be reviewed every six months as part of the Looked After Children arrangements. The father as well as the mother may make representations about the contact question.  S herself will also have the opportunity to contribute to the consultation exercise in advance of LAC reviews.    </span></p>

I imagine, though I cannot be certain, that an order which explicitly emphasises the child&#8217;s welfare need to see her mother face-to-face in this jurisdiction will have influence with the immigration authorities.   </span></p>

She has mixed feelings about her mother which is not at all surprising in the circumstances.   It would be very beneficial if S were able to continue her relationship with her mother by indirect means and, ultimately, for her to be able to see her mother in this jurisdiction.  </span></p>
