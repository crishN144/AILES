Following a brief intimate relationship, they remained in contact and formed what they describe as a close and loving bond, albeit their relationship was platonic.

The necessary procedures were undertaken at a fertility clinic in New York and embryos created with Mr Y and Ms C&#8217;s gametes. Following an embryo transfer to Ms B the pregnancy was confirmed. G was born, Mr Y was present at the birth, Mr X was present via video calls. Mr X was able to meet G when he was two weeks old. Mrs X was also involved in meeting G. The applicants had not secured a pre-birth order in the State where G was born so only Mr Y&#8217;s name is on G&#8217;s US birth certificate.</p>

Finally, the payments that have been made to Ms B other than for expenses reasonably incurred ($25,000) can in the circumstances of this case be authorised as they are not disproportionate to the expenses, this was a voluntary arms-length agreement where all parties had access to legal advice and there is no suggestion any party acted other that in good faith.</p>

To an outsider the nature of the applicants&#8217; relationship may be described as &#8216;unusual&#8217; or &#8216;unconventional&#8217; but the court must remain focussed on the statutory requirements. In my judgment, the applicants are &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">living as partners in an enduring family relationship&#8217;.</span> They are in a long term committed relationship with each other that has been in existence for a number of years. Whilst it is right Mr X has remained married and living with his wife, the existence of that relationship has not detracted from the evidence the court has of the way Mr Y and Mr X operate as committed and loving partners, particularly in relation to the way they have made the decision to have a child, the steps they have taken to do that and what they have done following G&#8217;s birth. Mr X is arguably in two relationships that could meet this definition but there is no requirement for any relationship within this definition to be exclusive, although it is a very relevant factor the court needs to take into account in assessing the evidence. I agree with Mr Verity that the applicants are very much a family unit even though they have not had the relationship history of family life together that is common to more conventional situations. They do not live together, the statute does not require that, but they are living as partners in a committed and loving relationship that has been established and maintained over a number of years. Its early focus was their relationship, more recently it has been their joint decision to have a child and the steps they have taken together to achieve that, what they have done following G&#8217;s birth and their plans for their relationship going forward, with G at the centre. Although unusual, this relationship established by Mr Y and Mr X co-exists with Mr and Mrs X&#8217;s marriage in the way described in the evidence. Mrs X is wholly supportive of the relationships that exist.</p>

The application in this case was issued three years after G&#8217;s birth. In their statements the applicants describe that they only recently became aware of the need for a parental order when they sought legal advice. Once they became aware of the need to make an application it was promptly made. For the reasons set out by Sir James Munby in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (A child)(Parental Order: Time Limit) [2014] EWHC 3135</span> it is possible for the court to consider applications made after the six month limit. In this case there will be no prejudice to any third party if the application is permitted to proceed. If it isn&#8217;t permitted there will be significant prejudice to G and the applicants, as they would be denied the opportunity to secure an order that has a fundamental impact on the child&#8217;s identity, namely who he is and who his parents are. There is no suggestion in this case of any abuse of public policy and there was no untoward delay once the applicants became aware such an application was required.</p>

In my view he will have developed a secure attachment to both [Mr Y] and [Mr X] (and to [Mrs X]), who have separately and together cared for him for all his life, and so would wish that shared care to remain in place.&#8221;</span></p>

He needs to be cared for in a nurturing, stable and safe environment where his emotional, physical and educational needs are met consistently by the important adults in his life. He needs to be encouraged to live a healthy lifestyle, should receive adequate and appropriate stimulation and be surrounded by unconditional love and acceptance with clear and consistent parental boundaries. [Mr X] and [Mr Y] have demonstrated that thus far they have been able to meet these requirements well given that [G] has moved to and from between two homes in two countries. They share the values of parenting.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">G has the advantage in this case of a wider loving family, including Ms B who carried him and Ms C who has a genetic connection to him. The most recent statement from the applicants describes how G&#8217;s relationship with the wider family has developed and the transparency within both wider families about G&#8217;s own background. This openness will provide a solid foundation for G, as he starts to navigate his own genetic and gestational background.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The making of a parental order in this case will provide the secure lifelong benefits that a legal parental relationship provides, recognising and affirming the arrangements within a legal framework that spreads wider than the applicants and secures the wider family relationships. In this case Ms B was both G&#8217;s birth mother and his aunt. Following the making of a parental order she will remain his aunt, which more accurately reflects the relationship they have going forward, although not changing the factual background. Ms C will become G&#8217;s cousin in the event of a parental order being made, again supporting the relationship going forward without detracting from her role in G&#8217;s past.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered the evidence from the applicants and Mr Verity&#8217;s detailed assessment in my judgment making a parental order will secure G&#8217;s lifelong welfare needs by conferring joint and equal legal parenthood and parental responsibility upon the applicants who are and always have been regarded by G as his parents. In addition, a parental order will secure the legal relationships with the wider family which, in the circumstances of this case, will help reflect G&#8217;s own particular and unique background.</p>
