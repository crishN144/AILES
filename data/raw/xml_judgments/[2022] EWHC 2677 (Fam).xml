The application concerns S, a boy aged 21 months.  He is the only child of FB (&#8220;the father&#8221;), and MG (&#8220;the mother&#8221;).  The father seeks the summary return of S to the State of Israel.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father and mother are married.  There is no dispute in this case that the father has rights of custody in respect of S, and was exercising them at the material time.  It is the father&#8217;s case that S has throughout his life been habitually resident in Israel, and been wrongfully retained in this jurisdiction (England) since the end of May 2022.  He advances an alternative case that the mother formed the intention to retain S in this country in December 2021, and that therefore there was a pre-emptive retention of S in England from that date.</p>

The mother argues that S is, and always has been, habitually resident in England, and has only made visits to Israel in his short life.    In the circumstances, she argues, there has been no wrongful retention.  Alternatively, she contends that if the court were to find that S was habitually resident in Israel at the end of May 2022, she nonetheless can successfully defend the application on the following basis:- </p>

Ms Green made an application at the outset for me to hear some limited oral evidence on the issue of habitual residence.  Mr Basi was neutral on the application.  Ms Green was not able to identify any specific issue on which a factual determination would be likely to be essential, and I therefore declined the application. </p>

It is also agreed that he spent altogether a little over 20 weeks of his life in Israel; the balance of the time he has been in England.  That is to say, approximately 24% of his life up to the date of the alleged retention had been in Israel, and 76% in England<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		  <p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"> I should add here that the father&#8217;s lawyers filed a position statement at the outset of the proceedings asserting that S had spent &#8220;the majority&#8221; of his life in Israel, which is acknowledged now to be materially inaccurate.  It is of course possible that those were the father&#8217;s instructions.  However, if that was an <span style="font-style:italic">assumption</span> by the lawyers<span/>can I point out the real risk to the proper administration of justice and the fairness of proceedings if lawyers (particularly at the outset of proceedings when all facts may not be known) make <span style="font-style:italic">assumptions</span> about the facts, and <span style="font-style:italic">present</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">those assumptions </span><span style="font-style:italic">as</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">facts</span> to the court?</p>

The longest period of any time spent in Israel (9 weeks) was acknowledged to be attributable at least in part to the temporary closure of borders because of Covid-19, and because of hostilities.  Between the New Year of 2022 and the launch of these proceedings, S had spent only 13 days in Israel.</p>

Perhaps this derives in part from their different social backgrounds; the mother is a daughter of ostensibly a very wealthy family in London who live at one of the most desirable addresses in the centre of the city. The father is from a very different background indeed in Israel.  It is reasonable to infer from that, and other evidence, that their priorities and their values were different.  For instance, the mother obviously aspired to premium private school education for their son, in London; there is nothing in the papers which indicates that the father truly turned his mind to any alternative in Israel.  Revealing of their very different standpoints on this issue, I note that at one time the mother sent a photograph to the father of school children from a well-known private preparatory school, in central London on an outing, in their distinctive school uniform; she attached the comment: this is &#8220;how school trips are meant to look&#8221;.  He responded, &#8220;it&#8217;s like the military&#8221;.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not unsympathetic to the father&#8217;s argument that the mother had made her habitual residence in Israel from 2017 onwards &#8211; she is, after all, a Jewish woman, who had married an Israeli citizen, in Israel, and had made the Aliyah. He could reasonably be expected to have believed that she was making (or would make) Israel her settled and permanent home.  He may well have thought that by her taking Hebrew lessons, and transporting items from London for the apartment in Ramat Gan, she was investing in a life there.   But this would be to ignore the fact that the mother&#8217;s emotional connection remained with England; she has spent all of her life until 2017, a significant part of her life between 2017-2021, and the significant majority of her life since January 2021 in England.  The mother and S have been based in her parents&#8217; home; she has conducted her UK-registered business primarily from England; she has remained on the electoral roll in England; she has received universal credit in England for the whole period since S&#8217;s birth in early-2021 &#8211; an entitlement only available to those who live in the UK.  In short, it is likely, in my judgment that the mother&#8217;s habitual residence during the relevant period is/was in England not in Israel.  </p>

As I have earlier referenced, S has spent only about one-quarter of his life in Israel; it is in London that he has his meaningful wider family network (including his grandparents with whom he lives); it is in London where he has an extensive and varied programme of age-appropriate activities; it is in London where his medical needs have been met throughout his life; it is in London where the mother has made plans (to the knowledge of the father) to enrol him in kindergarten.   And of course he is and has been throughout his life, in the primary care of his mother whose habitual residence is and has been (as I have found &#8211; see the previous paragraph) for the relevant period, in England.</span></p>
