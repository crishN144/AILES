	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s original application dated 23 June 2022 was heard by Arbuthnot J in November 2022.  Arbuthnot J handed down judgment on 23 December 2022 by which she dismissed the father&#8217;s application for the return of A from the jurisdiction of Zambia to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  On 12 June 2023, the Court of Appeal allowed the father&#8217;s appeal and remitted the question of habitual residence to the High Court for re-hearing in circumstances where the Court of Appeal considered further oral evidence on that issue may be merited and therefore was not in a position to render its own decision on that disputed question.  On 8 February 2024 I determined that A was habitually resident in this jurisdiction at date of the father&#8217;s application and that the jurisdiction of England and Wales was the appropriate forum for determining the dispute as to A&#8217;s welfare (see <span style="font-style:italic">J v E (Habitual Residence) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2024/196" uk:canonical="[2024] EWHC 196 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2024">[2024] EWHC 196 (Fam)</ref>).  I further concluded that it was in A&#8217;s best interests to be returned to this jurisdiction whilst the issues with respect to her welfare were determined and ordered the mother to return A. The mother has now done so.</p>

As I have noted, the mother has now returned A to this jurisdiction pursuant to the order of this court.  Pursuant to an agreement reached between the parties prior to that step being taken, she and A are currently residing in the former family home.  The father currently resides in a houseboat.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As noted in my previous judgment, in November 2019 the father purchased a substantial property in England for &#163;1.85M. The mother describes the parties as having decided to purchase a property in England as their family home.  The mother and father renovated the property to a high standard.  Following the birth of A, the father added the mother&#8217;s name to the title to the property. The father now contends that the transfer from his sole name into the parties&#8217; joint names was to provide the mother and A with the security of a home, not to provide the mother with an equal  beneficial interest in the property.  As such, it would now appear that there is dispute as to the beneficial ownership of the property, albeit it is not clear at present what the father says is the extent of the mother&#8217;s beneficial interest, if not reflected by the legal title.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 11 March 2024, the court directed the mother to issue an application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47" uk:canonical="1996 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996</ref>.  Ms Allman now submits that such an application is unnecessary in circumstances where the court can determine the dispute as to beneficial interest within the context of the proceedings under Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (a point which Mr Devereux and Ms Syme appeared to concede on behalf of the father) and that, in any event, it is the father who disputes the beneficial interest not the mother.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother originally ascribed a value to the former family home of &#163;2.25M but has now revised that figure.  In the circumstances, Mr Devereux and Ms Syme submit the court should direct a valuation exercise in respect of the property.  For this hearing, the father and the mother have prepared a Form ES2 detailing the other assets that will fall for consideration in the proceedings under Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  The total non-pension assets are some &#163;10.1M on the mother&#8217;s case and &#163;9.4M on the father&#8217;s case.  Of that sum, some &#163;4.1M is in investments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, it is also apparent that there is now a dispute between the parties concerning monies provided by the father to the mother with respect to her business interests in Zambia.  As noted in my previous judgment, in November 2019 the mother registered a business in Zambia in the joint ownership of herself and the father, with her being the majority shareholder, and purchased a six acre plot of land.  The mother later purchased an additional 1.5 acres of land.  The mother&#8217;s business plans in Zambia were financed by the sum of some &#163;850,000 from the father, he says on the understanding that the business would &#8220;benefit our household income&#8221; (whilst no objection was taken to this formulation in the court&#8217;s previous judgment, the mother now disputes the figure of &#163;850,000).  The father now contends that these monies were a loan, in the sum of &#163;852,680, made over the course of ten payments between 2019 and 2021 to enable the mother to invest in her business ventures in Zambia.  The father seeks the repayment of that alleged loan, asserting that the mother unilaterally spent a significant proportion of these funds to meet her own personal expenses.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further issue with respect to the parties&#8217; assets has arisen in respect of a Bentley motor vehicle.  As can be seen from the court&#8217;s previous judgment, reference was made to that vehicle as belonging to the mother, the judgment noting the existence of &#8220;the mother&#8217;s Bentley, worth some &#163;150,000&#8221;.  This reference in the judgment was made in the context of a statement by the father dated 16 August 2022, in which at paragraph [39] the father stated that &#8220;[E]&#8217;s car, a Bentley Bentayga worth approximately &#163;150,000 was also left in the garage and no arrangements have been made to sell the car&#8221;.  The father now appears to contest the ownership of the Bentley, although again his case as to the ownership of the car is not entirely clear.</p>

In addition, the father receives a modest income from dividends from his foreign investments.  The father states his net income as &#163;189,999 per annum or &#163;15,584 per month and contends that he has income needs of &#163;11,978 per calendar month or &#163;143,736 per annum including the &#163;1,500pcm child maintenance payments made by the father but not the outgoings on the former family home.  The mother states that she is at present not in employment and that her income is limited to the &#163;1,500 per calendar month in agreed child maintenance paid to her by the father. The father contends that the mother has income from other sources and has raised questions in his questionnaire as to a number of payments into the mother&#8217;s bank account between April 2023 and April 2024 amounting to some &#163;38,777. The father seeks a finding in relation to the mother&#8217;s earning capacity</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, in addition to her application for permission to remove A from this jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of Zambia permanently, the mother now applies for financial provision for the benefit of A, pursuant to Schedule 1 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  The mother&#8217;s application was initially, and erroneously, issued under the fast track procedure by a Form A1 dated 7 March 2024. That application sought a periodical payments order.  The mother has now issued a further application dated 1 May 2024 seeking a lump sum order and a settlement or a transfer of property for the benefit of A.  The father contends that the mother&#8217;s applications were issued without prior formal notice to the father or any attempt to compromise the outstanding issues without litigation. </p>

The court gave those case management directions within a timetable that, with respect to the welfare applications, listed a pre-trial review on 4 June 2024, a fact-finding hearing on 11 June 2024 with a time estimate of four days and a welfare hearing 15 July 2024 with a time estimate of three days.  With respect to the Schedule 1 and Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act applications, the court timetabled those applications to final hearing on 18 July 2024 with a time estimate of two days. </p>

The father emphatically denies sexually abusing A.  In that context, at the hearing on 11 March 2024, the court made a series of respectful requests to various authorities in Zambia for disclosure of material relevant to the fact finding exercise this court is now required to undertake.  Whilst the court had directed that service of the requests be effected through the Foreign Process Section, the FPS has subsequently indicated that it cannot assist and,  therefore, the requests need to be served by an independent agent.  The father has identified an independent agent and is willing to pay for the costs of this.  The father has issued a C2 application dated 19 April 2024, and issued on 23 April 2024, seeking an amendment of the directions to this end.   The parties have now agreed revised requests to be served by agents, seeking information by 10 June 2024.  This situation will inevitably result in the current case management timetable slipping.</p>

The father contends that the police service in Zambia is endemically corrupt, points to the fact that the allegations of sexual abuse have been made by a parent seeking not to return to this jurisdiction with A and who has sought to obstruct his contact and any involvement in decisions concerning A and, through his lawyers in Zambia, has alleged that the mother has used named officers in the Zambian police service as a means of framing the father in order to succeed in the proceedings commenced by the father in this jurisdiction.  For her part, the mother seeks for the requests this court has made to the authorities in Zambia for documentation to be served on officials she names to combat a contended for risk that the agents instructed by the father will somehow improperly influence matters in that jurisdiction.</p>

Bluntly, the reason for this appears to be that the matters should have been raised on instruction by alternate counsel instructed at the last hearing but were not.  Whilst the solicitor for the mother sought to ascribe this to the fact that she had not been permitted to attend remotely at the hearing on 11 March 2024, it was not clear why counsel instructed on the last occasion had not been sufficiently briefed ahead of that hearing to raise the matters that Ms Allman now raises at this hearing.  By those additional directions, the mother now seeks to re-formulate the case management timetable established at the hearing on 11 March 2024 to allow for the determination, as a preliminary issue, of the question of beneficial interest in the family home and the nature of the disputed sum of &#163;850,000 provided to the mother by the father, so as to provide the parties with an opportunity to undertake an FDR / early neutral evaluation of the financial dispute or to otherwise negotiate in that regard.</p>

Likewise, no proposed costs budget was provided by the mother in support of the application for a costs allowance.  During the hearing, Ms Allman relied on certain correspondence from the mother&#8217;s solicitors to the mother (which expressly states it is not correspondence that is the subject of legal professional privilege) as setting out the sums the mother now seeks by way of a costs allowance.  These costs appear to encompass both the welfare and the financial proceedings.  In addition, by a Form H dated 3 May 2024, which appears to relate only to the Schedule 1 proceedings, the costs incurred to date are said to be &#163;6,239, with anticipated costs up to and including FDR of &#163;7,440.

Ms Allman notes in this context that were it not for the father&#8217;s challenges to the mother&#8217;s entitlements to these assets, which he placed in her name, neither the application for financial provision nor the application for legal costs funding would be required.   The mother further contends that she is not able to borrow against her assets in Zambia.  She has been refused, she contends, assistance by litigation funding lenders. In the circumstances, Ms Allman submits that the mother&#8217;s only route to securing a legal funding order from the father is to make an application for a costs allowance.  </p>

Another court had previously determined that A was habitually resident in Zambia at the relevant date and, whilst this conclusion was overturned on appeal, the appeal was allowed on the basis of that the judge had applied the wrong legal test and the facts were not so clear cut as to permit the Court of Appeal to reach its own conclusion and negate the need for a re-hearing.

However, in circumstances where the parties required the court to consider and determine each and every funding, costs and case management issue before the court, it is not realistic to think that a hearing of the disputed issues of beneficial interest in the former family home and gift versus loan with respect to the &#163;850,000 can be prepared for final determination within a little over 14 days from the date on which this judgment is handed down, particularly in circumstances where the question of the nature of the &#163;850,000 provided to the mother by the father has not yet been the subject of witness statements and may well require the disclosure and consideration of documentary evidence on that issue.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the hearing listed on 11, 12, 13 and 14 June 2024 will have to be vacated and the finding of fact hearing moved to the dates currently listed to deal with the financial and welfare matters.

Whilst various proposals were advanced with respect to dates already in the list, having regard to the timetable set out above, I am satisfied that in respect of the fact finding stage, this is likely to be most efficacious on or after 28 June 2024. In the financial proceedings and the final welfare hearing, this is likely be most effective after the receipt of the parties final welfare evidence and any <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.7</ref> report. In circumstances where there has even been a degree of disagreement over which date or dates should be utilised for further directions hearings, I will direct counsel to provide the court with their dates of availability for the pre-hearing reviews within 7 days and the court will then fix the dates.</p>

The parties were further incapable of agreeing any amendments to the case management timetable consequent on the delay in the receipt of information requested from the jurisdiction of Zambia.  The father insisted on pressing his disputed application for his costs ahead of the conclusion of those proceedings.  </p>

The parties may wish to reflect on the fact that such delay would have been avoided had they each been capable of taking a reasonable approach to the contested issues of funding and case management that they instead chose to lay at the feet of the court.</p>
