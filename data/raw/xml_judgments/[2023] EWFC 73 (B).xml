The parents split up in the first couple of years of her life, and extremely sadly, she appears to have been the subject of litigation for most of the time since then.  I have not seen it, but I understand there was an order made by District&#160;Judge&#160;Payne in 2012 when she was only three&#160;years old, and that obviously would have been at the end of a process before the Court.</span></p>

There are then further orders made and it is not entirely clear to me whether these are the same proceedings or different proceedings; the case number seems to vary, but there are other orders made by District&#160;Judge&#160;Buckley-Clarke in 2020, which provided for X to spend time with both parents, albeit a greater period each fortnight with mother.  That order was suspended by District&#160;Judge&#160;Buckley-Clarke in these proceedings in 2021 when she ordered that contact be more limited and supervised when X was spending time with father.</span></p>

That led ultimately to a fully-contested hearing in May and the first day of June this year when Recorder&#160;Hocking ultimately reinstated the long weekend contact with Father, with no supervision.  I have considered his very careful judgment about that and he is very clear that a 50/50 split of contact is not appropriate, not in the child&#8217;s interests, but that having a clear order for there to be some contact was.  He also made a section&#160;91(14) order inhibiting applications to the Court until X was 16.</span></p>

That offer is of course there, but it is not something that should be forced upon X.  The advice the Court has received is that she doesn&#8217;t want to because she has done it once already and it is important that father understands that such a meeting would not be a chance for X to express her views to the Court at all; that is not the purpose of it.</span></p>

He has been served with the papers when they were issued in October and served again in November, and I understand again on 1&#160;December.

Counsel, and I am sure with assiduous research, has not been able to uncover any reported cases which are of any great assistance to the Court.  It is not only that it is unusual for there to be committal proceedings in a family case, but it is also unusual for the alleged breaches to be not by the resident parent refusing to allow the child to spend time with the non-resident parent, but in this case the non-resident parent refusing to take up the contact that has been ordered and seeking to spend time with the child outside the order.</span></p>

Those orders both allowed the child to spend time with the father, but were very clear in restricting any contact between the child and the father outside the terms of the orders.  Both orders contain prohibited steps orders preventing that further contact.  The reason for that was to prevent X from feeling overwhelmed by continually being approached by her father when it was not properly planned and to try and prevent her feeling torn between her parents.  It has been said that she has found it very difficult to say no to her father.</span></p>

He has been cross-examined by counsel for the Guardian and briefly by Mother, who appears in person, as does he.  He frankly admits a number of breaches.  It is a very sad situation in that it ought to be perfectly possible for the child to spend time with both parents without this level of conflict.  Indeed, in the past, the Court has taken the view that she should spend time with both parents.  The difficulty is father&#8217;s insistence on doing so on his own terms, and it is that which puts the child in an impossible position.  It is self-defeating because it has led to this application.</span></p>

The funeral of a grandparent is, by definition, a rare event.

The situation was only brought to an end by Mother attending and being assaulted by father, in respect of which he has been arrested.  That breach is also proved.

However, instead of waving and going the other way, as it was suggested he should have done, he approached her, he engaged in conversation, as he set out in his own email to the Guardian on the same day, and as Mother described X reported to her.  There is a consistency about what was said, by Mother and by Father, namely that he asked X about seeing the judge again.  Mother&#8217;s evidence was also that X was very upset after that incident and that again is supported by Father, who said that she started crying.  We do not know why she was crying; each of them blames the other.  It does not matter.  She was upset.  The order does not permit this sort of conversation.  There was an alternative which was simply to wave, to smile and go away.

That incident was exacerbated by his throwing beer over one of the people with her.  All of that he acknowledged.  He does not deny it, and it is proved beyond reasonable doubt.</span></p>
