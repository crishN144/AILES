Recently I am very afraid that my wife tries to bring my son for a year to Cambridge, England where she plans to do her overseas study in her sabbatical leave from her office, a private university in Tokyo.  Although I have clearly and repeatedly opposed my wife's proposal to bring our son to Cambridge for a year, she is still explicitly telling me that she will bring our son.  All I can do now is to ask the government of UK to follow the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.  More specifically, in case my wife tries to obtain a visa for my son, please carefully examine the application whether there is consent from his father who is me.  Currently I have no intention to agree to his long stay abroad including in the UK.

Also, given T&#8217;s abrupt change of his approval on the child's move to England, along with his mother's professional assignment there, which he used to say as a desirable experience for the child, I have come to a conclusion that a divorce is the best option for the child's welfare and future as well as our own.  Although we have had considerable discussions that the divorce mediation are ready, I would like to enter into a divorce agreement again.  As you have been told during the mediation processes and as T has been aware for several years, I will be posted in England from one year from this April.  Therefore it would not be possible to exactly observe the access arrangements set by the mediation agreement.  My new assignment in England should not be taken as something to deny the access right of the child to the father nor the access right of the father to the child.

However, the mother did not await that judicial determination.

Thus, the wronged parent may sign a formal agreement if the child is to remain in the country to which he has been abducted.  Again, he may take an active part in proceedings in the country to which the child has been abducted to determine the long term future of the child.

He understood this.

R said his father did not come to the airport because he did not want him to come to the United Kingdom.  He said his daddy did know he was going to the United Kingdom but said it was fine to the go to the United Kingdom once but not a second time.  R then said he was not sure if his father knew about the first trip, though I thought he must have to make the argument that one visit was sufficient.  I asked him what he missed most about Japan and he said the food.  His favourite is Karataj which his paternal grandmother makes.  He added that his mum too was a good cook and she told me at the end of the interview that she was taking R to a restaurant in Chinatown before travelling back to England.(?)  I asked R what he liked about England and he replied: 'My school'.  I asked him if he liked his school in Japan and he said: 'Not much'.  I asked why and he said that his school in Japan was very strict.  The teachers were strict.  I asked him to give me an example and he said that if you do something wrong and are told off by the class teacher in Japan it's a big drama and the whole class has to stop what they are doing and wait and watch.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"First, it is clear that the burden of proof lies with the person, institution or other body which poses a child's return.  It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions.  There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities.  But in evaluating the evidence the court will of course be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague Convention process.  It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under Article 13(b) and so neither those allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"Second, the risk to the child must be grave.  It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such asylum, that the risk be real.  It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as grave.  Although grave characterises the risk rather than the harm there is in ordinary language, a link between the two.  Thus, a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as grave, while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"Third, the words 'physical' or 'psychological harm' are not qualified.  However, they do gain colour from the alternative or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation.  As was said in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re D</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, intolerable is a strong word but when applied to a child must mean a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not expected to tolerate.  Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation.  Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble discomfort and distress.  It is part of growing up, but there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate.  Among these of course are physical or psychological abuse or neglect to the child itself.  Among these also we now understand can be exposure to harmful effects as seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of the other parent.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"Fourth, Article 13(b) is looking to the future, the situation as it would be if the child were to be returned forthwith to his home country.  As has often been pointed out this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person who has requested the return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand.  More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when he gets home."</span></p>

The court in Tokyo is already seized of that issue and will be addressing it on 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August of this year.  Therefore, it follows from my findings that, firstly, I am satisfied that R has been retained in the United Kingdom unlawfully in breach of the father's custody rights.  Secondly, that Japan is R's country of habitual residence and, thirdly, that none of the Article 13 defences have been established.  Accordingly, pursuant to Article 12, I must order the return of R to Japan forthwith.  There is no definition of the term "forthwith".  In this case, as we know, the mother intends to return to Japan with R on or about 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2014 to attend the hearing listed at the Tokyo Family Court.  Accordingly, in my judgment, it is fair and proportionate to order the return of R to Japan on or before 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2014.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">At the beginning of this judgment I explained that the purpose of the Hague Convention is to provide a swift mechanism to secure the safe return of a child wrongfully removed or retained away from his country of habitual residence to enable the court in his country of habitual residence to decide any parental disputes about him.  In this case, as I have indicated, the Family Court in Tokyo is already seized of two applications to resolve parental disputes about this particular child.  The mother should have waited until the Family Court in Tokyo had resolved those disputes.  This adjudication will require R to be returned to Japan to enable the Family Court in Tokyo to exercise its jurisdiction.</span></p>
