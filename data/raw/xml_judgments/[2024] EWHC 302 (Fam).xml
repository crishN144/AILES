Both parties have been represented by experienced counsel in Ms Gray for the mother and Ms Chaudhry for the father. I have not heard evidence, but I have had the benefit of reading 3 statements from each of them, and I have heard oral submissions from both counsel to augment their full skeleton arguments. I have also been provided with a full bundle of authorities, and indeed a further number after the conclusion of submissions, in light of points discussed during the hearing. This matter had been listed before me for a day, which was always likely to be too little, given the issues between the parties.</span></p>

I have not had to enquire as to whether this also confers on her Jordanian nationality. The father accepts that when he took R to Jordan, he did this without the mother&#8217;s knowledge or consent. He then obtained, again without notice, an order from the Jordanian Court to prevent R being removed from Jordan, dated 20 September 2023. Since then there have been no further Court proceedings in Jordan relating to R, and Ms Chaudhry has confirmed that there are no ongoing proceedings there. The father says that he did inform the mother that he had obtained this order, but he does not suggest that she was afforded the opportunity to be involved in the process by which the order was obtained.</span></p>

Sadly it failed to produce any agreed way forward between R&#8217;s parents, and so the application comes before me today. Whilst there has been no direct contact between R and her mother since 24 August 2023, it is also clear that there had been no consideration of any direct meeting in any other country than Jordan or England, and it is to be hoped that that possibility will be explored in the event that the issues between these parents around where R is to live continue to be disputed between them going forward.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">17&#8230; : (i) The habitual residence of a child corresponds to the place which re&#64258;ects some degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment (A v A, adopting the European test). (ii) The test is essentially a factual one which should not be overlaid with legal sub-rules or glosses. It must be emphasised that the factual inquiry must be centred throughout on the circumstances of the child&#8217;s life that is most likely to illuminate his habitual residence (A v A, In re L). (iii) In common with the other rules of jurisdiction in Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (&#8220;Brussels IIA&#8221;) its meaning is &#8220;shaped in the light of the best interests of the child, in particular on the criterion of proximity&#8221;. Proximity in this context means &#8220;the practical connection between the child and the country concerned&#8221;: A v A, para 80(ii); In re B, para 42, applying Mercredi v Cha&#64256;e (Case C-497/10PPU) EU:C:2010:829; [2012] Fam 22, para 46. (iv) It is possible for a parent unilaterally to cause a child to change habitual residence by removing the child to another jurisdiction without the consent of the other parent (In re R). (v) A child will usually but not necessarily have the same habitual residence as the parent(s) who care for him or her (In re LC). The younger the child the more likely the proposition, however, this is not to eclipse the fact that the investigation is child focused. It is the child&#8217;s habitual residence which is in question and, it follows the child&#8217;s integration which is under consideration. (vi) Parental intention is relevant to the assessment, but not determinative (In re L, In re R and In re B). (vii) It will be highly unusual for a child to have no habitual residence. Usually a child lose a pre-existing habitual residence at the same time as gaining a new one (In re B). (viii) &#8230; (ix) It is the stability of a child&#8217;s residence as opposed to its permanence which is relevant, though this is qualitative and not quantitative, in the sense that it is the integration of the child into the environment rather than a mere measurement of the time a child spends there (In re R and earlier in In re L and Mercredi). (x) The relevant question is whether a child has achieved some degree of integration in social and family environment; it is not necessary for a child to be fully integrated before becoming habitually resident (In re R) (emphasis added). (xi) The requisite degree of integration can, in certain circumstances, develop quite quickly (article 9 of Brussels IIA envisages within three months). It is possible to acquire a new habitual residence in a single day (A v A; In re B). In the latter case Lord Wilson JSC referred (para 45) to those &#8220;&#64257;rst roots&#8221; which represent the requisite degree of integration and which a child will &#8220;probably&#8221; put down &#8220;quite quickly&#8221; following a move. (xii) Habitual residence was a question of fact focused upon the situation of the child, with the purposes and intentions of the parents being merely among the relevant factors. It was the stability of the residence that was important, not whether it was of a permanent character. There was no requirement that the child should have been resident in the country in question for a particular period of time, let alone that there should be an intention on the part of one or both parents to reside there permanently or inde&#64257;nitely (In re R). (xiii) The structure of Brussels IIA, and particularly recital (12) to the Regulation, demonstrates that it is in a child&#8217;s best interests to have an habitual residence and accordingly that it would be highly unlikely, albeit possible (or, to use the term adopted in certain parts of the judgment, exceptional), for a child to have no habitual residence; As such, &#8220;if interpretation of the concept of habitual residence can reasonably yield both a conclusion that a child has an habitual residence and, alternatively, a conclusion that he lacks any habitual residence, the court should adopt the former&#8221; (In re B supra). </span></p>

This is not to say continuing or historical connections are not relevant but they are part of, not the primary focus of, the court&#8217;s analysis when deciding the critical question which is where is the child habitually resident and not, simply, when was a previous habitual residence lost.</span></p>

It is necessary to assess the degree of integration of the child into a social and family environment in the country in question. The social and family environment of an infant or young child is shared with those (whether parents or others) on whom she is dependent. Hence it is necessary, in such a case, to assess the integration of that person or persons in the social and family environment of the country concerned. The essentially factual and individual nature of the inquiry should not be glossed with legal concepts which would produce a different result from that which the factual inquiry would produce.&#8221;</span></p>

There is no issue but that she was habitually resident in England and Wales up to the point of her removal to Jordan on 24 August 2023. However, thereafter she moved into a completely new environment (I do not consider that the brief holiday in September 2022 offers evidence of any advanced integration into Jordanian life for her). Fully considering Moylan LJ&#8217;s analysis, I consider that R&#8217;s lack of real former connections with Jordan, and the loss to her of her mother who, clearly, has been an important carer in her life &#8211; notwithstanding the father&#8217;s case that he had been her primary carer, which I will deal with below &#8211; would have meant that she would not have begun any appreciable degree of integration into Jordanian life immediately upon her arrival. Whilst the father&#8217;s family were around her, none of them can have been well-known or even recognisable to her before her arrival.</span></p>

This period of nearly a year, for a child born only in January 2022, would have been a critical one for R. I accept the mother&#8217;s case that she was the primary carer for R immediately prior to her removal to Jordan in August 2023. So, whilst the focus must be on the degree of integration R would have achieved in Jordan, the loss of her connection to her mother must be relevant to the question of how quickly she can have become integrated into life with her father and his family in Jordan, and prevented any sufficient integration being immediate.</span></p>

He speaks of seeing extended family, and of being able to access the health care system. He says that he is (on his case &#8211; he remains) her primary carer.

Now, after a period of 5 months rather than 2, for a child who has only just passed her second birthday, the level of integration will inevitably be such that she will more likely be habitually resident in Jordan than she had been when these proceedings began. It has to be said that the evidence in the father&#8217;s third statement provides no more specific examples, but I consider that it would be unsafe to proceed on the basis that she remains habitually resident in England after the time which has unavoidably elapsed, and the reality for her of her life in Jordan, without direct contact with her mother. She does maintain regular indirect contact with her, but there will by now be, in my judgement, a sufficient degree of integration into her surroundings that her habitual residence will have become Jordan.</span></p>

In those circumstances, I agree with Ms Gray that the issue of stay cannot arise as s.5(2)(a) of the 1986 Act enables the Court to grant a stay on an application for a Part 1 order, in circumstances where proceedings with respect to the matters to which the application relates are continuing outside England and Wales.

On the one hand, this is a clear and acknowledged case of a removal from the jurisdiction of her then habitual residence of a very young child by one parent without the knowledge or consent of the other; which other I am satisfied was her primary carer immediately before that removal. However, the removal was to a country which is not a signatory to any relevant convention, and one where both parties&#8217; counsel acknowledge that any orders made in this jurisdiction will have scant prospect of being enforced. And further, the making of a return order may serve to do no more than further entrench the parties, who have already had one unsuccessful attempt at mediation, and make the prospect of R having a meaningful relationship with both of her parents, as she needs to, more remote than is already the case following the father&#8217;s unilateral and precipitate action.</span></p>

In that case she had the benefit of a single joint expert&#8217;s report on the Libyan legal system, and evidence given to her in court by a representative on behalf of the Libyan ambassador, as well as extensive evidence from an experienced CAFCASS reporter. However, one of her principal reasons there was the expressed opposition by the children to a return from Libya, at an age when their views carried significant weight (they were 14 and 12).</span></p>

Either the mother comes to Jordan, or she will simply not have face to face meetings with R. I suggested that he might consider visits in a neutral third state &#8211; somewhere such as Dubai &#8211; but Ms Chaudhry indicated that such a possibility had not been considered as a way forward. I was told that it now might be. Meanwhile, it is inevitable that however attentive the father&#8217;s family may be, R will be suffering emotional harm by being deprived of the opportunity to spend face to face time with her mother. I have seen no evidence that that will change in the absence of a return order, but there is no certainty that making such an order will achieve a positive outcome for R.</span></p>

It is only after deciding what orders are required to secure the children&#8217;s welfare that the court should turn to consider enforceability, and when it does consider that matter it will look first at the likelihood of the person against whom the order is made complying with the order and then the means of enforcing compliance if he does not. There may be various means of securing compliance without resorting to reciprocal enforcement in the courts of the other country.&#8217;</span></p>

It may well prove to be the only available order for this court to make to attempt to persuade the father that R&#8217;s interests, and his own, are best served by returning her to this country so that a proper welfare analysis can be carried out, the allegations that each party makes against the other can be investigated. I am aware, however, that the making of such an order may simply have the effect of leaving the father feeling unable to offer any direct opportunities for R to see and spend meaningful time with her mother.</span></p>

On any view, those arguments rang hollow in circumstances where there are no ongoing proceedings in Jordan, that before the mother was even aware that proceedings had commenced, the father had already obtained a &#8216;stop order&#8217;, and that the father has demonstrated that he is well able to litigate with high level specialist representation in the English Court. I can see little benefit to R in any adjournment to garner further information about the legal position in Jordan, about which the parents are not actually in disagreement.</span></p>
