DP has been a resident of NN Care Home since 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2004. He requires support with activities of daily living including personal care, hygiene, medication, mobility, nutrition and general safety. He has been prescribed antipsychotic medication, namely sulpiride which is administered at 300mg twice daily. He also receives a mood stabiliser, sodium valproate 250mg again, twice daily. It is reported by the Registered General Nurse (RGN) that at the care home, DP requires support of at least one staff member for his personal care and hygiene needs but requires 2 staff members when catatonic. Episodes of catatonia occur approximately once every 2 weeks and endure usually for one day, though occasionally for 3 days. DP is doubly incontinent and requires incontinence pads. He mobilises independently for short distances but uses a wheelchair for longer distances. He is able to feed himself, save when catatonic. When he is catatonic it is possible to continue feeding him, with support. </p>

This is not found on the form itself. The form could usefully be amended to add a question seeking this information. Elsewhere Dr Longe stated that he introduced himself &#8220;as a BIA acting on behalf of the London Borough of Hillingdon to review his care and support needs&#8221;. This is clearly an inaccurate description of the purpose of his visit. Hayden J found a failure to properly explain the purpose of the assessment to be a critical one in the Wandsworth case (para 71) and said it could be fatal or at least gravely undermines the assessment. He was not dealing with interim applications or indeed assessments for a standard authorisation. Clearly, there is scope for training on both the need for and how such explanations could be given.&#8221; </span></p>

In my last visit, he was in a catatonic way but was still saying he wants to move. However, at the same time, [DP] stated that he is happy at [NN] Home. [DP] told me that if he moves to West Drayton, Bill will visit more frequently. There was a meeting to discuss this move on 11.06.2019. I was not invited to attend this as I believe there was some confusion at the care home/social worker on who the PPR is and Rachel Hagland from POhWER attended this. I spoke to Rukayat (Home Manager) about the outcome of the meeting and she advised me that [DP] wanted herself and Karen (Staff) to go with him to West Drayton and when Rukayat advised him that they are unable to go with him, [DP] stated, "if that is the case then I will stay here."

Bill has stated to staff, which is recorded, that he cannot guarantee he will be able to visit [DP], if [DP] moves to West Drayton. This is due to Bill's wife being unwell and he is her main carer. Moving [DP] to West Drayton will allow [DP] to have the vision that Bill will visit frequently. However, when this does not happen, [DP] may feel isolated as he is in a new placement/environment with unfamiliar faces. It may also have an impact on [DP] 's and Bill's friendship, [DP] may start to neglect Bill for not visiting, which will effect the the only friendship [DP] seems to have. Having regular visits to see Bill, if possible every 4-6 weeks, will allow [DP] to keep his friendship live and I believe this will reassure [DP] to stay at NN Home.&#8221; </span></p>

DP does identify that he has had a stroke and is unable to care for himself and that he needs support when catatonic. These appear to be reasoned decisions. The fact that he was unable to discuss his care needs when asked, could be for a variety of reasons: he does not wish to, is bored, is embarrassed to do so, lacks insight into them, does not consider them significant etc. It is not clear what might be the explanation. The fact that DP says carers don&#8217;t support him and don&#8217;t allow him to shave even though he is clean shaven, could bear a variety of meanings. Also, when Dr Longe  says DP was unable to discuss the potential risks of leaving the care home the context of the question is not clear. We don&#8217;t know how Dr Longe raised this question, whether he suggested that there were risks and DP did not acknowledge them or whether he is saying DP did not spontaneously raise this issue. The latter would be an unreasonable expectation under the circumstances. The information recorded leaves open many questions and evidences poor connections and reasoning by Dr Longe.&#8221; </span></p>

My understanding is that there is a case which has very recently been heard by the Court of Appeal which might throw some light on this. For some time, it has seemed to me that attention has not yet been directed to the problems that might exist if a court considering the evidence that was before it, necessarily at a later time to the times upon which the relevant standard authorisations were given, reaches different conclusions to the relevant assessors and those responsible for granting the standard authorisation. </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.65in;text-indent:0.25in"><span style="font-style:italic">Such points may well not be academic because issues could arise whether a deprivation of liberty was unlawful through periods of time during which DOLS authorisations based on conclusions that are different to those reached by the Court were in place. In that context, the relevant public authorities may face claims for damages. To my mind, there must be an argument that, in testing the legality from time to time of standard authorisations, an administrative law test is the appropriate one. However, equally, to my mind, and this is supported by the approach taken thus far in the Court of Protection, in the exercise of its powers under 21A the Court of Protection is not carrying out any sort of appeal or review jurisdiction. Rather, it is assessing the relevant qualifying requirements itself and reaching its own view on the evidence presented to it. It is almost inevitable that when doing that the Court will have to pay close attention to what will, on the evidence before it, best promote the best interests of the relevant person in the immediate, medium and long term and so carry out its own best interests assessment. That is an inevitability in this case should it proceed. Also, as I have explained, if this case proceeds there is a high likelihood or an inevitability that if it is thought that the least restrictive way to best promote the best interests of UF is that she should be in a care home, so long as she protests at being there, she would be being deprived of her liberty and therefore that would need to be authorised.</span></p>

It does not provide for the making of a declaration. Thus, the Court&#8217;s finding that there is reason to believe that P lacks capacity ought, strictly, not to be phrased in declaratory terms.  Ms Butler-Cole also argues that, as the COPR 2017 describe an interim declaration as an &#8220;interim remedy&#8221;, there can be no interim remedy in a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 21</ref>A MCA application.

It was open to the Deputy District Judge, for example, to permit questions to be put to Dr Longe and/or, if necessary, to arrange for him to give evidence or revisit his assessment. I doubt that it was necessary to instruct a further expert on what is, when properly identified,  an essentially uncomplicated issue i.e. does DP have capacity to decide to change care homes to be nearer to his friend Bill and, if not, whether it is in his best interests to do so.  </p>

I have lengthy, carefully crafted and well researched skeleton arguments on both sides, the benefit of a hyperlinked e bundle and Authorities bundle. I have heard skilled and focused submissions, on a video conferencing platform, for a day and a half, interspersed with appropriate breaks. I was also asked if DP could speak to me from his care home. As a courtesy and out of respect for his wish to be involved, I readily agreed. I did not take any evidence from him and was accompanied throughout by his Accredited Legal Representative. In stark contrast, DDJ Chahal had a one-hour telephone hearing and limited opportunity to absorb the position statements. Moreover, the elision of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 48</ref> declaration with the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 21</ref>A procedure was, I consider, one in which the Advocates became entangled. Though I have allowed this appeal I think it important to highlight and acknowledge DDJ Chahal&#8217;s industry and effort in putting together a detailed and thoughtful judgment in circumstances which were challenging and so markedly different from my own. Importantly, it requires to be noted that the argument that the mental capacity requirement was not met had not been foreshadowed in the grounds filed with the application. It was however identified in the Position Statement and the draft order filed by the applicant.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">These phrases found favour with Parker J in DA v DJ (supra). Indeed, Parker J expressly deprecated my own reluctance to accept that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 48</ref> test might be met on &#8220;a possibility&#8221; that P lacked capacity. As I read all three judgments I note that in each one, an attempt has been made to illuminate, expand or recast the clear words of the statute itself. It is, I think, better to predicate this exercise in the way that Parker J succinctly identified, by formulating the question &#8220;is there reason to believe that P lacks capacity?&#8221; This will be answered by conducting a broad survey of all the available evidence, including hearsay evidence, which, inevitably, will have varying cogency and weight. It is intrinsic, as I see it, to each of the three judgments that there is a recognition that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 48</ref> test requires proper consideration and evaluation of evidence. It is manifest that the section permits the court to make an interim order where professional evidence as to lack of capacity is not yet available. It should also be noted that the section is permissive, providing that the court &#8220;may&#8221; make an order, but not requiring it to do so.  This provides the crucial safeguard in those cases where reasonable grounds for believing that P may lack capacity, on a given issue, can be identified but where the plans or proposed arrangements that are contemplated on the making of an order appear to the judge to be disproportionate or to represent an unjustifiable interference with P&#8217;s autonomy.  The court has to be satisfied that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it is in P&#8217;s best interests to make the order, or give the directions, without delay.&#8221; </span>(see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S48</ref> </p>

The use of the word &#8220;delay&#8221; in this provision indicates that the section is designed for circumstances of perceived urgency or emergency. The Law Commission Report preceding the enactment and implementation of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> and the explanatory notes published by TSO (The Stationery Office), alongside <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> were referred to in DA v DJ. I note that the relevant extract from the Law Commission Report reads as follows and I further note that it is headed &#8220;Emergency Orders&#8221;:</p>

In exercising this emergency jurisdiction, the court would only be able to make the order or give the directions sought if it is of the opinion that the order or direction is in the best interests of the person concerned. We recommend that the Court of Protection should have power to make an order or give directions on a matter pending a decision on whether the person concerned is without capacity in relation to that matter (draft bill, clause 48).&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Finally, as I have now observed in a number of cases, the Court of Protection is a uniquely fact specific jurisdiction. Therein lies the danger of attempting, however well-meaningly, to add an explanatory gloss to the words of the statute. In the Wandsworth case I was considering a perfunctory and very superficial assessment which, for the best of motives, was intended to deliver an undoubtedly kind and beneficial outcome for P. The purpose of the assessment had not been explained to P and the analysis was, as I described, &#8220;superficial and incomplete.&#8221; I did not intend that the absence of an explanation to P of the purpose of the assessment or even the failure adequately to engage P&#8217;s involvement in the assessment would automatically and, in every case, result in the assessment failing to meet the evidential test set by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 48</ref>.
