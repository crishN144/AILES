	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this judgment I consider a difficult question as to whether this court has jurisdiction to hear an application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in respect of two children, a girl E aged 9 and a boy M aged 4. The father, the applicant, contends that this court has jurisdiction on one of two grounds: (1) that at the date on which proceedings were started, namely 22 February 2016, the children were habitually resident in England and Wales and that, as a result, this court has jurisdiction under Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 (&#8220;Brussels IIA&#8221;), or alternatively (2) that the children were wrongfully removed from England and Wales to Latvia in September 2015 at a point when they were habitually resident here, that the father has neither consented to nor acquiesced in their removal, and that as a result this court has jurisdiction under Article 10 of Brussels IIA. The mother, the respondent to the proceedings, contends that at all material times the children were habitually resident in Latvia and that the courts of that country have jurisdiction under Brussels IIA in respect of all matters of parental responsibility. In the alternative, she wishes to argue that, if this court has jurisdiction under the regulation, it should initiate the process under Article 15 of Brussels IIA to transfer jurisdiction to Latvia on the grounds that a court of that country is better placed to hear the case. In the course of the hearing, however, it was conceded on behalf of the mother that this court does not at present have sufficient information to determine an application under Article 15. In the event that I conclude that this court has jurisdiction on one or other of the grounds claimed by the father, the question of whether to initiate the procedure under Article 15 will be adjourned to another occasion, assuming the mother decides to proceed with that application.</p>

It is the child&#8217;s integration which is under consideration. Each child is an individual with his own experiences and his own perceptions. These are not necessarily determined by the decisions of his parents &#8230;. The environment of an infant or very young child is (one hopes) a family environment and so determined by reference to the person with whom he lives. But once the child leaves the family environment and goes to school, his social world widens and there are more factors to be taken into account. Furthermore, where parents are separated, there may well be two possible homes in which the children can live and the children will be well aware of this. This may well affect the degree of their integration in a new environment&#8221; per Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re LC</span> para 62.</p>

The concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he loses his old one. Simple analogies are best: consider a see-saw. As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up will probably come the child's roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it&#8221; per Lord Wilson in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> para 45.</p>

According to the mother, arguments continued and she alleges that in April 2011, the father assaulted her again. The police were called and the father was arrested and told that he should keep away. Once again, however, the parties resumed cohabitation. The mother and the children travelled to Latvia but returned back to England in August 2011. At that point, however, the mother became pregnant again and in December 2011 she and the two girls again returned to Latvia. One reason for the mother&#8217;s decision to return on this occasion was that she was experiencing problems with her pregnancy and wanted to get medical treatment in her home country. It is a recurring theme in this case that the mother prefers medical treatment provided by the Latvian medical services rather than the National Health Service in this country.</p>

In December 2012, the mother and three children returned to the UK and once again resumed living with the father. By January 2013, she was pregnant again. In February 2013, the mother went to Latvia by herself to undergo an abortion, leaving the children with the father in England. It is her case that the father pressurised her into having a termination. Afterwards, she returned to England but a few weeks later another argument took place which led to the police being called. On this occasion (according to the mother) the father took off all his clothes so that when the police arrived he was standing naked in the house. The police did not arrest him on this occasion but, according to the mother, asked him to leave.</p>

In May 2014, the mother and the three children once more came back to this country. Meanwhile, the father was continuing to press his case to be allowed to remain in this country. He has produced for these proceedings a copy of a handwritten document apparently written by the mother in June 2014 in support of his application for leave to remain in the UK. In the document, the mother asserts that she had been working in England since 2009, that she had been living in London during this period and that the children lived here. Following submission of this letter, the father was issued with a permanent residence card as the spouse of an EEA national exercising their treaty rights in the UK. Further documentary evidence exhibited to the statements shows that HMRC allocated tax credits to the father and mother as a couple in the tax year ending April 2015.</p>

She returned to the family home but social services insisted that, because of the alleged domestic violence, she should leave the property. Having done so, however, she was told by the housing department that they had no accommodation for her. Following the intervention of her MP, however, she and the children were accommodated temporarily in a hostel in the same London borough</p>

In her second statement in these proceedings, the mother states that the main reason for this trip was because of what she regarded as a risk of misdiagnosis of tuberculosis in England, and her overall concern about the children. She had asked her GP in England to check for TB but he had apparently replied that test was only carried out when there were signs that the child was suffering from the illness. The mother commented about this in her statement:</p>

As A was attending the school in UK, we agreed with the family including the children that she would return with me but at the end of the academic year we would come back to take them back with us to UK. Both E and M agreed and were happy to stay with their grandparents in Latvia &#8230;.

In January he was issued with a deportation order but subsequently lodged an appeal against the order. On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016, he was released on immigration bail. At the time of his release, he was on licence to the probation service until August 2016, the licence being subject to conditions not to speak to, approach or communicate with the mother or A, or speak to, approach or communicate with E or M without the prior approval of the family court or social services. A few days after his release, the father filed an application in the East London Family Court seeking a child arrangements order in respect of all three children and a prohibited steps order preventing the mother removing the children from the jurisdiction. On 9 March 2016, District Judge Davies ordered the mother to return the children to this country by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March, gave directions for the filing of statements, and ordered CAFCASS to complete a risk assessment by 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May.

She therefore spoke to social services in Latvia and was referred to the Orphan Court. A psychologist was appointed to see the children and subsequently reported that the children had expressed fear of the father. E was reported as saying that she likes living in Latvia because she doesn&#8217;t have to see her father, and is afraid to go to England because her father is there. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the father, Mr Jacob Gifford Head conceded that until 2014 the children were habitually resident in Latvia. He submitted that that they were not deeply integrated in that country because they spent regular periods living in England, but nonetheless accepted that they were habitually resident there. His principal argument was that subsequently they became habitually resident in England prior to returning to Latvia in 2015 and further they remained habitually resident in England up to February 2016 when the father filed his application in the East London Family Court. On that basis, he submitted that this court has jurisdiction under Article 8. In the alternative, Mr Gifford Head argued that, even if the children ceased to be habitually resident in this country at some point between September 2015 and February 2016, the father neither consented to not acquiesced in their removal from this country so that this court has jurisdiction under Article 10.</p>

It is the children&#8217;s habitual residence and integration which are under consideration. Each child is an individual with her or his own experiences and her or his own perceptions. These are not necessarily determined by the decisions of their parents. On the other hand, I also bear in mind Baroness Hale&#8217;s observation in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v A</span> that the social and family environment of an infant or young child is shared with those (whether parents or others) on whom she or he is dependent.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, M is a very young child whose social and family environment is inevitably shared with those on whom he is dependent. E is somewhat older &#8211; 9 &#189; - and has been attending school for some time so that, to adopt Baroness Hale&#8217;s words, her social world is somewhat wider. Overall, however, I find that both M and E are principally dependent upon their mother. They are close to their maternal grandparents and perhaps also to other members of the maternal family, but their lives have largely followed their mother&#8217;s life. For the substantial preponderance of their lives to date, they have lived with their mother. When a separation has occurred, it has only been temporary.</p>

It seems likely, therefore, that they were not as deeply integrated in Latvia as they would have been had they lived continuously in that country.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A few months later, the relationship between the parents finally broke down after the father assaulted the mother with a shoe. It might have been expected at that point that the mother and children would then relocate to Latvia again. In fact, the opposite occurred. During the children&#8217;s visit to Latvia in early autumn 2014, the mother came over to England to try to arrange permanent accommodation for her and the children away from the father&#8217;s property. In other words, there was an element of pre-planning to her actions at this point. Then, in October 2014, the mother brought all three children back to this country and the mother actively sought permanent housing here, enlisting the help of social services and her MP. E and, in due course, A started attending school here and M attended nursery. The children were registered with a GP.</p>

Her intention was that they would remain there only for such time as they were receiving treatment. When it became clear that the treatment would take several months, she decided that they should stay in Latvia for the rest of the academic year until May 2016. But it was always her intention that the children would return to live in England. It was only after Judge Davies&#8217; order in March 2016 that the mother changed her mind. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further important point is the fact that, save possibly for a short visit during the February half term, the mother and A remained in England throughout this period. It follows that, although the maternal grandparents and other members of the maternal family were with the children in Latvia, the &#8220;central members of their family&#8221; &#8211; that is to say, their parents and their older sister &#8211; were all living in England.</p>

It was the mother&#8217;s clear intention that they would return to England at the end of the academic year. I therefore find that E and M remained habitually resident in England at the date when the father started these proceedings in February 2016. As result, this court has jurisdiction under Article 8 of Brussels IIA.</p>

I accept Mr Gifford Head&#8217;s submission as to the proper interpretation of the 2007 statutory declaration which, in any event, applied only to E and not M. Accordingly, even if the court does not have jurisdiction under Article 8, it has jurisdiction under Article 10.</p>

I have yet to decide whether to initiate the process for transferring the case to Latvia under Article 15 or, if the case is not transferred, what order should be made as to the future welfare of the children. It should not be assumed that, simply because the court has concluded that it has jurisdiction, it will find in favour of the father&#8217;s application. The mother will plainly put forward arguments that the children should continue to live in Latvia, but the question as to precisely what orders should be made is for another occasion.</p>
