	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an appeal from a dismissal by DJ Aitken of an application by the Appellant Mother (the mother) of an application made under Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> for a lump sum payment for the benefit of her daughter (the child) to meet, or to contribute to, (a) the costs of the Schedule 1 claim (the Schedule 1 proceedings) and (b) proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> relating to where the child should be educated and where she should live (the s. 8 proceedings).  The Respondent to the Schedule 1 proceedings and this appeal, and the applicant in the s. 8 proceedings is the child&#8217;s father (the father).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case was presented to the District Judge, and this appeal was opened, on the basis that the court had no jurisdiction to make an order for periodical payments to cover the costs allowance sought because this was precluded by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/8/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 8(1)</ref> and (2) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref>.  The basis for this approach was that a CSA assessment had been made in 2004 and, although a review was sought May 2010, this had not yet been completed and the present assessment was below the maximum assessment.</p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The premise for that stance was and is that, unless and until the Commission make a maximum assessment, the Court&#8217;s power to order &#8220;top up&#8221; periodical payments pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/8/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 8(6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref> is not engaged.  I queried this, because it is not what <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/8/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 8(6)</ref> expressly provides, and  I was referred to <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re P</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2003/837" uk:canonical="[2003] EWCA Civ 837" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWCA Civ 837</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">H v C </span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 2 FLR 1540" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 2 FLR 1540</ref>.  It seemed to me arguable that the court could determine the issue of fact that is part of the trigger to its jurisdiction set by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/8/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 8(6)</ref>(b), namely whether the father has a net weekly income in excess of the figure set in regulations (at present &#163;2,000 per week).  It was common ground that the jurisdictional issue of fact set by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/8/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 8(6)</ref>(a) is satisfied.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unsurprisingly, the mother&#8217;s counsel sought to adopt and pursue this argument which has two elements namely whether (a) the original common approach that the court&#8217;s jurisdiction is not engaged unless and until the Commission makes a maximum assessment is correct, and (b) if not, whether the father&#8217;s net income exceeds &#163;2,000 a week.  Understandably counsel had not come prepared to argue point (a), and the evidence had not been directed to point (b).  Consequently, as I indicated during the hearing, I concluded that the point could not be fairly pursued on this appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, in my view, whatever the answer is to point (a) there should be a full two way street of disclosure relating to the father&#8217;s income and more generally his financial resources between the Schedule 1 proceedings and the Commission&#8217;s assessment.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The jurisdictional issue on the appeal is therefore whether the court has power, where a child maintenance calculation below the maximum assessment is in place, to make a payment for the benefit of the child in respect of legal fees of the Schedule 1 proceedings and/or other proceedings (here the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 8</ref> proceedings).</p>

I have checked the order and confirm that the costs element was included within an order for periodical payments and that the capital sum of &#163;250,000 was not a lump sum ordered under Schedule 1 but was a sum provided as a sinking fund from which periodical payments could be deducted given the history on non-payment.  The reality in that case has been that the periodical payments ordered have been made from, or through, that fund in the UK and it has been topped up from time to time.  The jurisdiction to provide for that fund either under Schedule 1 (e.g. paragraph 9(1)(b)), or as an aspect of the grant of the stay of the contested divorce proceedings (it being disputed whether the parties had been married in Nigeria, and I decided that this should be determined by the Nigerian courts) was not the subject of argument.</p>

My recollection is that such trusts can have some fiscal advantages, and can be utilised (quite properly) to enable shareholding directors (and employees) to receive benefits derived from the profits of a business in a form other than salary or dividend.  That may or may not apply here, but it seems that it is the ultimate owner of at least some of the assets and profits (and thus declared dividends) of some of the XY companies and that the father would be likely to be one of the persons who could receive funds from it.  So, on the material before me, I consider that the practical and fiscal purpose of that ultimate controlling party, its access to dividends paid by other XY companies, the moneys received by the father from it and his ability to access money from or through it, merit examination in the assessment of his financial resources.</p>

As I understand it, within them the father relies on an agreement with the mother that when the child had completed her primary education she would move to Edinburgh and continue her education under his care and supervision spending her holidays with her mother.  Initially his position was that the child would need to board, but this has now changed.  The schooling issue is therefore closely linked to the issues on residence and contact because the father contends for a school in Edinburgh and the mother for one in England.  Further, and although as I understand it the father accepts that he will pay her fees wherever she goes to school, this schooling issue has a tangible link to the Schedule 1 proceedings because it has an impact on where the child will have her home or homes and what, if any, provision should be made by the father for or towards a home for the mother and child and the upkeep of the child.</p>

It will therefore involve this emotional pressure for the mother whatever its other merits.  This point is also an obvious hurdle, that the father will have to overcome if he is to show that the child&#8217;s best interests will be served by her moving to live in Edinburgh for the terms (and part of the holidays because of the desirability of her having some holiday time at the home of her father and where she can see her school friends) in  circumstances in which it seems that the father will continue to work full time and for hours and in places that do not fit easily with the timetable of the child.  It may therefore be that he will   have to employ a carer. On the face of it, it would seem that the mother has strong points to advance in favour of the view that the welfare of the child would be best promoted by her living with her mother and going to school in England.</p>

In the Schedule 1 proceedings there is the additional point that the instructions to the accountant who has been instructed to report therein (initially at the cost of the father) need to be prepared so that he is directed to issues identified by lawyers or persons familiar with the issue in the Schedule 1 proceedings.  I add that the generally framed instructions, as often seen in claims for financial provision, would not in my view be appropriate.  Also his report will need to be considered by someone with appropriate expertise to seek to ensure, for the benefit of the child, that a full and accurate picture of the father&#8217;s financial position is before the court.</p>
