	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">These proceedings concern the welfare of two girls, KM aged 11 years and KR aged 9 years. The children&#8217;s mother is aged 50 years; she is represented by Ms Laurence of Counsel. The father is aged 56 years; he is unrepresented and conducts litigation in person although his cross examination of the mother was undertaken by Mr Khan of Counsel acting as a Qualified Legal Representative (&#8220;QLR&#8221;). The children are represented by Ms McMeechan of Counsel through their children&#8217;s guardian.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">The parents previously found themselves before the Family Court in 2019, when the father made an application. Those proceedings concluded on 19 November 2020 at a final hearing before Recorder Archer, which provided for the children to live with both parents, with the father on alternate weekends and for broadly half of all school holidays, and at all other times with the mother. In addition, there was provision for telephone or video calls &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">at least</span>&#8217; twice per week. I shall call this child arrangements order the &#8220;2020 order&#8221;. By Form C100 dated 3 March 2022, the mother applies to vary that order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">It is a sad fact of this case that the children&#8217;s relationship with the father appears to have deteriorated over the course of the proceedings. As long ago as the order of Deputy District Judge McDonagh on 3 October 2022, the father is recorded as having alleged that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">contact is not progressing due to parental alienation</span>&#8217;. It is that allegation that now forms the core focus of this fact-finding hearing. </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0in">February 2024, the father was assisted by Counsel for the children to boil down his allegations into a core schedule which now appears in the bundle; in essence, there are three headline allegations with some 21 sub-allegations numbered 1(a)-(j), 2(a)-(h) and 3(a)-(c), which the father describes as being examples of &#8216;parental alienation&#8217;. At the commencement of the hearing, it was agreed that 2(h) would not be determined. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">Second, I make clear from the outset that I have endeavoured in this judgment to avoid use of the term &#8216;parental alienation&#8217; along with any notion that phrase may carry with it of a diagnosable syndrome. There has been a great deal of public discourse as to the appropriateness of the label &#8216;parental alienation&#8217;; in addition, some critics question whether or not the courts should even entertain such allegations, not least in cases where domestic abuse is alleged by  the other parent, what has been described by the President as a &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">complex and sensitive issue</span>&#8217;. That latter point has not been taken by any party in this case. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">I have of course had regard to the available authorities and, in particular, remind myself of the clear guidance given by the President in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (&#8216;Parental Alienation&#8217;: Instruction of Expert) </span>(&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>&#8221;)<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[2023] EWHC 345 at [103]. In cases of alleged alienation, the question of whether or not a child has been alienated from one carer by another is and remains a question of fact: has there been a process of manipulation of the child perpetrated by one carer against the other through what might be called &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">alienating behaviours</span>&#8217;. As the President concludes, </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.76in;text-indent:0in">&#8230; the identification of &#8216;alienating behaviour&#8217; should be the court&#8217;s focus, rather than any quest to determine whether the label &#8216;parental alienation&#8217; can be applied.  </p>

	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0in">Ultimately, I take the view that the father&#8217;s allegations as set out in his schedule are relevant and triable. To the extent that any label is necessary or appropriate, I consider that those allegations fall under the descriptor of alienating behaviours. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">Finally, I am not today making any decisions concerning the children&#8217;s welfare. That being said, I note at this stage with regret the delay experienced in these proceedings to date, not least because &#8211; having heard their oral evidence over two days &#8211; I have no doubt that both parents love the girls very much. While this hearing was initially intended to be a composite final hearing, at the pre-trial review I was informed that there had been a significant delay in final reports being provided. The view of all parties, in those circumstances, was that the two-day fixture should be retained for the purposes of the fact-finding element only. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">Both parents are of Nigerian heritage. The father moved to the United Kingdom in/around 2005 and the parents met here in/around 2007. They were married in Nigeria in 2008, with the mother moving to the UK to join the father in/around 2010. Both have extended family in Nigeria. There are two children of the marriage, KM and KR.

By the time of separation in October 2019, they were living in &#8216;B&#8217;. Since September 2020, the children have been attending Primary School; KM is due to start secondary school this coming September.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">A body of evidence is contained within the bundle concerning the historic involvement of children&#8217;s services. I note at this juncture that both parties have, at various stages, made allegations of domestic abuse against the other; while the court has determined on previous occasions that it is neither necessary nor proportionate to determine those cross-allegations at a fact-finding hearing, there seems little doubt from the documented history that this was a relationship marked at times by hostility and acrimony. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">The local authority first became involved with the family in 2016 following a referral made to them by the police. I have seen reference to the mother having made a complaint to the police that the father had struck her several times to the head in the presence of the children. The children were ultimately made subject to child protection plans between October 2016 and July 2017, at which point the parents confirmed their intention to remain a family and the case was closed to children&#8217;s services. The concerns at that time are recorded as centring on the parents&#8217; hostile relationship and possible issues of neglect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">Matters between the parents appear to have come to a head on 31 October 2019, when the father reported to the police that he had been the victim of an assault at the hands of the mother. Contained in bundle is the statement of the father filed in support of his application for <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> orders under the Family Law Act (&#8220;the FLA&#8221;) 1996, in which he details an allegation that the mother thrust a phone into his face causing bruising. In addition, he alleged that the mother had threatened to poison his food, had physically assaulted the children and that she had threatened to allege he had sexually abused the children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">The consequence of the father&#8217;s allegation was that the mother was duly arrested and held in police custody. On 1 November 2019, a Domestic Violence Protection Order was made against the mother for the duration of the month, which prohibited <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>her return to the family home. On 28 November 2019, the father obtained a non-molestation order without notice; he subsequently failed to attend the return hearing on 9 December 2019, which was heard by Her Honour Judge Brown. Ultimately, the non-molestation order was discharged on 20 December 2019, when the court accepted cross-undertakings from both parties. </p>

When the matter returned before Her Honour Judge Brown on 9 December 2019, proceedings under the Children Act 1989 were instigated of the court&#8217;s own volition and the matter listed for a first hearing dispute resolution appointment (&#8220;FHDRA&#8221;) on 23 January 2020. The father appears subsequently to have lodged a Form C100; by the time safeguarding checks were undertaken by Cafcass in March 2020, it seems that no contact was taking place with the father, who remained unaware of where the mother and the children were residing. </p>

By that hearing, the children&#8217;s time with the father had progressed to weekly overnight stays, from 10:00 on Saturday to 11:00 on Sunday. There is before me a note of the judgment given by the Recorder (although not a transcript) from which I glean the court made remarks to the effect that the situation had &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">developed with antipathy and suspicion over years</span>&#8217; and that contact had only &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">progressed by orders</span>&#8217;. I also note, however, that the parents were able to agree the principle of shared care (that is, a lives with/lives with order) but that they required the court&#8217;s assistance to determine the term-time arrangements. Where the father sought to maintain the weekly visits, the mother sought alternate weekends, from school collection on Friday to school drop off on Monday. Ultimately, the court preferred the mother&#8217;s proposal and a final order was made to that effect. </p>

He reported having received a message stating that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">[y]our punishment is waiting for you just remember this</span>&#8217; and informed the police he was in fear of his life. The police closed the case with no further action, concluding that the father &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">has not been truthful as to how these emails came about</span>&#8217;. In effect, it appears that a dispute had arisen between the parents over whether or not the children had sufficient school unform. </p>

It appears to be common ground that no face-to-face time took place between the children and the father for a period of some six weeks over the summer holidays. At a CiN meeting in July 2021, the father indicated that he had been evicted from his home and would not therefore &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">be able to spend time with KM and KR for a month</span>&#8217;.

The situation calls for judicial resolve because the line of least resistance is likely to be less stressful for the child and for the court in the short term. But it does not represent a solution to the problem. Inaction will probably reinforce the position of the stronger party at the expense of the weaker party and the bar will be raised for the next attempt at intervention. Above all, the obligation on the court is to keep the child&#8217;s medium to long term welfare at the forefront of its mind and wherever possible to uphold the child and parent&#8217;s right to respect for family life before it is breached. In making its overall welfare decision the court must therefore be alert to early signs of alienation. What will amount to effective action will be a matter of judgement, but it is emphatically not necessary to wait for serious, worse still irreparable, harm to be done before appropriate action is taken. It is easier to conclude that decisive action was needed after it has become too late to take it. </p>

There is no record <span style="font-style:italic">at all</span> of such an allegation being made or investigated in the manner alleged.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">What to make of all this? It is troubling that the father has continued to inform professionals that a formal complaint was made by the mother when no such complaint was ever made. Equally, he has continued to allege that the children were subjected to a medical examination when there is no evidence at all to support that assertion. While I accept that the mother raised the spectre of such an allegation in her text messages to the father in October 2019, that he would continue to misinterpret events so vehemently in February 2024 in an attempt to support his narrative of &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">parental alienation</span>&#8217; leads me to conclude that he is not always a reliable witness of fact. I must, therefore, approach his evidence with a degree of caution. </p>

What on Earth were the children to make of being told their mother was alleging sexual abuse? I do not accept that allegation 1(e) is made out; this is simply not an example of the mother exhibiting alienating behaviours. If anything, it illustrates how the father&#8217;s own actions have been liable to cause confusion and upset. </p>

By the end of her evidence, I formed the impression that she has found these proceedings draining and has to some extent checked-out of the litigation process: she informed me that she has elected not to read Dr A&#8217;s report, notwithstanding its detailed analysis of herself and the children, and the recommendations made that are designed to assist all parties. Likewise, she had not read the ICFA report. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">As for her credibility, there are aspects of the evidence that give pause for thought. I have had sight of historic documents from both the police and the Home Office in which concern is expressed as to the mother&#8217;s honesty. In 2008, for example, her application for a student visa was rejected on the basis that she had not been frank in her application; despite claiming it was her first application, the clearance officer discovered that the mother had made a previous failed application under a different passport. The officer concluded, &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I am satisfied that you have altered your identity in order to obtain a new passport in order to conceal the fact that you have been previously refused entry clearance</span>&#8217;. The father wishes me to place great weight on this document, which I note is now some sixteen years old, from a time when the mother was doing what she could to enter the UK. I do not consider this to be of any real assistance in considering the mother&#8217;s credibility in 2024. </p>

In several key regards, I also consider that the mother&#8217;s evidence has been inconsistent. For example, the account of the pillow incident in November 2022 differs between her written and oral accounts.

The mother alleges that the father was in Nigeria during this time. She points to a series of e-mails she sent to the father on 30 July, 20 August and 16 September in which she complains he had failed to attend contact (direct and via telephone) and that on one occasion this meant the children waiting for 30 minutes in the rain to see if the father would attend.

Quite why he could not maintain the telephone calls as a minimum is unclear and &#8211; to the extent that the father says he could not because of his financial and personal circumstances, or because he was otherwise blocked by the mother &#8211; he has failed to evidence the same. I find on balance that contact did not take place during this period for reasons that lie entirely at the father&#8217;s door and that, in his failure to maintain contact, he showed a lack of insight into the impact this would inevitably have on the children and their relationship with him.  </p>

That seems to me to show a certain lack of insight by the father into the needs of the girls at that time. Clearly, an event occurred that was significant enough for KM to have been upset and to have spoken to her mother about it; it may well be that her complaint was unjustified or exaggerated but the father&#8217;s labelling of his daughter as a &#8220;liar&#8221; was entirely unhelpful and shows a lack of empathy and ability to view events from his daughter&#8217;s perspective. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in">As for the mother&#8217;s approach, she appears to have leapt on these events as a reason to suspend the children&#8217;s time with the father. Neither child volunteered allegations to staff at the school on Monday and, on the mother&#8217;s own evidence, details were only obtained by her with some degree of questioning of the children. The trip to the GP identified no visible injuries while the mother&#8217;s call to the police logged later that evening indicates a significant degree of exaggeration if not fabrication on her part. The section 47 investigation concluded that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">incidents like this are ceased [sic] upon by parents to prolong their conflict</span>&#8217;. I agree and find, on a balance of probability, that the mother deliberately exaggerated and weaponised this event in order to frustrate the children seeing their father. To be clear, however, neither party covered themselves in glory: the father&#8217;s refusal to provide details to enable safeguarding checks on T is a case in point. </p>

The second session was less successful. This time, the children arrived late and made repeated comments about historic events; when support staff intervened, the girls claimed the father was only pretending to be nice.

The mother&#8217;s hostility and, at times, derision for the father and her inability to acknowledge that on some level he genuinely loves his daughters (see paragraph 67, above) are instructive. On balance and with regard to the entire canvas of the evidence before me, I find that the mother has failed to shield the children from her own negative views, both of the father and his new partner. Whether or not she has expressly informed the children that the father does not love them, I cannot say. I have no doubt, however, that the children are aware of the mother&#8217;s hostility towards the father and, to a large extent, appear to have sided with her. Equally, I am satisfied that the mother has done little to promote the children&#8217;s paternal identity and that she remains dismissive of their need for a relationship with the wider paternal family. </p>

His formatting is unhelpful, with different messages having been pasted onto the page so that there is no coherent run and messages appear out of order (e.g. 09:21 on 17 December, then 15:17 on 3 December followed by a message at 15:36 on 16 December etc.). What they do appear to show is that, on 3 December, the mother did not message the father until just after midday stating &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Children sick. They can&#8217;t come out</span>&#8217;. By that time, the father says he had already set off for the 12:30 collection time.

Third, it is alleged the mother blocked the father&#8217;s phone number on the children&#8217;s mobile phones and swapped the children&#8217;s SIM cards to frustrate calls.

This was subsequently reduced to once per week during the current proceedings. In support, he has provided telephone logs which, he says, demonstrates his point. I note that the log covers only the period 11 to 28 January 2023 inclusive, by which time calls were scheduled for Wednesdays at 19:00 pursuant to the order of 6 January 2023; on 13 January 2023, this was amended to Saturdays at 19:00. The log shows two attempts to call at 18:59 on Wednesday, 11 January which do not appear to have been successful. There were then attempts to call on Saturday, 14  and again on Saturday, 21 January. It is unclear whether or not a call was attempted on 28 January. I am concerned that the only phone logs provided are for such a short span of time, for which no explanation has been provided. </p>

There is also a recording on the order of 3 October 2022 which indicates the father was reporting his phone had been blocked. While the father also exhibits runs of messages showing texts he would send to the children if he had called and not received an answer, there are no years provided nor is it possible to get a coherent picture from the cherry-picked jumble. Ironically, the one reference to a phone number being blocked is when the father blocked the mother on 5 December (year unknown). </p>

The social worker at the time spoke to the mother by phone, who reported being in Slough at a health appointment and that she had taken the girls with her; the worker did not believe her, however, and said that the mother appeared to be at home.

His own comments to the children have at times been equally inappropriate and &#8211; in terms of the children&#8217;s reports of shouting &#8211; I have found this to be more likely a result of the children&#8217;s own experiences rather than any manipulation by the mother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in">In my view, the use of the word &#8216;alienation&#8217; in this case is deeply unhelpful. In the end, the father seeks to attribute blame to the mother for the children&#8217;s current reluctance to spend time with him, in circumstances where the picture is far more complex and nuanced. I remain concerned that both parties currently lack sufficient insight into the emotional needs of the children. In the context of the father&#8217;s allegations, this is especially so given that many of his assertions would appear to evidence his inability to accept that he too has had a role to play in the deterioration of his relationship with the girls. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in">At its core, this case has always been &#8211; and remains &#8211; one in which the ongoing risk to the children arises primarily from the parents&#8217; extreme acrimony. That has been the view of professionals now dating back over several years and is a consistent theme running throughout the local authority records. The section 47 report from December 2021 noted that the parents &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">continue to put their acrimony and their personal interest before the wellbeing of the children, which has always put them at risk of continuous emotional harm</span>&#8217;. That comment is as true today as it was then. </p>
