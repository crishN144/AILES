	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application before the court, dated 27 April 2023, concerns one child, who I shall refer to as &#8216;S&#8217;. She is the only child of the Applicant (&#8220;the mother&#8221;), and the First Respondent (&#8220;the father&#8221;).   She is 9 years old.  At the pre-hearing review, and with the agreement of both parents and the support of the Family Court Adviser, Ms Kay Demery, I joined S as a Second Respondent to the application.  All parties have been represented at this final hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the pre-hearing review, the mother &#8211; through leading and junior counsel &#8211; sought to vacate this final hearing in order for me to re-list the application for a 7-day hearing, so that the court could hear evidence about, and determine, a range of matters of fact.  The mother also argued, through counsel, that an adjournment was necessary in order for her more fully to prepare her case.  I refused both applications.  I determined the parameters of this hearing (declining to embark on an elaborate fact-finding exercise), and gave directions giving leave to the mother to file a further (second) statement within 7 days. I retained the original listing.  The mother failed to file the said statement.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 13 October 2023 (i.e., the last working day before the hearing), the mother&#8217;s solicitor filed a form C2, again seeking an adjournment of the hearing of her application, on the basis that the mother was too unwell to participate in it; a medical certificate accompanied the application.  For what it is worth, I should say here that the certificate did not impress me as adequately supporting the application.  On the same day, Mr Gration KC and Mr Langford filed a position statement arguing vigorously for an adjournment, in order for their client to be able to recover sufficiently from &#8216;acute&#8217; illness to participate in the proceedings.  That document (clearly prepared on instructions from the client) included the following:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was, to say the least, something of a surprise that as the case was called on for hearing on 16 October, the mother entered the courtroom in London in person, having flown from Japan on the previous day.  She attended the hearing throughout, paying full attention, making notes, conversing with her legal team through an interpreter, and displaying no apparent signs of illness.</p>

It will be apparent that the history gives rise to a number of potential safeguarding issues which are also discussed &#8211; at least in some respects &#8211; in the judgment which follows.  The consequence is that this is, I regret, a long judgment; there has been a great deal of factual and legal territory to cover.</p>

They separated in 2009, when the father first returned to the UK, but reconciled in 2012 when he was posted back to Tokyo.  It was within this second phase of their relationship that S was born in Japan in 2014.  It appears that both parents played a reasonably significant part in the upbringing of S, though the extent of their respective contributions is contentious, and I do not need to decide this. The evidence suggests that the parents visited the UK and USA regularly for holidays; the father says that they visited the UK at least every 2 years, for one or two weeks at a time. I am advised that the paternal family visited Japan, (the father&#8217;s mother on three occasions, and his brother on six).  In 2018, the parties had a marriage &#8216;celebration&#8217; and &#8216;ceremony&#8217; at a renowned hotel in England, but this was not a formal registered marriage, and they are not legally married.</p>

The parents separated finally in May 2019, when the father was relocated to the USA for work; he remained there for one year, before returning to the UK in 2020.  After the father&#8217;s departure for the USA, S remained with her mother.  At or about the time of the parents&#8217; separation in May 2019, the police were called to intervene in one of their disputes; the mother had sent WhatsApp messages to the father repeatedly telling him to take S, that she &#8220;hates&#8221; both of them and that she wanted both of them to &#8220;die in pain&#8221;.  She told social services (in Japan) that she had asked the father to take S, but then contacted the police complaining that the father was about to abduct S from Japan. The police visited the father; he denied an intention to abduct S but was reluctant to return S to the care of the mother given her erratic behaviour.  The father ultimately returned S to the mother but only because he needed to leave the country, and the police had advised him that they would otherwise have to place S into the care system. </p>

The father&#8217;s case is that he raced to her apartment and called the emergency services; the mother could not be taken to hospital as she had Covid.

The mother was abusive to the father; he was abusive to her in return. When told that S was enjoying life in England, the mother responded to him: &#8220;she changed like cold white people. I need to keep her in Asia&#8221;.  The father nonetheless confirmed (11 July) that he recognised that had the mother&#8217;s permission for S to be in the UK only until 26 August 2022, and repeated several times over the summer that the return flight was booked.</p>

This is inconsistent with the mother&#8217;s further case that she was unaware of the terms of the e-mail to the international school in Tokyo, as she had blocked the father&#8217;s e-mail account.  </p>

I consider below whether her alleged agreement was sufficiently clear and unequivocal as to amount to consent under the 1980 Hague Convention (see &#167;61 below).  There had, it seems, been a discussion at one time between the parents about S returning to Japan at the end of half-term (28 October 2022).

On the evidence which I have seen from the video-recordings, the mother has demonstrated at times an ungovernable temper, and loss of self-control, which she has unleashed on S in the past.  I reject completely her case that S was play-acting in the videos; the short videos contain extremely disturbing footage of child emotional harm, of a seriousness rarely seen in the Family Court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father argues that no protective measures can address the grave risks to S of physical or psychological harm to which I have just referred. He is concerned that pending any determination by a Japanese Court of any application for custodial rights, S would be placed in state care given that the mother is regularly out of the country in South Korea.  The Guardian argues that the situation in Japan would be &#8216;intolerable&#8217; for S and that the protective measures do not begin to address S&#8217;s needs.</p>
