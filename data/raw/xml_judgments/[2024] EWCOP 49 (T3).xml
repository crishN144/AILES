For the purposes of determining the application, I have heard the oral evidence of Mr. M, a consultant gynaecologist, Dr. Y, a psychiatrist who has known PG for over twelve years, and Dr I, her current treating psychiatrist.  I was due to hear briefly from Dr Ty Glover, instructed by the Official Solicitor, but in the event he was not required to attend for the purposes of cross-examination.</span></p>

During PG&#8217;s childhood, her mother was said to have been suffering from chronic alcohol dependence.  It is possible that PG was raped, or experienced a serious sexual assault, as a young person; she makes repeated reference to this and I comment on this again below. </span></p>

In the intervening years she has had multiple admissions to psychiatric hospitals under the Mental Health Act 1983 (&#8216;MHA 1983&#8217;), and has not enjoyed any extended periods of stability while living in the community.</span></p>

She has been subject to section 3 MHA 1983 since the end of 2022 and has been on section 17 MHA 1983 &#8216;leave of absence&#8217; since mid-June 2024; ideally, she would like to return to live at her previous flat which is in a different borough in South London.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Her psychotic illness is treatment-resistant, and she remains symptomatic despite general compliance with medication. She has suffered relentless mental health difficulties, and her day-to-day activity has been profoundly affected by her illness.  She suffers ongoing paranoid delusions, irritability and aggression; she is periodically fixated on her history of an alleged previous rape, to which I have already referred (</span>&#167;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">6 above).  It is not known whether this is an accurately remembered trauma, or a delusion.  She believes that that she has been controlled by a TV celebrity.  She suffers from occasional auditory hallucinations.  </span></p>

She has been in and out of hospital ever since, sometimes spending months on end on acute psychiatric wards.  She has limited insight into her mental illness and her care needs, and this has historically led her to engage in only a limited way with mental health services.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The professionals believe that if PG was indeed the subject of a serious sexual assault, and/or rape (as she describes), this may account at least in part for her firm resistance to even mildly invasive obstetric and gynaecological investigation.  PG believes that any kind of vaginal examination is associated with abuse, and has raised delusional beliefs that the clinicians who are concerned about her at present are trying to effect an abortion or to rape her.  She speaks of having had a child five years ago, although she has never been pregnant; this indeed is a delusional belief.</span></p>

She became resistant to taking her medication, and reduced her dosage against advice. She fell acutely ill in July 2022 and was admitted to hospital. While there, the possibility of supported accommodation was discussed with PG, but she declined it. She was discharged back to her flat in September 2022. Shortly after her discharge, she became unwell again and in December 2022 she was detained under Section 3 MHA 1983; she remains under this section to date.</span></p>

In June 2024 she was transferred to York House. The placement at York House has been successful to date; PG appears to have sufficient confidence in staff to talk to them. An interesting insight into her life was provided to the Court from a discussion between the Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative and the Operations Manager at York House:</span></p>

She is reported to be </span>capable of considerable aggression when roused in this regard, and while she is not physically abusive to others, she often slams doors, throws chairs, and &#8220;will rage&#8221; often &#8220;for hours&#8221;.

Stage 4 cancer is an advanced cancer, also known as metastatic cancer.

Nor would PG tolerate surgery; there is a very low expectation from the multi-disciplinary team that she could or would comply with post-operative wound care, with the insertion of a catheter for up to 6 weeks (per Mr N), and/or the maintenance of significantly higher levels of hygiene than PG currently achieves.</span></p>
