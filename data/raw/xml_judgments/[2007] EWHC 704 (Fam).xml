This stems, as I understand it, from the power that the court has under Schedule 1 of the Children Act.  It can make an order requiring a parent to make a payment to the other parent for the benefit of the child.  There is also power to make such an order to the child itself.

There should be a stay because of the arguments previously set out in relation to the position of a second court.  Furthermore the discretion is prescribed.  It is &#8220;to improve coordination of the exercise of judicial functions within the Community and to avoid conflicting and contradictory decisions&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221; (The Tatry (1994) 1-5439).</p>

It applies in even more debatable circumstances.  I consider this when analysing whether there was an agreement on jurisdiction.  Furthermore the issues in relation to financial support are plainly related.  Different questions arise in relation to some of the other claims.  The impact of Brussels II may well be relevant on this.</p>

It is either property to which either parent is entitled or which is specified in any order (Schedule 1 (2) (d)).  Under Article 22, the court of the member state where any property is situated has exclusive jurisdiction.  That arises where the proceedings have as their objects rights in rem in immovable property or tenancies of immovable property.</p>
