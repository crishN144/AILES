	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This is an application by East Lancashire NHS Trust for orders under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> that PW lacks capacity &#8220;to make a decision regarding whether to undergo the leg amputation surgery to address his high risk of sepsis&#8221;; and that it is lawful to carry out that surgery having regard to his best interests. Before dealing with the substantive issues in this case I will deal with the timing of the application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The application came before me on an extremely urgent basis on Wednesday 13th March 2019. The application was only lodged with the Court late on the 12th and I understand that the Official Solicitor was only sent the draft application at around 4pm on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>. I am in the circumstances most grateful for the assistance that I received from the Official Solicitor&#8217;s counsel, Mr Lawson and individual solicitor, Mr Beck. The application said that matter needed to be considered within one day and the witness statement of Dr L, and a letter from the Trust to the Court of Protection, said that the surgery was required within the next 48 hours. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">However, it was entirely apparent from the papers that the application had been in the course of preparation for at least a month, and that the clinical team at the treating hospital had been contemplating the need for the surgery for 9-12 months. I will explain the medical background below. Although the matter had become extremely urgent because PW&#8217;s foot had deteriorated when PW attended the Hospital on 12 March, this deterioration was entirely predictable and indeed had been why the application started to be prepared in mid-February. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In these circumstances this application could and should have been made some weeks ago, even if at that stage it was on a slightly more precautionary basis. The effect of the delay has been detrimental to PW&#8217;s interests and to a fair process which could fully take into account his wishes. The timing of the application has meant that the Official Solicitor had no time to visit PW and discuss the operation and his views with him; it has meant that there has been no time for the Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) to visit him before the hearing , the last visit was in July 2018; and the OS has had no time to instruct an independent doctor for another opinion if he had felt one was justified. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Although I spoke to PW over the phone, in order to try to understand his wishes and feelings, it would have been much better for the Court and PW if the OS had been able to visit him and prepare a report for the Court. The delay in making the application has therefore been contrary to PW&#8217;s interests. I should make clear that it has been possible to achieve a fair process here, not least because as I explain below it is my view that ultimately the decisions I have to make on the evidence are fairly clear-cut. However, this application should have been made weeks ago. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The background to this case is that PW is a 60-year-old man with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. PW has been living in a care home (described as a specialist psychiatric care facility) since at least 2016, initially subject to a Community Treatment Order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref> and now a standard authorisation. PW also has diabetes. In April 2016 he was admitted to hospital as an emergency with sepsis related to a severe diabetic foot infection to his left foot. He had an emergency amputation to part of the foot. It seems that he was considered to have capacity at this time, although that is not entirely clear from the papers. That operation led to the loss of all but one of the toes on his left foot, and the partial removal of his ankle joint. This operation was only partially successful in as much as the immediate risk to PW receded, but the left foot continued to be highly problematic. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In July 2018 PW&#8217;s clinical team considered four options &#8211; a below the knee amputation; a pin in PW&#8217;s leg to secure the ankle; a continuation of treatment solely through the use of antibiotics and no treatment. Dr L, the consultant physician, completed a mental capacity assessment stating that PW lacked capacity to make a decision regarding the proposal for an amputation. At that stage an IMCA was instructed and visited PW at the care home on four occasions. Her report is dated 25 July 2018. Unfortunately, for the reasons I have given above, her report is the most recent written evidence of PW&#8217;s wishes. What is set out in that record very much accords with what PW said over the phone to the Court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In his witness statement Dr L explains how PW&#8217;s foot had deteriorated since the best interests meeting in July 2018, the consideration in February 2019 and the options which had been considered. Since the operation in 2016, PW&#8217;s foot has been managed by having a below the knee cast. However, the ankle has become increasingly unstable and this has led to skin ulceration and initially superficial infection. In mid-February the ulceration spread to the weight bearing part of the foot. At this point there was a multidisciplinary discussion and options were again discussed with PW. The existing treatment was agreed by the clinicians to be failing and no longer to be sustainable. If the team simply waited for an emergency admission there was an increased risk that the subsequent operation would have to be more extensive and could involve removal of the leg above the knee, because infection could spread rapidly through the bone and up the leg. This operation would be significantly more disabling for PW because it would be much more difficult to learn to walk with a prosthetic leg above the knee joint. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There is also a risk that leaving the operation would allow infection to spread into the bloodstream with potential effects on other organs, and thus a material (though hard to quantify) risk that PW could die.  There was consideration of a different operation with the ankle being fixed with a pin. However, this option is very unlikely to stabilise the ankle, and would lead to further problems in the cast, which itself is extremely likely to create further infection. The pin itself was likely to lead to further infection. When Dr L gave oral evidence (on the phone), he was asked a number of questions about this option. It was apparent to me that it was not a realistic option to provide even a shortterm solution to the problems with PW&#8217;s left foot. The ankle would not be stable, and as such either catastrophic injury and/or further infection, would follow. All these options were discussed with PW and he continued to refuse to accept amputation. </p>

However, before the application was made PW was admitted to hospital as an emergency on 12 March at 12pm. There is now significant swelling and redness around the residual left ankle joint, and fluid is draining from the deeper tissues. Dr L said that this was consistent with deep infection possibly involving the bone. He is being treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics however the most recent culture from the wound indicates that the bacteria is showing some resistance to the first antibiotic used. This increases the risk of the infection spreading and antibiotics being less able of controlling the spread. </p>

He was articulate and appeared to understand the information he had been given, in as much as he could to some extent repeat it. However, he was adamant that he did not want an amputation. He repeated to the Court at least twice that he believed his GPs (at the X surgery) could treat the infection with antibiotics). He did not accept the possibility, indeed probability, that if he did not have the amputation the operation would become more serious and disabling.  </p>

The reason for this conclusion was that B&#8217;s religious beliefs were deeply meaningful to him, and that to force him to have the operation would be to take away his little independence and dignity to replace it with a future he had little appetite for [45]. B had said that he was not afraid of dying.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The first issue I need to address is whether PW has capacity to make the decision about treatment decisions regarding his foot. I have reached the view on the evidence that he does not. I rely upon the assessment of Dr M and Dr L, as well as hearing PW&#8217;s evidence to the Court. PW&#8217;s diagnosis is of paranoid schizophrenia with treatment resistant delusional beliefs. He also has a cognitive impairment which means that his ability to understand and weigh up information is reduced. According to Dr M he has no insight that his beliefs are false. In Dr M&#8217;s view PW is unable to understand the risks of not having the operation, despite having been given patient friendly information, and in particular he does not understand the danger to his life through sepsis. Dr M is also of the view that PW cannot use or weigh up the information as part of his decision making. Dr L&#8217;s evidence entirely accords with this.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I accept Dr M&#8217;s evidence. The evidence that PW gave over the phone entirely supported what Dr M said, that PW is delusional in his belief that his foot can be healed, and that he does not understand the risks in not having the operation. He has remained entirely fixed in this view over a prolonged period despite obvious deterioration in his foot. His references to the GP being able to heal his foot indicate a clear inability to process or comprehend the information he is being given and the universal medical advice he is receiving.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I turn then to PW&#8217;s best interests. The medical evidence is overwhelming, that if PW does not have the below the knee amputation now then certain consequences will follow. Either the infection will spread and he will need a much more debilitating operation and in a worst case scenario die from sepsis which spreads before it can be controlled; or in a best case there will be a brief improvement from the IV antibiotics but his foot will inevitably become infected again. </p>

Although investigating the option in questions to witnesses,  Mr Lawson did not seek to persuade me the alternative operation was in PW&#8217;s best interests, or was an appropriate alternative to the below the knee amputation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am very aware of the fact that PW is strongly opposed to having an amputation. This is based at least in part on having had the previous amputation and not wanting an operation. Those are perfectly understandable feelings that would be shared by many. However, the medical evidence shows that PW is either going to have to have an amputation, or the infection will spread and he will die (though in an uncertain time frame). In my view, following Peter Jackson J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">B,</span> it is appropriate to give weight to PW&#8217;s wishes and feelings, even though he does not have capacity, and given that those wishes are clearly expressed, strongly and consistently held, give them considerable weight. However, unlike B, PW does not want to die. He does not understand the choices he faces - he is labouring under a delusion that there is an alternative, namely IV antibiotics, which the medical evidence shows will not solve or materially alleviate the condition.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">PW is a 60 year old man, so significantly younger than Mr B, and who if he has the below the knee amputation has a good prospect of regaining mobility, and indeed be in better physical health than he has been in the recent past. I also do not think, though I cannot be totally confident on this, that PW&#8217;s opposition to the operation is as deep seated, or as fundamental to his dignity, as was Mr B&#8217;s. I am therefore hopeful that the impact of him having the operation, albeit against his wishes will not fundamentally undermine his dignity and his independence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">For these reasons I have reached the clear view that it is in PW&#8217;s best interests to have the operation. I also take into account the fact that there is a care plan in place to assist him, both before and after the operation, and that further work is to be done on the postoperative care plan. Having heard Dr L give evidence I have every confidence that PW will be given the best and most thoughtful care possible in coming to terms with the aftermath of the operation.  </p>
