	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Police began an extensive investigation, which is still ongoing, into the causes of those deaths.  The local authority started care proceedings in respect of the surviving younger sister of the boys, whom I shall refer to as A, now aged two.  The local authority contends that the threshold under section 31 of the Children Act for the making of care orders is crossed in this case and seeks findings, first, that the mother neglected her children and, secondly and more seriously, that she was responsible for the deaths of the two boys by asphyxiation.  The proceedings were transferred to the High Court and listed before me for a fact-finding hearing held in Portsmouth.  This judgment is delivered at the conclusion of that hearing. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother was born in 1985.  At an early age she was diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism, for which she has been prescribed medication throughout her life although, as she accepted in oral evidence, there have been periods in her adult life when she has failed to take her medication. In particular, her medical records suggest that she was not taking her medication during 2010, before and after the birth of A, and up to and including the date of J&#8217;s death.  Her GP commented to the police, via the paediatrician, Dr Trevelyan, that symptoms of missing the medication would include, inter alia, feeling tired, excessive sleepiness, depression, problems with memory and concentration, slow movements and weakness and weight gain. In her oral evidence, the mother said that she became depressed when she did not take her medication - &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do stuff and I just go on the computer.&#8221;  In addition, the mother has been diagnosed as suffering from a mild or borderline learning disability, with a full-scale IQ measured at 67 in 2000 and at 79 in May 2011 when she was seen by a psychologist at the outset of these proceedings.  Psychological testing indicated that she has difficulty with some, not all, areas of cognitive function.   She was able to give instructions to her legal representatives, but received extra support during the hearing, including the assistance of an intermediary when she was giving evidence, although in the event the intermediary was, so far I could see, not required to interpret any question or answer.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s parents separated when she was very young and from the age of two she was brought up by her mother, the maternal grandmother, hereinafter referred to as DA, and her stepfather.  She has a younger half-brother, L, who has a degree in nursing and is working in the north of England.  The mother experienced a number of problems in her childhood and her relationship with her mother, DA, was difficult. At the age of 14, she was placed in voluntary foster care and received extensive support from psychiatric and other healthcare professionals.  Her medical records include a number of references to drug overdoses and other episodes of self-harm, with some suggestions of fabricated medical conditions.  For the most part, however, these suggestions are not being relied on by the local authority in this case and I have expressly not been asked to consider the possibility that the deaths of the boys may be linked to any form of factitious illness syndrome.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In her teenage years, the mother had a number of sexual relationships and on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2006 gave birth to her first child, B.  B&#8217;s father has played no part in his life, nor in these proceedings.  Initially the mother and B were accommodated by a local project and in June 2007 they moved into local authority accommodation.  During the first year of B&#8217;s life, there were concerns about the mother&#8217;s capacity to care for him, including poor home conditions, inappropriate feeding and over-chastisement. In October 2007, the mother told social services that she felt unable to cope with the baby and took an overdose.  Following a hospital admission, she was diagnosed with postnatal depression.  At that point, B was placed with DA, with whom he lived for the rest of his life.  It was agreed that DA would apply for a residence order and it seems that an application was duly filed, although there is no record of any such order being made.  All parties, however, proceeded on the basis that DA had a residence order in respect of B.  She acted as his main carer and he formed a close and loving bond with his grandmother.  All the evidence suggests that he thrived in her care. For example, the manager of the nursery attended by B, told the police: &#8220;Emotionally, he was stable and happy.  I had no concerns about his home environment and he loved his nan, who appeared devoted to him.&#8221;  <marker name="tab"/>A contract of expectations was drawn up and signed, providing that the mother would not have unsupervised contact with B outside DA&#8217;s home.  On occasions, however, the mother took B to nursery where the manager observed that B was comfortable in her presence and she had no cause for concern.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In 2007, the mother had started a relationship with GM, a patient at the psychiatric unit to which she had been admitted following her overdose.  GM has a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia.  Subsequently he moved into her local authority accommodation and she became pregnant by him, giving birth to her second child, J, on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2008.  A further pregnancy was terminated in March 2009.  The relationship between the mother and GM was turbulent, with allegations of sexual assault against herself and J.  These allegations did not lead to any proceedings.  In February 2009, the mother and J moved to another flat without GM, although the relationship continued and he spent some time at her new flat.  Social services were significantly involved with the family after J&#8217;s birth and he was made the subject of a child protection plan in November 2009, on the grounds of neglect.  By that point the mother was pregnant again.  The child protection case conference minutes, produced in the course of this hearing, recorded concerns about safety issues in the home, ongoing problems between the mother and GM, and the fact that the mother, with her learning difficulties, struggled with aspects of daily parenting.  On the other hand, the minutes also spoke of &#8220;lots of positives,&#8221; including the fact that the mother had asked for help and engaged with the agencies.  The care plan included provision for daily support from adult services, arranged by the learning disabilities team, and child-minding was arranged for J.</p>

She too was made the subject of a child protection plan shortly after birth.  A parenting assessment carried out after A was born concluded that the mother did not have the capacity to care for the children through to adulthood without a high input from social services, both for the children and for herself.  In the first few weeks, A was admitted briefly to hospital on two occasions, once for vomiting and once following blood in her stool.  Concerns continued to be voiced about a range of matters, including the condition of the home, worsening relations between the mother and some professionals, missed appointments, difficulty managing J&#8217;s behaviour, problems caring for two children and concerns that A was failing to thrive.  <marker name="tab"/>A further contract of expectations was drawn up, setting out what was expected of the mother in order to avoid court proceedings.  This document provided, inter alia, that B&#8217;s visits to the home should be limited to twice a week, with no overnight stays.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother continued to receive daily support provided by an organisation called SCA. Her cooperation with the support workers from that organisation was erratic.  The worker with whom she had perhaps the best relationship was a woman called TW.  She gave evidence at the hearing and observed that the time allotted for her to help the mother was not enough. She added that the mother should have had further support for the children to assist her with parenting skills.  In cross-examination by Miss Pine-Coffin, junior counsel for the mother, however, TW said that J and A seemed happy and comfortable at home, that J was &#8220;always happy.&#8221;  The children were fed and well-dressed and that the mother cuddled the children and said that she loved them.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The social worker assigned to the family in July 2010, EA, who was not called to give oral evidence summarised the ongoing problems in a later police statement as being the mother&#8217;s poor parenting skills and unintentional neglect of the children.  However, during the autumn of 2010, EA noticed some change for the better, although she queried whether the improvement was sustainable.  According to the mother and DA, the restrictions on contact with B were relaxed and he was permitted to stay overnight. The local authority&#8217;s position at this hearing has been that no such relaxation was agreed, although the social workers were aware that B was in fact staying at the mother&#8217;s flat on occasions.</p>

Following her arrival at the emergency department, A vomited on two further occasions.  In her oral evidence, Dr Trevelyan, the paediatrician at the hospital, said that the description of A in the medical notes was of a child who was not well.  The doctor on duty records her impression as viral gastroenteritis and it was considered that the floppy episode may have been attributable to dehydration.  A was allowed home later that day.  </p>

There is evidence that on occasions the mother expressed frustration about the demands for caring for the children.  She was a regular user of text-messaging and the internet MSN message service and, when chatting to friends by these means, she would on occasions grumble about the children.  One example, on the evening prior to J&#8217;s death, contains the statement that she could have &#8220;fucking killed&#8221; B, because he had made J cry and been disobedient, and added an additional remark: &#8220;I wish I didn&#8217;t have fucking kids.&#8221; </p>

The mother said that she could not cope with the children anymore and she had packed their bags and wanted social services to take them away.  Before the social worker arrived, support worker TW called at the flat.  The mother told her about the argument with DA.  On arrival at the home, social worker EA found that the children were ready to leave, with coats on and bags packed, but after talking to the mother it became clear that she did not really want the children removed, but rather was angry and upset by what she alleged had been said by DA.  The social worker therefore left without the children.  It was agreed that J&#8217;s child-minding hours would be increased. On a further visit a few days later, the social worker noted that the mother was still struggling to cope with the two children.  At a meeting on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, the mother said that she was having problems dealing with J&#8217;s behaviour.  It was agreed that she would attend a parenting course in the New Year.  In the last few days of December, A became ill again and was seen on three occasions by the GP, who diagnosed bronchiolitis and prescribed a Ventolin inhaler.</p>

Later in the call she said that he had &#8220;turned really blue,&#8221; and further on she said: &#8220;He looks so lifeless. He&#8217;s tried to catch his breath.  He can't.&#8221;  When the first paramedic, SV, entered the room, his first reaction was that J had died, but on rubbing his chest, J opened his eyes and started to move.  At the time of the incident SV made no note about the mother&#8217;s behaviour on the form available for such observations, but in his police statement, notably given over six months later, he said that he thought the mother&#8217;s behaviour had been odd.  She did not come into the room when J was being treated and seemed to show a lack of urgency.  He observed however that she appeared to have some kind of learning disability.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">One matter which has featured prominently in this case is the presence and interpretation of a rash seen by some medical staff on J&#8217;s body. Cross-examined by Miss Judd QC on behalf of the mother, SV said that he would have looked for a rash and for petechiae but did not see any such signs.  On arrival at hospital, however, medical staff in the emergency department did observe a petechial rash over J&#8217;s upper chest.  The mother gave a consistent account of what had happened.  The doctor in the emergency department recorded his impression as to diagnosis as &#8220;febrile convulsion and, question mark, meningococcal meningitis.&#8221;  The senior paediatric registrar who examined J next noted that there were petechiae around his neck, increasing in number.  J&#8217;s temperature was slightly raised.  Her impression was &#8220;febrile convulsion, most likely secondary to upper respiratory tract infection, petechial spots noted, cannot exclude meningococcal sepsis.&#8221; On the following morning, the paediatric registrar, Dr Verling noted, &#8220;No evolution of petechial rash.&#8221;  Cross-examined by Miss Judd, Dr Verling said that there were only a few petechiae and added: &#8220;we see a lot of petechial rashes, especially in the context of children with a high temperature.&#8221;  He described J&#8217;s temperature on admission, 37.9 degrees Celsius, as on the cusp of a significant temperature.  In the notes, Dr Verling described J as &#8220;a well baby, running around ward.&#8221;  He was discharged home.  The note records: &#8220;Mum happy and medical team happy for J to go home.&#8221;  </p>

She agreed with Miss Judd  that staff on the paediatric ward were much more experienced in observing and documenting this sort of interaction, particularly taking the trouble to do so when a family was known to Social Services, so that a child protection pro forma had to be used.</p>

GW reported the mother as saying that J was making a funny noise.  In her oral evidence, GW described the mother as &#8220;flustered, not crying but panicking.&#8221;  Her statement continues: &#8220;We went into J&#8217;s bedroom.  J was lying on his back on his bed, with his eyes wide open, fixed on the ceiling.  He was making a little noise like he wanted to be sick. I put him on his side and he vomited a little bit.  I was calling his name and rubbing his back.  I would describe J as not responsive.  On seeing J, I immediately said to phone for an ambulance.&#8221;  Although GW was unable to recall who had made the call, the transcript shows that it was she who started the call and then handed the phone over to the mother.  In the course of the conversation, the mother said: &#8220;this has happened twice now and I&#8217;m getting a bit scared of it, 'cause one day I may not wake, you know, I might wake up and find him not alive.&#8221; </p>

In his police statement, given 15 weeks later, DF described J as &#8220;breathing but basically unconscious; his eyes were not open.  He was not talking, but his limbs were moving.&#8221;  DF concluded that he was post-ictal<span style="font-style:italic;color:#FF0000"/>that is to say recovering from a seizure in which there had been a lack of oxygen.  Cross-examined by Miss Judd, he said that he had no concern about the mother&#8217;s behaviour on this occasion. Had he had any such concern, he would have recorded it.  He did note that the mother had stayed initially outside the room.  He accepted in oral evidence that the flat was small and there was not a lot of room in J&#8217;s bedroom with three or four people in it.  The paramedic noted no obvious rash on his body, but on arrival at hospital the mother told medical staff that a rash had appeared on his back during the day. Further examination revealed that J was suffering from chicken pox and he was discharged home. In a note to social services, the hospital commented: &#8220;no concerns with this presentation to the emergency department.&#8221;</p>

The autopsy showed J was a well-nourished boy with no evidence of injury and no internal structural defects.  Biological tests show the evidence of chicken pox with varicella zoster viral DNA present in J&#8217;s nose, throat, lungs, blood and cerebrospinal fluid.  There was patchy but widespread active inflammation of the lungs, with neutrophils seen in all the lung lobes sampled.  Dr Fowler commented that there are a few case reports of sudden death in children with varicella pneumonia, but J did not have the severe pathology seen in such cases and appeared to have recovered from the acute phase of the illness.  He concluded:</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;The question is whether J died as a result of complications of varicella infection or whether varicella infection contributed to his death or whether there were other factors involved.  For example, I have been asked by the police to consider the possibility that J may have been smothered with some soft material such as bedding or pillow.  I cannot exclude this, but there were no pathological findings to provide confirmation.  Although J had chicken pox/varicella viral infection, both clinical and laboratory data confirm this, I am not able to give this as the cause of death with certainty and not to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt.

DA had complained again about the state of the mother&#8217;s bedroom.  According to TW, the mother said that she hated living there and could not wait to get out of there.  They stopped at B &amp; Q, where the mother picked up some wallpaper samples and paint charts.  TW told the police that the mother was in a good mood and was talking about decorating a room for A, like a princess&#8217; room, if she was rehoused.  They then returned to DA&#8217;s house. On arrival, DA said to the mother, &#8220;You&#8217;d better get up to that room and tidy it now.&#8221;  An argument ensued in the course of which, according to TW, the mother said to DA, &#8220;I hate you, I wish you were dead.&#8221;  TW had not heard the mother say this to DA before, but she told Miss Pine-Coffin in cross-examination that it did not concern her.  It was like her arguments with her own mother.  TW stated that B came downstairs during the argument.  According to DA, the argument continued after TW left.  The mother shouted: &#8220;I&#8217;m going back to my flat.&#8221;  DA replied: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid.&#8221;  DA said they both then calmed down and she asked the mother: &#8220;is<span style="font-style:italic"/>it because Mother&#8217;s Day is coming up?&#8221; The mother replied: &#8220;yes.&#8221;  After that, the mother went upstairs to tidy the room.</p>

In her statement she said that she left about 19.15, but it must have been earlier, as she was seen on CCTV entering the local supermarket at 18.53.  She left that shop at just after 7 o'clock and went to the mother&#8217;s flat. The mother and B remained at DA&#8217;s home.  Subsequent analysis of the mother&#8217;s computer showed that she started to use the internet at 18.59.  She logged onto a gambling site at 19.05 and purchased four online bingo tickets, at 19.07, 19.15, 19.22 and 19.28.  At 19.26 the mother texted SB and asked: &#8220;Are you coming on the comp?&#8221;  By this she was enquiring whether SB was going to chat over the internet via the MSN site. SB replied by text &#8220;later maybe, why hon?&#8221;  At 19.28 the mother replied: &#8220;just asking.&#8221;  At 19.33, DA&#8217;s sister telephoned the landline at DA&#8217;s home but the call is timed as having lasted only one second.  At the same time, the mother logged out of the online website.</p>

She says that she took him inside and put him back to bed.  She put a DVD on in his bedroom and sat with him for a few minutes until he was nearly asleep. A group of local boys told the police that they saw B on the front doorstep and the mother putting him indoors and shouting and telling him off.  There is some inconsistency between the boys&#8217; accounts to the police as to the timing of this incident.  None of the boys was called to give evidence before me.</p>

The phone was answered by SB&#8217;s mother&#8217;s partner, MP.  There is some disagreement about the timing of this call.  MP  put it at 19.30, because he recalls &#8220;Emmerdale&#8221; finishing and &#8220;Coronation Street&#8221; starting.  His partner, EH, SB&#8217;s mother, stated that the call came while she was on the balcony smoking a cigarette after the conclusion of &#8220;Coronation Street&#8221; and before the start of &#8220;East Enders&#8221; at 20.00 hours, and lasted about 20 minutes.  According to the phone records, however, the call lasted about five minutes and started at 20.16.  I conclude that both MP and EH are simply wrong about the time of the call.  MP states that after some friendly banter, the mother said she thought B &#8220;has shit,&#8221; to which he replied that she had better check it was not running down his leg.  The mother&#8217;s account is that she &#8220;smelt poo,&#8221; went upstairs whilst still on the phone to MP, checked A first and then went into B&#8217;s room where she found him in a collapsed state.  </p>

When TR answered the door, the mother told her that B was not moving.  TR described the mother as hysterical and frightened.  She grabbed the mother&#8217;s hand and they ran back to DA&#8217;s house, closely followed by MM.  When TR entered B&#8217;s bedroom, she saw B on the bed with the quilt pulled back and his head on the pillow.  The wooden frame of the bed is constructed to resemble a car.  The mattress is a few inches below the top of the frame.  TR described B as lying on his back with his head back and his eyes and mouth half-open.  He was blue in colour.  Both TR and MM rang 999 and transcripts of their respective calls, each timed at 20.23, were produced in these proceedings.  In both calls, TR is heard telling the mother, &#8220;Get away, get away.&#8221;  MM entered the bedroom and started resuscitation, under instruction from the ambulance controller, lifting B from the bed and putting him on the floor. He carried out both mouth to mouth and cardiac pulmonary resuscitation.  In oral evidence he described B as cold when he touched him.  </p>

The mother was screaming hysterically.  AT entered the other bedroom and found MM doing chest compressions on B.  It was obvious to AT that the boy was not breathing.  He attempted to get B&#8217;s heart started with a defibrillator and attached a breathing mask to B&#8217;s face, all without success.  In a statement signed two days later, AT referred to the photographs taken of B some hours later, showing a petechial rash and said that he had no recollection of seeing this rash when he was treating B.  In cross-examination by Miss Judd, he said: &#8220;we would be observant for marks but I didn&#8217;t see any.&#8221;  In his police statement he said that a mark on B&#8217;s chest in the same set of photographs was consistent with where the defibrillator pads had been placed, although he could not say for certain that the pad caused this mark.</p>

His mother, grandmother and a number of friends and neighbours gathered at the hospital.  The consultant in emergency care, Dr Beardsall who did not give oral evidence, told the police that B was noted as a well-looking boy, who looked like he was sleeping rather than suffering a life-threatening event.  Dr Beardsall added that a brief inspection of B&#8217;s body whilst resuscitation was going on did not reveal any signs of trauma to explain his condition.  He told the police that in his experience, which included over ten years in emergency medicine, he had never seen a child in cardiac arrest where the precipitant was not obvious, be it trauma or illness.</p>

Both gave oral evidence and described the treatment given to B that evening. After intubation, B&#8217;s heart resumed beating after about 20 minutes in hospital, but it fluctuated for a further 15 minutes before it subsided and resuscitation was stopped.  Thus, B received a total of resuscitation from MM, the paramedics and the hospital staff in excess of 30 minutes before any heartbeat was restored and at least 45 minutes in total.  I was told that this is at the outer limit of attempts one would have made to resuscitate a patient.  Dr <span style="color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF">Erlewyn-Lajeunesse made a note retrospectively at 20.30 in which he said, inter alia: &#8220;no abnormal bruises or injuries (back not yet inspected.)&#8221;  Cross-examined by Miss Judd, he initially said that had there been any petechiae he would have noticed them.  He added that he was not clear about how much access he had had to B&#8217;s face; the focus had been on saving B&#8217;s life and he could not say that petechiae were not there.  However, in answer to further questions from Miss Judd, he described as examination as &#8220;more than a once-over,&#8221; that he was suspicious and therefore looking for marks and that one of the things he would have been looking for was petechiae.  He also said from his experience that after a prolonged period of resuscitation, these sorts of petechiae would not have been unusual.</span></p>

The timing of this drawing is unclear from the documents but in oral evidence it became apparent that Dr Macintosh had completed it around midnight.  Apart from the body-map, there was no note taken of Dr Macintosh&#8217;s examination.  The document also contained a history, described as being from the mother and DA and friends.  In oral evidence, Dr Macintosh described how a crowd of about nine or ten people had participated in this discussion. Several people took part in giving the history and it had been difficult to pin things down.  The mother did not say a lot and seemed quite withdrawn, and Dr Macintosh had to put questions to her several times to get an answer.  When he asked questions, other people would chip in.  DA, who was understandably devastated, was the most vocal.  Often there would be a discussion between more and more people, as they tried to establish what had happened, and then Dr Macintosh would ask the mother to confirm the account. The note records that the mother had put B back to bed sometime between 19.30 and 20.30 and went in to check him about ten minutes after he had been put to bed and found him blue, his eyes open and there was no response.  Dr Macintosh was unable to recall, in answer to Miss Davis, senior counsel for the local authority, whether the comment that she had gone in after ten minutes had come from the mother or from others.  The order of events had been clear, but not the timing.</span></p>

He noticed some scattered petechiae around the left side of the face, but in his post-mortem report stated that there was &#8220;none on the right side or in either eye.&#8221;  In his external examination, Dr White found a focus of bruising, one centimetre in diameter, noting the scalp tissues beneath each of the external bruises.  So far as the respiratory system was concerned, there was some brownish mucus at the junction of the lower end of the trachea and the right main bronchus, but the larger airways otherwise appeared normal.   A section through each lung revealed a heavily congested parenchyma.  Histological examination of the lungs found that they were congested with focal areas of intra-alveolar haemorrhage with very occasional haemosiderin deposits noted in one section.  The lungs showed patchy, acute bronchopneumonia, but not at the level suggested that would account for death.  In addition, there were two small fibrin thrombi.  Dr White concluded that these signs were consistent with the ventilation that had taken place over a number of days.  The microscopic presence of a virus observed in a section of one of them was thought to be indicative of past infection.  </span></p>

During B&#8217;s stay in the Intensive Care Unit, ECG examinations showed prolonged QT intervals.  The cardiologist advised that it was strongly believed that prolongation of the QT interval was secondary to neurological status post cardiac injury.  Molecular genetic analysis had failed to detect any pathogenic variant of Long QT Syndrome in B, which significantly reduced the chance that the symptoms were attributable to mutation in those genes.  That comment has to be considered in the light of subsequent genetic analysis, to which I shall return below. Cardiac post-mortem examination by Dr Ashworth, consultant paediatric pathologist, confirmed that B&#8217;s heart was structurally normal.  There was some haemorrhagic necrosis of the apex intra-ventricular septum and the papillary muscles of the mitral valve.  These changes were considered to be secondary to the collapse.  There was no histological evidence of myocarditis.  </span></p>

At the outset of the hearing, I was asked by the police to permit an officer to sit through the expert evidence.  I concluded that it would not be appropriate.  These are private proceedings and it is generally inappropriate for persons who are not parties to sit in, save where permitted by statute. I have directed, however, that the police should be supplied with the full notes of the expert evidence taken by junior counsel for the local authority and for the mother, and I shall permit disclosure of the transcript of this judgment.

In that case a mother had been convicted of the murder of her two children who had simply stopped breathing. The mother&#8217;s two other children had experienced apparent life-threatening events taking a similar form.  The Court of Appeal Criminal Division quashed the convictions.  There was no evidence other than repeated incidents of breathing having ceased.  There was serious disagreement between experts as to the cause of death.  There was fresh evidence as to hereditary factors pointing to a possible genetic cause.  In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal held that it could not be said that a natural cause could be excluded as a reasonable possible explanation.  </span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.02in">It would probably be helpful at the outset to encapsulate different possible approaches to cases where three infant deaths have occurred in the same family, each apparently unexplained and for each of which there is no evidence extraneous to the expert evidence that harm was or must have been inflicted, for example, indications of or admissions of violence or a pattern of ill-treatment.  Nowadays such events in the same family are rare, very rare.  One approach is to examine each death to see whether it is possible to identify one or other of the known natural causes of infant death.  If this cannot be done, the rarity of such incidents in the same family is thought to raise a very powerful inference that the deaths must have resulted from deliberate harm.  The alternative approach is to start with the same fact, that three unexplained deaths in the same family are indeed rare, but thereafter to proceed on the basis that if there is nothing to explain them, in our current state of knowledge at any rate, they remain unexplained and still, despite the known fact that some parents do smother their infant children, possible natural deaths.</p>

The first approach is, putting it colloquially, that <marker name="tab"/>lightning does not strike three times in the same place.  If so, the route to a finding of guilt is wide open.  Almost any other piece of evidence can <marker name="tab"/>reasonably be interpreted to fit this conclusion. For example, if a mother who <marker name="tab"/>has lost three babies behaved or responded oddly or strangely or not in <marker name="tab"/>accordance with some theoretically &#8220;normal&#8221; way of behaving when faced with <marker name="tab"/>such a disaster, her behaviour might be thought to confirm the conclusion that lightning could not indeed have struck three times.

Whether there are one, two or even three deaths, the exclusion of currently known natural causes of <span style="color:#000000">infant death does not establish that the death or deaths resulted from the deliberate infliction of harm. That represents not only the legal principle, which must be applied in any event, but, in addition, as we shall see, at the very least, it appears to us to coincide with the views of a reputable body of expert medical opinion</span>.&#8221;</p>

If we have derived an overwhelming and abiding impression from studying this material, it is that a great deal about death in infancy, and its causes, remains as yet unknown and undiscovered. That impression is confirmed by counsel on both sides. Much work by dedicated men and women is devoted to this problem. No doubt one urgent objective is to reduce to an irreducible minimum the tragic waste of life and consequent life-scarring grief suffered by parents. In the process however much will also be learned about those deaths which are not natural, and are indeed the consequence of harmful parental activity. We cannot avoid the thought that some of the honest views expressed with reasonable confidence in the present case (on both sides of the argument) will have to be revised in years to come, when the fruits of continuing medical research, both here and internationally, become available. What may be unexplained today may be perfectly well understood tomorrow. Until then, any tendency to dogmatise should be met with an answering challenge.&#8221;</span></p>

Thus all the chemical markers for infection were normal in B&#8217;s case. Dr Cartlidge was unable to exclude the possibility that B had a minor infection at the time of his death, although the medical evidence indicated the absence of any serious infection.

He reported that metabolic disorders, sufficiently severe to cause some unexpected deaths, do not manifest without prior illness.  It would, said Professor Leonard, be most unusual to have two patients with the same metabolic disorder in the same family die without obvious symptoms.  He noted that the mother&#8217;s general health is fine except for congenital hypothyroidism.  Professor Leonard advised that a link has been established between sudden deaths and congenital hypothyroidism.  In this case, however, the three children had all been screened for this disorder at birth and those tests revealed that they did not suffer from this condition. As the mother is otherwise healthy, Professor Leonard considered it unlikely that two of her children would suffer a dominant metabolic disorder.

He advised that cardiac causes of death can be divided into three groups: (1) underlying structural heart disease, (2) inflammatory or genetically-determined disorders affecting the heart muscles such as myocarditis or cardiomyopathy and (3) heart rhythm disorders, in particular what are termed channelopathies &#8211; inherited conditions that render the individual susceptible to fatal ventricular rhythm disturbance. Channelopathies include a group of conditions called Long QT Syndrome, (hereafter &#8220;LQTS&#8221;), and a rare group of conditions called</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF"/><span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal;color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF">Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia</span><span style="color:#1D2D45;background-color:#FFFFFF">, (&#8220;CPVT&#8221;).  In this case, post-mortem examination of J and B excluded the presence of underlying structural heart disease and myocardial histology did not show any evidence of heart muscle inflammation or cardiomyopathy.  With both children, therefore, this only leaves the channelopathies as a potential cardiac cause for their deaths.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#1D2D45;background-color:#FFFFFF">Dr Martin gave some background information about channelopathies. LQTS and CPVT are conditions related to mutations of genes that control the passage of ions across the membranes of the heart muscle cells.  The largest study so far would predict that 5 to 10 per cent of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome cases have an alteration of one of the LQTS genes that may either result in death due to ventricular arrhythmias, or may represent a predisposing factor that may be lethal in combination with other risk factors, such as hypoxia or overheating.  Dr Martin reminded the court that neither J nor B was an infant, but sudden death from LQTS and CPVT can also occur in older children.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#1D2D45;background-color:#FFFFFF">As Dr Martin explained during his oral evidence, in cardiac arrest there are two main rhythm changes.  In the first, called asystole, there is no electrical activity; the pumping action of the heart stops and the ECG shows a flat-line.  In the second, the heart goes into a disorganised rhythm, known as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.  The heart becomes uncoordinated and does not work as a pump.  Each portion of the heart is trying to contract at different times, so it stops pumping blood.  Most heart conditions, including LQTS, would normally present with disorganised rhythm associated with heart muscle problems.  Asystole is an arrest of rhythm commonly recognised in other causes, rather than in LQTS, and is much more likely to be due to respiratory cause or hypoxia. Dr Martin agreed with Miss Judd, however, that a cardiac arrest, unless treated, &#8220;all ends up in asystole.&#8221;  In such circumstances, he agreed that one may not know if someone who presented with a heart that had stopped beating altogether had experienced an arrest which started with a disorganised rhythm.</span></p>

A long QT interval is thus a pointer to LQTS, but not diagnostic of it.  The diagnosis of LQTS is dependent on a number of factors: (1) the ECG findings, (2) the history of circumstances of the death and/or previous history of any unexplained blackouts or faints, (3) family history and (4) DNA analysis.  Dr. Martin stated that excluding a cardiac cause of sudden unexplained death can be difficult and the likelihood of a channelopathy being the cause of death would be estimated from careful review of the four areas cited above, coupled with an assessment of the alternative causes. Often, a diagnosis of LQTS can be made on the basis of the ECG findings alone, but death is the first sign of LQTS in an estimated 10 to 15 per cent of cases and where an ECG has not been obtained prior to death, a diagnosis has to be based on other findings, including genetic findings, if available.  The circumstances of the death may also be important.  Dr Martin observed that death during sleep has been recognised as occurring with some types of LQTS. He also stated, with regard to the ECG findings, it is important to realise that at least 10 to 15 per cent of people with LQTS may have a normal ECG. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">Prior to the development of genetic testing, various diagnostic criteria for LQTS were developed, one of which was helpfully set out by Dr Martin in a table in his report.  Measurement of the QT interval on the ECG is a crucial part of these diagnostic criteria.  This interval is typically measured in leads 1 and B6 and then corrected for heart rate using a formula known as Bazett&#8217;s formula.  The interval is the time measured from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave on the ECG and can be expressed in seconds or milliseconds.  Relevant normal values after correction for the interval are as follows: for children and adolescents, over 460 milliseconds equals a prolonged QT interval; 440 to 460 equals borderline prolongation.  For women, in excess of 460 milliseconds equals a prolonged QT interval and between 450 and 460 milliseconds equals a borderline interval. Dr Martin explained that the criteria are applied by allocating a particular score to certain factors, thus a corrected QT in excess of 480 milliseconds in children scores three points, a corrected QT of between 460 and 469 scores two points, etcetera. Where family history definitively identifies a member of the family as having LQTS, a score of one point is added.  Where a member of the immediate family had died under the age of 30 from an unexplained sudden cardiac death, a score of 0.5 is added.  There are a number of other factors for which scores are added, but none are relevant to this case.  A strict application of these criteria leads to a diagnosis of LQTS if there is a score of more than three.  Dr Martin stated that whilst it is not a precise diagnostic tool, a patient who scores over three is usually made the subject of a diagnosis.  However, Dr Martin stressed that this is not a firm rule and it is necessary to consider the whole clinical picture.</span></p>

In the opinion of the treating physicians at the time, the QT prolongation, consistent with the CT changes, were thought to be likely to be attributable to ischemia from the cardiac arrest and the severe neurological injury that was sustained. Dr Martin commented that it is indeed recognised that hypoxia and ischemia can cause all these ECG findings and in particular that neurological injury can cause QT prolongation.  Thus, on the balance of probabilities, Dr Martin concluded that the ECG changes in B are &#8220;most likely to be secondary to the cardiac arrest and the severe neurological injury.&#8221;  </span></p>

J suffered from a chicken pox infection at the time of his death and Dr Martin remarks that fever can sometimes be associated with sudden death in individuals with LQTS. He noted that they were both found collapsed during sleep.  Death during sleep has been described sometimes as occurring in cases of LQTS, although Dr. Martin said that it is rare to find children dying at this age. He observed that both cardiac arrests were asystolic arrests, that is to say the heart stopped beating completely; as stated above, in channelopathy the cardiac arrest is usually associated with the irregular rhythm disturbances &#8211; ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. As mentioned above, however, Dr Martin agreed with Miss Judd that every cardiac arrest, unless treated, ends up in asystole, and he agreed that one may not know whether someone who presents with a heart that has stopped beating altogether had experienced an arrest which started with a disorganised rhythm.  He agreed that it was not possible to say how the cardiac problems in J or B had started.  It depended on how long the effective pumping of the heart stopped.  The longer you go from effective beating, the more likely it was to end up in a flat-line.  In J&#8217;s case, he had apparently been dead for some time before the paramedics arrived.  Thus it was possible that the asystole had been preceded by a spell of irregular rhythm disturbances. In B&#8217;s case, on the other hand, this seemed less likely, given that it was possible for his heart to be revived.  He accepted, however, that it was not known how long B&#8217;s heart had stopped beating and it was conceivable that he could have had a cardiac condition 30 minutes before he was discovered by the first responder.</span></p>

He added that &#8220;whilst the ECG findings seen in the report are in the normal population and are certainly not diagnostic of LQTS, it is not possible to exclude the diagnosis.&#8221;  Overall, however, he concluded that there was no clear evidence of heart disease in the immediate family. He was asked about the medical histories of some distant relations of the mother. Her great-grandfather is said to have died of a heart attack at the age of 30. On her father&#8217;s side, there was a cot death of a cousin.  Dr Martin observed that he suspected that if one looks at most families, one would find family members this removed where this sort of incident had occurred.  Whilst one can never rule out the possibility that these events might have some bearing on the diagnosis of the boys&#8217; condition, Dr. Martin commented that &#8220;the further you get away from the individual, the less likely it is to be relevant.&#8221;</span></p>

In answer to Miss Judd, Dr. Martin acknowledged that, when analysing the family history, it had to be remembered that, at any one point, one might have a gene mutation but no symptoms. Furthermore, it was possible that symptoms might be expressed later in childhood or in adulthood.  It was possible, furthermore, for the presentation of symptoms to skip a generation and it was possible that one might not see symptoms in more than one generation, notwithstanding that all have the gene.  Thus before reaching any conclusion on whether the children suffered from a heart abnormality, I turn to consider the evidence of the expert geneticist.</span></p>

The carrier parents have no symptoms, because their normal allele is sufficient for normal biochemical activity.  This mode of inheritance is the most common.

It is still increasing and there is still much to be learned. In cross-examination by Miss Davis, Dr Newbury-Ecob observed that genetic analysis was an art rather than a science. It is, she said, a common misconception about genetics that it is black and white. On the contrary it is very much an art based on the assessment of a number of different factors.  The process of making a diagnosis of a genetic condition involves a number of factors, both clinical and molecular. The absence of information from a genetic testing does not exclude a genetic condition.  With the advent of genetic testing, possibilities for diagnoses increase and the number of undiagnosed patients is going down, although as Dr Newbury-Ecob observed in cross-examination by Miss Judd, there are still a number of genetic conditions that doctors are not yet able to diagnose. As yet, however, genetic testing is not sufficiently reliable to establish conclusively that a genetic condition has been excluded.  Furthermore, and of relevance to this case, there is a paucity of information about LQTS in children of this age. In answer to a question from Miss Judd, Dr Newbury-Ecob accepted that very few children were tested genetically at this age, because this is not the age at which death from LQTS normally occurs. </span></p>

There are a wide number of possible variants in a gene at any given point on the gene.  To date, twelve different genes have been identified as positively affected in LQTS. In answer to Miss Judd, Dr Newbury-Ecob said that ten years ago there were about four genes that had been so identified, but more had been discovered and it is likely that there are more, as yet unidentified.  Of the twelve that have been identified to date, five are the most common and responsible, it is believed, for 95 per cent of the cases of LQTS.  One of these genes is known as KCNH2.  In her report, Dr Newbury-Ecob observed that post-mortem molecular analysis in cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome had detected mutations or variants in long QT terms in 8 to 12 per cent of cases.  In particular, the KCNH2 gene variants have been identified in patients in cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.  In such cases the variant leads to heart arrhythmias, triggered, dependent on the gene and variant involved, by a number of factors, such as arousal, noise, emotion, exercise or sleep.  </span></p>

Not all variants have significant functional consequences. The laboratory can now look at the type of sequence change and predict how likely it is to affect the way in which the gene works.  Geneticists use the term &#8220;pathogenic&#8221;, for a variant that will clearly affect function, and &#8220;non-pathogenic where the relationship is not established&#8221;. In the case of a pathogenic mutation, the abnormal gene product affects the normal potassium channel delaying repolarisation of the heart ventricle and leading to the changes in the QT intervals seen on the ECG.   Identifying a variant does not by itself lead to a conclusive diagnosis of LQTS. Dr Newbury-Ecob said that in order to establish the genetic cause of LQTS in any particular case, it is necessary to identify first if there is a variant of any of the genes associated with LQTS and secondly, whether that variant is pathogenic, i.e. a cause of LQTS. Establishing pathogenicity of a variant or mutation includes wider family studies. If a mutation is said to be segregating with a disease phenotype or history of sudden death, it is considered to be more likely to be pathogenic than if it was found in unaffected family members. Dr Newbury-Ecob emphasised that LQTS is principally a clinical diagnosis.  If the clinical signs are borderline, one attaches no significance to the presence of a variant.  If the clinical signs are strong, the presence of a pathogenic variant does not add to the strength of diagnosis.  The purpose of the testing is not to confirm the diagnosis, but to provide screening for other family members. Dr Newbury-Ecob said that it was difficult to say if this approach led to families with LQTS being missed.  In order to answer that question, families would have to be followed over a very long time.  Families can be evaluated now, but it may be that the significance of those observations will only become apparent in 20 years.  &#8220;We do not have robust, long-term, case-controlled studies of these variants.&#8221;  </span></p>

Four of the genes were entirely normal, but analysis of the KCNH2 gene showed a variant and furthermore a new variant which had never been seen before.  Dr Newbury-Ecob observed, however, that a variant in the KCNH2 gene is a relatively common finding.  In answer to Miss Davis, she said that about 4 per cent of the population showed some kind of a variant, although it is unknown how many of those are pathogenic.  The KCNH2 gene consists of 16 exons spanning 19 kilobases that is to say 19,000 letters of genetic code.

To establish pathogenicity, the laboratory looks, first, to see whether the variant has been described previously in patients with a genetic condition, secondly, how the type of variant is predicted to work, and, thirdly, the location of the variant in relation to the gene function.. Databases have been established around the world which laboratories can examine to assist with this analysis.

If a variant changes the type of amino-acid, it is more likely to be predicted as functionally significant and therefore pathogenic, but the position in this case of the amino-acid sequence change was in the region of the gene with a lower likelihood of being associated with pathogenicity.  In addition, Dr Newbury-Ecob said that it is in the regions of genes that are &#8220;highly conserved,&#8221; that is to say have been present throughout evolution, with which more critical functions and changes tend to be associated.  Variants that occur in these conserved regions are more likely to be worrying and pathogenic.  The gene in question here does not come in a conserved region.  There is therefore no reason to think that this variant would cause LQTS by itself.</span></p>

The laboratory was only required to ascertain whether he had the same variant in the KCNH2 gene identified as in B.  It was found that he did not have this variant.  This process was possible using DNA protracted from tissue post-mortem. Whilst this is not as useful as testing on fresh blood samples, in this case there was no reason to have any doubt as to the quality of the DNA obtained from J&#8217;s tissue. It is relatively straightforward to look for a known change in the family by examining a post-mortem tissue, but very much harder to embark on a full genetic screen if only post-mortem tissue is available.  As a result, it is not known whether J had any other genetic variants, merely that he did not have the same variant as found in B.</span></p>

The reason for this is that either the type of LQTS is caused by an as yet undiscovered gene or that the technology may have missed disorders in known genes.  The pick-up rate in known genes is not 100 per cent.  Furthermore, Dr Newbury-Ecob commented in her report that while the KCNH2 variant detected in B may not cause LQTS by itself, the possibility that it may have an effect on the LQ interval leading to a susceptibility or risk of arrhythmias in the presence of other factors, either genetic or environmental, cannot be discounted.  It is potentially the case that a variant may be non-pathogenic in certain circumstances, but pathogenic in other circumstances, for example in the presence of other pathogenic variants.  That is believed to be the model in many common diseases, such as heart disease and cancer.  People inherit variants which may make them vulnerable in the presence of other genetic variants or environmental factors.</span></p>

It is possible that the changes in the KCNH2 gene, which are known to affect the length of the QT interval, may, in the presence of other factors, genetic or environmental cause, or be associated with LQTS or some other cardiac abnormality.  This is the subject of speculation and research, particularly in the context of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. In her oral evidence,, Dr Newbury-Ecob developed this point. The variant observed in B indicated some sort of susceptibility that could not be identified.  Saying that it could not by itself cause LQTS is not saying that this variant had no role in disease or death. There is research evidence that KCNH2 might play a role in some way in the presence of other factors, genetic or environmental.  Up to 10 per cent of families where there is more than one variant in LQTS give rise to clinical problems, whereas a single variant, on its own, would not be expected to do so.  </span></p>

Dr Newbury-Ecob considered it possible that these four features &#8211; dysmorphic facial features, congenital hypothyroidism, relative microcephaly and borderline learning difficulty &#8211; are linked genetically.

Although Dr Martin is not a geneticist, I attach some weight to his answer to Miss Davis: &#8220;to be fair, there are quite possibly a whole host of genetic conditions we know nothing about,&#8221; and his comment to Miss Judd that, &#8220;this is very much a developing area &#8230;. there is still a lot we do not understand.&#8221;  </span></p>

Dr Trevelyan, not called as an expert but as a witness of fact who works as a consultant paediatrician in a busy general hospital, said that she saw petechiae quite often in her role as a paediatrician. Dr Kenny, in her report, said that petechiae can arise for medical reasons, in which case they are usually generalised over the whole body.  They are seen in infectious diseases in association with inflammation to venules, most commonly in meningococcal septicaemia, but also more specifically in viral infections.  J, of course, was suffering from chicken pox in early January 2011. Petechiae can also however be caused mechanically by the application of pressure that restrict the venous return of blood to the heart.  In this context they have been associated with asphyxiation and consequently were the subject of much comment by the experts in the course of this hearing.  </span></p>

She had never witnessed it herself and was unaware of reports of post-resuscitation petechiae in the scientific literature.  Although Dr White had not seen cases in which petechiae had been sustained as a result of such resuscitation, he was aware that they had been described in the literature, although he acknowledged that this was a matter about which expert opinion was divided.  Dr White thought that both the strength with which the resuscitation was administered and the period of time in which it had taken place would contribute to the presence of petechiae.</span></p>

Cross-examined by Miss Davis, he stated that, in cases of asphyxia, the most common place to find petechiae is around the eyes (i.e. on the outside of the eyelids) , on the inner surface of the eyelid, inside the lips and behind the ears.  Those were what were described as the &#8220;classical distribution sites&#8221; for petechiae.  These were typical sites because tissue pressure in those sites is less than elsewhere, so that there is no support for little blood vessels which are therefore liable to burst if there is an increase in venous pressure.</span></p>

On 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">st</span><span style="color:#000000"> January, J had been well when he went to bed, but two hours later found unresponsive and jerky, with blue hands, feet and face. On admission to hospital some 50 minutes later, he was fully conscious and afebrile, but with petechiae over his chest and upper neck.  In Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s opinion, this episode considered in isolation would support a diagnosis of a fit, although he noted that the evidence of a fever was weak and the temperature taken in hospital over 37.9 degrees Celsius was not usually sufficient to trigger a febrile fit. So far as J&#8217;s second admission to hospital was concerned on 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">rd</span><span style="color:#000000"> January, Dr Cartlidge noted that once again J had been well or reasonably well at the time he went to bed.  Several hours later, he was found pale with staring eyes and possibly twitching of his hands.  On admission to hospital, J was found to be suffering from chicken pox, but was very energetic and afebrile.  In those circumstances, Dr Cartlidge ruled out the possibility that he had suffered from chicken pox encephalitis on this occasion.  Once again Dr Cartlidge considered that this episode, taken in isolation, would not be of significance.  However, when considered in the light of the later events, he considers that the admissions to hospital on 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">st</span><span style="color:#000000"> and 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">rd</span><span style="color:#000000"> January were concerning.</span><marker name="tab"/><span style="color:#000000">The events that are said to have taken place on those occasions were similar to later events in J&#8217;s and B&#8217;s lives that resulted in their deaths.

I consider that this is a matter on which the court is entitled to take a view independent of the medical experts. I acknowledge Dr White&#8217;s point that the fact that there were no scratch marks observed on B did not rule out suffocation as an explanation, but to my mind it is significantly more likely than not that there would have been some mark on one of the children, particularly B at the age of four. The local authority does not confine its case to saying that B was attacked in bed.  It is of course unable to be specific in any way as to where, when and how B was killed, if he was killed.  Much of the focus of this case has, however, been on the proposition that he was smothered while asleep in his bed.  Indeed, if he had been smothered when awake, it would be, in my judgment, even more remarkable that there was no mark on his body. At the invitation of counsel, I inspected the bed, currently in the possession of the police.  It has a wooden frame shaped like a car, raised slightly higher than the mattress.  Miss Judd concedes that it would have been possible for the mother to have smothered B on the bed, but submits it would have been much harder to do so than on a conventional bed and much harder to do so without causing him any bruising or other injury.  I find considerable force in that submission.  I consider it more probable than not that B, aged four, would have sustained some physical injury if smothered by his mother, and in particular smothered while lying on that bed.</span></p>

Miss Judd submits that if the history given by the mother about the three episodes involving J and the one involving B is false, it is extremely surprising that she has been so consistent about it, particularly given her limitations.  I agree.</span></p>

On the evening she said variously that it had been two minutes previously and ten minutes previously.  In oral evidence she said it had been before she last texted SB some 45 minutes beforehand.  Miss Davis and Miss Dewhurst, understandably, attach significant weight to this inconsistency. In assessing the significance of this discrepancy, I bear in mind the mother&#8217;s learning disability and in addition that the initial comments made by the mother were at a time when she was in a state of distress.   I also recall Dr Macintosh&#8217;s description of trying to get a history in a room full of people and that, while the order of events was clear, the timing was not. Furthermore, I take into account the fact that many people find it difficult to be accurate about timing.  As Miss Judd points out, there have been several examples in this case: MP and EH, who were otherwise credible witnesses, were obviously mistaken about the timing of the phone call made by the mother to SB&#8217;s home, and the boys who saw B outside shortly before his collapse did not give consistent accounts as to the time when that incident occurred.</span></p>

Given the amounts of detail in the accounts, and the mother&#8217;s learning disability, this is to my mind a significant pointer to the truth of her account.  I did not regard the discrepancy as to timing as significantly undermining the credibility of her account.</span></p>

The local authority suggest these incidents may have been incidents of smothering which the mother stopped short of causing lasting harm, but it must be remembered that J was not an infant but a child aged two years, four months.  Had he been the subject of two attacks by his mother, it might, in my judgment, have been expected that there would have been some sign of apprehension towards her.  The hospital staff and the paediatric ward noted, however, that there was good interaction between mother and son and no indication of fear on his part was ever mentioned.  </span></p>

The local authority concedes that there is no definitive evidence about what is or is not a normal grief reaction.  To my mind, looking at the evidence as a whole, her immediate reaction to B&#8217;s collapse was, for the most part, exactly what one would expect if her account is true.  That reaction was one of extreme distress, described by MP, EH, TR, MM and AT. In hospital, her reaction was consistent with shock.  She found it difficult to be heard in the presence of large numbers of friends and neighbours and the understandable grief expressed by her own mother, DA. So far as J&#8217;s hospital admissions were concerned, I do take into account the comments of the paramedics on one of the earlier admissions about her unusual reaction, but against that there is a description of her given by GW on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> January and the evidence from the 999 transcripts on that occasion was that she sounded upset.  I also bear in mind that she suffers from a learning disability and that this may have affected her reaction and her affect.  In cross-examination, and again in closing submissions, the local authority has emphasised the fact that the mother was at times refraining from taking her thyroid medication, but I consider that the evidence in support of the inference which the local authority invites me to draw &#8211; that this made her more prone to aggression - to be thin.  Of greater significance perhaps, is that by failing to take her medication she may have become more lethargic. In addition, I note the comment of GW, who says she has known the mother all her life and describes her as not a person who really shows her feelings.</span></p>

The local authority&#8217;s case is that the mother had smothered B at some point in the period after her mother DA left the house.  At some unknown point, the mother was seen dragging B into the house by a group of boys, all of whom were interviewed by the police and gave different times for this incident.  Until 19.28 the mother was on the computer playing bingo and texting SB.  It is difficult to imagine how she could have committed a prolonged attack on B during that period.  It must follow that any attack can only have occurred after </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">19</span><span style="color:#000000">.28 on either side of the MSN exchange that took place between the mother and NF. If the evidence as to the mother&#8217;s internet usage is to be relied on, she was on her computer until 19.45.  There was thus only a much shorter period when there was no evidence of her doing anything else.</span></p>

It is not something committed in a momentary loss of control.  Having seen her give evidence, it is, to my mind, difficult to envisage this mother committing an act of violence on her child lasting the length of time required to asphyxiate it.  It is equally implausible, to my mind, that she smothered B to silence him without realising the consequences of her action, having regard to the length of time needed to asphyxiate a child.</span></p>
