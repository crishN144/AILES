She maintains that the reason for the transfer was the Defendant&#8217;s determination that he should divest himself of any interest in the shares, so as to avoid the claims of creditors and potential creditors; he was at the time of the transfer &#8216;embroiled&#8217; (her word) in commercial litigation in Austria. The Claimant asserts that the Defendant made clear that he preferred for her, rather than a business partner, to be the owner of the Christchurch Street home in which they lived (a corollary of her taking ownership of the shares, as this was the main asset of the company). Further, or alternatively, the Claimant asserts that at the time of the transfer, and thereafter, the Defendant made clear, through unequivocal representations to the Claimant, that the shares (and the property in which they lived) belonged to her, and the Claimant acted to her substantial detriment in reliance upon those representations. In the further alternative she asserts that a constructive trust has been established by virtue of their common intention that she should have a sizeable proportion of the shareholding, and hence the property.   If the claim fails on all of these bases, the Claimant seeks relief under <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 1</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span>, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> for a housing fund for herself and three of the parties&#8217; five children. </p>

When he procured the transfer of the shares to the Claimant, he intended, and he asserts that the parties <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> so intended, that she would be no more than a &#8216;bare trustee&#8217; or &#8216;nominee&#8217; of the shares, and that at no time did she acquire beneficial ownership of the shareholding.  He claims to have told her this at the time.  His case therefore is that at all times he has been the beneficial owner of the shares.   He points to the fact that in 2018 the Claimant signed a document headed &#8216;Notes to the Declaration of Trust&#8217; which confirmed this arrangement.  In the <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 1</span> proceedings, the Defendant&#8217;s open offer is the provision of a capital sum (&#163;200,000<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

When cross-examined about this, the Defendant said that he had received advice from HMRC that it would be acceptable for him to be &#8216;staying&#8217; at the property while he was renovating it, and that this would not incur ATED liability.  I asked him myself where he was &#8216;living&#8217; at that time, and he confirmed that he was indeed &#8216;living&#8217; at Christchurch Street and was not &#8216;living&#8217; anywhere else.  This, it seemed to me, contradicted his solicitors&#8217; assertions on his behalf.  </p>

He responded with the words: &#8220;I would advise him to proceed as he thinks fit&#8221;.  Mr Weale pressed for a clearer answer, but the Defendant could not or would not oblige.  In my finding, the Defendant knew full well that had he confirmed to Dr K that he owned the property beneficially he would have defeated his whole purpose of the 2000 transaction, and would have exposed him to enforcement of debts accruing in any foreign litigation; yet denying that his beneficial ownership of the property, while possibly putting Dr K off the scent, would have totally undermined his case in these proceedings. </p>

Until 2018, the Company did not have a separate bank account; rather, payments relating to the Company were made to and from a Santander (formerly Abbey National) account in the Claimant&#8217;s sole name which had been set up at the Defendant&#8217;s instigation shortly after the shares in the Company were transferred to the Claimant. That account was, in turn, replenished by the Claimant from her earnings during all the years when she was in employment, both before and after having children, as well as from the child benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit.   </p>

If that were the case, I would be forced to start criminal proceedings. It's very straightforward: A trustee has strict obligations under the law. Your client would then be asked why she violated her trustee obligations. If, interrogated under criminal investigation, she would blame everything on ill advise (sic.) from say, her legal representative, it would be unavoidable to further investigate that claim as well. In Austria we have for that purpose the chamber of lawyers disciplinary committee, where I had the pleasure once or twice to initiate proceedings to disbar certain questionable elements from the legal profession&#8221;. </p>

This remained the case throughout the parties&#8217; relationship.  When the parties separated the Defendant sought to refurbish it so that the property could be let.  There is a dispute over the source of the funds for the renovation works.

I was unimpressed with the Defendant&#8217;s assertion, in the absence of evidence of the same, that he had reimbursed the Claimant in cash from the proceeds of sale of Vienna properties (the sales had all taken place many years earlier) or the sale of (unspecified) antiques in Vienna. </p>

Likewise, if she felt that the Notes did not reflect the true ownership of the property, she would have simply refused to sign that document too.&#8221; </p>

In his Defence, the Defendant asserts that she &#8220;would or should have consented to the same&#8221;.  I discuss the Defendant&#8217;s actions below, but it is appropriate to record here that his assertion that the Claimant would have consented to the transfer is preposterous. The step of purportedly registering an alleged transfer had only been taken, in my finding, because the letter before action had made clear that the Claimant was looking to seek &#8220;a declaration that the Company holds the Property on trust for [the Claimant] as well as a declaration as to [the Claimant&#8217;s] ownership of the shares in the Company.&#8221; </p>

In 2000, the parties intended and understood that the Claimant would become the owner pure and simple (put another way, the legal <span style="font-style:italic">and beneficial</span> owner) of the shares once the transfer had been effected.  The purpose behind the transfer was to ensure that the Defendant did not have any interest in the shares whatsoever, thereby preventing (so far as possible) the shares and the property from being &#8220;attacked&#8221; (i.e. seized or sequestered) by his creditors. This arrangement was brought about in circumstances where the Claimant and Defendant had been in a serious cohabiting relationship for nearly two years, and both saw the sense of the assets being held within their relationship.  On these facts, the company, Pier, held the property on trust for the Claimant.  As to that last point, Mr Weale relies on the judgment of Lord Sumption in <span style="font-style:italic">Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd &amp; Others</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/34" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 34" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 34</ref>, at para.52: </p>

The author there suggests that in a domestic context, the search is made to the parties shared intentions, actual, inferred, or imputed, in the light of their whole course of conduct in relation to it.  A constructive trust arises in connection with the acquisition by one party of a legal title to property whenever that party has so conducted.  Lewin suggests that where, as here, a claim is made by a person (the Defendant) to displace the presumption that the beneficial ownership of property follows the legal ownership, the following questions must be addressed: </p>

She conveyed her extreme upset at having to remember some of the worst aspects of the abuse which I am satisfied (and indeed HHJ Lord Meston QC found) that she had suffered during the relationship, upset at the divisions which it had brought among her own children, and gave her account without guile or embellishment.

These characteristics, which I am sure were present for much of their relationship, intensified during the breakdown of his relationship with the Claimant.  The Defendant became, by his own admission, &#8220;bitter&#8221; with the Claimant, and was, on my finding, extremely angry about the developing situation which was not to his liking.

The Defendant in my judgment took the risk that transferring the shares to the Claimant, in respect of whom he assumed he would remain in a long-term relationship, was overall less of a risk than the more pressing claims of his creditors.  I am satisfied that the Defendant wished to ensure that he was divested of any beneficial interest in the shares so as to prevent (so far as possible) the shares and the property from being claimed by those with his creditors.   </p>

The Defendant has failed to discharge the burden on him of proving otherwise. I do not, in the circumstances, need to deal with the Claimant&#8217;s secondary cases.   </p>

Had I not reached the conclusion that the beneficial ownership passed to the Claimant in 2000 when the shares were legally transferred, I would have had no hesitation in concluding that the Defendant should be estopped from denying her claim to the entire shareholding or a sizeable portion of the shareholding. </p>
