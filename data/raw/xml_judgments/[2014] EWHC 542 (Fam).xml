The Claimant had left home in her late teens and married a man with whom she has had five children.  The deceased profoundly disagreed with her lifestyle choice and an irreconcilable rift developed between them.  Attempts at reconciliation were unsuccessful.  District Judge Million found that the main responsibility for the rift lay with the deceased although the Claimant and her husband bore some of the responsibility for the difficulties.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">District Judge Million held that the fact that the Claimant was an adult did not debar her from establishing that the will did not make reasonable provision for her.  He found that it was relevant that she was of limited means.  He found that the rejection by the deceased of her only child at the age of seventeen, then maintained for the rest of her life, was unreasonable.  That had led to the deceased unreasonably excluding her daughter from any financial provision in her will, despite her daughter&#8217;s obviously constrained and needy financial circumstances and wish for and attempts at reconciliation.  He held that the reasons given by the deceased for excluding her daughter, set out in letters written in 1984 and 2002, both contained a number of factual inaccuracies in the attempt to explain her decision, which adds to and supports the unfairness.  </p>

The appeal was apparently heard by Eleanor King J under some pressure of time.  It was contended that if she found in favour of the Claimant in respect of the &#8220;gateway&#8221; provision then the Claimant&#8217;s appeal in respect of quantum would fall away.

Steps were eventually taken to have the appeal listed.  Sir James Munby P. gave directions on 7 May 2013.  By that time, there had been three relevant developments.  (i) Mr John Collins of counsel, who has been acting latterly on behalf of the Claimant, and who acts pro-bono, had taken the view that his predecessor&#8217;s grounds of appeal needed supplementation (ii) the Claimant had come into possession of a letter which she said required to be put before the court.  That letter had on her unchallenged account only came into her possession after the hearing before the District Judge but before the appeal hearing before Eleanor King J.  The Respondents accordingly submitted that it did not fulfil the relevant tests under <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/1954/1" uk:canonical="[1954] EWCA Civ 1" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1954">[1954] EWCA Civ 1</ref> since it had been available as at the date of the appeal (iii) after the hearing in the Court of Appeal (which attracted some publicity) the Respondent&#8217;s solicitor received an anonymous letter claiming that on the basis of the report of the case it appeared that the financial position of the Claimant and her husband had been misrepresented.

The Claimant had never had a holiday, much of what she has is old and/or second-hand, she has difficulty in affording clothes for the children, and is limited in the food that she can buy.  She set out schedules setting out what she thought would be reasonable expenditure for her to enjoy a reasonably comfortable life and what she thought would be reasonable expenditure to lift her home and its contents to a modern standard.  It is now submitted on behalf of the Claimant that the Judge wrongly thought that these schedules were served during the trial but in fact they had been served with the original witness statements but updated shortly before trial.  It is the case for the Claimant that these schedules were filed to demonstrate the sorts of things which were unaffordable on the Claimant&#8217;s present resources, and to assist the court in its broad brush determinations, per <span style="font-style:italic">Re Watson deceased</span> [1999] 1FLR 878, at 890g, as to what might be regarded as a reasonable provision beyond what the Claimant can currently afford.</p>

He describes what was eventually sought as &#8220;a much more ambitious case.&#8221;  The Claimant sought (1) &#163;186,000 to permit her to purchase her own home (there will be a discount under the Right to Buy provisions) (2) &#163;53,000 to pay for a single-storey extension to the house, presently three bedrooms (3) a capitalised sum equivalent to an income of &#163;10,000 per year for life: this was not quantified but the judge calculated that on the Duxbury tables in At a Glance a sum of &#163;173,000 was indicated (4) some further capital sum to permit the refurbishment and re-equipment of the house after its purchase.  That list produced a sum of &#163;40,950.  The Claimant also produced a proposed annual budget for the family which totalled &#163;34,600.  Taking into account H&#8217;s income from his part time earnings at &#163;5,304 and child benefit of &#163;1,570, this would have required, the Judge calculated, an additional annual income of &#163;27,776.  Capitalised for life for a female aged 46 years would require a sum of about &#163;562,000 (again using At a Glance figures).  The Judge commented that this exceeded the size of the estate.  The Judge said that he regretted that &#8220;the Claimant&#8217;s case on these matters was presented in an ill thought-out and unhelpful way.&#8221;  In his skeleton argument on the appeal Mr Smith, then representing the Claimant, states that the schedules were put forward to assist the Judge in determining what might be a reasonable maintenance figure.</p>

But he did consider it reasonable for her to attempt to support herself by some paid work during the course of the next few years.  However, even with such future work, the Claimant would be likely to remain in some financial need.  If both the Claimant and H work, they may continue to be entitled to working tax credits, presently &#163;8,112 per annum.  One half of that share would be &#163;4,056 per year.  He said:</p>

He said that that was an approximation.  He then took into account that the Claimant ought to be able to find some modest part time work, although he accepted that it would be poorly paid and that she is likely to continue to require state subsidises for her basic living expenses.  In order to reflect that potentially reduced financial dependency, he capitalised the maintenance figure at the lower sum of &#163;50,000.  He concluded:</p>

Those criteria have to be assessed in respect of both what I have called the &#8220;gateway&#8221; stage, and at the evaluative stage.  I take the view that the court is engaged in a different exercise at the two stages.  At the first stage, this judge took the view that the lack of expectancy did not fail to make the lack of provision unreasonable.  But the exercise in deciding on quantum was different.  To take a simple example, the financial resources and financial needs which the applicant had or is likely to have in the foreseeable future may render the provision unreasonable: but the quantum will certainly be affected by the amount of the resource.  The same is so in respect of all the other criteria set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref>.  Therefore, in my view the judge was not wrong to take into account lack of expectancy: which seems to me to fall certainly under (g) &#8220;any other matter, including the conduct of the applicant or any other person &#8230; relevant&#8221; and also potentially under (d) &#8220;obligations and responsibilities&#8221; towards the Applicant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Supplemental ground 3</span><span style="font-weight:bold"/>- The 1998 letter discloses that the deceased had received a very substantial lump sum after the death of her late husband, the Claimant&#8217;s father, which occurred when she was pregnant with the Claimant.  In that letter she states that the sum was used to reduce or pay off the mortgage on the property which her late husband had owned and to which she succeeded as his widow.  Mr Collins says that this puts a new light on the judge&#8217;s decision since the judge erroneously assumed that the deceased had brought up the Claimant from her own resources and in circumstances of some hardship.  Mr Collins refers to <span style="font-style:italic">Callaghan</span> [1985] Fam1.  The deceased had married the Claimant&#8217;s widowed mother.  Her home had been provided by the Claimant&#8217;s grandfather.  The Claimant&#8217;s mother predeceased his stepfather.  Part of Booth J&#8217;s reasoning in providing for the Claimant out of the estate rested on the origin of the assets which &#8220;clearly derived from the Plaintiff&#8217;s mother &#8230; and from the property which was the gift to her of the Plaintiff&#8217;s paternal grandfather.  It was in effect (her) inheritance following on the death of the first husband, the Plaintiff&#8217;s father.&#8221;</p>

I reject Mr Collins&#8217; argument that it derived from the Claimant&#8217;s father and therefore it is reasonable for her to be provided from this sum, which has become part of the estate.  There is no evidence to suggest that this sum was anything other than a payment to the deceased as widow.</p>

Mr Collins accepts that no evidence as to this was led in the court below, but he says that it is a matter of law that any capital over &#163;16,000, unless it is used for the purchase of the home in which the Claimant is to be living, will reduce pound for pound the benefits to which the Claimant would otherwise be entitled.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In response, the Respondents submit that the District Judge had rejected the Claimant&#8217;s suggested figures in his judgment as being in excess of what would be reasonable to receive from the estate.  In particular, the judge did not hold that an improvement was called for and was not given the tools with which to achieve it.  Ms Reed has stressed to me that it was not for the judge to make enquiries or to suggest ways in which an award might be appropriately structured.  It is further submitted that the &#163;50,000 awarded would undoubtedly enable the Claimant to improve her circumstances in such ways as she might choose.  It is pointed out, as indeed the Claimant accepts, that her budget and capital claim bore no relation to her actual circumstances.  It is submitted that the Claimant&#8217;s claim is based upon the false premise that she is entitled to that which she would like her maintenance to be rather than an assessment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref>(b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1975 Act</ref> as an assessment of what &#8220;in all the circumstances of this case it was reasonable for her to receive from the estate for her maintenance.&#8221;  It is further submitted that the Judge had found that she had only just crossed the threshold and thus the award should be limited.  The fact that the Claimant and her husband had managed for many years without any assistance from the deceased was crucial.  It was submitted that the District Judge did not equate reasonable provision under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> with the funds payable in respect of state benefits but took half of those tax credits as giving an indication of what the government accepts as being needed to give the Claimant a reasonable but basic standard of living; and on the facts in this case this was reasonable provision.  The point is inevitably made that the size of the estate in this case was not sufficient to permit the Claimant to be both housed and provided for by way of capital:  therefore any award cannot take her out of the benefits regime.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant relies on <span style="font-style:italic">Myers</span> 2005 WTLR 851.  The Claimant had suffered from mental fragility, ill health and emotional and practical problems and lived in straightened circumstances.  The estate was worth in excess of &#163;8 million.  Mr Justice Munby, as he then was,  held that the deceased had obligations and responsibilities towards the Claimant that were not be narrowly construed but to be taken into account in a broad sense.  A balancing exercise is required for the many factors to which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> requires to have regard and the court should give weight to those factors as may in the individual case be appropriate.  The factors tipping the balance in the Claimant&#8217;s favour were that she was living in severely straightened circumstances; although her situation was to a significant extent a result of her awkward personality; she had not had behaved as badly to the deceased as he seemed to believe; and he had very substantial wealth.  There was more than enough in the estate to meet the needs of all parties.  Thus in those circumstances she was provided with a flat and living expenses to be settled upon her.  The Judge was at pains to make sure that she was not provided with a windfall.  </p>

Piglowski </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 3 All ER 632" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 3 All ER 632</ref>).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Reed also referred me to <span style="font-style:italic">Cunliffe v Fielden</span> [2006] CH 361 for the proposition that if I am to allow this appeal and substitute my own evaluation I must do so on the basis of the figures as in the 2007 judgment.  I am not persuaded that <span style="font-style:italic">Cunliffe v Fielden</span> is authority for that proposition: where the Court of Appeal took the figures as at the first instance decision because, it seems to me, they were still current.  If, for instance, the estate had decreased very markedly in value in the 6 years since the first instance decision, it seems to me inevitable that the Respondents would wish to rely on that fact and such leave to rely on fresh evidence: and indeed in the facts of this case the Claimant&#8217;s asserted needs in this case are less now than they were at the original trial.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Watson</span> Mr Justice Neuberger took the view that the cost of appropriate alternative accommodation had not been established and he adjourned the case for that information to be produced.  I am in rather a different position on an appeal but I am very conscious of the costs which are being run up in this case.  No attempt has been made to put in fresh evidence as to the costs of housing.  I am far from certain that I would have permitted a further adjournment if I was satisfied that the Judge had erred.  I accept entirely, however, Ms Reed&#8217;s submission that the first step is to decide whether the appeal against the award of Judge Million should be allowed.  In any event Mr Collins has now limited his client&#8217;s claim. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a result of the anonymous letter Mr Aspden, the Respondents&#8217; solicitor, instructed an inquiry agent.  He went to a spiritualist meeting and has reported back that the Claimant&#8217;s husband was offering various spiritualist services at a cost of &#163;35 and his health did not seem to be as impaired as medical reports produced at the trial had suggested.  The Claimant&#8217;s husband has responded that he has declared all his income for tax purposes, that he makes no profit on his consultations as part of his membership of a spiritualist church, and that this activity started post trial in any event.  Ms Reed concedes that this aspect of the case makes little if any difference to the judge&#8217;s evaluation of quantum and, as I have said, did not touch upon the evidence in her argument.  I discount it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge found that it was not appropriate to meet the Claimant&#8217;s housing need in all the circumstances.  Although the Respondent charities have no claim, moral or otherwise, on the deceased as the judge recorded, nonetheless he had to pay regard to the fact that this was the way that the deceased had chosen to bequeath her assets.  The Judge&#8217;s award was intended to provide the Claimant with a windfall for her to spend as she liked in improving her circumstances.  The Judge did not specifically take into account that only the first &#163;16,000 of this sum would be of direct benefit to her, unless of course she expended the total immediately.  I do not know and have not been told what effect on her benefits there will be if she does indeed expend these sums: and whether they will be treated as notionally hers.  The reality may be that she will need to expend the first &#163;34,000 on living expenses before she can reclaim benefits.  I bear in mind that the judge was not given the material needed to make this assessment.  I have not been given it now.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If I took the view that the judge&#8217;s approach was manifestly wrong because he did not provide a sufficient lump sum to re-house the Claimant, for the reasons set out in the Notice of Appeal, then of course I would allow the appeal.  But the court at first instance is conducting a balancing exercise between the various factors.  I cannot say that the judge was manifestly wrong, or even wrong, in taking the view that notwithstanding that the Claimant and her husband and family lived in straightened circumstances, the fact they had done so for so many years did not justify an award which improved their circumstances.  The argument on behalf of the Claimant is in effect that because there will be no benefit to the Claimant unless her housing need is met, the award must achieve that result.  That can not be the right approach.  Otherwise, the judge&#8217;s determination that the lack of expectation tempered the award would be rendered meaningless.</p>
