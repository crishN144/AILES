Her counsel is Mr. Buswell, who has said all that could be said for her application in the rather difficult circumstances of his coming to the case relatively afresh.  The father has been represented by solicitors and counsel, his counsel being Mr.&#160;Glaser.  That legal team has been in place throughout, by which I mean from 2009.  Since then there has been voluminous and hugely expensive litigation over matters of income for C, over questions of a property for C (ie D Square) and the cost of funding it.  The legal costs now run to several million pounds, almost all of which had been paid by the father, both for his own lawyers and for those of the mother.  Other issues which have had to be determined by me along the way have been the satellite issue of so-called cost funding for the mother, which over the years became a quite complex issue.  </span></p>

The reason is that the father, who is in his 50s, is a member of the Royal Family of a Middle Eastern country.  I will mention at paragraph 14 below how I described his wealth in one of my many judgments in this matter.  The mother, who is in her 30s, was born into an affluent family from a different Middle Eastern country; but now says, as per her statement of 24th&#160;November&#160;2015, that she is &#8216;in serious financial troubles&#8217;. </span></p>

Whilst somewhat rambly and repetitive, for which the mother is not to be blamed, her statement clearly enough puts across her case in support of her Notice of Application.</span></p>

On 14th&#160;December&#160;2012, I heard a Pre-trial Review prior to my hearing a few months later the full Sch.1 application.  At that time the mother wanted to take C for a holiday to the USA after Christmas 2012.  She said that this was a stressful time for her in the run-up to the main hearing and since the welfare of C depends on the mother&#8217;s wellbeing, I did accede to that application.  I ordered &#163;21,000 to be paid by the father towards such a holiday in the USA.  This was less than her claim for &#163;46,000 against him, on the basis that she could and should have saved some of her then substantial interim periodical payments for C to put towards the cost of a holiday.  I emphasised that this was &#8220;on the particular occasion&#8221; and I said at para.24 of my judgment:</span></p>

Both parties were represented by leading counsel and junior counsel.  This was a very detailed hearing covering a substantial range of issues in depth and concerning most aspects of the final arrangements for C.  I recorded in that judgment that C has a diagnosis of a syndrome called MBL immune deficiency, as well as of Kawasaki disease, another immune-system illness, and that he had been very ill in 2010.  These features have, I accept, made the mother protective of him and have led her to be very choosy about the way she brings him up, for example as to the foods which she purchases for him.  She says for instance that she has to buy a particular food supplement for him which costs &#163;241 a month or just under &#163;3,000 per annum. </span></p>

That property was to be held on arrangements to be agreed and to revert to the father after C ceased tertiary education, including a gap year.  The purchase price of D&#160;Square was &#163;3,450,000.  I further ordered that various debts of the mother amounting to some &#163;770,000 must be cleared off by the father via a lump sum paid to the mother for C&#8217;s benefit, and, as I have said, I ordered periodical payments for C of &#163;204,000 per annum or &#163;17,000 per month.  There was no order as to costs because the father had accepted responsibility for the mother&#8217;s costs, save that he was ordered to pay her costs of the implementation of the order.  That implementation was ordered to be down to and including a hearing which was fixed to follow shortly afterwards for finalisation of the way in which D Square was to be held and in respect of its maintenance, repair and so on.</span></p>

It is impossible to know the reality of his lifestyle, save to say that his family, the royal family, appears to rank pretty clearly among the super-rich and that as a senior member of that family he moves naturally within a world of opulence (the mother&#8217;s word) where there is effectively little if anything which he cannot have, or have the use of.&#8221;</span></p>

It is very much in C&#8217;s interests, and will not impact on the father in any way which he will notice, that she should go away from this hearing with a fresh start, with a clear awareness of the budget within which she has to live and with her balance sheet at zero rather than in deficit.

The budget below is what the court has calculated to be reasonable when balancing the various competing arguments which arise in cases like this.

She was represented at that hearing by extremely experienced leading and junior counsel.  It was writ large in the judgment that the mother had to set and adhere to a budget.  As I noted, this periodical payments order for a five-year old boy of &#163;204,000 per annum (with the mother&#8217;s accommodation costs provided for in a &#163;3.4&#160;million house, with school fees paid and with all her debts of &#163;770,000 cleared) was and is a very substantial order, even in the context of a man of the father&#8217;s colossal wealth.  Even now the mother&#8217;s asserted budget remains at what one can described as a mouth-watering level&#160;...&#160; &#163;714,000 per annum.  Certainly on that budget there are a number of claimed items which can manifestly be brought down to a more reasonable level without sacrificing the welfare of C, even taking account of the mother&#8217;s arguments (which are understandable to her) that he has the status which he has.  For example, holidays there mentioned are in the sum of &#163;188,000 per annum with staff at just over &#163;100,000 per annum&#160;...&#160;I bear in mind that the mother again seeks a box for C at the Emirates Stadium and a box for him at Ascot, although these were specifically rejected [by me] in&#160;March&#160;2013.  She continues to seek payment by standing order when I have held that there is no jurisdiction to make such an order against the father, because he is not resident in this jurisdiction.  In a case like this where the &#8216;millionaire&#8217;s defence&#8217; is taken, a court simply has to taking a view as to what is the reasonable amount in all the circumstances of the case, bearing in mind the test that I mentioned in the March&#160;2013 judgment of enabling the mother to bring up the child in circumstances which are not too dissimilar from those of the child&#8217;s father (that is a paraphrase and not completely accurately stated).  That view as to the reasonable amount was taken in&#160;March&#160;2013.  The remedy was to go to the Court of Appeal if it was felt that I was insufficiently generous and therefore wrong.  If I was right, then it is not right to vary it in the manner now sought.  I therefore dismiss the application for an upward variation in periodical payments for [C].&#8221;</span></p>

It was apparent that the father had succeeded on the vast majority of the issues.  I assessed his costs at &#163;30,000 and ordered the mother to make a very modest contribution of &#163;5,000 towards them, to be deducted at the rate of &#163;500 per month from C&#8217;s periodical payments.  The father agreed not to enforce that order if the mother made no further application under Sch.1 for two years (ie not before 10th&#160;December&#160;2015).  In fact, the mother has done so and it will be for the father to decide now whether to enforce his costs order by deducting &#163;500 a month until the &#163;5,000 is paid off.</span></p>

It arose in this way.  On 30th&#160;August&#160;2013 the mother applied ex parte to Hayden J about urgent dental work for C.

The reason that this child is in difficulty is because your client is just not acting responsibly as a parent&#160;...&#160;in allocating her finances&#160;...&#160;She has so poorly managed her affairs that this child has had to endure further pain and discomfort because she could not find &#163;5,000.  I am not for one moment impressed and it is time for this litigation to be closed down.  If it were not for the fact of a little boy in pain and the mother&#8217;s assertion that she has pennies only, I would not have acceded to her request.  There was not, in my view, any need for this to have come on as an urgent application.  It was finance mismanagement and not the treatment that has led to this.  I make the provision requested, but with bad grace and reluctantly.  It is time for the mother to arrange her finances in a mature manner.

It was vitally in C&#8217;s interests that the treatment could go ahead.  Even though the dental condition was chronic, that was not his fault and I think it would be detrimental for it to be set aside, being a wholly irrelevant sum to the father, except as a matter of principle.  I will not, therefore, require it to be repaid [by the mother] to the father, but I do propose to set aside the costs order against him in respect of that ex parte hearing.&#8221;</span></p>

Mr.&#160;Buswell says that the Court of Appeal hearing was all to do with a legal point about the appropriateness of the so-called &#8216;millionaire&#8217;s defence&#8217;; but it is clear that the Court of Appeal was also looking at the quantum of my award (see per Macur LJ at para.1). </span></p>

I am aware that the mother says that prices are going up and she refers particularly, through Mr.&#160;Buswell, to BUPA.  He placed before me quotations from BUPA, which appear to show an increase from some &#163;12,000 for 2013/2014 to almost &#163;18,000 predicted for&#160;January&#160;2015 to&#160;January&#160;2016.  Closer inspection however indicates that the greater part of the increase in the quotations is the amount payable for the mother, which goes up from &#163;5,000 in the first one to &#163;12,000 in the second one, whilst the figure for C goes up by only &#163;1,000.

More broadly there will of course always be individual items of expense which will go up.  There may equally be some that go down.  Such variations are predictable for everybody.  That is the reason for the court having index-linked the award and for its having emphasised that the mother has to budget in broad terms within the amount allowed to her. </span></p>

It may indeed be that it was the costs wrapped up in the compromise for the payment by the father of the total of &#163;70,000; or it may alternatively be that it was other costs.  But if it was any costs to do with the hearing on 11th&#160;December&#160;2013, then the costs order at that hearing was actually that the mother should pay a contribution to the father&#8217;s costs.  That would mean, if there were any costs owed by her to Withers relating to that hearing, that she would have a responsibility to them herself for those costs, without recourse to the father (except of course by seeking a lump sum against him nominally for C&#8217;s indirect benefit).  </span></p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">In my Judgment, it is quite inappropriate that the father should now be expected to pay the Withers bill for the mother (whatever services it precisely covers) as being something for the indirect benefit of C.  It would serve to undermine the court&#8217;s determination on costs.  That bill will have to be something for the mother to sort out as best she can as between herself and Withers.</span></p>

First, there is the question of a new trustee to represent her as regards the trust which owns the shares in the company which owns D Square.  This issue has not been put into evidence by either party; but in short I understand the point to be that the mother is being advised that the individual she wishes to represent her as trustee should be cloaked in some entity, like a trust or company.  The father does not want this, particularly if it were to be a shell company, and he wants her trustee to be &#8216;a person&#8217;.  That is because it is his belief that the mother would make herself the shareholder and director of a company and thus become the individual with whom his trustee would have to deal.  He considers this would create all sorts of aggravation in the management of D Square.</span></p>

The mother says that the builder whom she instructed has inflated the bill and that the father/the father&#8217;s trustee will not pay it.  She is apparently being sued for it by the builder and says she cannot pay it.</span></p>

In the first instance the parties should attempt to deal with them by negotiation/mediation and by the injection of a good dose of common-sense to avoid having to come back to the court.  But in the last resort it will be necessary for the matter to come back, reserved to myself if available, to deal with the questions of (a) how the new trustee is to be set up to represent the mother and (b) what is to happen about the cost of the works which she is being asked to pay for. </span></p>
