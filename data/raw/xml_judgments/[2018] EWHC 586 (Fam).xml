She is also, I understand, a serving member of the armed forces of X. The mother and the four children with whom I am concerned entered the UK with diplomatic rights and privileges arising from the mother&#8217;s employment at the X High Commission. The mother also has an older daughter, C, born on 7 March 1995 and thus 23 years old, who lives with her. </p>

The mother and her children thus had diplomatic status arising from her employment as a member of the administrative and technical staff at the High Commission. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0in">Problems relating to the children emerged relatively soon after the family&#8217;s arrival in the UK. During 2015 there was a report from D&#8217;s school that D and his siblings did not have lunch money. In May 2015 a referral was made to Children&#8217;s Services following D being stabbed. D changed his account of what had happened to him several times and stated that five white males had attacked him. No further action was taken with respect to this incident. In July 2016 a further referral was made after D went missing just before the family were due to travel to X on holiday for a month. On 14 July 2016 D was at risk of being excluded from school for an assault on another student. He was withdrawn from school by his stepfather, SB, and was taken to X by his mother and stepfather. D returned with his mother to the UK to start a new school in September 2016 but his stepfather remained in X. </p>

During the subsequent police and local authority investigation, D disclosed that his mother had thrown a shoe at him causing injury to his head and had hit him with a metal stick causing an injury to his finger. He also reported incidents of his mother shouting at him, threatening him, withholding lunch money, withholding dinner, and shaving his head as a form of punishment. D said he was fearful of being taken to X by his mother, a threat which she often made to him when she felt he was not listening to her. </p>

He said that they were all hit with a belt up to 40 times or until the mother became tired. S and SL then confirmed that their mother had hit them with a belt. S corroborated D&#8217;s account that his hair had been shaved as a punishment and that he had been sent to X for bad behaviour. D was also seen with a mark on his left cheek. He explained that this had happened when his elder sister, C, had put a hot iron on his cheek. D had told his mother who denied that this had happened. </p>

Following the expiry of police protection on 28 November 2016, the mother signed a s.20 agreement for the children to remain in foster care although she denied the allegations of physical abuse. On 29 November 2016 a child protection medical was undertaken of D which revealed that he had multiple marks all over his body consistent with non-accidental injuries. E and SL were ABE interviewed and both confirmed being hit with a belt by their mother and having seen their siblings being hit. D&#8217;s ABE interview was cancelled on 30 November 2016 due to concerns that his family had diplomatic immunity. </p>

She accepted that she sometimes smacked the children as a form of discipline but said that the children had exaggerated some of what had occurred in the family home. She said that D was lying because he wanted his freedom. The local authority was concerned that the mother minimised the difficulties and was only willing to work with the local authority because she was frightened of being sent back to X. Nevertheless, she agreed to work with the local authority, saying that she and her children would be sent back to X by the High Commission if she did not cooperate. The local authority issued care proceedings on 9 January 2017. </p>

The order dated 7 February 2017 recorded that the courts of England and Wales had jurisdiction to hear the care proceedings and that the mother and children did not have immunity from those proceedings by virtue of the mother&#8217;s employment with X High Commission. There remained a live issue as to whether public law orders could be enforced against the mother and the children by reason of their diplomatic privileges and immunities. </p>

He went missing from his foster home and was guarded as to his whereabouts when questioned. When placed in semi-independent accommodation, he became involved in criminal activity whilst missing from that placement: for example, on 4/5 March 2017 he was arrested for possession of knives; on 15 March 2017 he was arrested for robbery; and on 13 April 2017 he was arrested on suspicion of shoplifting. It was suspected that D was affiliated to a gang and was also associated with substance misuse. The local authority decided to support D&#8217;s return home to his mother at a hearing on 3 July 2017 as the risks of such a return appeared to be lower than those presented by D&#8217;s non-engagement and absconding from local authority care. D returned home to his mother shortly after the hearing and has remained living at home since that time. </p>

On 23 August 2017 Mr Justice Hayden approved the position taken by all the parties that a fact-finding hearing was not necessary in the light of the threshold concessions made by the mother, these being of sufficient severity for the assessments of her to be predicated upon a realistic evaluation of any future risk she posed to the children. The matter was listed for a final hearing with a time estimate of five days commencing on 23 October 2017. </p>

Just before the mother&#8217;s recall became known, the local authority was at the point of filing and serving its final evidence and care plans. At that stage, the local authority sought final care orders for the younger children based on a plan for long-term foster care with a view to the children&#8217;s potential rehabilitation to the mother in the longer term if she were to successfully complete the therapeutic work recommended by Dr Van Rooyen, the clinical psychologist jointly instructed as an expert in these proceedings. Those plans had been formulated on the basis that the mother would remain in the UK and would have regular contact with the children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">I conducted a hearing between 23- 27 October 2017 and gave a judgment which is in the bundle. On the basis of a consensus amongst the parties which had emerged following the oral evidence of Dr Van Rooyen, I adjourned the proceedings until 12 February 2018 for the mother to undertake the work recommended by Dr Van Rooyen and for Dr Van Rooyen to further report as to her progress. The work comprised (a) individual counselling sessions to develop the mother&#8217;s insight into her past behaviour and her empathy as to the children&#8217;s situation; (b) parenting work which would start after the mother had had three sessions of individual counselling; and (c) family therapy. The mother was also offered some anger management work. All the parties were in agreement that this work should take place though the Children&#8217;s Guardian was more cautious about a successful outcome. I made it plain in my judgment that my approach was governed by the paramountcy of the children&#8217;s welfare. The imminence or not of their mother&#8217;s recall to X was an important factor but was not determinative of the outcome of the proceedings. The options for the children remained open since what was required of the mother in a relatively short space of time was, to use Dr Van Rooyen&#8217;s words, a big ask. Whilst Dr Van Rooyen acknowledged the desirability of rehabilitation of the children to the mother&#8217;s care and that in the circumstances no time should be lost in putting this plan into practice, she also maintained her position that the prognosis for the mother to make the necessary changes in her parenting was guarded.  </p>

By that stage, it was clear that the mother had not had sufficient counselling sessions to allow the parenting work to begin. In addition, on 13 December 2017, the local authority had received an email from the X High Commission which stated that it had informed the FCO of the mother&#8217;s recall and which confirmed that the mother&#8217;s salary would no longer be paid after the end of December 2017. Clarification was sought from the FCO and it certified after the hearing that no notification of the recall had been provided to it by the X High Commission. On 18 January 2018 the X High Commission sent a letter to the local authority stating that the only outcome to the proceedings that it would countenance was the return of the children to their mother&#8217;s care. </p>

It submitted that the certificate was not conclusive evidence that the mother&#8217;s diplomatic privileges and immunities ended on 31 January 2018. The &#8220;reasonable period&#8221; available to the mother in which to leave the UK following the end of her functions was a matter ultimately for the court to decide. In the circumstances of this case, the local authority suggested that the &#8220;reasonable period&#8221; for the mother to leave should take into account the need for her to attend the proceedings and to continue to be in the UK for an appropriate time thereafter. If the court were of that view, the local authority submitted that the impact of diplomatic immunity on the making of final care orders would need to be addressed by the court. The local authority submitted that D and S were clearly members of the mother&#8217;s household and thus had the same diplomatic status as she did. The local authority also submitted that E and SL were members of the mother&#8217;s household even though they remained living with short-term foster carers and thus that they too enjoyed diplomatic immunity. It was the local authority&#8217;s contention that, if all four children had the benefit of diplomatic immunity, that the court had no jurisdiction to make final care orders in respect of these children. </p>

With respect to the legal issues, D and S submitted that the mother&#8217;s diplomatic immunity had not come to an end on 31 January 2018 because the &#8220;reasonable period&#8221; extended to the period necessary to participate in these proceedings and to maintain any contact needed to ensure that any order was effective.

If the mother were to return to X, the Children&#8217;s Guardian supported a final care order being made on a plan for S to return to foster care.

Following oral submissions on the legal issues in this case, Mr Momtaz QC abandoned his reliance on the submission that the mother was permanently resident in this jurisdiction.

It was submitted that the certificate issued on 8 February 2018 was conclusive proof of the facts therein stated. The mother&#8217;s diplomatic immunities and privileges had expired on 31 January 2018 as certified. If the court were to consider that the reasonableness of the period to be allowed was a matter for the court to assess in the circumstances of a particular case, the Secretary of State submitted that 31 days was a reasonable period as a normal policy in the particular circumstances of this case in that it was a sufficient period to conclude matters arising from the mother&#8217;s diplomatic appointment. The skeleton argument submitted by the Secretary of State also contended that, when the children moved to foster placements in November 2016, they ceased to be part of the mother&#8217;s household. D and S, both of whom had returned to the mother&#8217;s household, had thus regained the same status in this jurisdiction as that enjoyed by the mother. The position of E and SL was different as they had remained in foster care throughout. The Secretary of State submitted that diplomatic immunity was irrelevant to the court&#8217;s power to make final care orders as neither the mother nor any of the children had enjoyed any diplomatic immunity or privileges since, at the very latest, 31 January 2018. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">In this case however the dispute concerned what was a reasonable period within which to bring the mother&#8217;s diplomatic rights and privileges to an end. That was different to a dispute, for example, about the date upon which a diplomat arrived or took up his/her diplomatic functions or the date at which those functions came to an end. I find that the language of the February certificate as set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 did not describe facts alone. Rather it set out what was a mixed question of fact and law: the fact being the date the diplomatic rights and privileges of the mother terminated but that fact being dependent upon what the UK Government considered to be reasonable within Article 39(2) of the VCDR. Mr Verdirame on behalf of the FCO conceded that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">reasonableness</span>&#8221; was not a question of fact but rather an interpretive question of law. He was, in my view, right to make that concession. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1964/81" uk:canonical="1964 c. 81" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 1964 Act</ref> does not set out a precise time limit for the termination of diplomatic rights and privileges as is the case for example in Switzerland (6 months) or Venezuela (one month).

Fundamental to its operation was the distinction, which runs through the whole instrument, between those immunities which were limited to acts performed in the course of a protected person&#8217;s functions as a member or employee of the mission, and those which were not. The distinction was fundamental because what an agent of a diplomatic mission did in the course of his official functions was done on behalf of the sending state. By comparison, the acts which an agent of the diplomatic mission did in a personal or non-official capacity were not acts of the state which employed him.  They were acts in respect of which any immunity conferred on him could be justified only on the practical ground that his exposure to civil or criminal proceedings in the receiving state, irrespective of the justice of the underlying allegation, was liable to impede the functions of the mission to which she/he was attached. </p>

The purpose of Article 37(2) was to ensure that family units were protected by diplomatic immunity. The commentary in Denza at page 238 noted that the extension of immunities and privileges to spouses and families had been long established and that families were essentially seen as extensions of the persons of diplomats themselves. Denza noted that the spouse of a diplomat not legally separated from him or her was universally accepted as a member of the family as were children below the age of majority. I find that the objective behind Article 37(2) would be undermined if an interim care order or any other form of interim order could deprive some family members of diplomatic immunity. It is axiomatic that, when interim care orders are made on a plan for children to remain in foster care, no final conclusions will have been reached as to whether or not the children should be reunited with their mother. </p>

The father and his family were accepted as having no immunity from care proceedings, which were civil proceedings, provided that they related to acts performed outside the course of the duties of the father. It was not suggested the beating and bruising of the child came within the scope of the duties of the father, and on this basis the court found the father, mother, and the child had no immunity from family proceedings and so continued the interim care order with the child being placed in foster care. Nothing in that decision suggested that the child lost her diplomatic rights and privileges by reason either of being the subject of an interim care order and/or being placed with foster parents [see paragraph 17]. </p>

I observe that the original submission made by the FCO would have led to illogical outcomes at different points in the proceedings for some of the children with whom I am concerned. Thus, D was now part of the mother&#8217;s household as he was living with her and was dependent. He was said to have lost his status when placed pursuant to s.20 but then presumably regained it when he returned to live with his mother in July 2017. Likewise, E and SL were said to have lost their status in November 2016 though at that stage they were not the subjects of interim care orders and remained dependent upon the mother by reason of her consent to s.20 accommodation. S was said to have lost his status in November 2016 when he was accommodated and was said to have regained it when he returned to live with his mother in December 2017 even though he remained the subject of an interim care order. The FCO&#8217;s initial analysis which focused solely on dependence/co-residence of minor children ran the risk of creating haphazard and inconsistent outcomes given what were short lived changes in the children&#8217;s circumstances.  </p>

In that case there was little argument regarding enforcement and, in consequence, I do not regard the remarks made about the power of enforcement as determinative of the issue. It would be surprising in my view if the provisions of Article 37(2) permitted proceedings to be brought but did not also permit consequent orders to be enforced. It would also be contrary to the rule of law for a court to determine a person&#8217;s legal rights and then not enforce them. Principles such as the rule of law are well recognised in international law and are relevant, in my view, when interpreting the provisions of Article 37(2).

However, that right would be illusory if a contracting state&#8217;s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Art.6(1) should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious - without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions. To construe Art.6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would indeed be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the contracting states undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the &#8220;trial&#8221; for the purposes of Art.6.&#8221; </span></p>

That Article also extends to members of the administrative and technical staff of a mission who do not enjoy immunity for acts performed outside the course of their duties. It is plain in this case that the mother&#8217;s behaviour towards her children was not within the course of her duties as a member of the administrative and technical staff of X High Commission. There was nothing in Article 31(1)(c) which prevented the enforcement of care orders in public law proceedings and the enforcement of such orders would, in my analysis, also be compatible with Article 29 which provides for the inviolability of the person of the diplomatic agent who shall not be liable to any form of arrest or detention.   </p>

To summarise, the children had suffered significant physical and emotional harm as a result of the mother having smacked and slapped all of them; having hit all of the children with a belt using up two or three strikes; having thrown a shoe at D&#8217;s head causing injury; having shouted at D and threatening to send him to X if he did not behave and thereby scaring him; and having threatened to cut D&#8217;s hair as a punishment. That abusive behaviour towards the children was to be addressed by the mother engaging in therapeutic work, a detailed programme of which had been endorsed by me in my judgment. At that time, the mother had expressed a willingness to commit herself to the therapeutic work required. It is important to bear the above in mind when assessing the situation now. </p>

The issue of that certificate rendered the mother&#8217;s return to X a probability which, in my view, cannot sensibly be ignored. A return to X was not an outcome desired by any of the children or indeed by the mother. She told me in her evidence she would feel under an obligation to accept recall to X as she was a serving member of the armed services of that country. If she did not return when ordered to do so, her already limited salary would be forfeit and she would have no practical means of supporting herself either in this jurisdiction or in X.

It was her opinion that the risk of physical chastisement had substantially reduced but had not disappeared altogether. As far as the issue of emotional harm was concerned, the mother needed to apologise to the children for her behaviour so that the children accepted this and she needed to work upon her empathy and understanding of the children&#8217;s perspective. </p>

The work that was required of the mother to prevent future emotional harm to the children was the very basic minimum and the timescale required should be measured in months rather than weeks.

Having thought very carefully about this issue, I have concluded that there is insufficient evidence for me to justify relying on those matters as establishing a risk to the children if they returned to the care of their mother. I do so for the following reasons. First, I can only take into account risks deriving from past facts proved on the balance of probability. Most of the issues relied upon in respect of a return to X have not been so proved. Second, though I can take account of the fact that there are areas of X which are dangerous, the mother&#8217;s evidence was that she was likely to return to a city in the centre of a large safe area where she had a part-completed property and where she would be close to other family members. Her statements and those of the children about their fears of return were not proof of the existence of dangers, the magnitude of which would rule out either the return of the children to the care of their mother or indeed the entire family&#8217;s return to X. The strong wish of all the family was to remain in the UK and I cannot disregard the influence that this desire may have had upon the stated fears of the mother and the children about the situation in X. </p>

Dr Van Rooyen now recommended a scaled-down rehabilitative plan of work based on what she considered to be a substantial reduction in the risk of physical harm posed by the mother to the children and on the positive changes made by the mother since October 2017. Her view was supported by events on the ground. Thus, D had not reported incidents of physical abuse by the mother since his return home though it was clear that he continued to test parental boundaries. I do not regard the mother&#8217;s attempts to try and impose on D a timely return home at night as coming close to anything amounting to abusive behaviour. S had also </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0in">given no indication that he had been subject to physical abuse by the mother since his return home. By all accounts, S had settled well since returning to his mother&#8217;s care and was very clear that he wished to remain with her in the UK. The contact between the girls and their mother which had taken place in the family home was of a better quality and considerably more relaxed than contact in the contact centre. I note that E was not enthusiastic about going into the family home when the first opportunity for contact at home unexpectedly arose when she was with the social worker. Nevertheless, with encouragement and support, she went and contact was a success. Contact in the family home has become the normal venue. I also note that the mother had consistently said she would not use methods of physical chastisement in respect of her children. These positive changes have taken place in circumstances of enormous stress for the mother. Whilst the Children&#8217;s Guardian drew my attention to the mother&#8217;s minimisation of matters agreed in the threshold document, I was not persuaded that this significantly altered the risk of physical chastisement to the extent contended for by the Children&#8217;s Guardian. Those statements by the mother had to be placed in context and had to be evaluated in the light of the mother&#8217;s current behaviour. As I have indicated, events in the family home indicated positive change despite great personal stress for the mother.  </p>

I have taken into account the evidence of Dr Van Rooyen who noted that this issue was not insurmountable but that it did require the mother to think about the effect of what she had said and done. Though E remained determined to resist a return home, Dr Van Rooyen was of the opinion that this might change once she became more familiar with the family home and the mother was meaningfully able to validate her experiences. In that context Dr Van Rooyen was clear that E&#8217;s willingness to have joint therapeutic sessions with her mother was a big step forward. Finally, the risk to the children from the mother&#8217;s tendency to criticise them about matters such as hairstyle and weight, their performance of household chores and late nights or absences from the family home, was on the evidence before me a risk which appeared to be reducing and which, in any event, I find was not of such significance to amount to a ground in itself for the children&#8217;s separation from their mother&#8217;s care. </p>

She accepted she had not engaged, to the extent desired, in the parenting work endorsed in my October 2017 judgment. I acknowledge the very significant strain on the mother occasioned by (a) her recall by the President of X in October 2017 (that date being the date the mother was informed of the same though it is different from the date upon which the recall notice was signed); (b) her abandonment both emotionally and financially by her husband, the father of the three younger children; (c) the financial stresses caused by a reduction in her wages in late 2017 arising from her recall; (d) the news of the termination of her diplomatic status set out in the February 2018 certificate from the FCO; and (e) the ongoing strain of the care proceedings. Additionally, I have taken into account the shift in the mother&#8217;s attitude and the behavioural changes I have highlighted above. It was my overall assessment that, should the legal proceedings come to an end, the mother would be both willing and able to undertake work for the benefit of the children and that such work was more likely than not to have a positive outcome. That assessment accorded with the expert evidence of Dr Van Rooyen and with the assessment of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, both of whom expressed a degree of optimism that the mother was capable of parenting the children safely. Though the professionals told me that, ideally, there should be a longer timescale for both parenting work and rehabilitation, I have concluded that, whatever work can be undertaken within this jurisdiction, the risk of future physical and emotional harm will be thereby reduced.  </p>

Those wishes and feelings fell to be assessed with an eye as to whether the children had a full understanding of what the immediate, medium and long term future might hold for them, having regard to the realistic options for their care. E&#8217;s letter to me was expressed in stark terms and, if I were to give effect to the wishes set out therein, that would be to the exclusion of her mother for the remainder of her childhood and to the exclusion of her country and her culture. I must also bear in mind the evidence before me from E&#8217;s foster carer that E had become accustomed to a different material lifestyle to the extent that it had influenced her views about returning to the care of her mother. Likewise, S&#8217;s stated wish to remain in the UK irrespective of whether his mother could do so was at odds with his strong desire to live with his mother even if he were to be the subject of a final care order. Finally, SL&#8217;s wish to return to the care of her mother was simply expressed in her letter though I was told in the Children&#8217;s Guardian&#8217;s report that her wishes in this regard had fluctuated.  </p>

Contact with the mother would be via telephone or Skype and the likelihood of the mother being able to have direct contact with the children was remote. Not only would the mother have to surmount the financial hurdle of paying for flights to and accommodation in the UK in order to exercise contact but she would also have to surmount a significant immigration hurdle in order to gain entry to the UK. The potential separation of the three younger children from their mother was described by Dr Van Rooyen as a major loss akin to a bereavement. When I asked Dr Van Rooyen where the balance lay between the children remaining in foster care and the children returning to the care of their mother even if she were unable to do all the work which was recommended, Dr Van Rooyen answered &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it&#8217;s a </span></p>

Additionally, it appeared probable because of the difficulty in obtaining a placement for all three of the younger children together that the children would not be able to live together for the remainder of their childhood. Furthermore, maintenance of the children&#8217;s cultural roots would be very difficult in these circumstances and the children would almost certainly lose any small chance of having a meaningful relationship with their father who, on the evidence before me, was an important figure for all of them. Finally, the children would remain in local authority care and be subject to the known risks of such an outcome, for example, the breakdown of foster homes. I also observe that, if D had to leave the UK with his mother, the children&#8217;s relationship with him would be subject to similar stresses as that with their mother. </p>

That rehabilitation would occur by the time the mother was required to return to X even if all the therapeutic work envisaged had not been completed. This option was also not risk-free given the identified need for the mother and the children to have therapeutic support with a view to rehabilitation over a desirably longer period of time.

I cannot allow short-term difficulties to dictate the outcome for these children in the medium to long-term unless I am satisfied that those difficulties are truly insurmountable and inconsistent with the paramountcy of the children&#8217;s welfare.

It was founded on an evidential basis about the risks in X which was not established to the relevant standard of proof and it represented, on one view, the making of an order which had the impermissible effect of depriving the Secretary of State for the Home Department of her power to remove S from the UK. As contended for by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, final care orders with a contingency plan for long-term foster care which precluded the return of all three children to X were also, in my view, impermissible for the same reasons. </p>

Her evidence focused on the negatives in the relationship between the mother and children rather than attempting to balance these against the positive changes achieved by the mother during the entirety of the legal process. In coming to this conclusion, I do not accept all of the criticisms made of the Children&#8217;s Guardian by Miss McKenna though I was persuaded by her overall submission that I should be circumspect about accepting the recommendations made by the Children&#8217;s Guardian. </p>

In all the circumstances, I have decided that making no order would be better for the children than making any form of public law order. </p>

The parties may wish to seek from the Secretary of State for the Home Department an extension of the time permitted to the mother and children to remain in this jurisdiction in order that this work might be completed. It is not a matter which is within the gift of this court. </p>
