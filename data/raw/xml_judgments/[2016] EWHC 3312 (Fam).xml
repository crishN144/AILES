	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are before the court two linked applications brought under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref></span>.  The first application in time (10 December 2015) was filed by two children, namely GD, a girl now aged 9, and BD, a boy now aged 4.  The second application (18 December 2015) was filed by their mother (MD).  In each case the Claimants seek awards of damages and declarations.  The claims arise from the conduct of two public authorities, Wakefield Metropolitan District Council (hereafter &#8220;the Local Authority&#8221;) and West Yorkshire Police, in the context of public law proceedings under <span style="font-style:italic">Part IV</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span> between February and November 2015.  In each case the claims for damages have been agreed &#8211; with the public authorities each agreeing to pay one-half of the agreed sum: &#163;10,000 for the mother, and (subject to the court&#8217;s approval) &#163;5,000 for each child.  Significant concessions have been made by both authorities since the proceedings began, and these in large measure establish the grounds for the declarations.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Additional to the formal concessions, the Local Authority has also sent a full letter of apology to the mother (dated 28 June 2016).  In that letter, the Local Authority acknowledges that the allegations which it made in the proceedings against the mother, namely that she was a sexual risk to her children as a result of having perpetrated gross sexual act on her daughter, were &#8220;horrendous&#8221;; the authority confirms that it accepts &#8220;without reservation&#8221; that MD did not abuse her daughter or allow her daughter to be abused by the father.  I do not regard it as appropriate to annex this letter to the judgment, but note its contents.  The Chief Constable of the West Yorkshire Police has openly apologised to the Claimants (see Annex B [11] below).</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Inevitably, some issues of fact remained unresolved notwithstanding the significant degree of concession; the Claimants invited me to try those issues.   The Local Authority and the West Yorkshire Police opposed that course, arguing that they had made sufficient concessions that a hearing was not required.  I ruled on 20 July (at the final Case Management Hearing) that the issues outstanding between the parties raised questions of importance justifying enquiry by the court; these are issues of substance to the parties in the case and matters of wider importance potentially to other cases. I regarded it as just, appropriate and proportionate for court time to be allocated to the determination of the declarations sought by the mother and the children that remained in dispute. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I heard evidence from DS Hudson (formerly of the West Yorkshire Police Child Sexual Exploitation and Abusive Image Unit, now retired), DFI (a Digital Forensic Investigator employed by the West Yorkshire Police), DI Walker (West Yorkshire Police, supervisor of DS Hudson), Andrew Garthwaite (Legal Services, West Yorkshire Police), SW1 (social worker), SW2 (team manager, Joint Investigation Team), Ms Anne McMullan (Local Authority solicitor), and Ian Shiels (barrister instructed by the Local Authority).  I read statements of evidence filed in these proceedings, a number of selected documents filed in the public law proceedings, extensive extracts of the 400-pages of transcripts of evidence from the final hearing of the public law proceedings in November 2015, and copies of various e-mails and correspondence generated during the investigation.  The documentary material filled six lever arch files.  No judgment writing time was available at the end of the hearing; this has, I regret, contributed to the delay in producing this judgment. I recognise that this has been all the more frustrating for the parties given that the final judgment in the substantive proceedings, to be delivered by HHJ Anderson who has conducted the <span style="font-style:italic">Part IV <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span> proceedings, awaits the conclusion of this part of the case.</p>

Two computers and a number of other electronic items were seized for forensic examination; those devices, it was revealed, contained nearly 5,000 indecent images and videos of children, including:</p>

DS Hudson in liaison with his colleagues in the imaging unit commissioned the creation of a superimposition montage which allowed the picture of Girl Y to be overlaid on a picture of GD; this appeared to confirm their lay view.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Some ten months later, on 25 February 2015, DS Hudson shared the information which the police had gathered with representatives of children&#8217;s services at Wakefield MDC.  The social worker who attended the relevant strategy meeting noted that DS Hudson declared himself to be &#8220;90%&#8221; sure that the woman in the video was MD; he was later to say (same source) that he considered that the child in the still image was GD &#8220;to a 99% probability&#8221;.  This evidence (involving the percentages) infiltrated other discussions, and were attributed to DS Hudson.  DS Hudson was later to deny having used percentages as recorded, but having heard from SW1 and DS Hudson, I reject his denial; I am satisfied that this statement, and the percentages referred to, reflected his actual view of the probability of MD and GD being captured in the images, and that he expressed himself in this way.  Later that afternoon, DS Hudson and SW1 (social worker) attended the family home; DS Hudson arrested MD and FD on suspicion of assaulting a girl under the age of 13, and of possession of multiple indecent images of children. The West Yorkshire Police exercised powers of protection and the children, GD and BD, were placed in foster care; on the following day, the Local Authority commenced care proceedings under <span style="font-style:italic">Part IV </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span>.</p>

On that date, DS Hudson informed the social workers that the police intended to conduct an interview with GD under the 2011 <span style="font-style:italic">Achieving Best Evidence</span> (&#8220;ABE&#8221;) Guidance, and that until that time, no contact should be facilitated between the children and their parents. (I interpolate here to observe that it was only on 25 June 2015 that DS Hudson confirmed that the police would not in fact conduct such an ABE interview, as GD had by then been excluded as Girl Y on facial mapping evidence; that did not however deter the Local Authority who conducted such an interview in September &#8211; see below).  </p>

This examination was arranged by DS Hudson and facilitated by the social worker. Regrettably, there had been insufficient co-ordination between the investigating and safeguarding authorities, and three days later GD was subjected to a further medical examination as a Looked After Child (see below, under &#8216;Lessons to be Learned&#8217; at [131](xvii) below). The children at this time, it is acknowledged, were expressing very considerable distress at their separation from their parents and were requesting to see them; there had been no contact since 25 February 2015.  On the same day (6 March), the police requested LGC Forensics (the international life sciences measurement and testing company) to undertake a facial mapping comparison of the footage/picture identified in [12](i)/(ii) above.</p>

(This photograph was later shown to have been taken on a Kodak camera, and is hereafter referred to in this judgment as the &#8216;Kodak photograph&#8217;).

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 31 March 2015 Ms Jacqueline Pestell of LGC Forensics contacted DS Hudson, and gave him an oral report of the results of the facial mapping exercise; it is a little unclear precisely what was said. Ms Pestell maintains that she advised DS Hudson over the phone that MD could be &#8220;eliminated&#8221; as the woman in the video; this indeed was the account given by DS Hudson in his first statement in these proceedings. LGC&#8217;s internal note refers to the differences observed in the images, making them &#8220;unreconcilable&#8221; (sic).  DS Hudson was advised in the same call that MD&#8217;s sister was a better match. In a later written statement in these proceedings DS Hudson doubted that the word &#8216;eliminated&#8217; had in fact been used but confirmed that he was advised that the sister was a better suspect, and that in the circumstances there was little if any prospect of pursuing charges against MD. It is in fact formally conceded now that the police treated MD as being &#8216;eliminated&#8217; from this<span style="font-style:italic"/>the time (see Defence filed on behalf of West Yorkshire Police, and see Annex B [2] below)).  Interestingly, in oral evidence, DS Hudson repeatedly used the word &#8216;eliminated&#8217; to describe the effect of the information he had been given at this stage, and on the balance of probabilities I am satisfied that this is indeed what he was told by LGC. </p>

At a court hearing convened on 7 April 2015, it is common ground that the West Yorkshire Police and the Local Authority informed the court that there was now a &#8216;better suspect&#8217; than the mother, but neither (it appears) went so far as to say that the mother had been eliminated.  The Local Authority of course did not know that this was the view of LGC Forensics.</p>

West Yorkshire Police concede that by this time, the Local Authority were still not aware that the mother had been &#8216;eliminated&#8217; on expert analysis, and nor was Moylan J when he made his further order for disclosure.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By 4 June 2015, LGC Forensics had also excluded MD&#8217;s sister as Woman X. West Yorkshire Police informed the Local Authority of this. However, when the social worker (SW1) spoke with an officer of the West Yorkshire Police on 8 June, she was advised that the police were still in some doubt about the evidence and could not confirm that no criminal charges would arise as a result of these images; on the following day, DS Hudson wrote to the social worker in these terms: &#8220;the results back from the Forensic Company has not been able to confirm the identity of [MD] or [her sister]&#8221; as Woman X (this phrase did not in my view faithfully reflect what DS Hudson had been told), adding that the mapping work in relation to GD/Girl Y had not yet concluded.  MD recalls that at this point she was simply advised that the facial mapping exercise had proved &#8220;inconclusive&#8221;, not that she had been eliminated.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 June, there was a major development in the police investigation.  DFI, one of the experts in the Digital Forensic Department working on an unrelated investigation, located a video recording of approximately eight minutes&#8217; duration, of which the short video of Woman X (which had been the focus of enquiry in this investigation, identified in [12](i) above) was clearly an extract; the longer (eight minute) video showed clearly the identities of those participating in the recorded activity, and revealed beyond question that MD was not Woman X. It was further clear (from incidental detail in the footage) that the video had been recorded in the United States of America, not in West Yorkshire. DFI e-mailed DS Hudson asking him to call, as he has &#8220;information about [Woman X]&#8221;. DS Hudson was (it is agreed) on leave on that day and it appears that he did not in fact make the call on that day; it is not clear when DS Hudson returned the telephone call to DFI, but I am satisfied (on DS Hudson&#8217;s own evidence) that it was not long after DS Hudson&#8217;s return from leave on 22 June.   In that call, I find that DFI gave DS Hudson sufficient detail about the longer video for him to know that MD was definitively not Woman X.  From that point on, he told me that it was &#8220;cast iron&#8221; that MD was exonerated and he was then fixed with this knowledge.</p>

On 15 June 2015 the West Yorkshire Police received the written report from LGC Forensics which confirmed beyond question that MD was not Woman X. The report further confirmed that GD was not Girl Y, the child in the still image ([12](ii) above).  </p>

The contents of the LGC report were not shared with the mother for more than two more weeks (9 July) &#8211; see [27] below).

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 9 July, the parents were interviewed by the West Yorkshire Police for the second time; both denied possession of the indecent images, and the mother denied recently destroying the computer hard-drive (per the Kodak photograph). As planned, the still image of Girl Y was put to the parents, who each in turn disputed that it was GD.  Following the interview, the mother (MD) was eliminated from the investigation (a point which was confirmed in an e-mail of the same date to the social workers: &#8220;[MD] has now been eliminated from the investigation&#8221;), whereas the father (FD) was charged with six sample counts of making indecent images of children.  On the same day, the West Yorkshire Police provided the 40-page and detailed LGC Forensic report to all parties; this confirmed that there was &#8220;no support&#8221; for the contention that MD was Woman X, nor that GD was Girl Y.  The West Yorkshire Police further disclosed the image of MD allegedly destroying the computer hard drive. At court on the following day, Andrew Garthwaite, solicitor for the West Yorkshire Police recounted that &#8220;the Police position that the female in the video was not [MD] was clearly stated&#8230;&#8221;; he says that he spoke with Ian Shiels at court, who in turn indicated his wish to view the short video. This arose because Mr. Shiels detected some lack of confidence in the expert report among those who had commissioned it; Mr Garthwaite acknowledges that at that time he may well have said to Mr Shiels that he recognised the similarities between Woman X and MD and &#8220;couldn&#8217;t preclude the possibility that another facial mapping exercise might generate different findings&#8221;. Ms McMullan told me that Mr Shiels had reported to her an air of scepticism among the advocates about the reliability of the facial mapping report. In that regard, Mr Shiels followed up the discussions at court with an e-mail to Ms McMullan the following day in these terms:</p>

His e-mail further alluded to the difference in standard of proof between the criminal and civil processes, and the need to look at the primary evidence and not be &#8220;led entirely by expert opinion, which need not necessarily be right&#8221;. He acknowledged that the conclusion of the LGC Forensics report was &#8220;a problem&#8221; but not &#8220;necessarily an insuperable one&#8221;.</p>

DS Hudson told me in evidence that he did not in fact go to the forensics laboratory to view it on that day on account of &#8220;operational commitments&#8221;, but only viewed the longer video a month later on 24 August. DS Hudson told the court in November 2015 that he believed he had viewed the longer video in or around June or soon after 23 July 2015.  The evidence of DFI was that DS Hudson viewed the longer video &#8220;around&#8221; June/July, but at the latest &#8220;the first part of August&#8221;.  Later, within the evidence filed in these proceedings, DFI went some way to confirming DS Hudson&#8217;s account that he did not view the longer video until 24 August (linking it with recalling having e-mailed him in relation to a &#8216;personal matter&#8217;), though acknowledged that he only &#8220;vaguely remembers&#8221; the events.  It is not material to establish precisely when DS Hudson viewed the longer video; I cannot find on the evidence that he did in fact view it before 24 August.  As I have said earlier (see [24] above), he was fixed with the knowledge of the mother&#8217;s certain innocence by the end of June 2015.  On my reading of the e-mail traffic, this is the only e-mail passing between DS Hudson and Mr Garthwaite about the second (longer) video (see also [99] below). Mr. Garthwaite reports that he did not appreciate the significance of the second (longer) video at this time. </p>

To recap, the Local Authority knew of the conclusions of the LGC Forensics report by this stage, but not of the existence (let alone the significance) of the longer video.  The note of the manager reflects inaccurately that &#8220;The woman [on the video] is believed to be mum (90% certainty <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">following facial recognition</span>)&#8221;; it is not clear to me whether that information had been incorrectly understood by the social work team or whether the note of the conversation is inaccurate.

She believed that DS Hudson would obtain further information from DFI about the relevance of America, and revert to her. Ms McMullan maintains that had she known, or been advised, that the second video existed, that it originated in America and that MD was certainly not the woman in the short video: (a) the local authority would not have asked to view, let alone actually view, the short video, and (b) the course of the case would have been radically altered.</p>

Mr Shiels believes that it would have been perfectly plain to DS Hudson from the discussion at the conference that the Local Authority was going to maintain its case (set out in the schedule &#8211; see [31] above) that MD was Woman X; accordingly, Mr. Shiels felt that the video was pivotal in being able to prove that fact, notwithstanding the expert report from LGC Forensics. Mr Shiels did not understand from DS Hudson&#8217;s comments that the video had actually been filmed in America (as in fact is proven to be the case) but wondered whether the reference to America was to a shared computer file with an American partner.  He recalls the reference to the watch, and to DS Hudson confirming that the police search of the family home had not produced the item.

This, I find, was not correct; quite apart from anything else, the second (longer) video, which DS Hudson had seen only three days earlier, had not been disclosed. On 8 September, DS Hudson met with SW1 and her team manager in order to discuss the conduct of a proposed ABE interview with GD. Following that meeting, SW1 wrote to Ms McMullan who in turn wrote to Mr Shiels asking for his advice on the ABE interview; specifically, she wanted to know whether SW1 could show GD picture stills of herself alongside a pixelated photograph of the abused child (Girl Y) who was thought to be GD (reference [12(ii)] above).  Ms McMullan was explicit about the purpose of this exercise: </p>

The mother&#8217;s solicitor indicated her intention to make an application for permission to instruct an expert to assist with the dating of the Kodak photograph. This request was forwarded to Mr Shiels. It is a matter of record that no response was ever received to this e-mail request.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 September, Mr Shiels wrote to Ms McMullan chasing the witness statement from DS Hudson (see [38] above). Mr Shiels identified a number of specific points which he wished DS Hudson to cover in the statement: namely, that Woman X was wearing a ring on the same finger of her right hand as MD; the unusual feature of the face of the abuser being seen on the video; the fact that the house was cleaned out in both police searches, and that the photo of the mother destroying computer discs can only have been taken or stored between 2014 and 2015; the particular hair style of the child (i.e. similar to GD) . It is to be noted that there is no recorded request for a <span style="font-style:italic">general</span> statement about the investigation, nor for any evidence which <span style="font-style:italic">pointed away</span> from the mother&#8217;s culpability, nor was there reference to the fact that the watch seen on the video was not found in the house. Mr Shiels told me that he was not purporting to advise on the overall content of the statement, and was not advising that anything should be omitted, but simply giving pointers as to what should be included. Ms McMullan conveyed the request to DS Hudson.  When a short first draft of this statement was later produced, it was returned to DS Hudson by Ms McMullan with a request that further identified information be included; Ms McMullan drafted two suggested paragraphs for DS Hudson to consider (&#8220;only of course if completely agreed by you&#8221;). Ms McMullan&#8217;s draft included the statement that the still image of Girl Y &#8220;bore a striking resemblance to the daughter of [MD]&#8221;.  He incorporated those paragraphs and signed the statement. In its completed form, the written evidence from DS Hudson, the Officer in the Case, extended to no more than one-half of a side of A4, reflecting only those matters on which he had been specifically asked to comment and no more. DS Hudson acknowledged that this was of course by no means a full account of the police investigation or of the evidence which been obtained; he said that he did not appreciate at that time that his statement would be used by the Local Authority to seek a finding that MD was Woman X and if that had been made known to him, he would have insisted on making the police view clear. Notably of course the statement is silent on the fact that, on any view, DS Hudson had viewed the longer video by then, and had certain and first-hand knowledge that MD was not Woman X.  He accepted that in providing such a limited statement he afforded the opportunity for the Local Authority case to be progressed in the way that it was.</p>

Mr. Shiels replied later the same day. He rightly in my view indicated that it was right for the ABE&#8211;trained interviewers to make decisions about the interview; however, he professed himself &#8220;not so sure&#8221; that GD should be asked to confirm that the pixelated photograph was of her, but considered that general questions about her clothing, whether she had ever had a photograph of that nature taken of herself, and whether she had ever seen photographs like that would be permissible.</p>

Mr Garthwaite had passed on the request by the mother&#8217;s legal team to view the short video; DFI raised a concern about this to his colleagues, saying:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">DS Hudson asked for legal advice about the position from Mr Garthwaite who told me at this hearing that he did not appreciate until 19 November the relevance of the second (longer) video. On the basis that an order would be sought by the parties for permission to view the video, and that disclaimers would be sought, arrangements were made for the mother and her legal team to view the short video.   The mother and her legal team viewed the video on 12 October. There later followed a request by the Children&#8217;s Guardian to view the video; this provoked an e-mail from DS Hudson to Mr Garthwaite:</p>

Now we are being asked to show this video to [GD]&#8217;s solicitor and her Guardian; we are being asked to show a Level B Child Abuse video to her Guardian. Why? What protection is in place should her Guardian react in a negative way to this abuse video?  It was agreed to show the video to [MD] and her counsel on the basis that counsel has dealt with these issues in the past and [MD] had seen the video in interview. Please confirm that the police and officers involved will have no repercussions in this matter.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the same day (17 September), DFI, responding to an internal request for information arising from the mother&#8217;s solicitor&#8217;s request (above), confirmed to DS Hudson and Mr. Garthwaite that the Kodak photograph was dated 11/03/2009, and that the date would have been recorded as per the device settings on the camera, so (in the view of the police) would be inherently unreliable. Although the images were shown as being created on the computer systems in late 2014, they in fact had a modified date of 24/07/11.  This information was not supplied to the Local Authority or to the parties, not even when, on the following day the mother formally sought and obtained permission to instruct her own expert to advise on the creation and dating of the Kodak photograph.   Later on the same day, DFI confirmed by e-mail to DS Hudson and Mr Garthwaite that the short video (which the mother&#8217;s solicitor had requested to see) did not show either MD nor GD, &#8220;albeit that the female in the video does have a resemblance to MD&#8221;. DS Hudson commented, in a separate e-mail on the same day, that &#8220;what we have is footage of a sex act with a woman who has a remarkable likeness to [MD] &#8230; looks like [FD] has found the perfect likeness of his partner&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Also on the same day, 17 September, SW1 and a colleague undertook the ABE interview of GD. SW1 had no training or experience in ABE interviewing; her colleague had been trained but had never undertaken such an interview. The interview is in my judgment (I have read the transcript) correspondingly clumsy and awkward; the questions are contrived and stilted, perhaps in part due to the fact that SW1, the untrained interviewer, took the lead in asking the majority of the questions.   GD was shown photographs and asked where they came from; she was told that they were the photographs from a family photo album.  She said that she did not remember any of the photos, but later recalls some (but not the photo which was not of her).  SW1 later told HHJ Anderson that she did not think it had been appropriate to show the photograph of Girl Y to GD, but she had been advised she had to do it; she accepts that she told GD that the photo was from a &#8220;family album&#8221; and although this was not true, she did not intend it to be misleading.  This was also the gist of her evidence before me.  I deal with the ABE interview more fully later.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, on 17 September, a further meeting took place between DS Hudson, Ms McMullan and Mr Shiels, the purpose of which was for DS Hudson to show the Local Authority legal team the superimposition montage of photographs of GD created earlier in the year. In view of the clearly worded report from LGC Forensics, I was left wondering why this exercise was considered to be useful.  Mr Shiels considered the montage to have probative value in identifying GD as Girl Y (&#8220;potentially good supporting evidence&#8221;), and requested that it be disclosed to the other parties to the proceedings; Mr Shiels indicated that he wished to use it to challenge the evidence of LGC Forensics. Ms McMullan did not share Mr Shiels&#8217; view of the value of this piece of evidence; she accepted that she was asked by Mr. Shiels to disclose the montage but accepts that she did not do so, having &#8220;overlooked&#8221; the request.   She concedes that this was her fault and accepted responsibility for the delay in disclosing this evidence to the other parties.  I do not find that the failure to disclose the montage was deliberate.  It was, I accept, an oversight.</p>

I learned a little of the evolution of the report at the hearing. It passed through at least two editorial hands (the team manager and the Local Authority lawyer) before being filed. Ms McMullan was the final editor and included in the report a number of new sentences.  She said that she asked SW1 to check the statement before signing it, having earlier &#8220;knocked [it] around a bit&#8221;; SW1 told me that she did not check it carefully and only after its filing did she read it thoroughly, and then realised that words had been added with which she was not comfortable, importing views which she did not hold.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 21 October there was an advocates meeting, following which Mr Shiels sent an e-mail to Ms McMullan asking for questions to be put to DS Hudson, namely whether DFI could produce the evidence as to the provenance and date of the Kodak photograph, and whether he could provide any evidence as to how the video allegedly involving MD and the image allegedly of GD originated. These were important requests, which had been made before (9.9.2015).  Ms McMullan passed on Mr Shiels&#8217;s request to the police on the following day; Mr. Garthwaite sent a holding reply. On 23 October, at the IRH, HHJ Anderson made a further order for disclosure against West Yorkshire Police requiring them to produce any further evidence as to the origin and dates of the short video, the still image of Girl Y, and the hard disk photo. Ms McMullan chased the request for disclosure on 9 November; DS Hudson replied indicating that &#8220;there is no further evidence to submit&#8221;.  He now explains that he thought that Mr. Garthwaite had disclosed all of the relevant material by that time. This remark illustrates, in my finding, a lack of co-ordination within the West Yorkshire Police in relation to the lines of responsibility for disclosure issues.  Ms McMullan forwarded the information to the solicitors for the parties.  </p>

The Note, however, does not refer to the possible American origin of the video (about which Mr. Shiels had been reminded only two days earlier) nor the search in vain of the mother&#8217;s home for the watch seen on the video.  These were material omissions.  The Note referred to the superimposition montage.  Mr. Shiels plainly mistakenly believed that this had been disclosed by his solicitor, but it had not been (see above: [48] above). Indeed, no other party was aware of its existence.  The Local Authority asserted in this note that there was no &#8220;significant difference at all&#8221; between the image of the mother and the image of Woman X, and that &#8220;viewing the videotape suggests to the local authority that there is a very strong resemblance between the female in the video and the mother&#8221;.  It refers to the evidence of the expert from LGC Forensics as &#8220;questionable&#8221;, and GD being &#8220;defensive&#8221; in her ABE interview.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final hearing began before HHJ Anderson on 17 November; no evidence was called on the first day. Following discussions between the advocates, Mr. Shiels drafted questions for LGC Forensics to answer about the superimposition montage, namely (a) whether it had been seen before and (b) whether it caused the expert to alter her analysis.  As I discuss later, I find that these questions could and indeed should have been asked much earlier.  On 18 November, DS Hudson and DFI attended at court to give evidence. It appears that in the pre-hearing conference outside court, DFI informed Mr Shiels of information he had known since 10 June 2015, namely that the short video had originated in America, and was an extract of a longer video.  Mr. Shiels&#8217; account from his witness statement repays rehearsing in full:</p>

		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.05in">&#8220;I was not told that there was any other version of the video, or a &#8220;longer&#8221; video &#8230; I was very surprised to be told that the origin was clearly in America, rather than merely a possibility. I then asked if they were saying that the woman in the video was in fact probably not [MD].  [DFI] said this was so. I cannot recall if DS Hudson contributed anything to this.  If he did, he did not say much.  He did not dissent from what [DFI] told me. I immediately communicated this information to the other advocates and then to the court, withdrawing the Local Authority&#8217;s case that the mother was the woman in the video&#8230;. At no time prior to the 18 November had I been told of the longer video, the origin clearly being in America, and the certainty that the woman was not the mother. If I had known this at an earlier stage, I would immediately have taken the same action that I took at court and withdrawn that allegation against the mother.&#8221;</p>

At the conclusion of the second day, Mr. Shiels had invited the judge to allow the officer to be treated as a hostile witness; it was increasingly apparent that DS Hudson directly contradicted Mr. Shiels&#8217; personal recollection of events, and was casting blame for the lack of disclosure on others. When the hearing resumed on 23 November, Mr. Shiels indicated his intention to withdraw from the case.  He explained his position to HHJ Anderson thus:</p>

The temporary but total severance of the relationship between the children and their parents was a serious step at the point at which the children were removed from their parents&#8217; care; while there may have been sound reasons for this initially, while the police investigation was at an early stage, the Local Authority is right to concede that it should have done more to test the necessity of this suspension continuing for more than a day or so.

Two witness statements fell under scrutiny in this hearing: those of DS Hudson and SW1.  The preparation of the witness statement of DS Hudson was wholly unbecoming of a serious investigation such as this, fell well below ordinary standards of professionalism in its compilation, and the end result was a document which was neither fair nor balanced.  There is no or no material evidence that either Ms McMullan or Mr Shiels really addressed themselves to that issue. The Local Authority cannot escape the fact that the written request of DS Hudson to provide only evidence in his statement which was incriminating of the mother caused his contribution to be distorted and partial.  I understand and accept that Mr Shiels had addressed his mind only to reminding Ms McMullan of certain matters which ought to be included in the statement, and that his e-mail was </p>

SW1 asserted in the final version of her statement that that she agreed with the police view which had been initially expressed (in February 2015) that MD was the woman in the video, and that GD was Girl Y.  Of course SW1 had in fact expressed misgivings about this view in July.  There was no mention in this statement of the US origin of the video (though, in fairness, SW1 may not have known this fact at the time of signing her statement, though Ms McMullan did know), or of the fact that the police had searched the family home and found no evidence of the watch visible on the video.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, I question why an interview in the ABE format was taking place at all in September 2015, some seven months after the children were received into care; SW1 believed that GD &#8220;needed to tell her story&#8221;, but what story was it that she &#8220;needed&#8221; (or was being invited) to tell?  Insofar as it was appropriate at all, it was not properly prepared, and the questions asked of GD reveal that the interviewers were at sea; it is to be noted that &#8220;[a]<span style="font-family:'Bliss 2 Light';font-size:11.5pt;color:#000000"> well-conducted interview will only occur if appropriate planning has taken place.

It is further right for the Local Authority to concede that the photograph of Girl Y should never have been shown to GD. SW1 was wrong to mislead GD that the photographs were all from a &#8220;family album&#8221;; that was manifestly not so in relation to one of the pictures.  One of the lowest points of this blighted history was the act of showing GD an edited version of an illegal download of a child abuse victim lying on her back with her legs apart exposing her genital area (albeit pixelated) under an entirely false pretext that the interviewers believed it was her and that the photograph had been located in a family album.  I agree with the mother when she argues that it was &#8220;fundamentally wrong&#8221; for the Local Authority to interview GD in this way. Had the Children&#8217;s Guardian been aware that the interview was to be carried out in this way (and I am satisfied that he was not) he says that he would have &#8220;objected in the strongest terms&#8221;, and rightly so.</p>

There is no doubt that the interview itself would have been distressing to GD; the manner in which it was conducted was designed or intended, it seems to me, to produce evidence which falsely implicated the mother. If GD was &#8220;defensive&#8221; in interview (a point relied on by the Local Authority as part of its &#8220;wide canvas&#8221;) this is not entirely surprising. The Local Authority knew that GD was not Girl Y by this time and should never have proceeded in its investigation in this way.  I accept the Claimants&#8217; case that it was undignified and demeaning for this eight-year-old girl to be put through a formal interview process which was unnecessary and which sought to inveigle her into providing evidence to support a false allegation.</p>

They have maintained that the Local Authority legal team, Ms McMullan and Mr. Shiels, lost objectivity in their professional conduct in this case, and as a consequence focused on only those aspects of the case which were adverse to, or implicated, the parents, and not those parts which might serve to exonerate them.</p>

Had she undertaken her role with more attention to the detail of the case, I am sure that the US provenance of the video would have received greater prominence in her thinking.

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">For a complex case, it was regrettable that the key social worker (SW1) was so inexperienced; indeed, she had not dealt with a sexual abuse case before. She gave the appearance (in her evidence to me, which chimed with the transcript of her evidence before HHJ Anderson) of someone who was struggling with the case. I felt that she was probably rather impressionable, and could possibly be (or at least feel) pressurised by her seniors or others; she told HHJ Anderson that she was advised by her manager and the legal department that the Local Authority was going to take a particular line in the case, albeit that it did not accord with her view (see the quote from the e-mail at [33] above).  She described herself in that earlier hearing as &#8220;just part &#8230;I am the social worker part of the process&#8221;, and disputed that she had instructed the department &#8220;to seek findings&#8221;.   She said that she had not been party to any conversation about the obtaining of expert evidence to counter the LGC Forensics paper, although would have expected to be so.  The Guardian picked up this dynamic; he felt that SW1 had been &#8220;instructed&#8221; by her legal team to take the line she did in relation to the case, perhaps against her better judgment.  I concur with the Guardian&#8217;s analysis.</p>

The situation which arose in relation to this highlights vividly the lack of strategic leadership in the management of the joint investigation and in its relationship with the Local Authority, and the failure of Mr. Garthwaite (as the solicitor for the force) to gain an understanding of the significance of the evidence.</p>

Mr. Shiels&#8217; approach to the case he was instructed to present, reflected in his advice to his instructing solicitor, appears to me to have been more bullish than it was cautious; that is not a criticism as such, nor a mark of professional irregularity.  He was of course evaluating the case in the context (to which I have alluded above) of serious criminal offending within the family home; I consider that this backdrop may have influenced (perhaps to a disproportionate extent) his intention to seek serious findings against the mother which on the evidence were, objectively viewed, likely to be beyond his reach.  Central to Mr. Shiels&#8217; advice was that the LGC Forensics report may be wrong, and that there was much extraneous evidence (including the superimposition montage) which could knit together to establish a finding that MD was Woman X and that GD was Girl Y on the preponderance of probabilities.   While Mr. Shiels was entitled to the view that the expert evidence may indeed be wrong, and that it was in any event only part of the forensic picture, I discerned limited if any evidence on the papers before me that he had properly thought through how this might be presented to the court.

The suspension of all contact in the period immediately after removal was reasonable while the parents were being interviewed, but is harder to explain or justify once that immediate period post-arrest had passed.  The Local Authority of course had duties to promote contact (see [75] above). It was incumbent on the Local Authority and the police to review conscientiously, together, the enforced separation of the children from their parents after the point at which the police were informed that the mother was excluded from consideration as Woman X in the short video on 31 March 2015. By 12 June 2015, that picture was clear to the police at least; the report from LGC Forensics shortly thereafter confirmed this. </p>

I accept that there were residual concerns about the willingness of the mother to accept the culpability of the father for the downloading of multiple indecent images, and that this had implications for her ability to protect the children from the risk thus posed; those concerns may have justified a cautious approach to rehabilitation but would not have excluded this.  The fact is that no one in the Local Authority considered it, or had the chance to consider it, as it was forced to make key strategic decisions in ignorance of the true facts.  The First and Second Claimants contend (reference their Claim) that rehabilitation should have been considered and advanced &#8220;at least by 21 August 2015 if not sooner&#8221;.

Ms McMullan was entitled to describe it as trickery (reference 25 June 2015 e-mail), and it was wholly unfitting of a senior police officer.  The notion that a false identification of GD as Girl Y might justify an ABE interview of GD &#8220;to see if she can recall the incident&#8221; displayed no regard to the integrity of investigation, and was potentially abusive to GD herself.  The potentially corrupting impact on this investigation of these particular steps was compounded by the actions of the Local Authority, which by their social worker showed GD the photograph of Girl Y with much the same objective. These were, as I have earlier observed, low points in this investigation.  The adult parties and their lawyers in this case would be entitled to regard the viewing (in October 2015) of the video of grossly depraved sexual conduct between an adult female and an infant as worse or lower still &#8211; particularly, when it was known that the video had no relevance to this mother and this child.

If contentious issues arise, then Legal Services of the Police should be involved.  It should be clear in any request, and understood as a matter of common practice, that any statement of evidence must provide balanced and accurate information and not mislead by matters either included or omitted; any statement should include all matters which in the view of the District Safeguarding Inspector (and/or Legal Services, if involved) will assist the Family Court in reaching decisions in the best interests of a child, whether that is helpful or adverse to the particular case being advanced by the Local Authority; the statement should be prepared by the Local Authority solicitor.  The current policy of the West Yorkshire Police provides for the officer to be interviewed by a Local Authority representative (I would propose that this be a lawyer) in the presence of an Inspector (or higher ranking officer). This makes good sense.  It appears that DS Hudson was unaware of the policy at the time he prepared his statement; I understand that DI Walker has referred the matter to the Safeguarding Central Governance Unit in order that all officers involved in safeguarding work can be reminded of its contents;</p>

The Claimants are two children and their mother.   This judgment is delivered at the conclusion of a seven-day hearing held in Bradford.  The case has exposed serious and systemic flaws in the decision-making and information-sharing of a joint investigation involving West Yorkshire Police and Wakefield Metropolitan District Council.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 25 February 2015, two children &#8211; a girl (GD) then aged 7, and a boy (BD) then aged 2&#189; &#8211; were removed from their family home under police protection measures and placed in foster care; this followed the arrest of their parents on suspicion of involvement in the downloading and distribution of indecent images of children. On the 27 February 2015, the children were made the subjects of interim care orders in favour of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council (the &#8220;Local Authority&#8221;). In August 2015, their father (FD) pleaded guilty to 6 specimen counts relating to these offences, and was later sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  </p>

The police officer further believed (with 99% certainty) that GD had been photographed in a sexually provocative pose displaying her genitals, on a still image also found on the parents&#8217; computer (Girl Y).</p>

This was later confirmed in a written report from the forensic expert on 12 June 2015. The Police did not divulge this information to the Local Authority until 24 June, and not to the mother until 9 July 2015. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 June 2015, a second (longer) video recording was discovered by the West Yorkshire Police in the context of a different investigation, of which the first (short) video was clearly an excerpt. This was a crucial discovery.  This longer video showed: (a) that the film was recorded in the United State of America, (b) that the mother was definitively not Woman X, and that (c) that GD was definitively not the girl being abused.   This information was not shared with the Local Authority, nor with the Respondent parents, until the final hearing.  At a meeting on 21 August 2015 DS Hudson advised representatives of the Local Authority (its solicitor, Ms Anne McMullan, and the instructed counsel Mr Ian Shiels) in passing that the short video probably originated in the USA. He did not refer to the existence of the longer video. It was only on the second day of the final hearing of the public law applications some months later, on 18 November 2015, that the Local Authority advised the mother, father and Children&#8217;s Guardian of the American origin of the video, and on the same day, the Police informed all parties (the Local Authority and the respondent parents) for the first time of the existence of the longer video.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the meantime, the Police interviewed the parents under caution, putting the still image of Girl Y to them to see if they would (erroneously) identify her as their daughter; at the time the police knew that the still image was not a picture of GD.  Unsurprisingly neither the parents nor GD acknowledged the still image to be a photograph of GD; I describe this as &#8220;one of the lowest points of this blighted history&#8221; &#8211; see [88/89] and [126] above.   Separately, the Local Authority social worker conducted an ABE interview with GD, and similarly put the still image of Girl Y to her for her comment/recognition; at the time, the social worker knew that the still image was not of GD. The ABE interview was conducted by inexperienced social workers and the lead questioning by social worker who had not received any training in the conduct of such interviews.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority pursued a case in the public law proceedings that the mother was Woman X and that GD was Girl Y. They commissioned a witness statement from DS Hudson who had overall management of the investigation of the offences to file in the Family Court.  The statement in its final form was four paragraphs long and contained only information which incriminated the mother, no information which exculpated her, and provided no context.  This statement was signed at a time when DS Hudson knew for sure that the mother was not Woman X, but he did not say so.</p>

The Local Authority was beholden to the police in relation to the information sought, and thereby at times found itself partially disabled from conducting any effective case management;</p>
