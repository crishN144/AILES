	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in">In September 2011 the father began proceedings seeking a residence order and a prohibited steps order to prevent the mother from removing P from his care or from her school.&#160; After much paper was generated and reports obtained from an independent social worker, S B, a consultant child psychiatrist,&#160;Dr. B, and a consultant psychiatrist, Dr. M, the section 8 proceedings were eventually compromised and an order made by Mr. Justice Coleridge on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, 2012, only about two and a half months ago.&#160; The order includes the following provisions.&#160; It was recorded and acknowledged by the mother and the father that neither of them sought a residence order in respect of P.&#160; They agreed the arrangements for care of P.&#160; It was agreed that P should stay overnight with her mother if she wishes.&#160; It was agreed that both parties and the father's current partner would continue to encourage P to stay overnight with her mother and have more time with her mother.&#160;&#160; The father told me that he does encourage P in that manner.&#160; The father undertook not to consume alcohol during P's minority and to continue to undertake hair strand testing, blood testing, and liver function testing in respect of alcohol until 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, 2013 and to provide to the mother's solicitors with copies of the test results as soon as they are available.&#160; In addition, the father's current partner undertook to inform the mother and the mother's solicitor immediately of any relapse or suspected relapse by the father in his abstinence from alcohol during P's minority.&#160; The arrangements for care of P, as agreed and enshrined in the order, were that P should be in the care of her mother during term-time every Friday from school until 9.00 p.m.; on alternate weekends, on Saturdays from 10.00 a.m. until 7.00 p.m. and on Sundays from 10.00 a.m. until 6.00 p.m. and for half of all school holidays and for such other periods as may be agreed in accordance with P's wishes.&#160; At all other times it was agreed that P should be in the care of her father.&#160; On that basis it was agreed that there should be no order on the father's applications for residence and prohibited steps orders.&#160;&#160; </p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in">Although the order does not say so, its effect is that P now lives with the father as resident parent and has contact with the mother as the non-resident parent.&#160; Mr. Hale, counsel on behalf of the mother, has sought to argue that as the order is silent as to residence and contact, the concepts of resident and non-resident parent are inapplicable to this case.&#160; I disagree.&#160; In my view it is important to look at the underlying reality.&#160; The concepts are relevant in considering whether there is any jurisdiction to make a maintenance order in view of the bar imposed on the court's jurisdiction by section 8 of the Child Support Act.&#160; The mother seeks a maintenance order of &#163;2,200 per month, but if there is no jurisdiction to make that order according to a letter from her solicitor, dated 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, 2013, she seeks a lump sum payable by instalments to cover such payments until P reaches the age of eighteen or finishes full-time education.&#160; Mr. Hale, on behalf of the mother, has not pursued that alternative because the circumvention of section 8 of the Child Support Act is precluded by a decision of Mr. Justice Johnson in the case of <span class="Emphasis">Phillips v. Peace</span> [1996] 2FLR, 230.&#160; </p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in">Mr. Hale argued that the mother should have a home commensurate with the father's in order to enjoy contact with P, even if P does not return to live with her mother.&#160;&#160; This is not a father who lives in palatial surroundings.&#160;&#160; The father's home in London has three bedrooms, as does his farmhouse.&#160; Given the current high values of properties in London, the values of the father's homes are comparatively modest.&#160; I am not persuaded by that argument that the mother must stay on at Property B or that she will be unable to acquire another suitable property in which to have contact with P.&#160; Moreover, the father said that P was not worried about the standard of her home.&#160; Much more important, he said, is her relationship with her mother.&#160; I agree.</p>
