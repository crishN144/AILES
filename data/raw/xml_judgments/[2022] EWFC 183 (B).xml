As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process that might inelegantly be known as &#8216;story-creep&#8217; may occur without any necessary inference of bad faith.&#8221;</span></p>

I reminded myself that I must consider her evidence through the prism of mother being a victim of alleged domestic abuse.  She had been diagnosed with low mood and post-traumatic stress disorder.  It is not unusual for witnesses with such difficulties to find it difficult to remember precise details or to be somewhat inconsistent albeit her GP has reported only symptoms with sleep, anxiety and low mood.  I was not satisfied that language has presented a barrier for mother.   As Mr Chapman reminded me, she drafted maternal grandmother&#8217;s witness statement in perfect English.   She had some command of English and she had an interpreter when she spoke to professionals.  I was unconvinced of mother&#8217;s explanations that there had been issues with translation and this included the questions on the DASH questionnaire where she was able to recollect abuse to her and was clear that there was no abuse to the children or sexual abuse towards her.</span></p>

There were several occasions during cross examination when she had to be asked questions multiple times.  I was satisfied that she understood the question and was warned by me several times that she would be asked the question once and if she declined to answer, I would make such inferences as appropriate from her reluctance to answer the question.  It was almost impossible to ascertain from mother when and how her relationship with her new partner started, although she eventually conceded this was January 2020 and was only visiting him prior to this.  Her partner said they began a relationship in August 2019 and the police referred to LT as mother&#8217;s new partner following their visit to his home in December 2019.   Clearly mother and LT were in a relationship very soon after their relationship break down with father and earlier than January 2020.  It was clear to me that mother simply did not want to tell me anything that she perceived to be detrimental to her case or that she felt would cast her in a poor light.  I could not attribute such reluctance to her mental health but rather to an intention to be less than truthful with the Court.</span></p>

She said that she saw father&#8217;s poor attitude to mother but did not intervene.  When asked about mother hitting the children, she said that mother did this because father asked her to.  I found that less than credible and was clearly mirroring mother&#8217;s evidence.  She was unable to give specifics about father hitting the children save that he hit them when they were naughty for example, when DD was damaging the tablet.  She was not concerned about father having unsupervised contact with the children in February 2020, she said that she thought that father had come to his senses.  I was left with the impression that grandmother was aware that both parents chastise the children but that she sought to blame father for mother&#8217;s actions as well as his own.  She minimised mother&#8217;s actions to merely raising her voice.  Noting that mother stormed into father&#8217;s room in April 2019 when he asked for food and shouted at him, and thereafter the physical altercation took place, I was unable to accept that mother was never aggressive and that maybe she raised her voice as maternal grandmother claimed.   Maternal grandmother&#8217;s account that father had been hitting the children and assaulted mother did not sit easily with her reluctance to get involved or acceptance that father would see the children in February 2020.</span></p>

He could not credibly explain how he was able to make a statement in Romania concerned with the children returning to the UK that he knew father to be a violent man, both physically and verbally having witnessed arguments between mother and father on many occasions.  He later equated &#8220;many&#8221; to &#8220;few&#8221; noting that mother confirmed that LT had only witnessed her relationship with father 2 or 3 times.   I wasn&#8217;t even clear how or when he had observed mother and father together as he did not provide any details. In my judgment, he had embellished his account to the courts in Romania.  It was clear from his evidence that he and mother had spoken to the children about father in negative terms and given DY adult information such as information about Christmas Day 2019.  He had denied talking to DY until he was presented with DY&#8217;s police interview where she confirmed that LT had spoken to her about that incident.

Father minimised the disputes between the parties by stating that they had not had loud arguments before.  DY&#8217;s account was very different telling teachers that her parents shout and scream at one another, and I believe that the relationship between mother and father in April 2019 was strained; father said their relationship was not going well to Ms Russell at that time.  Father said that mother had threatened to return to Romania twice and I believe that was because the relationship was difficult.  Father minimised his working hours although when interviewed by the police in August 2020 he accepted working 12-15 hours per day.  DY said father worked 15 hours a day. From my own knowledge, a HGV driver can drive for 9 hours and is usually expected to work at least 11-12 hours which includes breaks and checks excluding commutes.  The first assessment done by Leicestershire County Council referred to father working 15 hours a day.  NM stated that father worked long hours and I believed her account of that.</span></p>

He said the cameras were in the lounge and kitchen but there was clearly a camera in the children&#8217;s bedroom too. He said the cameras were to protect the children as they lived in a shared house.  It was clear from NM that she was not in the house for long periods as she was working.  NM had no reason to go into the childrens&#8217; bedroom.  Father&#8217;s need to safeguard his children could have been achieved by not sharing his home with others.  Cameras are usually used for surveillance and monitoring and I am satisfied that this is the reason why they were installed.  Father recorded his video conversations with the children for evidential purposes.

It was therefore incomprehensible that father would threaten to expose videos of mother having sex with other men when she had not done so.

This happened on one occasion and father forced mother to be more aggressive with the children and make them quiet.  In her oral evidence, she could not explain why she hit DY so many times.</span></p>

I saw the video of mother hitting DY in the children&#8217;s bedroom.  DY was hit multiple times and then pulled from the bunk and hit again.  The translation confirms that this was because she had not done her homework.  </span></p>

DY had confirmed that mother had hit her repeatedly but then also stated it was only once.  Mother had said she would not hit DY and then said she only hit her on one occasion.    Neither can be relied upon to be an accurate historian.  Father did not say that mother had hit the children before.  There is little to evidence that this happened previously although in my view there is a real risk that it has happened before.</span></p>

DY made the same allegations but she clearly mirrored mother&#8217;s rhetoric in absolving her mother from blame.  This is typical behaviour of child aligning themselves to one parent, in this case the mother.</span></p>
