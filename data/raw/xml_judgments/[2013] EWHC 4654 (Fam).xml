The case concerns C B, who is aged 17 (having been born on 28 June 1996).  The case involves a local authority, A County Council.  On 18 August 2013 that local authority issued these proceedings.  It sought a secure accommodation order under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.  It took that action because it contended that C was exposing herself to significant risk, was using drugs, was consuming alcohol, and was at significant risk of self-harm.  </span></p>

She had also, it is said, behaved aggressively and in a threatening way to her grandmother, with whom she had been living, to the extent that her grandmother left her own home.  C&#8217;s mother is DB.  She was born on 25 September 1980 and is, therefore, now aged nearly 33.  The father of C is EF. Neither parent takes any part in these proceedings.  C&#8217;s grandmother is J H, who was born on 9 June 1956. C lived with her grandmother under a residence order for much of her childhood.  The position of the grandmother is also not entirely clear, although I was informed that, at an earlier hearing before another judge, on 29 August, she expressed her objection to the continuation of the secure accommodation.  C has a daughter, GI, who was born on 16 December 2012, when C was aged 16&#189;.  On 9 July 2013 care and placement orders were made in relation to G.  </span></p>

The issue before me today, therefore, is whether there is jurisdiction in the court to make a secure accommodation provision in relation to C.

Each of them has spent a large amount of time over the weekend researching the points of law that arise.  So have I.  However, ultimately the argument was driven into a corner by the skill of Miss Campbell, and that led to a position where no party sought to dispute her analysis of the extent of the wardship jurisdiction and its availability, as a matter of principle, in relation to a child of C&#8217;s age and circumstances.</span></p>

It is also one where, on paper, there is every reason to have grave concern for C.  The psychiatric evidence that has been prepared by Dr Yates and Dr Leonards ultimately concludes that C is of capable of detention under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.  There are various suggestions about her state of health, including a suggestion that C may have a conduct disorder, which Dr Yates thought has increased in severity. I make no adjudication, of course, in relation to that.  The anxiety about C&#8217;s vulnerability and potential for harm is entirely genuine and requires analysis of fact at a subsequent hearing. The extraordinary circumstances of this case include, however, the following: (1) C&#8217;s age; (2) the fact that she has herself had a child; (3) the fact that, at the time these proceedings started, she was not in local authority accommodation or subject to any other statutory scheme relating to her; (4) the reported degree of vulnerability that she bore.</span></p>

Therefore, an order making C a ward of court, but granting custody of her to the local authority, is, I think, inherently contradictory.  Further, the provisions of paragraph 1 of the orders made in the X District Registry, by which care, custody and control were granted to the local authority, must, in the manner of their drafting, be exactly that which is intended should not be ordered by reason of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. The much more difficult points that have arisen and which have occupied my mind for much of the weekend are these: (1) whether it could be said that C was a looked after child within the terminology of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> at the time of the initiation of these proceedings; (2) whether, absent an order granting care, custody and control of C to the local authority, it would be permissible for the inherent jurisdiction to be used for C to be made a ward of court, and for the court then to direct her detention in secure accommodation.

It is not for us to decide but at first blush I would tend to think it more likely that the history and circumstances would be sufficient to create a duty on the local authority to provide accommodation under subsection (3).

If she was, then the matter would be simple and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/42/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> accommodation would be available in principle.  All the parties before me have accepted that C should not be regarded as a child who was accommodated by the local authority when the proceedings started.  The fact is she was not living in local authority accommodation, and had not been doing so beforehand.  I have to say that my own mind remains open as to whether a local authority, exercising its duties under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/42/section/20/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20(3)</ref> and making accommodation available to a child aged 16 or 17, is not then in a position to contend that the child is looked after by them, having thought about this quite carefully over the weekend.  I have considered, for instance, whether a parent keeping rooms available for children at boarding school are not providing accommodation for the children even though they do not use it, or whether adults who keep rooms available for elder parents in their home are not also providing accommodation for those elder parents, for instance if the elderly parents need to remove themselves from their own homes.  Further, it could not be said that a local authority ceases to provide accommodation for a child if the child runs away.  So I think this is somewhat more complex than perhaps meets the eye, and I was prepared to listen to submissions in relation to it.</span></p>

It follows that if (1) the clinic is secure accommodation and (2) falls within the category of persons set out in either limb of regulation 2 of the Children (Secure Accommodation) (No 2) Regulations the inherent jurisdiction of the court is ousted and for C to be detained in a clinic, an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> will need to be made pursuant to the regulations.  I have to say that I find the regulations difficult to construe. Mr Munby conducted a detailed analysis of the regulations in the skeleton argument. I do not propose to repeat that exercise in this judgment, helpful as it was.  The critical question seems to me to be, is the clinic secure accommodation?  If it is, then the question of the construction of the regulations and their application to the instant case must be addressed.  But, if it is not, detention in the clinic is outside the statutory scheme and the major inhibition on the use of the inherent jurisdiction disappears.&#8221;</p>

Secure accommodation can only be justified on a number of legal bases, that amongst them includes the provisions of Article 8(2).  For Article 8(2) to be satisfied, the action of the public authority, here the court, must be demonstrated to be in accordance with the law; secondly, necessary for the protection of the rights and freedoms of C; and, thirdly, proportionate.  I remind myself, of course, that secure accommodation involves the deprivation of liberty, and thus the liberty of the subject is engaged, and it is also one of the most draconian orders that can be made in relation to the placement of a child within the available armoury of the court.  Therefore, very serious issues indeed arise under this provision, and there has to be strong and legal justification for intervention under the secure provisions.</span></p>

In circumstances where the statutory code under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> is satisfied in relation to a 17-year old child, with the exception of the requirement that the child is looked after by the local authority, it is open to the court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to direct that a child be detained in secure accommodation.  I accept Miss Campbell&#8217;s submission, on reflection, that the guidance and the authorities suggest that where the wardship court does exercise that jurisdiction, it must do so in a way that is compatible with the limitations imposed by statute.  But the existence of the jurisdiction to make orders detaining children under the inherent jurisdiction is now established in argument before me, and therefore I conclude, as a matter of law, that it is permissible to order that a ward of court be detained in secure accommodation.  The individual facts of individual cases have to be considered, and I am not, by this decision, indicating any conclusions about whether C should be further detained in secure accommodation. That will be for another day.</span></p>
