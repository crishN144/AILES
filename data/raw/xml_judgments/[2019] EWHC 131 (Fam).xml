Arguments as to the delay and its effect on the assessment carried out by the judge can be made in respect of the grounds on which permission has been given.  These grounds have no realistic prospect of success. ground three: although the judge may have concluded that it was open to the mother to leave and re-enter the jurisdiction at an earlier stage and it may be arguable that this was erroneous the judge&#8217;s conclusions as to the general uncertainty relating to her current immigration status appear unchallengeable. In the circumstances even if there were an error as to the mother&#8217;s immigration status in October 2017 it had no material impact on the ultimate decision. This ground has no realistic prospect of success. </span></p>

The judge&#8217;s conclusions as to the mother&#8217;s manipulative personality was a matter which he was well placed to determine having seen the parties give evidence and considered the evidence. It is clear from the judgment that the judge was unimpressed by both the mother and the father both as a result of what he had seen and what he had read. A narrow textual analysis of particular aspects of the evidence as deployed by the appellant does not undermine the analysis and conclusions of the judge contained within the judgment.

I directed that that application be heard at the same time as the substantive appeal. At the commencement of the hearing I canvassed with counsel for the appellant and the respondent how that application was to be dealt with and suggested that rather than deal with it as a preliminary issue that each party make their submissions in respect of each of the grounds and I would then give a judgment on all the matters. It appeared to me given the nature of the submissions that were likely to be made in respect of ground 4 that they would take a considerable tranche of the time set aside for the appeal and that it would not be possible to deal with them separately in the one day allowed. </p>

Given the nature of ground 4 his analysis of those matters occupied a significant part of that skeleton argument and indeed the majority of his oral submissions. In ground 4, Mr Vine QC identifies seven specific issues or findings which the judge made which contributed to the overall conclusion that the mother had a manipulative personality and formed a significant component of the conclusion that she would not promote the father-son relationship if permitted to relocate. Mr Vine QC characterised these as the &#8216;building blocks &#8216;of which the overall finding was constructed.  In respect </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">of each of them in the skeleton argument Mr Vine QC identified aspects of the appellant&#8217;s written or oral evidence which he submitted had not been adequately addressed either in the respondent&#8217;s oral evidence or by the judge in his conclusions so as to enable the judge to reach the conclusions that he did. I shall turn to them in more detail later. In respect of ground five, Mr Vine QC&#8217;s case was essentially that the analysis that the judge undertook in respect of the likely impact on the appellant of being forced to live in the UK was so attenuated that it could not be said to be a sufficient analysis and plainly did not give appropriate weight to the practical and emotional difficulties that the mother would face if she were not permitted to relocate. Given that the mother had only come to the UK to give birth, had no ties, no relatives, was not permitted to work or access public funds, Mr Vine QC says this was a most unusual case and the impact on the mother was likely to be considerable and required careful analysis. The second component of this was that there was no sufficient analysis of the knock-on impact on the child of the impact on the mother of being forced to live in the UK.  In respect of grounds 6, 7 and 8, Mr Vine QC submits that the judgment did not address the issue of the impact on the child of separation from the mother, or the reliability of the spend time with arrangements and that it reached overall conclusions which were not accompanied by the evaluation required by the welfare checklist or general principles. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Ms Crowley QC, on behalf of the respondent, submitted a skeleton argument on behalf of the respondent together with a litigation chronology. Her skeleton also was devoted in large part to ground 4 of the appeal and contains significant extracts from the judgment which address the relevant findings together with the respondent&#8217;s analysis of the building blocks which Mr Vine QC seeks to demolish. On behalf of the father, she identified the findings in the judgment and aspects of the documentary evidence in the bundle which she maintains provided a proper foundation for each of the conclusions on the building blocks that the judge reached. In respect of ground five, Ms Crowley QC submits that the judge had conflicting evidence from the mother as to her financial position in the UK and her ability to provide for herself and the child. He had also heard evidence as to her immigration position and had taken the view that she could have done more to regularise her situation. Ms Crowley QC identifies that the judge did consider the impact upon the mother at various stages and also identified the possible impact on the child as well as the mother&#8217;s acceptance that if she were unable to return to Africa she would remain in the UK. Together with his finding that the child ideally needed the shared care of both of his parents this fully justified his rejection of the mother&#8217;s application. Ms Crowley QC notes that at the time of the hearing the child was still only six months of age. In respect of grounds 6 &#8211; 8, Ms Crowley QC submits that the judge was entitled to determine the child arrangements in the event the mother was deported and that it is implicit in his reasoning that he found the father would be more likely to facilitate contact, that there would be an impact on the child of being separated from his mother. He plainly took into account his conclusion that if the child were allowed to leave with the mother it would terminate the relationship with the father. In particular in relation to ground 7, </p>

Ms Crowley QC submits that it was not unreasonable for the judge to deal with the default position because if the mother were to be deported there would need to be in place a clear and unambiguous plan to deal with the child is living arrangements. She submits that the judge had ample evidence upon which to make his conclusions. </p>

In reality in the judicial consideration of the welfare checklist it simply is likely to mean the judge will be that much more alert to the importance and thus weight to be afforded to the child&#8217;s right to maintain contact with the left behind parent and their rights to a stable and secure family life with their primary carer, if there is one.  </p>

In the latter the overall undulations may make the balance a very fine one. Ultimately every case is fact specific. This case is a paradigm example of that.</p>

Even in a very full trial, it may often be disproportionate and unrealistic to expect a cross-examiner to put every possible reason for disbelieving a witness to that witness, especially in a complex case, and it may be particularly difficult to do so in a case such as this, where the Judge sensibly rationed the time for cross-examination and the witness concerned needed an interpreter. Once it is accepted that not every point may be put, it is inevitable that there will be cases where a point which strikes the judge as a significant reason for disbelieving some evidence when he comes to give judgment, has not been put to the witness who gave it. </span></p>

As the Privy Council pointed out in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Chen</span> in an ideal world all of the contested factual matters will be tested in oral evidence and will be separately identified and adjudicated upon by the trial judge. However we do not operate within an ideal world but a world in which the court is mandated to deal with matters proportionately. This inevitably means that the parties accept that the judge will not be able to explore every contested matter of fact. In this case both parties wanted an early determination of the applications. The mother not only had an application for leave to remove but also challenged the jurisdiction of the court to make any orders her case being that the child was habitually resident in Africa, and that the courts of that country should conduct the welfare enquiry. As both Mr Vine QC and Ms Crowley QC accepted the time estimate for such issues to be fully explored was far in excess of two days. However both parties took the view in January 2018 that they did not want the case pushed back many months in order to secure that sort of time estimate. The mother therefore has to accept that her ability to have all of the evidence tested orally and the depth of the enquiry that His Honour Judge Sharpe would be able to undertake into the facts was necessarily far more constrained than would have been possible in a four or five-day hearing. The courts are now accustomed to more abbreviated hearings, to assessing documentary evidence and dealing with disputes of fact in a more summary way. Provided that the court is satisfied that justice can be done and that an appropriate welfare determination can be achieved it is perfectly proper for the court to determine factual matters with limited exploration of contested issues or largely on the papers. This is particularly so if the parties invite the court so to do or do not suggest to the court that the hearing should be adjourned in order to enable a fuller enquiry to be undertaken.   </p>

Firstly in respect of each aspect of the building blocks I do not consider that it would have been proportionate to fully explore each but in any event those building blocks are selections from a far wider landscape of factual issues that the judge was considering. The issue of whether the mother was manipulative and hostile to the father having a relationship with the child was a central issue and was covered in the evidence including the Cafcass report [D25xiv] [E27iv] [E29,7.2]. It was a focus of Ms Crowley QC is closing submissions [B149, 13], [B151, 19], [B153]. There were several examples which might also have been selected.

Mr Vine QC says that not only did the court disregard the mother&#8217;s first and third witness statements but the police records log the incident as possible coercive controlling behaviour. The police record which is contained within the Cafcass report at D4 is no corroboration at all for the mother&#8217;s case. It merely records that there had been a report from the mother about her husband&#8217;s behaviour and that the police (I assume it was they rather than the mother) applied the description coercive and controlling behaviour. It was assessed by police as medium risk. I do not believe that one can sensibly extrapolate from that anything which corroborates the mother&#8217;s account; all the police were doing was reflecting what the mother had told them. That is not corroboration. Given the other evidence which the judge heard which indicated the mother was not fearful of the father (she later requested that only she and he be present for handovers) the judge was entitled to reach the conclusions that he did which was that it suited the mother to generate an impression of fear and intimidation which is entirely contrary to that which she genuinely felt. The judge concluded the father presented no risk of violence. In respect of the call to the police, there is no basis for me to interfere with that conclusion. </p>

Without a transcript of the mother&#8217;s evidence or submissions, I cannot know how often the issue came up during the hearing but it is clearly a matter which was raised at the hearing, had been raised at earlier interim hearings and troubled the judge. It is clear from the previous orders for contact and the mother&#8217;s statements in support of variations [B3/4], [B6/7] that she had relied on breastfeeding as a reason for varying the orders. The father&#8217;s response [C23] referred to the fact that the mother could have expressed breastmilk but was choosing not to and that the parties had previously given the child formula as well as breastmilk. In those circumstances the judge&#8217;s conclusions during the interim hearings that the mother was seeking to rely on breastfeeding to achieve a variation was certainly within the range of conclusions that he was entitled to reach and those earlier decisions refusing to vary interim contact on these grounds were not appealed. The judge appears to have accepted that the mother&#8217;s reliance on the issue was inconsistent with the solution the father had proposed and he was entitled to infer that there was another motive for the argument having been deployed. I therefore do not accept that this issue required very careful consideration and clear reasons if they were to be rejected.  </p>

The conclusion that the mother had been intent on providing as little contact as possible forms part of the manipulation finding. Mr Vine QC criticises the judge for not engaging with the rest of the evidence the appellant provided in the earlier stages as to why she had sought to change arrangements; namely the father&#8217;s family were caring for the child during some contact and there were difficulties with handovers. The judge&#8217;s conclusions were based on the earlier interim decisions which had not been challenged, his assessment of the progress of contact and the mother&#8217;s reasons for seeking variations, which he considered to be unfounded, and changes in her position is as pointed out by Ms Crowley QC. An example is insisting on accompanied handovers because of her fear of the father and later seeking handovers only between herself and the father. It was an entirely legitimate inference that the mother had not been supporting contact and had been seeking excuses for varying it (always a reduction never an increase). Given the hostility expressed by the mother towards the father and her criticism of his interest in his son and his capability it was hardly a great leap to conclude that the mother had been seeking to limit the father&#8217;s contact. Given that the judge concluded that the father was a capable father his conclusion that the mother unjustifiably wished to limit the relationship was well within the findings that were open to him. It did not require detailed exploration or more careful consideration than the judge gave it. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">not clear for some considerable time. On the morning of the hearing a document was received from the Home Office which [E1] stated that the mother &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">had a Visa on condition that she does not enter the UK for more than 180 days in a 12 month period&#8217; . </span>The judge was unsure of the effects of her Visa. He concluded it was a moot point as to whether she would have been entitled to re-enter immediately if she had left the jurisdiction for a day or whether she would have had to wait for another six months before entering. It may be that the judge was incorrect in thinking that the mother could have left and immediately re-entered. It may have been harsh to have expected her to leave if she was genuinely uncertain as to whether she would be readmitted given that she would have been leaving behind a tiny baby. However that is only part of the picture because it was not simply the issue of not leaving prior to 30 October but also not taking steps with the Home Office direct to regularise her position. It is certainly clear that he considered the mother had not taken reasonable steps that were open to her to regularise her immigration position and that he concluded that she had done so as a strategic choice to in effect put a gun to the court&#8217;s head. Her witness statement contained evidence that she had sought immigration advice about regularising her position and had been unable to afford it.  Interestingly the evidence confirms that she was advised to write herself to the Home Office seeking to explain the position. It does not appear that this was done. Whether the court was right in respect of her ability to leave the country and immediately return is neither here nor there. The fact was that by February 2018, some five months after the separation, the mother had not done anything to regularise her position. Nor had anything been done in the course of the litigation to do so. It is standard practice in such cases to either have made the application to the Home Office or to have sought advice from an immigration expert to inform the court as to the options available to that party to regularise their status and the likely outcome. None of that had been done. Indeed I was told by Mr Vine QC that even now no application has been made. Whilst I accept that from 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September onwards when the order was promulgated that its contents might have been detrimental to the application, or even from July when the judgment was handed down that an application might have stood less chance. But what about the period prior to that? The mother said she could not afford it. However the judge concluded that the mother&#8217;s financial position was obscure. The contents of her last statement suggested that her family had sufficient resources to fund an application. Therefore the conclusion that the judge reached that the mother had used her immigration position in a manipulative way to put pressure on the court was one which was open to him on the evidence. Whether that issue was fully explored in evidence was not of such a central importance as to render the overall conclusion unsafe given the other components. </p>

This was determined by His Honour Judge Sharpe on 14 November 2017. The fact that it followed on from earlier attempts to obtain interim leave to remove based on her immigration position combined with the unsatisfactory evidence from Africa in support of her father&#8217;s illness led the judge to conclude that he was not satisfied that the mother had established on the evidence that there was an urgent need to go. Mr Vine QC submits that this suggests the decision was based on suspicion rather than the proper binary approach to underlying facts. I cannot agree with this conclusion. If the judge was not satisfied the evidence was genuine he was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the mother&#8217;s father was ill. The fact that he did not conclude it was definitely false is different. The conclusion that the mother had made an application for reasons which were not supported by the evidence and which had led to a refusal of interim leave on the basis of a risk that she would not return was a perfectly proper matter for the court to take into consideration in determining whether the mother was manipulative. Again I do not consider that this was such a central issue that testing of the evidence in detail was a necessary precondition for the judge relying on this aspect. Nor did the evidence in respect of her father&#8217;s ill-health require careful consideration and clear reasons to be given in the judgment. Ms Crowley QC pointed out that by the time this was determined in February the father&#8217;s ill-health was not relied upon by the mother at all and no further evidence had been deployed by the mother suggesting that her father&#8217;s ill-health played any part in her need to return home. More importantly no appeal had been made against the interim determination of His Honour Judge Sharpe. He was therefore entitled to take it into account. </p>

Like a Jenga tower even if he is right in respect of one or more of the building bricks and they must be removed the construction may still remain intact. The conclusion that the mother had a manipulative personality and was hostile to the father&#8217;s relationship to the child was a conclusion that the judge was entitled to come to in all the circumstances and having regard to the oral evidence he had heard and the written documentation he had considered. The individual building blocks were in my view conclusions the judge was individually entitled to reach on the evidence. Even if one or more of them were to fall away, the remaining building blocks taken together with the other evidence the judge heard, his decisions on interim contact his conclusions on the mother&#8217;s highly critical approach to the father and his ability to care for the child all would have justified the conclusion that the judge reached in any event. In the context of the hearing, configured as it was these findings were open to the judge to make. I do not consider this to be a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Chen</span> case where the manipulation conclusion hung on one or two particular points not adequately addressed in the evidence.

He noted that the evaluation of the welfare of the child was to be undertaken not only by application of the welfare checklist but through the undertaking of a holistic balancing exercise whereby competing proposals were considered on their merits with their various positive and negative aspects analysed then looked at as against each other before then considering the proportionality of the proposal. He noted that no priority is to be given to any particular option or any particular proposer. He also reminded himself of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> (2A) Children Act 1980.

They require that a judge considers the relevant welfare checklist factors as they emerge on the facts of that particular case. The prominence given to particular factors is a matter for the trial judge. The extent to which the judge analyses evidence earlier set out is also a matter for the judge. In looking at the sophistication and complexity of the analysis undertaken an appellate court must also bear in mind not only the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Piglowska</span> guidance but must look at the circumstances in which the judgment was delivered. It is reasonable to expect that a judgment delivered at the conclusion of a five-day case, where the judge has had a day or two days to consider and prepare his judgment, will contain a more detailed analysis than a judgment following a case given a time estimate of two days.  Provided the material factors are evaluated a more attenuated judgment and analysis is not only acceptable but is to be expected in such a situation. </p>

He is right that this was an unusual case. Neither the mother or the father had planned on settling in the UK. Both had planned on settling in the Middle East. The father had family connections in Wales and in England but had not made his life here for some time. The mother was here essentially only to give birth to the child and has no friends family or connections with this jurisdiction. The application came on for hearing when the child was only six months old and as Ms Crowley QC pointed out this was a very different situation to a child who had developed an attachment to both his parents. The mother&#8217;s immigration position and the prohibition on her working or accessing public funds plainly made her situation (whilst that persisted) more difficult. The father and mother were both highly critical of each other and the prospect of them working together successfully even within this jurisdiction were not good. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Vine QC is right in saying that the judge&#8217;s assessment of the impact on the mother of having to remain living in the jurisdiction was brief. In his analysis of the welfare checklist factors under the likely effect of any change in circumstances the judge said that the refusal of the mother&#8217;s application is likely to be deeply upsetting for the mother being contrary to what she has been determined to achieve. In his analysis he identifies that each would have to turn their minds to securing work and that the mother was under a disability because of her immigration status. Mr Vine QC is right in identifying that even if the mother were to blame for her inability to work or access public funds and the consequent effect that was likely to have on her this was not about blame but rather about the effect on the mother and the child of the objective reality that she would face.  He submits that the tenor of the judgment is to focus more on blame of the mother than on the likely impact on the child. I do not agree that that is the overall effect of the judgment. Plainly the judge thought that the mother was able to support herself notwithstanding her Visa limitations and considered that the regularisation of her Visa position would improve her position. Thus, if she had been able to manage for the six months since the separation he was perfectly entitled to conclude that she would be able to manage going forwards. Earlier in the rehearsal of the evidence the judge had identified that the mother&#8217;s accommodation and finances were a source of concern to her. However, this was tempered by the fact that he concluded she had withdrawn her application for assistance with housing and finances from the local authority; which she would have been entitled to notwithstanding her Visa conditions because she was caring for the child. He also had referred to the fact that she had been able to provide housing for herself albeit there had been no evidence of funds passing through the bank account she had produced evidence of. There was of course evidence in her third witness statement that set out the funds that the trust </p>

The judge had also considered the circumstances in which the mother and father came to be in the UK and what their future intentions were when he was looking at the jurisdiction issue. He had concluded that neither the mother or the father intended to settle in the UK but rather that the intention was to return to the Middle East. Of course, the judge had concluded that the mother had wished to get away from Africa as well. </p>

Equally he could have set out more evidence for instance from the Cafcass officer about her evaluation of the mother, her motivation and behaviour. But one has to return to the context of this judgment. It was given after a two-day case in which a host of complex issues fell to be considered. The mother and father had both urged the judge to deal with them in February rather than later in the year at a longer hearing. At the conclusion of the two-day hearing the parties had only just completed the evidence. Written submissions had to be provided to the judge the judgment then had to be considered. In the judgment not only did the judge have to address the issue of habitual residence dealing with both the law and the facts, but also had to deal then with the child arrangements applications. </p>

In addition he had concluded that the mother was not likely to promote the relationship if she were permitted to relocate. These factors in many cases would outweigh the likely impact on the applicant of the refusal of a leave to remove application. Having conducted the exercise that he did the judge was perfectly entitled to reach the conclusion that he did and I do not consider that the assertion that he failed to consider sufficiently the difficulties for the mother to live in the UK and the impact on the child of requiring her to do so is made out. Given the two factors identified above it would have required an impact on the mother and consequent impact on the child of a very considerable magnitude to have tipped the scales the other way and there was no evidence before the judge which suggested that sort of impact. I therefore do not consider that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the difficulties the mother would face living in the UK nor did he fail to consider sufficiently the impact on the child of requiring her to do so.

The father sought a shared care arrangement with both parents and child remaining in Wales.

Technically such advice may not be a matter of part 25 expertise, it relating to a matter of English law but that nicety aside it is relatively standard for that to be sought. In this case the issue had not been addressed prior to Mr Vine QC&#8217;s arrival on the scene for the final hearing in January 2018 and when that was adjourned an application was made to the Home Office to clarify the mother&#8217;s immigration status. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">More importantly though, was His Honour Judge Sharpe equipped with the evidence and submissions to enable this issue to be addressed? Plainly it potentially would have medium to long term welfare consequences for the child. If it were to come to pass a default order might settle the child arrangements for the whole of the child&#8217;s minority. Would the mother be able to litigate child arrangements from Africa if she were unable to enter the jurisdiction? That being so it was a welfare decision of very considerable importance. To reach a decision on what was in the child&#8217;s welfare interests were that eventuality to come to pass required a further holistic examination of the competing options; on the one hand the child remaining in England with his father and having contact with his mother, on the other the child returning with his mother to Africa and having contact with his father. </p>

There is no analysis of the impact on the child of being separated from his mother. There is no analysis of the viability of the spending time with arrangements whether from a cost or entry to the UK perspective. There is no analysis of the risk that the father might undermine the relationship between the child and the mother. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">This was a central component of the refusal of the mother&#8217;s application. Ms Crowley QC is right to point out that the judge&#8217;s findings in relation to the father were less harsh than in relation to the mother but at no stage does he undertake the assessment of the likelihood of the father promoting the relationship were the mother to be deported. Given he had found that the father was highly critical of the mother (albeit not of her parenting of the child) and had lost no opportunity to criticise her (including suggesting that she might have him murdered) this was plainly something that needed to be factored into a holistic analysis of the options. Ms Crowley QC is right to say that the distinction between the judge&#8217;s findings in respect of the mother and the father are such that it is probable that he would have concluded had he undertaken the analysis that the father was more likely to promote contact than the mother albeit there would have been risks but this is only part of the holistic analysis. What if the evidence had established that the mother was unable to travel to the UK for immigration related reasons? What if the evidence that established that the finances were not available on the mother&#8217;s side to make the spending time with arrangements realistic? What was the evidence of the impact on this very young child of being separated from his mother to whom he almost certainly had his primary attachment at that stage? When all of the relevant welfare checklist factors were weighed in favour of the two options in this scenario where did the balance fall? The exercise was not undertaken and was probably incapable of being undertaken in the way required to reach a properly founded welfare determination. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is hard to avoid the conclusion that in this respect the judge did lapse into a linear exercise. Having earlier ruled out the child moving to live in Africa with the mother in favour of him remaining in this country with both his father and his mother the only real explanation for the conclusion that the judge summarily reached at paragraph 154 must be that having ruled out the child moving to Africa in his earlier holistic evaluation of the two competing options he imported that ruling out into his determination of the default position if the mother were to be deported to Africa. That I do not think was permissible because different issues fell to be considered in that eventuality and an entirely separate holistic evaluation of the option of the child remaining in Wales with his father and having contact with his mother either in the UK or in Africa as against the option of the child moving to Africa with his mother and having contact with his father in Africa the UK or elsewhere needed to be considered. Part of that evaluation, as I&#8217;ve set out above would have required a conclusion on the likelihood of the father promoting the mother-child relationship. Whilst the judge made observations on this he did not draw the threads together into a conclusion as he did for the mother. He had not had to in the earlier holistic evaluation but it would have been a necessary component of this. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Although no doubt His Honour Judge Sharpe considered and determined the default option out of a desire to tie up all of the loose ends and to provide a clear way ahead for the child in this respect I conclude that in this determination he did fall into error and that he did not undertake the holistic welfare evaluation of some complexity in order to determine where the child is paramount welfare lay. Had it been done it may have resulted in the same outcome but equally it might not. In particular had the parties&#8217; and the judge&#8217;s focus been on those two competing options I would wonder whether merely embarking on the process of analysing it would have led to the conclusion that the material was not available and perhaps the time was not right to undertake it at all. </p>

The arrangements for the child in the medium to long term will need to be determined by the court on the basis of the evidence as it then appears. In the event that the mother receives notification that she is to be removed for immigration related reasons the mother or the father must restore the case for further consideration. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Plainly it would be better for all concerned if the mother&#8217;s immigration status were clarified. The clear conclusion of His Honour Judge Sharpe was that this child needed both of his parents in his life. Equally it is clear (albeit the magnitude has not been finally determined) that there would be a risk to the maintenance of the mother/child relationship were she to be deported. That clearly would have article 8 implications for the child. How the parties choose to deal with the issue in terms of seeking a court order will have an interface with the progress made on clarification of the mother&#8217;s immigration position. However, I cannot determine that within the confines of this appeal. At the moment, I&#8217;m not sure it could be dealt with at first instance. Further clarity probably needs to be achieved in a number of areas in order to properly determine that issue. </p>
