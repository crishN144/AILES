	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">This judgment is delivered in matrimonial proceedings in which the wife is seeking a financial remedies order against her former husband after a marriage of 25 years during which three children, all now in their late teens or early 20s, were born. During the marriage, the family enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle as a result of the husband&#8217;s successful property development business. But latterly his business has run into difficulties and he alleges that he now has liabilities which significantly exceed the family&#8217;s assets. The central issue in the case is whether the husband, and his business associates who gave evidence at the hearing before me, have fabricated or exaggerated those liabilities in an attempt to defeat the wife&#8217;s claim. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">In his opening note at the start of the hearing, Mr Martin Pointer QC for the husband described this as a vexing case in which the costs incurred have been disproportionate to the resources of the parties. It is indeed vexing and the parties have been represented at considerable cost by leading and junior counsel and well-known specialist family solicitors (although for a period earlier in the proceedings the husband represented himself). The wife&#8217;s case is that the costs have been greatly increased by the husband&#8217;s failure to comply with his obligations to give full and frank disclosure. Such documents as have been produced by the husband, and latterly by his business associates claiming to be his creditors, have been produced in a piecemeal fashion. This has caused considerable difficulties, not only for those representing the parties and in particular the wife, but also for the court. Preparation of this judgment has been delayed in part because of other commitments but also because of the need to go through all the documents that have been produced in an effort to piece together the evidence to establish whether the wife&#8217;s allegation that the husband has fabricated or exaggerated his debts has been made out. </p>

Both moved to live in the UK when they were children, the wife when she was aged 10, the husband when he went to boarding school in this country aged 13. The husband&#8217;s father, whom the husband describes as an entrepreneurial man, still lives in Iran. It is the wife&#8217;s case that her father-in-law has property and business interests in that country and that the husband himself has some involvement in those or other business interests there. The husband denies that this is so, having only visited Iran four times since 1979. </p>

The husband&#8217;s evidence is that when they met he had a job as a car salesman. They were married in 1990. At that point, they had little money and no other assets, save that the wife had inherited her late mother&#8217;s jewellery. The husband obtained work in a Mercedes dealership and after a few years set up his own business as a car dealer specialising in Smart cars. The wife trained and worked as a midwife but ceased paid employment in 1994 when she became pregnant. Subsequently she gave birth to three children, two girls and a boy, in 1994, 1996 and 1998 respectively.  </p>

It is clear that he was successful in this business and the parties&#8217; financial position was transformed. It is the wife&#8217;s case that she assisted the husband in the interior decoration and furnishing the properties, and also entertained the husband&#8217;s business associates and investors. She asserts that through her friends and acquaintances he made some important business contacts. The wife herself did not have any paid employment again, save for a brief period when she operated two children&#8217;s clothing shops which did not make a profit and had to be closed. </p>

A copy of the application to cancel the entry on the Land Registry charges register was produced. It purported to show that the application to cancel the charge on the matrimonial home had been made by C Finance via a firm of solicitors based in Hampshire, called Daltons, on 14 December 2011. A copy of the Land Registry&#8217;s cancellation of the charge on form DS1 was also produced, dated 6 December 2011 and executed by Wayne Stebbings on behalf of C Finance. Witnesses representing C Finance who gave evidence before me stated that no one on behalf of that company had authorised the removal of the charge.

The letter proceeded to set out an account of the history of transactions between the husband and C Finance and U Properties. I shall return to that history below.

The judge listed the enforcement application for a further hearing in August 2017 and directed the husband to disclose all relevant documents supporting his assertions as to the sale of the boat and Rolls-Royce and the loans from Mr. X.

She valued the husband&#8217;s business interests before personal tax at &#163;11.8m. All parties now agree that this report does not represent an accurate valuation of those interests. The parties are agreed that the principal reason for this is that the husband had failed to disclose significant details of his financial position. They disagree, however, as to what those details were. On 16 October, the wife&#8217;s lawyers submitted questions seeking clarification of aspects of Ms Hall&#8217;s report.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">At a further hearing in November 2017, Cohen J extended the interim order of sale to include other works of art, providing that the proceeds of sale should be applied slightly differently, namely the first &#163;100,000 to be divided between the parties on the basis that the husband&#8217;s share be utilised towards debt of &#163;76,000 which he asserted was owed to HMRC, with the balance of the proceeds to be applied in accordance with the order of 11 August. The freezing injunction remained in force. An FDR the following month failed to lead to any resolution of the parties&#8217; dispute. On 1 December, Ms Hall filed a supplemental report in answer to the questions posed on behalf of the wife. On 12 January 2018, the wife filed a <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Daniels v Walker</span> application, seeking permission to rely on a report by Mark Gillespie of FTI Consulting in respect of the husband&#8217;s business interests on the basis that there was a very substantial dispute as to the value of those assets. On 15 January, the wife served a schedule of deficiencies in the husband&#8217;s disclosure and a further questionnaire. At a hearing on 16 January, at which the husband was represented by junior counsel, I allowed the wife&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Daniels v Walker</span> application and gave consequential directions obligating the husband to provide information to Mr Gillespie and directing an experts&#8217; meeting. I also made an order directing the husband to reply to the wife&#8217;s schedule of deficiencies and further questionnaire. At the same hearing, being informed that the earlier valuation of the matrimonial home was no longer agreed, I provided for the appointment of a single valuer to value the property.

Lenders approached to provide a loan had requested an assignment of any share ordered by the court to be paid to him in the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home, the Knightsbridge flat, and the three properties in the South of France. On 31 January, I amended the freezing order as requested. On the same day, the husband having failed to comply with my order that he reply to the wife&#8217;s schedule of deficiencies and further questionnaire or with my order that he prepare a schedule of art works, the wife&#8217;s solicitors filed an application for a penal notice to be attached to those orders. The husband&#8217;s solicitors sought a variation in the earlier directions, which I approved without the imposition at that stage of a penal notice.  </p>

It was asserted that between January 2015 and July 2017, he spent a total of &#163;402,000 on his former girlfriend, Ms AZ. The schedule listed in detail specific expenses on holidays, restaurants, clothes, jewellery, shoes, and other luxury items. It was asserted that he had disposed of four family assets, including the Princess 42 boat, the Rolls-Royce, a Mercedes and a Land Rover, total value &#163;524,925. It was further asserted that the husband had dissipated significant sums raised by loans from Mr X, totalling approximately &#163;375,000. It was further contended that he had depleted a collateral bank account securing the mortgage by the sum of &#163;740,000. Including other sums unaccounted for, and subject to any explanation provided by the husband, it was asserted in the schedule that the total sum dissipated was in excess of &#163;8.5m.  </p>

He recorded that the husband had promised that information about those latter loans would be provided in the witness statement but added that, at the date of his report, however, no such statement had been provided. Both parties agree, albeit for different reasons, that the information provided to Mr Gillespie was incomplete and/or inaccurate and that, as a result, his report does not reflect a reliable valuation of the husband&#8217;s business assets.  </p>

In fact, the statements produced were from five witnesses &#8211; (1) the husband&#8217;s sister, (2) a friend of the husband, hereafter referred to as &#8220;Mr M&#8221;, who asserted that a number of art works in the matrimonial home were in fact loaned by him to the husband, (3) Mr X, (4) Mr Y, who is finance director of Mr X&#8217;s company and responsible for managing his personal and business investments, and (5) a man hereafter referred to as &#8220;Mr K&#8221;, who asserted in his statement that he was the director of C Finance and associated companies to which, he claimed, the husband was indebted to the sum of just under &#163;14m. The statements from Mr X and Mr Y had been served on the wife&#8217;s lawyers on 20 February, but the statement from Mr K was not served until late in the afternoon of 23 February. In addition to the five statements, the husband&#8217;s solicitors also served a number of other documents on 23 February, which purported to support his case as to the existence of a loan owed to C Finance and its associated companies. It was claimed that the reason for the very late disclosure was that the hoped-for funding for the husband&#8217;s legal representation did not materialise until 1 February 2018, (when a litigation loan of &#163;425,000 was agreed). As a result, his solicitors could not start work until after that date, and a huge amount of work had been necessary in preparing and taking the statements. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">The hearing started on 20 February 2018. In their opening submissions, counsel for the wife (Mr Timothy Bishop QC and Miss Katherine Cook) and for the husband (Mr Martin Pointer QC and Miss Judith Murray) presented their respective schedules of assets and liabilities. The wife&#8217;s schedule assessed the parties&#8217; joint net assets to be worth approximately &#163;3.6m, of which &#163;3m were attributed to the husband and &#163;600,000 to the wife. This calculation was based on a valuation of the matrimonial home of &#163;4.8m and included a figure for the wife&#8217;s &#8220;addback&#8221; claim of &#163;1.2m. It included the husband&#8217;s liabilities to Mr X and some of his other immediate liabilities, including the debts to HMRC, but not the alleged liabilities owed to the husband&#8217;s sister, his friend Mr M, or C Finance. The husband&#8217;s schedule asserted that the parties had net liabilities of approximately &#163;1.33m, with the husband&#8217;s net liabilities assessed at just under &#163;1.5m and the wife&#8217;s net assets at &#163;156,000. The basis for this calculation differed from the wife&#8217;s schedule in a number of respects. The valuation of the matrimonial home was &#163;9.5m  (that being the figure given at a much earlier stage of the proceedings). The schedule included different valuations for the parties&#8217; art collection and unlike the wife&#8217;s schedule included the parties&#8217; jewellery, the husband&#8217;s jewellery being valued at &#163;94,000 and the wife&#8217;s at &#163;789,000. Most importantly, the liabilities included, in addition to those owed to Mr X, sums said to be owed to the husband&#8217;s sister, his friend Mr M and C Finance. The figure given in the schedule for the liability to C Finance was just under &#163;9m.  </p>

On 7 March, some further documents were disclosed by HKH Kenwright and Cox, the solicitors acting for C Finance, replying to questions posed on behalf of the wife.

The solicitors provided &#8220;selected email communications between the husband and entities within the group of companies related to the loans and profit share agreements&#8221;. On 9 March, which was originally intended to be the last day of the hearing, Mr X gave evidence by telephone, the husband and wife were briefly recalled, and then Mr Y gave evidence in court.

I have been very conscious that the wife&#8217;s case is that the husband has fabricated the extent of his liabilities &#8211; in other words, lied to the court. It is incumbent on any judge faced with such a serious allegation to consider all the evidence carefully, bearing in mind the potential consequences of finding the allegation proved. </p>

If the liabilities are on the scale claimed by husband himself, he is insolvent &#8211; indeed, he is indebted to the sum of several million pounds &#8211; and all the other issues identified by the wife&#8217;s lawyers are of limited relevance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">On behalf of the wife, Mr Bishop argued in opening that the husband was a very shrewd operator in the world of high-end residential property development and as a result of his business success, substantial wealth could be generated during the marriage enabling the family to enjoy an excellent lifestyle. He made it clear that the wife did not accept the alleged liabilities to C Finance and complained that the husband&#8217;s litigation conduct had caused difficult computational issues. He accepted, however, that the reduction in value of the matrimonial home, coupled with the clarification of the high level of indebtedness to Mr X, meant that the current picture was a far cry from the lifestyle which the parties had lived during the marriage. He submitted that a realistic solution would be for the matrimonial home to be sold and the proceeds of sale and collateral accounts transferred to her to provide a housing fund. He proposed that other assets, including the three French properties and linked collateral accounts, be transferred to her to enable her to pay her debts and provide an interim income fund. He further proposed that the husband should pay the wife a series of lump sums equivalent to 50% of the net sums received by him on the completion and realisation of the three London development projects. On behalf of the husband, no open offer or detailed proposal was advanced at the start of the hearing. It was submitted that the outcome of the case would have to be a clean break between the parties, although it was acknowledged that the court would have to consider whether the clean break could be immediate or should be deferred to await the completion of the projects. </p>

The bank balances, including deposit accounts, were said to be approx. &#163;3.5m. The five properties listed included the matrimonial home in London, valued at &#163;9.5m, the Knightsbridge flat valued at &#163;1.6m, and the three properties in the South of France, two of which were valued at &#8364;7m (&#163;5,840,000) and the third at &#8364;2m (&#163;1,670,000), although the husband added in a footnote that in order to achieve &#8364;14m for the two larger properties &#8220;an additional &#8364;3m will be spent within the next 12 months&#8221;. The art collection was valued at approximately &#163;1m. Nine cars were listed with a total value said to be &#163;863,000, and a Princess 42 yacht valued at &#163;250,000. The total assets therefore amounted to just over &#163;30 million. The liabilities listed comprised credit cards of approximately &#163;20,000, four bank loans linked to properties, namely the matrimonial home (&#163;4.7m), the Knightsbridge flat (just over &#163;1m) and two of the South of France properties (&#163;1.1m and &#163;0.9m respectively), and further loans in respect of five of the cars totalling approximately &#163;400,000, making total liabilities approximately &#163;8.24m.

The figure given for the equity in the matrimonial home (&#163;4.75 m) was roughly equivalent to that portrayed in the earlier document, although the sums given for the market value and outstanding mortgage were significantly higher (&#163;11m and just under &#163;6m respectively). Similarly, the equity in the Knightsbridge flat was roughly equivalent, although the sums given for both the market value and outstanding mortgage were lower. The value given for the French properties was notably lower, being expressed as the current value, with a qualification that two of the properties were under development and would require investment of &#8364;2m over the next 12 months. The valuation given for the art collection was also lower (&#163;902,582), as was that given for the cars and boat (&#163;642,346), although other chattels - the contents of the former matrimonial home and watches - which had not appeared in the voluntary disclosure were included in the form E. The value of the various bank accounts and other bank investments was several hundred thousand pounds less than in the voluntary disclosure. The most significant variation, however, concerned the development transactions. Whereas in his voluntary disclosure the husband had estimated his interest in the three properties (A House, D House, and the Mayfair property) as approximately &#163;6.35m, with an expected profit of between &#163;5m and &#163;10m, he stated in his Form E that he held shares or an &#8220;equitable interest&#8221; in three companies involved in developing the three properties and estimated the value of his shares or interest in those companies at &#163;4.35m. Of even greater significance was his assertion, not mentioned in his voluntary disclosure six months earlier, of liabilities in the form of loans owed to a well-known businessman, thereafter referred to as &#8220;Mr X&#8221; totalling just over &#163;10m. In an annex to the Form E, it was asserted that the loan arrangements with Mr X had been made to enable the husband and his companies to participate in the three property development projects, together with the development of the French villas &#8220;and for cash flow purposes to meet personal and business expenses&#8221;. It is notable that the Form E did not refer to any other loan arrangements save for those involving Mr X.  </p>

In June 2016, the husband had asserted that the family&#8217;s assets were around &#163;20m, and his investments in development transactions were worth &#163;6.3 million with an anticipated profit of between &#163;5m and &#163;10m. The Form E, however, asserted that the value of his assets less liabilities was &#163;6m.  </p>

He replied that the earlier Statement &#8220;was an informal document prepared by the respondent without legal advice at an early stage to provide a broad overview, and contained errors and omissions. At that early stage, before having taken legal advice, the respondent felt uncomfortable discussing the extent of his liabilities to Mr X.&#8221; On behalf of the wife, it was submitted at the hearing before me that between the voluntary disclosure in June 2016 and the filing of the Form E in January 2017, there had been a significant breakdown in the parties&#8217; relationship and that, by the time the Form E was filed, the husband was fully engaged in seeking to minimise the wife&#8217;s financial remedies claim. </p>

It was only in giving his answers shortly before the hearing to questions posed by the wife&#8217;s expert, Mr Gillespie of FTI Consulting, that the husband asserted that a series of loans had been made between 2011 and 2014 totalling &#163;8,996,194 from U Properties, and that the loans had subsequently been refinanced by a profit share agreement relating to the three development properties A House, D House and Cottage and the Mayfair property.

In June 2016 I prepared for [the wife] a draft, one-page asset schedule. [She] has, throughout these proceedings, sought to rely heavily on this. As one might expect from a document prepared before I had legal advice &#8230; it contained errors and was incomplete &#8230; [She] has focused on the fact that the statement did not make provision for my loans from Mr X (which in May 2016 were the &#163;5m facility and the &#8364;1.1m villa loan). This is disingenuous, as [she] was present at our home in France when he and I agreed the &#163;5 million facility in June 2015 and thanked him personally for the loan during our dinner &#8230; that evening &#8230;. This was an omission from the schedule, but &#8230; my (sadly optimistic) thinking was to repay Mr X quickly (given the high interest rate) with refinancing from the completed villas and receipts/profits from [the Mayfair property], and that we would not then need to dip into our assets to repay him. The schedule did not explicitly refer to C Finance, but, as it was a summary schedule, I stated my investments in each of the three projects, totalling &#163;6.3m after deducting the sum I would need to repay my funding partner when the project exited, i.e. c &#163;8m (the revised SJE valuation for these assets is &#163;14m).&#8221; </p>

Mr Bishop suggested that the document contained information that would be of no interest to prospective investors or business partners, such as details of his credit card liabilities, the value of his art collection, and the cost of his expenditure on his children. The husband responded that such information was needed so that prospective investors could work out his affordability. </p>

He noted that the husband had asserted the reason for not mentioning Mr X in that schedule had been because he hoped to be able to repay the loans out of the proceeds of sale of the French villas and the Mayfair property. Mr Bishop asserted that this made no sense because the husband had included 100% of the value of the villas in the schedule and, if he was anticipating having to repay from that source, he could not possibly have left Mr X&#8217;s debt off the schedule. The husband retorted that he had left the debt off the schedule because  </p>

In his relatively brief statement, Mr X described how he had met the husband and wife socially some years ago and that in due course this connection led to his decision to invest in projects being undertaken by the husband and subsequently making personal loans. The detailed evidence about the financial relationship between Mr X and the husband was provided by Mr Y. Mr Y&#8217;s evidence was that Mr X&#8217;s loans and investment with the husband represent a very small proportion of his overall lending and business activity. Mr Y explained that over the past 10 years, he has routinely been involved in arranging loans to business contacts and friends of Mr X. In his statement, he explained that many of the loans made by Mr X to his friends are advanced in the knowledge that they carry a risk and are made on a basis which he would not normally accept in a strict business context. He therefore fully expects the loans to be repaid in the same good faith as they have been extended. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">In his statement Mr Y described in some detail the property investments that Mr X has made in joint business ventures with the husband. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this judgment to set out the details of those ventures. The following summary is sufficient. With regard to D House and Cottage, Mr X and the husband have invested approximately &#163;5 million each. They have also agreed that Mr X would receive a &#8220;preferred return&#8221; of 15% per annum on his equity before any division of profit with the husband. Mr Y explained that this figure is based on the level of return that Mr X would reasonably expect to obtain by investing in private equity ventures. Under this arrangement, he will receive the first &#163;4,273,000 of any return from D House. Mr Y added, however, that as a result of delays in completing the project, it has been &#8220;effectively mothballed&#8221; and significant additional bank funding will be required to complete it. With regard to the Mayfair property, Mr Y advised that the equity in the property is held as to 20% by the husband and 80% by a company owned by Mr X&#8217;s family trust. The husband is the developer of the property but there have been significant delays. Under the building contract, there is a penalty fee which requires the husband&#8217;s company, and the husband as guarantor, to pay &#163;10,000 per week for every week the project overruns the timetable. At the stage of practical completion of the development, the penalty fee ceased to accrue but by then it had exceeded &#163;1.5m. At present, the property is on the market for &#163;32m, although the professional valuation is no more than &#163;25m. If sold at that price, however, the project would make a loss. With regard to A House, Mr Y advised that Mr X and the husband are co-investors in the development, and that their respective shares are &#163;18.5m and &#163;6m. As with D House, it has been agreed that Mr X will receive a preferred return on his equity at 15% per annum. Mr Y advised that at present, this equates to around &#163;11m. Given the escalating cost of the project, Mr Y expressed the view that the prospect of the husband ever getting any return of even his embedded equity of &#163;6m would depend upon the property selling for a price in excess of &#163;55m. With a current valuation of &#163;42.5 million, Mr Y considered that any profit would be at best marginal and it was possible that the project would make a loss.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">Full details of the loans were set out in Mr Y&#8217;s statement and can be summarised as follows. The first loan, described as the &#8220;Villa facility&#8221; was agreed in November 2014 and was made to assist the husband to acquire one of the French properties listed above (described as &#8220;French property 2&#8221;), adjacent to another property (&#8220;French property 1&#8221;) which the husband already owned. He believed that the development of the two properties together represented a good investment opportunity. The second loan, of &#163;5m, was agreed in September 2015. &#163;2m was to be utilised as &#8220;seed capital&#8221; of future developments, a further &#163;2m to enable the husband to finalise the development of his villas in France, and the balance to clear specific debts and obligations. At that time, it was thought that the husband had about &#163;4.8m equity in A House and Mr X took security over that equity for the &#163;5m loan. Mr Y stressed, however, that repayment of the loan is not conditional on A House being developed successfully. If the loan is not repaid, and the husband&#8217;s equity in A House is insufficient, the loan will be enforced against his personal assets. A third loan of &#163;1.8m was advanced in May 2016. It was expressed as being for a 10 month term and thus due to be repaid by March 2017. Mr X took security for this loan against the husband&#8217;s interest in the Mayfair property. As stated above, that property is on the market for sale, but again Mr Y emphasised that repayment of the loan is not conditional on the sale of the property and if necessary would be enforceable against the husband&#8217;s personal assets. A fourth loan, in the sum of &#163;1.35m, was advanced in October 2016. By this stage, the divorce proceedings were under way and, as demonstrated in email exchanges exhibited by Mr Y to his statement (although not previously disclosed by the husband in these proceedings), Mr X and Mr Y had become concerned about the husband&#8217;s financial position and his extravagant spending. They advanced the money, however mainly because they realised that completing the Mayfair development project was the main impetus for the husband&#8217;s request for the loan and, as completion of that project was, in Mr Y&#8217;s phrase, &#8220;the first liquidity event on the horizon&#8221;, they realised that the husband needed help to complete the project in order to maximise their prospects of receiving repayment for the earlier loans. This loan was again secured against the husband&#8217;s interest in the Mayfair property. Statements made by the husband and Mr Y in their email exchanges in October 2016 are relied on heavily by the wife&#8217;s counsel in support of their interpretation of the husband&#8217;s financial position and are considered in more detail below. </p>

Those assets were sold and the loan is repaid. Subsequently, the husband requested further loans but Mr X and Mr Y declined these requests. Mr Y has exhibited to his statement </p>

The fact that she is evidently oblivious to these loans is therefore of some concern given the seemingly irrevocable breakdown of your marriage.

That document summarises the sources of evidence and attempts to demonstrate a full history of the transactions. In seeking to do so, however, it inevitably draws attention to gaps in that evidence. The documents disclosed by solicitors acting on behalf of C Finance during the hearing were piecemeal documents which in my judgement did not give anything approaching a complete picture of the alleged transactions. There were isolated copy emails and odd pages of bank statements. In some cases, the statements had been seemingly redacted </p>

During these transactions, the lawyer acting for C Finance was one Anthony Preston who, I was told during the hearing, has subsequently been struck off the roll. Having carefully considered the documents said to support it, I have reached the firm conclusion that the court has not been provided with the full picture. The documents disclosed do, however, provide some limited insight into what was going on. I give the following examples. </p>

I will arrange for her to sign a waiver of her right vis-&#224;-vis yourselves.&#8221; In the email dated the following day, however, he informed his clients that the husband &#8220;now tells me that his wife does not live at the property with him, therefore I have not sought the deed of postponement from her. I have no way of knowing whether this is true or not.&#8221; At all material times, the wife resided at the matrimonial home. She may have moved out of the property for a period while renovations were carried out, but this did not affect her rights to be informed of a charge registered on the property. If Mr Preston was accurately reporting what he had been told, it follows that the husband misled him. </p>

Those proceedings led to a possession order being made in respect of the matrimonial home in October 2009. In the event, however, the order was not enforced after the husband raised money from other sources. The emails disclosed are manifestly only a fraction of the documents which must have come into existence at this time. </p>

The emails also show Mr Preston warning his clients that the charge on the matrimonial home may not provide adequate security for the loans and that, when conducting negotiations, everything should be recorded in writing and marked without prejudice and subject to contract. At one point he warned them: &#8220;my firmest advice is not to have any discussions with him and to let matters take their course&#8221;, meaning presumably to allow the property to be repossessed. In another email (January 2010) Mr Preston reported to his clients that &#8220;as usual the story changes from day to day&#8221; and &#8220;it all seems rather far-fetched&#8221;.

Mr Preston retorted that he was concerned that funds had been sent to them direct by the husband&#8217;s solicitors when they knew that he was instructed. He asked on what basis the fund had been paid and whether the possession order was going to be enforced. He sent a chasing email a few weeks later.

It is impossible to draw any conclusions as to the true nature of the relationship between C Finance and the husband at this stage. It is clear, however, that relations deteriorated to a significant extent, that C Finance started proceedings to enforce their charge and got as far as obtaining a possession order, and that they were warned by their solicitor that there were grounds for thinking the husband was unreliable. Despite these difficulties, however, subsequent documents produced by C Finance in the course of the hearing suggest that, by 2011, only 18 months later, MO was again arranging further loans, this time connected with the acquisition and development of the Mayfair property. Once again, however, the very limited disclosure impedes a full understanding of the arrangement and in some respects, raises more questions than it answers. For example, in an email dated 9 August 2011, the husband wrote to MO saying: </p>

On the face of it, however, it seems rather that money was taken from the potential profit in the Mayfair property and put towards a French property transaction. It is also notable that the husband was informing MO that he would receive financial support in some form from his father, whom the wife asserts to have substantial assets in Iran. </p>

Few if any of these documents have been disclosed by the husband and relatively few of them were cited in the course of the hearing. They include a series of emails concerning a dispute that arose between the husband and the property investment company through which Mr X had originally provided financial support. I am conscious that this court has not been provided with the full picture concerning that company and the dispute which subsequently arose between Mr X and one of his colleagues, Ms E. I must therefore tread carefully when analysing this material. The emails show that the husband was challenged by Ms E and the company&#8217;s &#8220;Head of Legal&#8221; about information he had provided concerning transactions involving the Mayfair property. Most of the emails disclosed were copied to Mr Y. It would be disproportionate to set out the exchanges at length. Notably, however, the long series of questions included a number of enquiries about the husband&#8217;s relationship with U Properties. It was asserted that the husband&#8217;s company K Co and U Properties &#8220;are one and the same&#8221;, an assertion which the husband strenuously denied in a further email, as he has throughout these proceedings. In his lengthy reply responding to the various questions, the husband insisted that U Properties was nothing to do with him and forwarded an email from a lawyer who had acted for U Properties at the time of the acquisition of the Mayfair property in 2011 which confirmed that there was nothing to suggest any connection between U Properties and the husband. Confusingly, that lawyer was Mr Dalton who, as mentioned above, had acted for the husband in 2010 during the negotiations after C Finance obtained the possession order against the matrimonial home.  </p>

In that letter, the history of the dealings which were said to give rise to the current liabilities was summarised. First, it was asserted that in 2008, loans by C Finance to the husband, amounting to approximately &#163;2.4m, had been secured by a charge on the matrimonial home. The charge had been removed in circumstances in 2011. It was asserted that C Finance were unaware that it had been removed and that </p>

It was further asserted that on 20 April 2014, the husband had admitted orally to MO that he had dishonestly procured the removal of the charge. In the circumstances, the solicitors declared that C Finance was clearly entitled to apply to rectify the register to reinstate the charge. They added, however, that &#8220;if you would prefer not to re-register the charge (whether in view of your ongoing divorce proceedings or for any other reason), our clients will be willing to consider accepting alternative security provided it is of greater or equivalent value to the charge.&#8221; The total personal liability of the husband to C Finance secured by the charge was said to amount at 31 March 2017 to &#163;4,631,878. </p>

C Finance had loaned the husband personally a total of &#163;6.18m for the purposes of financing the purchase and development by his company of the properties. The loan had been on the basis that, upon the sale of properties, he would repay the capital together with 75% of any profits he made. The properties were then sold to a group of investors (including the husband and/or one or more of his companies) which the husband had brought together. He had agreed his liability to C Finance in respect of this transaction in the sum of &#163;1,378,787, on the basis that he would also pay C Finance 50% of any profits made by him or his companies from an onward sale by the investor group. Under a deed of assignment dated 22 August 2016, he had then assigned to C Finance his interest in a loan agreement between himself and his company, amounting to &#163;7,350,866. </p>

C Finance and U Properties had agreed to provide a bridging loan on that basis on terms that, upon the sale of A House, the husband would repay the principal sum of &#163;1 million, the sums owed in respect of D House and Cottage, and 50% of any profit made on the A House project.

On that date, the husband&#8217;s solicitors served a statement from Mr K, who described himself as the director of C Finance and U Properties.

It was submitted by Mr Bishop that the documents exhibited were manifestly insufficient evidence of the genuineness of the alleged transactions.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">In his statement, Mr K proceeded to outline brief details of the alleged loans. He stated that C Finance had started working with the husband in 2007, having been introduced &#8220;by an independent broker, MO&#8221;, adding that &#8220;MO continues to be a point of contact for both C Finance and [the husband] in relation to the communications and management of the various loans&#8221;. In respect of the Mayfair property, he asserted that sums totalling &#163;5.1m had been loaned on several occasions in 2011 and 2012, all made via Daltons solicitors. He asserted that the secured principal had been repaid, but the profit share and a side loan remained outstanding. The terms of the deal had been that C Finance would purchase the property and thereafter the husband&#8217;s investor group would purchase it from C Finance for redevelopment at a profit. A similar arrangement had been agreed with regards to D House. The sum of &#163;6.1m had been loaned on three dates in 2012, again via D Solicitors, with profits to be split 75/25 in C Finance&#8217;s favour. An adjoining property, D Cottage, had been added later. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in;text-indent:0in">The statement continues: &#8220;By December 2012, the completions of the purchases were done in [the husband&#8217;s] name to allow him to control both projects and arrange bank finance. In May 2014, the sale of the property into [the husband&#8217;s] investor group fell through. It was agreed by [him] with C Finance that both parties would own 50% of the profit share moving forward once C Finance is repaid in full, which [the husband] would look for replacement investors.&#8221; It was asserted that, at present, the whole sum invested by C Finance in D House and Cottage, plus projected profit share, remains outstanding.  In respect of A House, the statement merely said that the loan of &#163;1m had been advanced in April 2014 &#8220;from C Finance&#8217;s lending accounts&#8221;.  </p>

It was asserted that the loans had been advanced from C Finance&#8217;s lending accounts as well as group companies related to C Finance. Mr K added that the loans had been made with the wife&#8217;s knowledge, adding that MO had told him that he had met the wife on several occasions and that the husband had confirmed that she had consented to the loans. Those loans were secured against the matrimonial home by a registered legal charge in favour of C Finance which had subsequently been removed &#8220;without the consent of C Finance&#8221;. According to Mr K&#8217;s statement, the husband told him that </p>

Those documents that were produced were in some instances strikingly informal, e.g. an email from the husband to MO and a colleague simply requesting them to send &#163;1m to lawyers acting for the exchange on A House, and giving details for an electronic bank transfer. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">In a second statement dated 14 March 2018, Mr K explained that he had made himself available to give evidence on 8 March 2018 and on the afternoon of 9 March but, when his oral evidence had not been reached by late afternoon that day, he had to resume his Friday prayers and thus was not available when called. He further stated that, on the date on which the resumed hearing had been listed, he would be attending a long-planned family celebration in South Africa and was therefore unable to attend the hearing in person, although he was able and willing to give evidence by video link. In his second statement, Mr K exhibited a letter dated 8 March 2018 authorising Mr S to represent his companies in his absence. He explained that Mr S was a consultant who had originally been engaged on an investment project in which U Properties was co-investor and subsequently had been engaged by C Finance since 2017 on a monthly basis to implement security with the husband for his outstanding liabilities. He was therefore completely familiar with the husband&#8217;s dealings with the company. Mr K added that he had authorised Mr S to collate for his approval information and documentation from company records for the first draft of Mr K&#8217;s first statement, and to provide the answers to questions and supporting documents provided before the first hearing. So far as I am aware, the existence of Mr S, and his role in C Finance&#8217;s affairs, had not been mentioned before Mr K&#8217;s second statement was filed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in"> In passing, I note that his statement that he had learnt of these proceedings in early February was seemingly inconsistent with the earlier documents, notably the letter dated 12 August 2017 sent to the wife by HKH on behalf of C Finance in which they refer to the ongoing divorce proceedings. It is conceivable, however, that by &#8220;proceedings&#8221; he meant &#8220;the hearing&#8221;. In addition, however, the inference that he had not been available to give evidence in London at any point after early February was seemingly inconsistent with the assertion in his second statement that he had been available to give evidence on Friday, 8 March until obliged to leave to continue his religious observances. </p>

When asked whether C Finance had accounts with a conventional balance sheet and profit and loss account, he replied &#8220;possibly&#8221; and referred the question to Mr S. He was also unclear whether there would be a written profit share agreement, adding that he had hundreds of agreements all over the world and he could not recall any specific one. He was unfamiliar with the details of the bank accounts, and unable to recall the reason behind the execution of the deed of assignment. He was not sure of the amount he was owed by the husband and again referred that question to Mr S.  He stated that &#8220;you have to speculate to accumulate.

He described the process in which he had been engaged as part of an effort to correct issues between the husband and his lenders, and said that he had been one of the first to point out that those issues were far from ideal. There were no traditional structured loan agreements, just many communications between the parties which the lawyers said amounted to a contract. In the event that the parties were going through litigation, it would be difficult to justify why there was no title loan agreement. It was therefore Mr S&#8217;s evidence that, when he became involved in these matters, he set about arranging a more formal structure to be put in place.

As the transfers would generally be made with funds being paid through solicitors, the path of the money is clear and well documented &#8230; Mr X was not aware of our involvement in funding [the husband&#8217;s] share of the three deals &#8230;. This does not surprise me at all, as it is in my experience is not an uncommon practice in property deals to keep funding arrangements private from joint venture partners.&#8221;   </p>

MO added that in 2017, C Finance had engaged Mr S, a consultant, to work directly for Mr K with new solicitors HKH Kenwright and Cox &#8220;to ensure that the loans were disclosed in the divorce proceedings and that replacement security in lieu of the charge that had been removed was put in place&#8221;.  In his oral evidence, he said that C Finance did not remove the charge. He said that the husband had told him that it had been removed by mistake by his lawyer, Mr Dalton, but MO asserted that the husband and wife had presented the forms to the Land Registry. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">In her statement, the wife asserted that she and the husband had been fortunate to live a luxurious lifestyle for many years during the marriage. They lived in a substantial property in West London and had a three-bedroom duplex apartment in the South of France where they had boat moorings and kept a Princess 42 motor yacht. They had a valuable art collection, with works by a number of well-known modern artists. They had nine or more expensive cars, including a Rolls-Royce Phantom, a Lamborghini and a Ferrari, many with personalised number plates. They employed staff, including housekeepers and drivers, at both their London and France homes. They would spend seven weeks in the south of France every summer and would, according to the wife, often hire a large yacht to cruise around the Cote D&#8217;Azur and over to Corsica. They often travelled to the holiday home by private chartered jet which allowed them to transport their dogs. The wife further asserts that they spent &#8220;a fortune&#8221; on holidays. They would travel long distance for the October half term holidays to places such as </p>

At the February half term, they went skiing in Courchevel. At Easter, they would often travel to the United States or Mexico. They also enjoyed mini break holidays in New York, Paris and Cannes. When travelling, they always stayed in luxury hotels. Both in London and abroad, they frequently ate out at the best restaurants, and the husband was a member of well-known nightclubs. The husband would purchase expensive jewellery, handbags and clothes for the wife. They spent considerable sums on their children. In her statement, the wife said: &#8220;our children have wanted for nothing and we have provided them with luxury cars and parties&#8221;. All three children were privately educated. The two younger children are currently in further education. The oldest daughter has been trying to pursue a career in the music business. To assist this, the husband has spent considerable sums of money - perhaps as much as $1m. The parties also spent considerable sums on charitable donations. </p>

She relies, for example, on his decision to rent an apartment in Mayfair at a cost of &#163;9,500 per month, rather than live in his existing smaller Knightsbridge flat. Having obtained disclosure of his passport and evidence of his British Airways flights since separation, she points to travel to a variety of destinations across the world, including Mykonos, Ibiza, the Maldives, Biarritz, Luxembourg, Necker Island, Beirut and Spain, and that he travels every weekend to their holiday home in the South of France. On one occasion he spent a significant sum in connection with a dinner party for Ms AZ &#8211; the wife&#8217;s representatives suggest &#163;130,000, but the husband&#8216;s evidence was that there has been double counting and the sum spent was only &#163;60,00. The husband rejected Mr Bishop&#8217;s assertion that it had been a wedding ceremony, but described it as a &#8220;celebration of love&#8221;. Although his relationship with Ms AZ has come to an end, the wife asserts that he is now in a relationship with another woman with whom he travels frequently. For her part, the wife said in her statement that she was now in a relationship with another man although has no intentions of cohabiting or remarrying. On behalf of the wife, it is asserted that the husband&#8217;s behaviour is totally inconsistent with his assertions that he has liabilities valued at many millions of pounds and is wholly unreasonable given his failure to comply with the maintenance pending suit order. In addition, he has failed to maintain the matrimonial home - for example, failing to pay for repairs to the boiler so that the house was without heating for several months over the last winter.  </p>

In addition, at the date of the breakdown of the marriage in June 2016, he had over &#163;1.72m in his bank accounts, according to the asset schedule disclosed in June 2016. It was said in submissions on the wife&#8217;s behalf that the husband therefore got through about &#163;4.2m in the two years or so since the parties&#8217; separation. Mr Bishop submitted that the wife has seen relatively little of that money. In all the circumstances, he argued that a figure of &#163;1.2m should be included by way of &#8220;add back&#8221; in the calculation of any award made to the wife. In addition, the wife seeks payment of the outstanding MPS arrears. The husband is very substantially in arrears of the MPS order and, whilst he has paid some of the overheads on the matrimonial home, other bills, including utilities and mortgage, have on occasions gone unpaid. </p>

In his statement he said that he had never sought to underplay the details of the lifestyle which they eventually came to enjoy as a family. He described himself as a wholly self-made man who had been able to build up an extremely comfortable lifestyle for himself and his family in the course of the marriage through his sheer determination and hard work. It was his case, however, that the family finances had unfortunately become hugely overstretched and funded by ever increasing borrowing. He maintained that he had tried to impress upon the wife that she needed to make economies but she refused to compromise her expenditure, proceeding to buy dresses, shoes and other expensive items. He said that, when he protested as to whether she needed another Herve Leger dress, she replied: &#8220;Go to hell, it is not a matter of I need, it&#8217;s a matter of I want&#8221;, or words to that effect.

In addition, it is argued that the three French properties should be transferred to the wife along with the linked collateral accounts. Mr Bishop argued that the husband should be obliged to indemnify the wife for any outstanding debts on the properties, including any tax liabilities, over and above the mortgages. It is pointed out that the husband had not provided any updating disclosure as to the value of outstanding liabilities on the French properties.

In addition, it is contended that the following sums should also be paid to the wife out of the net profits received by the husband from three development projects (a) all arrears owed under the MPS order and costs orders made against the husband and (b) a payment equivalent to 50% of the sum of &#163;1.2m claimed by way of &#8220;addback&#8221;.  </p>

Mr Bishop insists, however, that the husband should be obliged to indemnify the wife for any liability she is found to have incurred to Mr X. In the event that the husband refuses to give an undertaking to that effect, Mr Bishop asks for a reverse contingent lump sum to cover any potential liability. Mr Bishop submits that, given the husband&#8217;s conduct to date, &#8220;watertight security and safeguards&#8221; will have to be put in place to prevent him removing any further interest from these projects so as to defeat the wife&#8217;s claims. These safeguards should include full disclosure obligations in relation to the progress of the three developments and the process of realising the profits.

On this issue, the wife&#8217;s primary position is that the court should conclude that, on a balance of probabilities, no such liability exists. In the alternative, if the court is satisfied that the husband does owe money to either of those companies, either by way of outstanding loans or profit share arrangement, it is submitted on behalf the wife that such sums will not be payable or enforceable until the completion and realisation of the three London development projects. As a result, the only impact on the outcome proposed on behalf the wife would be to reduce her share in the net proceeds following realisation of those developments. It should not affect the transfer to her of the matrimonial home or the three French properties. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">As set out above, a central feature of Mr Bishop&#8217;s cross-examination of the husband concerned the statement of assets and liabilities sent to the wife on 27 June 2016. In closing submissions, Mr Bishop submitted that the husband&#8217;s evidence on this issue had been dishonest. In particular, it was untrue that the purpose of the document was part of a package for a pitch to future investors and joint venture partners. In the covering email enclosing the statement of assets, the husband made clear that he recognised that the document would be scrutinised by the wife&#8217;s advisers. In his s.25 statement, served on the first day of the hearing, the husband asserted that he had prepared this document in June 2016 for the wife. He did not state that the document was prepared as a pitch for future investors. The assertion that the document was prepared as a pitch for future investors was first made by the husband during his evidence in chief. In cross-examination, the husband was unable to account for his failure to provide this explanation before he went in the witness box. Furthermore, an examination of the document shows that it must have been intended for the wife and her advisers. The contents of the document are clearly relevant to the wife and the division of the matrimonial assets. It would make no sense to tell potential investors about the husband&#8217;s credit card debts, school fees obligations and art collection. </p>

Although no creditor is identified by name in the document, it is his case that the calculations take into account sums owed to C Finance and U Properties but not the sums owed to Mr X.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">Fourthly, Mr Bishop submits that the independent evidence concerning the history of the loans made by Mr X to the husband supports the argument that the June 2016 statement was a broadly accurate summary of the husband&#8217;s financial position at that point. Whilst the document does not mention Mr X by name, his debts are reflected in the figures contained in the document for the husband&#8217;s equity interests in the three London development properties. Mr Bishop relies on the evidence of Mr Y and in particular his schedule of the husband&#8217;s liabilities to Mr X under his personal loans set out at paragraph 69 above. As at June 2016, the Villa facility had been in existence for about 19 months and Mr Bishop and Miss Cook calculate that the sum outstanding under that facility was then &#163;1.1m. At the same date, the loan of &#163;5m had been in existence for about nine months and had therefore incurred interest (at 15% per annum) of about &#163;562,500. The loan of &#163;1.8m had only been advanced a month before the June 2016 voluntary disclosure and had therefore only incurred a small amount of interest. Mr Bishop therefore submits that, as at 27 June 2016, the total sum owed to Mr X under the personal loans, including interest, was &#163;8.4m. Deducting this figure from the value of the husband&#8217;s equity in the three London developments (&#163;14.8m), one arrives at a figure of &#163;6.4m. The figure given in the June 2016 statement of assets was &#163;6.35 million. Mr Bishop submits that this reconciliation plainly supports the wife&#8217;s case that the figures set out in the June 2016 statement took into account the debt owed to Mr X under the personal loans than outstanding. He submits that it would be an unbelievable coincidence if the deduction of some other debt, for example the debt which the husband claims to be owed to C Finance, resulted in a net residual amount of the same sum as the deduction of the actual debts to Mr X which are now known to have existed at that date. </p>

He characterises the husband&#8217;s oral evidence on this issue, which is quoted at some length above, as comprising him standing in the witness box for a long time saying nothing. </p>

Mr Bishop submits that this is extremely significant because the husband would never have shown the document to Mr Y in the course of seeking a further loan if it did not truly make provision for the sums already owed to Mr X. Furthermore, Mr Bishop submits </p>

The wife&#8217;s case is that the husband is therefore a self-confessed liar - the question is whether he has lied to Mr X or to this court. It is a central plank of Mr Bishop&#8217;s case that the husband would never have misled Mr X and Mr Y in the way that he now claims he did. Given the context of their commercial relationship, Mr Bishop submits that this is &#8220;inconceivable, even for someone as dishonest, unscrupulous and adventurous as the husband&#8221;. Lying to Mr X and leaving him without any security for his debts would be, in Mr Bishop&#8217;s phrase, &#8220;financial suicide for the husband and would expose him to action for both breach of contract and fraud&#8221;. Given that these assertions are made in the context of bitterlycontested divorce proceedings in which the husband is seeking to defeat or restrict the wife&#8217;s claim for financial remedies, Mr Bishop and Miss Cook submit that it is much more plausible that the husband is lying to this court about the existence of the debt to C Finance. </p>

Within his Form E, he stated that he had &#8220;made loan arrangements, to allow me and my companies to participate in the above property development projects&#8221; and gave details of the indebtedness to Mr X. It is submitted that there was simply no good reason for his failure to refer at all to any indebtedness to C Finance or U Properties in his Form E, nor at the hearings of the first appointment, the MPS application, or the freezing order application, or in any documents filed in connection with those hearings.

Mr Bishop submits that it is extraordinary that there are no loan agreements relating to any of the sums said to be owed by the husband to C Finance. Any lender would want complete clarity as to the arrangements for repayment, interest and security. Mr Bishop contends that the absence of such evidence is a potent factor in assessing the likelihood of the true existence of the </p>

He further submits that the explanation provided by MO in his oral evidence &#8211; that contracts are not needed because the terms are sufficiently contained in an exchange of emails &#8211; is wholly implausible. In any event, he argues that it provides no explanation in this case because, despite requests, no such emails have been produced. Mr Bishop makes a similar submission about the absence of any written agreement, or evidence of any agreement, concerning the alleged joint venture arrangements between the husband and C Finance and associated companies. In answer to Mr Gillespie in February 2018, the husband asserted that the original security for the loans from C Finance and U Properties &#8220;lay against&#8221; the three London development properties, but that since 2014 &#8220;the current security is the joint venture agreement &#8230; on the basis that C Finance would participate in the profits&#8221;. Mr Bishop relies on the fact that no copy of the joint venture agreement has ever been produced, and such documents as have been produced are either inconsistent or incomplete (for example, the so-called &#8220;statutory declaration&#8221; from October 2017). </p>

Mr Bishop submits that the suggestion that the charge was removed without the knowledge of C Finance is completely implausible, that the obvious explanation was that it was removed by C Finance when it was no longer required, and that the assertion that it should now be restored is part of the fiction which is now being put forward. Mr Bishop highlights other odd features of the C Finance aspect of the case &#8211; that, despite allegedly advancing millions of pounds, they have done nothing to recover the money; that some of the solicitors they have engaged do not have the appearance of professionals engaged in high finance work; that C Finance applied to intervene in the proceedings on the day before the hearing was due to start, and then changed their minds the following day, and that the alleged director and proprietor of the company seemed to know little if anything about the details of the business with the husband.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">Turning to the documents eventually produced by the husband, or rather by those representing C Finance, and relied on by the husband as evidence of the genuineness of the liabilities to that company, Mr Bishop and Miss Cook make the following submissions. With regard to the 2012 deed of assignment, exhibited without explanation to Mr K&#8217;s statement, they point out that the SJE found no reference to the assignment in K Co&#8217;s books, and that the document was not referred to by either the husband or MO. In respect of the October 2016 assignment, they point out again that no reference to it was found in K Co&#8217;s books by either Miss Hall or Mr Gillespie, nor was it referred to in Mr K&#8217;s statement, even though he purports to be a signatory. Mr Bishop submits that the timing of this assignment, occurring just after the parties&#8217; separation and the worsening of their relationship, is very suspicious. Similar points are made about the statutory declaration - never mentioned to the experts, nor in the statement drafted for by Mr K to sign. Mr Bishop submits that it is unclear why such a document will be required if the August 2016 assignment was genuine. As for the &#8220;Heads of Terms&#8221; document eventually produced by solicitors acting for C Finance, it is again pointed out that no reference to the document was found in K Co&#8217;s records, nor was it mentioned by the husband at any point prior to his oral evidence, nor by Mr K in his statement.

The concept of the burden of proof, which has always been one of the main factors inhibiting the drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of evidence or disclosure, cannot be applied in the same way to proceedings of this kind as it is in ordinary civil litigation. These considerations are not a licence to engage in pure speculation. But judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to draw on their experience and to take notice of the inherent probabilities when deciding what an uncommunicative husband is likely to be concealing. I refer to the husband because the husband is usually the economically dominant party, but of course the same applies to the economically dominant spouse whoever it is.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">Looking to the future, Mr Bishop and Miss Cook submit that the parties face very different prospects. They describe the wife&#8217;s position as immensely vulnerable and entirely static, with no meaningful earning capacity and thus dependent on whatever remedy she receives at the end of these proceedings. In contrast, the husband&#8217;s position is dynamic. Not only does he have the opportunity to proceed with his ongoing property developments, but in addition he has over the years earned substantial fees in relation to other property transactions, with a proven earning capacity on a contractual basis as a project manager. In addition, it is the wife&#8217;s case that she believes that the husband had business connections and interests elsewhere in the world - France, Singapore, Malaysia and Iran, where she asserts that his father owns many properties - although she has been unable to produce further evidence about these connections and interests. Mr Bishop described the husband&#8217;s oral evidence as having compounded the picture of a man unwilling to economise, who treats the need to live prudently as something of a joke. In contrast, the wife has been left in difficult financial circumstances with no guaranteed means of support. Mr Bishop submitted that the husband had added to the wife&#8217;s financial difficulties by causing hugely inflated legal fees as a result of his ever-changing and, on Mr Bishop&#8217;s case, essentially dishonest presentation of his means, his failure to obey court orders, and his late and very incomplete introduction of evidence. It is therefore submitted that the court can safely conclude that he is a man who has dissipated assets and that this dissipation should be reflected in the distribution of what is left. This underpins the wife&#8217;s argument in support of &#8220;addback&#8221;. I shall consider that issue separately below. </p>

They rely on the well-established principle, however, that, where bankruptcy proceedings are pending, this court retains its full powers to make a lump sum and/or property adjustment order against the party who is at risk of becoming bankrupt: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mullard v Mullard</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1982) 3 FLR 330" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">(1982) 3 FLR 330</ref>. They acknowledge that the making of a bankruptcy order prior to the making of a financial remedies order would curtail the range of remedies available to the court in that, whilst a lump sum order may still be made, and thereby becomes a proveable debt in the bankruptcy, no property adjustment order is permitted. Where a property adjustment order is made prior to a bankruptcy order, the trustee in bankruptcy takes the property subject to the transferee&#8217;s equitable interest under the order so that the transferee is entitled to enforce the transfer of property order against the trustee: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mountney v Treherne</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2002/1174" uk:canonical="[2002] EWCA Civ 1174" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWCA Civ 1174</ref>.

They submit, however, that in practice the overall asset position is negative so that careful thought is required as to how to meet each party&#8217;s needs. Furthermore, the court must avoid making an order that could be set aside in the bankruptcy proceedings. It was accepted that the court will want to see that the wife is housed. It was recognised that if possible that the new property should be in the area of west London where she has lived for many years. It was submitted, however, that the property would have to be considerably smaller than the former matrimonial home. Although it was recognised that the wife has a revenue requirement, it was submitted that it is difficult to see how this can be provided when the husband has no income. </p>

His inability to obtain representation was attributable to the making of the freezing order on 11 August 2017, the failure of that order to make any provision for his legal costs until amended by my order on 31 January 2018, and difficulties experienced in obtaining a legal funding loan, with applications being refused on two occasions before a loan was eventually granted in February 2018. It was submitted that, for these reasons, the husband was only able to begin preparing his case 15 days before the final hearing and, as a result, his case was significantly prejudiced, not least because it turned to a considerable extent on evidence from third parties which was beyond his control.  </p>

Mr Pointer and Miss Murray acknowledge the absence of formal loan agreement documentation at the time the alleged liabilities were incurred, but submit that this was how the business was conducted. They urge the court to avoid what they characterised as an inappropriate Anglo-Saxon perspective. The absence of formality in respect of all the loans demonstrates how common this modus operandi is. In oral submissions Mr Pointer observed that funding arrangements involving Muslims have to be structured in a way that does not demonstrate interest, which was another reason why no formal written loan agreements were executed. </p>

Mr Pointer submitted that the total gross profits over the period of 20 years plus has been &#163;7.75 million gross, amounting to under &#163;6 million after tax.

They submit that the source of that backing was Mr K. The evidence, in the form of emails and bank statements, demonstrate that the loans from C Finance and associated companies all predate, and were all plainly made to facilitate, the purchase of the three properties. In contrast, the loans from Mr X all occurred sometime after those properties were acquired. The wife had failed to demonstrate how the husband had afforded the very substantial sums invested in the three London development properties. The funds invested in the properties must come from somewhere and Mr Pointer submitted that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the source of those funds was C Finance and associated companies. </p>

Mr Pointer and Ms Murray submit that a careful study of the arithmetic demonstrates that, in setting out the figures for the three London development properties in that statement, the husband deducted the sums borrowed from C Finance and not those borrowed from Mr X. Drawing on figures given at various points by the husband and in the documents disclosed on behalf of C Finance, they put forward the following calculation: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">Mr Pointer and Miss Murray submit that the arrears under the MPS order should not be enforced or otherwise taken into account in the final order. They assert that, at the hearing of the MPS application, the wife was clearly not frank with the court in respect of her knowledge of the husband&#8217;s straitened financial circumstances. To her knowledge the husband was at that stage paying all the costs of running the former matrimonial home, totalling over &#163;20,000 per month, plus a further &#163;10,000 per month for discretionary spending. In addition, he was paying the youngest child&#8217;s school fees and allowances to all three children totalling &#163;3,400 per month. The wife was also aware that the husband had not at that stage sold a property for several years and owed money to Mr X. The level of MPS claimed and ordered was never manageable. Furthermore, the husband&#8217;s representatives complain that the subsequent orders made by Roberts J on 11 August 2017 and Cohen J in November 2017 on the wife&#8217;s application for enforcement of the MPS order, including orders for interim sale of chattels, were outwith the court&#8217;s jurisdiction: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">WS v HS</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2018/11" uk:canonical="[2018] EWFC 11" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWFC 11</ref>. The husband made an application to vary the MPS order on 2 August 2017 which was listed to be heard at the final hearing. In the circumstances, it is accepted on behalf of the husband that, given the financial constraints and the parties&#8217; respective needs, there are insufficient resources to adjust the final determination either way, although it is argued that the wife&#8217;s pursuit of MPS at an unjustifiable level has led to unnecessary and wasted costs. In addition to their complaints concerning the wife&#8217;s MPS claim, Mr Pointer and Miss Murray point to other examples of what they assert is litigation conduct on the part of the wife which should be taken into account by the court in considering her application. Complaint is made about the very late preparation of the bundles, which hampered the strenuous efforts by the husband&#8217;s legal team to get up to speed with the case in the few days available before the hearing; the failure to file her s.25 statement before the first day of the hearing; and </p>

His evidence about the June 2016 statement of assets and liabilities was striking &#8211; he was unable to provide a coherent account as to why he would send to the wife from whom he was recently separated a summary of his financial position that exaggerated his wealth to the tune of several million pounds. His final explanation in oral evidence &#8211; that it was part of a pitch for future investors &#8211; was not mentioned until he went into the witness box. It was not suggested in correspondence, nor in any of the documents filed on his behalf, including his s. 25 statement filed on the first day of the hearing. It was a simple explanation and, if true, it is difficult to see why it was not put forward earlier. In fact, in his s.25 statement, he had confirmed that the document was prepared for the wife and her advisers as stated in the email sent to her on 27 June 2016, an explanation he withdrew in the witness box. As the transcript of his evidence set out above demonstrates, he was unable to explain why. </p>

I find that on occasions he has shown little regard for court orders or court rules. Whilst it is undoubtedly true that the presentation of his case was to a certain extent affected by the fact that he was for some time acting in person, I do not accept Mr Pointer&#8217;s submission that he was, as a result significantly prejudiced. Any competent man of business such as the husband ought to be able to comply with court rules, for example as to the disclosure of documents. His failure to comply with his obligations to give full and frank disclosure has been deliberate and wilful. If any party has suffered as a result of his lack of representation, it is the wife, who has had to respond to documents being produced in dribs and drabs and at the last minute. Of course, those representing the husband latterly have had to do a great deal of work in a short period of time. I am extremely grateful to all counsel and their instructing solicitors for all that they have done. But the principal blame for the difficulties in presenting and adjudicating on this case lies with the husband and his failure to give full and frank disclosure. I agree with Mr Bishop and Miss Cook that his approach to this litigation can be summed up in the phrase &#8220;catch me if you can&#8221;. </p>

None of the three witnesses was reliable. Mr K was literally a useless witness in these proceedings since he had nothing useful to say at all about the alleged transactions. The way in which this evidence was put before the court, through the mouth of a man whom had no knowledge of it significantly undermines its credibility.  This court deplores the way in which the witness statements purporting to set out the evidence given by witnesses related to C Finance were drafted and put before the court. It is manifestly wrong and misleading for a statement to be signed by a witness who is unable to attest to the truth of its contents. By putting the information concerning the alleged transactions with the husband in a statement signed by a man purporting to be &#8220;the director of C Finance and U Properties&#8221;, those responsible for drafting the document (not, I stress, the solicitors acting for the husband in these proceedings) were manifestly seeking to add a false authority to that information. In fact, having heard his oral evidence, I am not persuaded that Mr K is indeed the director of C Finance or U Properties. Who exactly is behind those companies - whether it be the Russian oligarch mentioned at one point in the papers, or somebody else - is unclear, and this court is certainly not going to speculate further about that. </p>

Furthermore, it seems that he had prepared the paperwork and the documents produced for the court, including Mr K&#8217;s &#8220;statements&#8221;, and the misleading way in which that task was undertaken casts considerable doubt on Mr S&#8217;s credibility. </p>

MO emphatically denies that allegation. I have no hesitation in accepting the evidence of the wife.

One example is the development of another property in London, P Lofts, which the limited disclosure suggested had involved transactions between the husband and C Finance although Mr K, Mr S and MO seemed to have little, if any, knowledge about it. </p>

In addition, if there were genuine loans made by C Finance and associated companies to the husband and his company, there would unquestionably be some record in the company&#8217;s books. Neither the SJE, Miss Hall, nor the wife&#8217;s expert accountant Mr Gillespie unearthed any such document. The very thin documents that have eventually been produced fall far short of providing reliable and proper support for the husband&#8217;s assertions. </p>

Those representing C Finance insisted that it was removed without their knowledge or consent by the husband acting fraudulently. They were unable, however, to produce any documentary evidence to support that assertion, which, if true, would mean that the husband had committed a serious criminal offence. The husband&#8217;s case is that it was indeed removed at the direction of C Finance. The picture is clouded further by the fact that the solicitor who removed it, purporting to act on behalf of C Finance, also acted on occasions for the husband, including at one stage in negotiations concerning the possession order. It is, however, not necessary for this court to reach any conclusion about what happened. The evidence about this matter, however, gives further support to the wife&#8217;s case that the court has not been given the full picture about the relationship between C Finance and the husband. </p>

Mr Pointer submitted that the arithmetical calculations put forward on behalf of the wife&#8217;s contrary case are wrong. If he is right, this would provide some support for the claim that the C Finance loans were genuine. Having carefully considered the rival calculations, however, I find that Mr Pointer is mistaken in submitting that the arithmetic in the calculations put forward on behalf of the wife does not add up. I accept Mr Bishop&#8217;s submissions, as set out above, that the extent of the husband&#8217;s indebtedness to Mr X in May/June 2016 is consistent with the summary of his business assets in the statement of assets and liabilities sent to the wife on 27 June 2016. </p>

Although the marriage had broken down, relations between the parties had not deteriorated to the level to which they fell a few months later. In his covering email enclosing the statement, the husband described himself as being sorry for all that had happened and for the pain that he had caused, said that he would be happy in the very near future to explain in detail all the balances and provide documentary evidence, and added that the information in the statement of assets was for the use of the wife and her advisers. Manifestly, the husband was referring to the wife&#8217;s legal advisers, and his attempts to suggest otherwise in his oral evidence were disingenuous. By the time of his Form E, however, relations between the parties had deteriorated and the husband&#8217;s attitude to the wife, and her claim for financial remedies, had hardened. </p>

I accept all of Mr Bishop&#8217;s submissions on that issue. In particular, I accept the submission that husbands generally, and this husband in particular, never overstate the assets in voluntary disclosure at the outset of divorce proceedings and that it would have been madness for the husband to overstate his financial position to the extent now claimed because any deal based on that disclosure would have been very unfavourable to him. I also accepted the submission that the husband would never have shown the document to Mr Y in the course of seeking a further loan, as I am satisfied he did if it did not truly make provision for the sums already owed to Mr X. It follows that the husband&#8217;s assertions in his Form E, in particular his claim that the sums owed to Mr X under the personal loan should be deducted from the value of his business interests, were a deliberate attempt to mislead the wife and the court as to his true financial position. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.81in">Drawing all these threads together, I have reached a firm conclusion that the loans alleged to been made by C Finance are a fiction. The truth is, as Mr Bishop put it to the husband in cross-examination, that he has procured the assistance of his acquaintances and offshore associates to try to create evidence to defeat the wife&#8217;s claim. I accept that sums may have been transferred from C Finance and U Properties to the husband but not under the loan agreements alleged by the husband and the other witnesses. Something else was going on. I am not going to speculate what it was. It is sufficient merely to conclude that the assertion that the husband owes substantial sums to C Finance under the alleged loan agreements is untrue. I accept Mr Pointer&#8217;s submission that the husband may have had additional funding to support the three projects but not his submission that it was provided by C Finance. </p>

I accept, for example, Mr Pointer and Miss Murray&#8217;s submissions concerning liquidated damages. On the other hand, I also accept the wife&#8217;s evidence that the husband has been involved in business ventures elsewhere which he has not disclosed. If Mr Pointer&#8217;s submissions are correct, his client has behaved foolishly, spending money on an unaffordable scale in the Panglossian belief that things will be all right in the end. That is not the man described in the wife&#8217;s evidence as quoted above (&#8220;an amazing provider &#8230; an extraordinarily successful man who&#8217;s managed to make our life bigger and better &#8230; an extremely clever guy&#8221;). Her view seems to be shared by others. Although I am quite sure that the full picture of the husband&#8217;s involvement with C Finance has been deliberately concealed from the court, it is evident the shadowy people behind that company have been involved in business activities of some kind with him over a period of 10 years, and have maintained their involvement even after he defaulted on payments to an extent that obliged them to obtain a possession order against his property. Plainly, they do not regard him as a fool, but rather as a man with whom it is worthwhile to do business. That view is shared by Mr X. He has continued to advance money to the husband, despite a series of difficulties, including some that arose in 2014 as demonstrated in the documents downloaded from the wife&#8217;s computer, and has continued to do so until relatively recently. As noted above, at the end of his oral evidence, when asked whether he would lend further money, Mr X replied it would depend on whether he was satisfied about the security offered for the loan.

On the other hand, all parties accept that this is a &#8220;needs case&#8221;. In the statement of assets and liabilities sent to the wife in June 2016, the husband gave a valuation for his interest in the three London development properties (which, as I have found, was calculated after deduction of the sums owed under Mr X&#8217;s loans) at approximately &#163;6.3m but stated that his expected profits were between &#163;5m and &#163;10m. In the final schedule of assets submitted on behalf the wife (the details of which are not accepted by those representing the husband), his interest is said to be worth &#163;14.8m, less sums owed to Mr X of approximately &#163;12.5m. I also accept Mr Pointer and Miss Murray&#8217;s submission that liquidated damages in the sum of &#163;1.6m for the Mayfair property development must also be deducted. On these figures, the current value of the husband&#8217;s interest in the three development properties is only about &#163;700,000. The precise value of his current interest is uncertain, given the current vagaries of the London property market. On the other hand, I accept the argument that, if allowed to complete the projects, the husband is likely to make a profit. That is why Mr X has continued to support him and, potentially, is willing to provide further support in future. I therefore agree with Mr Bishop&#8217;s proposal that, on completion of the outstanding building projects - in France and London - the husband should pay a lump sum to the wife. Mr Bishop proposes a process by which the precise valuation of that lump sum should be assessed when each project is completed, and recognises that, for that to happen, there will have to be a tightly drawn order and careful monitoring of the husband&#8217;s ongoing activities. Given the history of these proceedings, however, it seems inevitable that such a process would condemn the parties to expensive ongoing litigation so that any lump sum ultimately recovered would be consumed in further costs. In those circumstances, notwithstanding the uncertainties about the future, it is much better in my judgment to fix a lump sum now for the husband to pay by a certain date.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.81in;text-indent:0.12in">Before fixing that sum, however, I turn to two other aspects of the wife&#8217;s claim - arrears of MPS and &#8220;addback&#8221;. As set out above, I am unpersuaded by Mr Pointer&#8217;s arguments that the level of MPS was wrong and that the court should now remit the arrears. I find that the husband could have paid the MPS at any point but chose not to do so, preferring to spend the money on himself. In fixing the level of any lump sum, therefore, I must take into account the fact that the arrears of MPS stood at the level of &#163;358,765 at the date when submissions were delivered and are presumably now higher still. With interest, the figure would be close to half a million pounds, although Mr Pointer submits, relying on the decision of Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re TW</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/3054" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 3054 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 3054 (Fam)</ref> at paragraph 17, that interest is not recoverable on arrears of maintenance. The question then arises whether the lump sum should also take into account the claim for &#8220;addback&#8221;. I conclude that the facts of this case are materially different from those in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">MAP v</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">MFP (Financial Remedies: Addback)</span>. In my judgment, the husband&#8217;s conduct in this case was wanton and deliberate dissipation of assets at a point when he should have been paying maintenance to the wife. But if I were to include the figure claimed for addback, as well as the full arrears of MPS, there would in all probability be an element of double recovery. If the husband had paid the sums due under the MPS order, he would not have been able to spend money on himself in the same wanton way. Accordingly, in this case, I do not think it appropriate to take the figure claimed for &#8220;addback&#8221; into account as well as the MPS arrears when assessing the appropriate level of the lump sum. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.81in;text-indent:0.12in">In calculating the appropriate level of lump sum, I take into account all the circumstances and in particular the following factors (a) the length of the marriage, (b) the fact that the business assets were matrimonial assets, (c) the fact that the husband has not provided full disclosure of his financial resources, (d) his record of success in business and his resourceful character (e) the fact that the wife has little, if any, earning capacity, (f) the parties&#8217; respective needs, and (g) the arrears of MPS. All these factors point towards a substantial lump sum being awarded. On the other hand, I take into account the fact that the completion of the project will be undertaken by the husband alone after the marriage. I also bear in mind Mr Bishop&#8217;s observation that one needs to be realistic. It would be unwise to fix the lump sum at a level that the husband would lose any incentive to complete the projects. In the June 2016 statement of assets and liabilities, the husband estimated his likely profit from the development of the three London properties at between &#163;5m and &#163;10m. Since that date, his liabilities to Mr X have increased by &#163;4m. In addition, the value of high-end property in London has fallen. On the other hand, the husband will also retain the two French properties on which he hopes to make a profit, although there are planning issues outstanding.  </p>

That gives the husband three years to complete the London and French projects and realise his profit. Both parties will be at liberty to apply to vary that date, either bringing it forward or pushing it back, if the circumstances so justify. The figure represents a reasonable share of the husband&#8217;s potential profit on the five property projects and will give the wife capital to invest which will provide her with an income sufficient to meet her needs, although not to support the lifestyle she enjoyed during the marriage.  </p>
