	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The grounds relied on were non-disclosure and a supervening event.  In my judgment correctly, counsel for the wife did not pursue an argument based on supervening event.  In their opening note for the purposes of the hearing Counsel for the wife asserted that the husband was:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"> "engaged in negotiations for a new position; had agreed terms of employment; and was in consequence materially financially better off (as to both capital and income) than under his old employment contract".</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is asserted on behalf of the wife that this information was suppressed by the husband and thus, and less contentiously, that it should have been disclosed by him.  This allegation focuses on a comparison between the alleged agreed terms for a new position and the husband&#8217;s old employment contract.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her final statement stated 8 February 2008 the wife said that as at 20 July 2006 she did not know that the husband &#8220;was about to sign a new contract of employment&#8221; and then sets out incorrectly the amounts payable under what became his new contract of employment (in that they were too high).  She went on to state that this gave the husband considerable guaranteed and increased liquidity and that if he had made her aware of:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"> &#8220;the terms of his new contract of employment I would not have agreed to settle the case on the terms that I did, whereby [the husband] retains a charge over the matrimonial home in which the children and I continue to reside, nor would I have settled my maintenance claims at &#163;55,000 per annum.&#8221;</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She gave oral evidence to similar general effect to the quoted passage.  Following disclosure of the FDR material, and in the light of the documents evidencing the history of the negotiations and the terms of the new contract the wife was not either (a) asked further questions in chief as to her thinking as at 20 July 2006 when the parties put their agreement before the court and it was approved and became an order, or (b) cross examined on that assertion by reference to that material and documentation. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is accepted that in the period leading up to 20 July 2006 the husband was in negotiations relating to a new job and that he did not disclose the existence of such negotiations, or the position reached in respect of them, to the wife.  In his oral evidence he accepted that he decided not to do so. He asserts that given the position reached in those negotiations (a) he was under no duty to do so, and if he was (b) disclosure of the position relating to them would not have caused the court to make an order that was substantially different.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Those assertions raise issues of fact relating to the credibility of the husband on which I heard evidence.  For example as asserted by counsel on behalf for the wife in their opening statement: Had he agreed terms of employment? Or as asserted by the wife, in her statement: Was he about to sign a new contract of employment?  In addition the point arises whether the husband had in his possession or control a new contract of employment, or a draft of that contract at the FDR.  As will appear later, in my judgment the answer to all of those questions is in the negative.</p>

When they were married the husband was 28 and the wife 27, they are now respectively 40 and 38.  When they were married they were both employed but neither had any significant resources.  They have two children, both girls, one of them is 10 and the other is 8.  They bought their first house in 1996.  That house was sold in 2004 and shortly thereafter they bought a larger house from the proceeds of their first home, savings of about &#163;200,000 and a mortgage of about &#163;150,000.  Substantial renovations were then carried out to that property.  This house is an attractive family home.</p>

Nothing turns on the description and from 1989 to July 2006 he had had seven employers in the financial sector. He resigned from his employment with AA on 31 July 2006 (i.e. 11 days after the order) and took up his present employment with BB on 4 September 2006.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is common ground that as at 20 July 2006 the relevant assets had all been acquired during the relationship.  As is not uncommon in his field of work the husband&#8217;s remuneration package was made up of a basic salary and bonus some of which was paid in shares, or stock units, which were to vest over a period of time.  The wife had no relevant income and, as I understand it, had not been in employment for some time.  The marital partnership therefore was one in which, by agreement between them, the husband was the earner and the wife the home builder and the primary day to day carer of the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To my mind, the position was that the moneys representing assets acquired, savings made and income earned during the continuance of the relationship, which became a marital partnership, and the co-operation and agreed lifestyle based thereon (and thus up to separation in 2005) were moneys to which the approach that they should be shared equally applied with considerable force. This is because they were the product of that relationship.  In my view that approach would effectively apply to all income up to and including the bonus declared at the end of 2005 and thus to the vested assets (and the unvested RSUs) as at July 2006.</p>

The husband had an account at the Halifax which had been funded primarily by his bonus for 2005.  In July 2006 the credit balance on that account was approximately &#163;140,000.  That account, together with the husband&#8217;s basic salary, was used to pay day to day expenses and was therefore an &#8220;income sinking fund&#8221;.  At the end of the year a balance would be left that would constitute savings for that year. </p>

At current values the total net value of those unvested RSUs, after deduction of tax, was of the order of &#163;230,000 to &#163;250,000 (different figures are included in the papers as at 20 July 2006 and now).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband's remuneration package at AA was that he was entitled to a basic annual salary of &#163;100,000 payable monthly, and a bonus decided at the end of each trading year (30 November) paid part in cash and part in RSUs.  This complicates the position because part of his remuneration does not vest for some time, also unvested RSUs would generally be lost if he moved job.  For the calendar year 2005 his total remuneration was &#163;516,705 ($ 950,000) made up of basic salary &#163;100,000, cash bonus &#163;343,512, and 1,027 unvested RSUs (&#163;73,193).  That is net pay in cash of about &#163;262,000 (59% of &#163;443, 512) plus unvested RSUs.  The husband's P60 for the fiscal year 2005/6 (not the calendar year 2005) evidenced a net salary of &#163;278,030. So in broad terms by reference to his salary and bonus for 2005 the husband was earning at the rate of &#163;260,000 to &#163;270,000 net a year and was also in receipt of RSUs which would vest in the future.  In addition he had the benefit of a payment of &#163;5,000 as a pension contribution.</p>

So, looking forward to what might be awarded by way of bonus for the calendar year 2006, there was a real prospect, and thus a justifiable expectation, that his overall remuneration would increase significantly over the 2005 levels and therefore result in a receipt by the husband at the end of 2006 (or in early 2007) of:</p>

This is borne out by the documents at the time.  As to this expected incease, and to my mind correctly, the presentation on behalf of the wife at the FDR was that the husband was a high earner and that:</p>

Indeed in my view an approach on behalf of the wife that failed to take into account that it was likely that the husband&#8217;s bonus for 2006 would be significantly greater than that for 2005 would have been folly, and fallen below the standard of care owed to the wife by her advisers.  This is mirrored in what was said by counsel for the husband before the District Judge when he said that there had (as was common knowledge) been a very successful rising market and that counsel for the wife had calculated a general rise in that period (I have not seen that calculation) and the husband&#8217;s remuneration by way of bonus could go up or down.</p>

Others, as he accepted, were more negotiable.  But the position was that not only had a binding legal agreement not been entered into on 20 July 2006, but negotiations on the draft sent on that day had not commenced, were necessary and there were a number of points that needed to be altered to that draft before the husband would have committed himself to a move.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband was approached by head hunters in January 2006 but no progress was made.  A meeting was cancelled because the husband was not ready.  The husband was approached again in late April or early May and by the second week in May the husband had a meeting with the &#8220;number 2 at BB&#8221;.  This was followed by further meetings in May with representatives of BB and after those meetings the husband was sent accounts of BB on 19 May 2006.  In early June 2006 the husband was told, as was the case, that there was another senior individual being considered for a wider remit.  The husband&#8217;s reaction to this, as recorded by the head hunters, was that if BB wanted him he was ready to move, but if they did not, he would like to be told as soon as possible.  He was worried about not being kept up to date and the preservation of confidentiality.   The head hunters&#8217; view was that the husband had had enough of AA politics. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was therefore a change in thinking and direction at BB in late May and early June as to what they might offer the husband.  They had another person in mind for a more senior management role, similar to that for which the husband had been considered, but still thought that he would make a good Head of Sales who would work with, and report directly to, this new person if and when he was recruited (Mr R).  This was followed by an indication to the husband that an offer would be made to him by BB for a different role to that originally envisaged, but no such offer was made.  By mid June 2006 the husband thought, and it was reasonable for him to do so, that, as the head hunters recorded in an email to BB &#8220;the game is over&#8221;, although they had tried to assure him that this was not the case.</p>

Nor does the respective locations of the offices of the solicitors and the head hunters.  Rather it seems to me that the head hunters may well have wanted to make this personal contact to directly assess the husband&#8217;s position and thus whether matters should be left to the lawyers, or whether the head hunters should do something to promote the move being completed.  This would be in line with the email from Mr R in the early hours of the morning of 21 July 2006.  It would also be in line with the urgency being expressed at the BB end in the emails of 19 July 2006 and the wish of the head hunters to get the husband signed up, if the draft was handed over on the evening of 20 July 2006.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the second assertion is exaggerated.  The communications and exchanges at the FDR show that the husband was expecting a significant rise, through his bonus, at AA and I do not accept that what BB was prepared to pay was a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">very</span> surprising acceptance of his &#8220;market rate&#8221;.  Rather I take the view that the husband set his proposal as to the amount of his remuneration at a level above the top of the range of what he thought he would get at AA, but not so far above it that it would be likely to put BB off.  This would be a natural commercial approach.  He told BB that he was expecting a 40/50% increase at AA.  His proposal was for a figure of $1.6 million which is above that bracket ($1.33 to 1.45 million, see paragraph 101 below) and it therefore left room for manoeuvre down to, as well as within that bracket.  I therefore accept that the husband may well have been surprised that BB did not try to negotiate him down.  But by the latest 18 July 2006 when he was told by Mr R that his proposal was in the right ball park (and his final statement indicates that he may have understood this by 14 July 2006) in my judgment the husband was expecting the offer made by BB to be one that mirrored that response and thus in my view to be one at the top of, or above, his bracket.  In his evidence by reference to what another employee was awarded the husband has estimated what he would have been paid at AA by reference to a 35% rise.  In my judgment this is an indication that the proposal put forward by the husband was a negotiating figure.</p>

But the offer of 34% (including maintenance, school fees and extras for the children) of the net cash element of his salary up to a maximum of &#163;350,000 (and thus an increase over 2005) plus 10% of the cash element of his net salary over &#163;350,000 to my mind provides an indication that his thinking (on advice) as to both (a) future increases in his salary and (b) division of existing assets, was that he wanted a share of existing assets, and was offering a limited benefit to the wife from his increased earnings, and thus his earning capacity.</p>

No point was raised before me that the duty of full and frank disclosure is limited by reference, or by analogy, to the more limited extent of standard disclosure under the CPR, which does not apply by default by Rule 1.3 of the FPR 1991.  The pre application protocol annexed to the President&#8217;s Practice Direction of 25 May 2000 <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 997" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 997</ref> underlines the obligation of parties to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts, documents and other information relevant to the issues and also includes a reference to the overriding objective in FPR Rule 2.51D, which mirrors the CPR and by, for example, its reference to saving expense and proportionality potentially has a limiting effect on the width of the <span style="font-style:italic">Peruvian Guano</span> test of relevance.  However in my view it does not limit the duty to the equivalent of standard disclosure under the CPR.  Rather it introduces value judgments in respect of the <span style="font-style:italic">Peruvian Guano </span>test.

But, as the duty to disclose is a continuing one the approach can be applied when the information should have been disclosed before the agreement was reached on the basis of the court asking itself whether it would have endorsed and approved the agreement (reached in the absence of full disclosure) on the basis that there had been full disclosure between the time that the agreement was reached and the consideration of the matter by the court.  Indeed it seems to me that when the court has taken no part in the negotiation, and thus the agreement does not result at an FDR, this is the way in which the court has to approach such cases to ring fence its statutory role if the only test is an objective or court centred one.</p>

But the practical reality is that when, at an FDR, or at another time (save possibly after it has heard all the evidence and argument and agreement is then reached), the court is making an order in terms agreed between the parties it does not, and cannot, go through all, or much of, the detailed thinking which it would carry out when there is no agreement.  Not least it will not have heard evidence or full argument. Rather it considers whether the order is fair on the information it has and thus in my view in the sense that it is an order, or an order within the range of orders, that it might well have made after a full hearing.</p>

The wife did not become engaged to be married until after the agreement was reached and the question that arose was whether before the matter was put before the court the wife had a duty to disclose the fact that she had become engaged, so that that information was before the court when it made the order.  At 434C Lord Brandon says that the suggestion that the wife had made any misrepresentation to the husband or his solicitors which induced him to agree to the making of the consent order cannot be supported.  It is therefore easy to see why the focus was on whether the court would have approved the agreement already made if before the order was made it had been disclosed that the wife had become engaged, and points that the husband would have tried to resile from the agreement, or argued against its approval, were not covered in the speeches. </p>

In my view this is clear if the FDR material is ignored, because it is so inherent in the history of (i) the husband&#8217;s employment and its terms, and (ii) more generally City employment, remuneration and the performance of the stock market, which were well known to this intelligent wife and her advisers.  The FDR material confirms this.</p>

Here however the disclosure should have been made before, or during, the negotiating process at the FDR and in my view essentially the same issues arise in considering whether in the negotiating process the court would have indicated that the terms, or some of the terms, of the July 2006 order were inappropriate or unfair or something it would not approve, and in considering whether it would have approved and made the order.</p>

In my view this is fatal to the wife&#8217;s arguments because those uncertainties mean that it cannot be said that the prospects of the husband being materially financially better off (as to both capital and income) would have been effectively or materially different if he had disclosed the true position relating to the negotiations.</p>

This is because the reasoning that underlies the fairness of that order applies to the husband&#8217;s earning capacity, and the expectation that he will receive a significantly higher bonus at the end of 2006 (compared to 2005) whether he changed or did not change jobs.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, by reason of the objective reasoning set out above the court cannot safely conclude on the evidence that has been given that had the truth of the position in respect of the husband&#8217;s negotiations with BB been disclosed on or shortly before 20 July 2006 the FDR would have been adjourned.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already indicated that the evidence does not enable me to reach conclusions as to the subjective thinking of the parties and thus on a subjective basis what would have occurred at the FDR if the truth of the position in respect of the husband&#8217;s negotiations with BB had been disclosed.  But I add that:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">albeit that I accept that the wife wanted to achieve an outright transfer of the house, as mentioned earlier in my view her refusal of the percentage offer is an indication that her thinking was not only that she wanted certainty as to the level of periodical payments from time to time, but that she favoured a &#8220;wait and see&#8221; approach to the determination of their amount after the expected increase in the husband&#8217;s salary through the expected increased bonus for 2006 was known, and did not want to jeopardise or prevent an agreed solution in which she remained in the former matrimonial home by arguing or holding out for a transfer of the whole beneficial interest in it, on the basis that a large increase in remuneration was expected in 2006 and later years,</p>

Although no such contract existed at the time, I am of the view that this should be read, and her oral evidence should be taken, as being a reference to an undisclosed agreement or understanding which she has argued existed.  But on that basis the detail of her thinking was not pursued by reference either to her assertion as to the degree of certainty of a move and/or the terms of the husband&#8217;s new contract, and</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the parties know, because I asked to see counsel and also raised it in court, on a number of occasions during the hearing I was concerned that there was or may be a conflict of interest between the wife and her solicitors and junior counsel who had represented her in 2006.  This arose from two main sources, namely (a) my uncertainty whether it was being argued that a subjective test was being advanced relating to the wife&#8217;s thinking and thus the advice she was given, and (b) submissions which seemed to carry with them the implication that the wife&#8217;s advisers had proceeded in July 2006 simply on the basis of the husband&#8217;s 2005 remuneration and did not take account of an expected (or likely or possible) increase in 2006.</p>

It seems to me that in part that conclusion was based on the manner in which it was confirmed the case was being presented namely that (a) the test was an objective one, (b) at the second stage of that test alternatives were not advanced on the basis that the degree of certainty that there would be a move might be found to be less than that being asserted by the wife and (c) the FDR material showed that the wife and her advisers were proceeding on the basis that there was likely to be an exponential rise in the husband&#8217;s salary.</p>
