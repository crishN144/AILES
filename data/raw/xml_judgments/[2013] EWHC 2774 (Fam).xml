It is unfortunate that judicial liaison has not been achieved thus far, particularly as both parents wish for it to happen.

She observed that the common law definition (used for the purposes of the <span style="font-style:italic">1986 Act</span> and the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980) has been generally (though not entirely) thought to be different (in some respects) from the concept used by the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU).  She, and the majority of her fellow justices, declared that it is highly desirable that there is a uniform test, and that if there is any doubt, for the purposes of applying the BIIR Regulation it should be that adopted by the Court of Justice for the European Union (&#167;35).   </p>

The test derived from R v Barnet London Borough Council, ex p Shah should be abandoned when deciding the habitual residence of a child. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.65in">As I have indicated above (&#167;10), M has lived in England now for over six years, nearly one half of her life.  On the evidence presented to this court she appears thoroughly &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">integrated</span>&#8221; here.  Her mother has married a British national and they have made their family home here for many years; M&#8217;s mother and step-father have full-time employment here.  M has been at school here for the last six years, recently moving to a senior school.  She excels at school, and has a huge range of extra-curricular pastimes.  Her social life and friends are here; she is said to be popular among her peers.  Her half-sister was born here and has lived all her life here with M in her family.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.65in">On the basis of the test outlined above (see &#167;40, notably (iii)) I have no hesitation in concluding that M is habitually resident in England &amp; Wales.  She could not in my judgment be regarded as habitually resident in any other country.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.65in">It follows that the Court of England and Wales undoubtedly, in my judgment, has jurisdiction to entertain the mother&#8217;s application for substantive welfare-based orders in respect of M.  I do not accept the determination by the American Court (26 August 2013) that the English Court lacks jurisdiction (referred to in &#167;26 above).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.65in">The competing determinations on jurisdiction plainly give rise to scope for international judicial liaison.  Perhaps such liaison is needed now more than ever; it is obviously unsatisfactory for there to be competing judgments in two different jurisdictions.  I have been invited by Ms Chaudhry to state that the English Court has &#8216;exclusive&#8217; jurisdiction.  I decline to do so, not presuming to determine the issue of jurisdiction in the Florida Court, without hearing further argument on that point.  That said, I note that the Florida Court last made a welfare based decision in respect of M in March 2008; since that time, M has visited Florida only for the purposes of holidays with her father.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.65in">Given the extent of M&#8217;s integration into all aspects of English life (i.e. social, academic and family), I very much hope that the father, and indeed the Florida Court, will acknowledge the value to M, and to the parties, in the proceedings being conducted in this jurisdiction. Any welfare-based enquiry focusing on M&#8217;s best interests going forward, which would be likely to include the ascertainment of M&#8217;s views given her age, would surely be best conducted in the country which has been her home for such a significant time, and in which she is, in my judgment, habitually resident.  </p>
