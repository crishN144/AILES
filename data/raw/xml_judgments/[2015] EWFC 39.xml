For reasons set out in the following paragraph ([7]), I do not propose to rehearse the evidence of Mrs Enayat in this judgment; I would like to record, nonetheless, that it was clear, and forensically helpful.  In summary, it underlined the difficulties which would be encountered by the mother in leaving Iran with AH if the State authorities (or the father) sought to prevent her from doing so, and/or if the father was unco-operative or frankly unable, to secure the necessary travel papers to assist a safe return to this jurisdiction.  Mrs Enayat was unable to offer much comfort the mother, or the court, in moderating the concerns outlined by the FCO, referred to by the Court of Appeal at [12] of <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/989" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 989" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 989</ref>; specifically, security forces in Iran are suspicious of people with British connections, and there are particular reasons why the forces may be particularly interested in members of this family.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">At the conclusion of the expert evidence yesterday afternoon (6 May 2015), and before giving her own evidence, the mother indicated through counsel that given the absence of any degree of co-operation from the father (let alone the genuine and wholehearted co-operation which she sought), and the risks to her and AH if she was unable to achieve a swift and safe return, she recognised that such a plan was not &#8220;sustainable&#8221;, and she no longer pursued it.   This left only those issues identified in [4](b) and (c) above for determination.</p>

	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.02in">The child concerned was born on 13 August 2010. Her parents share parental responsibility for her as a consequence of their marriage. Both parents have indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the father having obtained asylum as a political refugee. The mother has two daughters by a previous marriage who live with her in this jurisdiction. The child with whom the court is concerned has been the subject of private law children proceedings since before 11 July 2013 when by agreement a residence order was made in favour of the mother. The same order provided for unsupervised contact for the father but prohibited him from removing the child from this jurisdiction. It permitted the mother to temporarily remove the child from the jurisdiction except to Iran which was prohibited. </p>

	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.02in">&#8230; the reason for that prohibition was the 'agreed' risk of travel to Iran for this family. At the time the order was made in July 2013 the apparent solution to the problem presented by the mother's wish to meet her own family with the child was that she could do so in Turkey. Such was the extent of the risk identified on that occasion that by agreement the court prohibited both parents from obtaining an Iranian passport for the child and the father surrendered an existing passport and his own passport which are held by solicitors to the order of the court. Before this court the mother explains that order by saying that she agreed to it as a 'package' not on the merits of the individual clauses. </p>

	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.02in">In February 2014 the case proceeded on the evidence of the parties alone. The father was content to rely on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) guidance and his own evidence as to how his own relatives and opponents of the regime in Iran had been treated. The mother relied on her own experience of free passage while travelling to and from Iran since she moved to this jurisdiction. There were background issues relating to whether the mother's family worked with or for the intelligence services in Iran but the judge was perhaps unsurprisingly unable to do other than comment on that claim given that it was unsubstantiated. </p>

	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.02in">Father's case was that his child's safety would be at risk because of his previous political activity in Iran and that this was not a fanciful risk: his relatives from Sweden had already been detained for six months for no apparent reason while visiting Iran. He sought to substantiate that risk with evidence about the imprisonment of and restrictions upon his relatives in Iran. His subsidiary case was that there was also a possibility that the mother might remain in Iran with their daughter, removing her from the reach of anyone who could assist him. </p>

Where (as in most cases) there is some risk of abduction and an obvious detriment to the child if that risk were to materialise, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the court has to be positively satisfied that the advantages to the child of her visiting that country outweigh the risks to her welfare which the visit will entail</span>.

AH has no Iranian passport, only a British one; she has an Iranian birth certificate.  Mrs Enayat described it as &#8220;theoretically possible&#8221; that the mother could convey AH through the Turkey/Iran border relying on just AH&#8217;s Iranian birth certificate.  Without AH&#8217;s birth certificate, this would be much harder, indeed only realistically achievable if the border guards could be bribed to &#8216;turn a blind eye&#8217;.  The mother offers to surrender AH&#8217;s birth certificate to her solicitor in England before travel, thereby eliminating her facility to use it as a travel identity document.  Mrs Enayat went on to describe the practice of illicit people trafficking/smuggling between the relevant countries over the Taurus Mountains as &#8220;common&#8221;, though plainly risky and physically challenging.</p>

If the mother chose to stay, or the State officials sought to make a return difficult (given the political connections of the family) it would be extremely difficult for the father to secure the safe (let alone swift) return of AH to this jurisdiction; he would experience enormous difficulties in travelling to Iran himself even for a short time, given his political status, and the legal and bureaucratic hurdles of seeking to do so remotely from England would be overwhelming, even if not insuperable.   I bear all this in mind.</p>

AH only has a British passport, which would not be so easily accepted at border control as an Iranian passport.  I consider it unlikely, having seen and heard the mother&#8217;s evidence, that she would choose to cross the Taurus Mountains with AH, and her two other daughters, covertly and illicitly.</p>

I propose further to direct that the mother should travel to Turkey on a British passport; at present she does not have one, but has made enquiries about applying for one and there is a chance that this could be obtained before the end of July.  This would make the travel from Turkey to Iran yet more problematic.  In the event that the mother is not able to obtain a British passport before the date of travel, she can apply to me to vary or discharge this requirement, which I shall consider favourably only if I am satisfied that she has made every effort to obtain the British passport.  In the meantime, she shall surrender her Iranian passport to her solicitors forthwith</p>
