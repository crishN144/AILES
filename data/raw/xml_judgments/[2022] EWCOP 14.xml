That this is the appropriate jurisdictional route is made clear by Baker J (as he then was) in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">KK v CC</span> [2012] EWHC 2136 where at paragraph 16 he said:</p>

In particular, once the court determines the question, it may make an order varying or terminating the standard authorisation: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 21</ref>A(3)(a).

Once its jurisdiction is invoked, the court has a discretionary power under s. 15 to make declarations as to (a) whether a person has or lacks capacity to make a decision specified in the declaration; (b) whether a person has or lacks capacity to make decisions on such matters as are described in the declaration, and (c) the lawfulness or otherwise of any act done, or yet to be done, in relation to that person. Where P lacks capacity, the court has wide powers under s. 16 to make decisions on P's behalf in relation to matters concerning his personal welfare or property or affairs.</span></p>

As a result, in February 2019 MB&#8217;s contact with P was restricted to 2 hours supervised per day.  That regime was still in place when P was transferred to the care home on 15 April 2019.</p>

P&#8217;s sister has told me that from an early stage in the marriage she noticed a considerable change in P.  From being an outgoing and adventurous young woman, she became increasingly isolated from her friends.  The pictures painted of married life by S and by PD are entirely consistent with one another.  P told PD and later S and the other children how confined her life was by MB.  When the oldest 3 children were small, and before the youngest was born, P was so unhappy in her marriage that she left with them and was placed in a refuge.  She was there for several weeks or so until she concluded that the conditions there were worse than they were at home.  </p>

When MB came back, the mood changed completely.  S says that he told his mother that she should leave the marriage but that she never had the confidence to do so; she felt that she could not leave, had nowhere to go and no money.

She enjoyed the work but told her sister and son that on each occasion she had to give the jobs up after a few weeks because MB would ostentatiously loiter either in her place of work or outside watching P, and if she smiled or looked at a man there was trouble.  On one occasion when P was late finishing work, MB simply drove off leaving her to walk home as he felt that she was having a good time with a man.  </p>

None of this appeared in his statements and I unhesitatingly accept the evidence of S and PD.  It would take a remarkable degree of artifice for P to have invented years ago a story of MB following her and harassing her at work and to have told that story to her sons and sister and in effect to have pre-planned her complaint of her husband&#8217;s behaviour and control.  I likewise do not accept MB&#8217;s assertion that P voluntarily, rather than at his instigation as she told others, handed over to him everything that she earned.   The account of the sewing shop manager deliberately holding back a small sum from P&#8217;s wages to give to her covertly is compelling.</p>

One of them is that only MB knew what was best for P.  He was completely unwilling to accept any sort of advice or comply with recognised procedures.  A few examples will suffice:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The hospital had a policy which it called PJ paralysis.  The purpose of the policy was to get patients into a routine which would, as close as reasonably possible, replicate their former life at home and aid their recovery.  One aspect of that was that when patients got up in the morning they would be encouraged to put on day clothes.  MB would not accept that.  The other members of the family would bring into the hospital day clothes for P but MB would take them home.  </p>

MB discouraged the children and in particular the grandchildren from visiting.  He told me that he was fearful that the children might pick up bugs on the ward and pass them on to P.  He said that he feared that the presence of too many family members would make her overtired.  He would not accept that the hospital staff were in the better position to judge that.  He wanted to have control over who saw P and when.  The result was that it was only a couple of times in 10 months that P got to see her much loved grandchildren.  All the staff reported to PN, and she observed herself, P&#8217;s pleasure and animation when she was with her sister, sons and grandchildren. P &#8220;lit up in their presence&#8221; and it was a matter of great regret to the hospital staff that this did not happen more often. </p>

MB had already been told that she did not have capacity.  The attempt was headed off by a nurse but is yet another example of MB&#8217;s determination to have control of his wife&#8217;s life.</p>

As a result, and following the order of Francis J, such contact as there has been between P and MB has been virtual and there has been no face to face contact since the end of 2020.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since direct face to face contact has stopped, the view of the care home is that P has become much more engaged and purposeful.  She wants to come out of her room and be with other people.  She becomes involved in activities and the view of the care home staff is that she is much happier.  The staff are also of the view that the virtual contact works better than the face to face contact did.  During face to face contact the staff observed that P often appeared to be subdued.  This was not always the case.  The OS has reviewed the care home diaries and makes the following broad observations which are agreed as being representative of what the notes record of the face to face contact visits:</p>

P is provided with a tablet or laptop, and the contact session is facilitated by a nurse assessor from the HB.  She seems to derive at least initial pleasure from seeing MB on the screen.  Although the nurse assessor does not limit the length of the sessions, the average duration of the contact appears to be about 10 minutes before P indicates to the nurse assessor that she has had enough, or MB ends the call.  </p>

With P in a wheelchair, it would have been impossible for MB to have carried out the manoeuvre that he did from the position described by the nurse.  I reject MB&#8217;s account of shin massage and can think of no reason why the nurse should fabricate.  That said, the presence of the intervening wheelchair tray and the table top may not have permitted her a clear, as opposed to an impeded, view.</p>
