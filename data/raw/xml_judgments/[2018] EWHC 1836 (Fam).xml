The effect of the Belgian maintenance regulations is that the wife, as the recipient of a maintenance order, has to pay tax at 40.09% on her receipt, so that the order of &#163;850 per month produced for&#160;her only &#163;509 per month.  Correspondingly, the husband of course gets no tax relief on the payments that he makes from his English income, so that each party, in effect, is paying tax on the same income.  Such, the court was told, are the wonders of modern taxation systems.  The Belgian tax advice was submitted to the learned judge on 8 June 2017.  His judgment was not delivered until 1 November 2017, some five months later, and an order eventually emerged on 15 January 2018.</span></p>

He ordered that until payment from 8 December 2017 the husband should pay periodical payments at the rate of &#163;250 per month in advance, and that in addition there was to be interest payable at the judgment rate, from 8 December until payment.  The effect of the judge&#8217;s order was thus: (1) instead of paying a total of &#163;9,500 maintenance over the period from 1 June 2016 until a period two years later, he had to pay the full sum of &#163;9,500 by 7 December 2017, some seven months earlier than the last payment would be due; (2) if he had not paid the sum in advance of that date, seven payments of &#163;250, that is another &#163;1,750 would be payable by the end of June 2018 unless payment was made; (3) interest would run from 7 December until 30 June 2018, amounted to another &#163;443.  Thus, a total of &#163;11,693 became payable by 30 June 2018 instead of &#163;9,500.  </span></p>

The husband appealed on a number of different grounds, some of which I refused permission to appeal on and which I need not refer to again.  I did, however, grant him limited permission to appeal on issues relating to the spousal maintenance and child maintenance.  As to the spousal payments, I granted him permission to appeal on (1) whether they should cease with effect from June 2017, when the increase of child payments came into effect; (2) whether payment of the capitalised sum should be required in advance of the termination date; (3) whether it is proper to award both interest and continued maintenance in default of payment.</span></p>

It seems to me that if he had been invited to step back and realised that he was making an order for &#163;11,693 &#8211; rather than &#163;9,500 &#8211; he must have come to a different conclusion.  In my view, the approach amounted to an error in law and therefore I have to consider what the right approach on his findings should have been.  </span></p>

However, the judge had then, in my view, two alternatives: either to make an order that, until payment, the husband continue to pay &#163;250 a month as per the original order or &#8211; and this is bound up with the child maintenance order &#8211; that he pay the sum of &#163;6,500 with interest on arrears, but no further sum, if the child maintenance was to be backdated to June 2017.    </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I granted permission to appeal the child maintenance on three grounds.  Namely, whether it should be backdated to a period when spousal payments were still being paid, secondly the relevance of the CMS figure, and thirdly the quantum of the order.  Mr Hollow, on behalf of the husband, raises three arguments.  First, he says if the &#163;850 per month was grossed up to allow for tax, it being common ground that when the &#163;850 was agreed &#8211; there was no question then of it being subject to any taxation &#8211; the total grossed up figure now would be &#163;1,416 per month, with a little bit of index linking on top.  That, he says, should be the maximum payable.  Secondly, he says why should&#160;the burden of paying the tax fall doubly on the husband?  That is, on his income as he earns it, and then secondly by the grossing up of the maintenance order.  He points out that his former wife is Polish, with property in Poland, and there was no reason for her to move to Belgium from Poland, where she had been living, shortly after the 2015 order, incurring with it a double tax&#160;burden, which had not previously existed.  Thirdly, he says her own evidence shows that she did not need an increase.  </span></p>

He covered it in paragraph 92 of his judgment, where he said this: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;Such a sum (&#163;1,600) should produce in excess of &#163;900 net in Mrs Harris&#8217; hands, which although is less than may have been awarded, provides a balance between the competing issues above and meets within the terms of that compromise of the child&#8217;s basic needs&#8217;.  </span></p>

He rightly said that it falls to the court to assess the relevant needs of both parties and to identify what the appropriate sums were to make in respect of the child.  He did not regard it as appropriate to simply keep the child&#8217;s award down to a minimum subsistence level and he said this, at paragraphs 54 and 55 </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">He was also right to take into account that there was an enormous difference in the income available to the husband and to the wife.  The husband&#8217;s net income was almost &#163;11,000 per month; the wife&#8217;s total income was less than &#163;2,000 per month.  I do not think that there can be any criticism of the figure of &#163;1,600.  I do not think that the criticism that Mr&#160;Hollow makes on behalf of his client that the tax burden should be shared carries any weight.  The parties met in Belgium, they married in Belgium, the wife had worked in Belgium before, and her move to Belgium produced, for her, a greater income, which was to the benefit of all three members of the family and, no doubt, therefore, reduced the need for support from the husband.  I therefore dismiss the appeal as to the quantum of the order.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">That also takes care of the issue of the relevance of the CMS figure, but the question then arises: should it be backdated to a period when spousal payments were still being paid?  It is evident from the judge&#8217;s judgment that, as from July 2017, the mother would have coming into her home for child support the gross figure of &#163;1,600 per month, and the net figure was what the judge decided as being the figure that she needed to meet the child&#8217;s ongoing needs.  Bearing in mind the way that the 2015 order was phrased, it seems to me self-evident that, if &#163;250 per month is payable on top of the increased figure for child support, then it significantly exceeds the needs for which the original order was intended to provide.</span></p>

I consider that the fairest and best way of dealing with this matter is to leave the judge&#8217;s order that the &#163;1,600 a month should start on 1 June 2017 in place, but the figure for spousal maintenance should be removed from the date of the increased child maintenance.  </span></p>

I dismiss the appeal against child maintenance.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I now turn to the costs at first instance.  The wife seeks her costs and has produced a schedule in the sum of &#163;20,294.  The husband&#8217;s schedule of costs is rather higher.  It has been attacked on two bases by Mr Hollow as being too high, but I reject both of them.  Therefore, I have to then look at the matter of principle.  Should there be no order for costs, as the husband asserts, relying on the general principle that the starting point for costs is that there should be no order as to costs?  The wife asked me to summarily assess her costs, in such sum as I think is appropriate.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In my judgment, there are some points of force made on both sides.  The husband makes the point that this was essentially a routine application for the variation of maintenance with no grounds for the &#8216;no order principle&#8217; being displaced.  On behalf of the wife, a number of points are made.  In particular, that the wife succeeded in getting a substantial increase in child maintenance.  Secondly, she was forced to court, because the husband had completely ceased paying maintenance for her and had only continued paying child maintenance in the sum which brought her &#163;508 per month.  Thirdly, he had pursued some arguments which were rejected by the judge and which I refused to allow to be opened on appeal and, fourthly, the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">ex post facto</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> point that, notwithstanding the judge&#8217;s judgment, the husband had continued to fail to pay any sum in respect of the wife&#8217;s maintenance.  Finally, she was by far the financially weaker party.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I am clear that an order for costs should be made.  Normally, at this sort of level, on a summary basis, I would allow for a reduction of 20% of the total bill, to allow for what one might find typically reduced on a typical reduction on an assessment, but I think that is too large a percentage for me to order the husband to pay against the background of the general principle that costs should lie where they fall.  I think there has been some serious litigation conduct by the husband in the way that I have described, and I am going to order him to pay 60% of the wife&#8217;s costs below.  That, therefore, is 60% of the figure of &#163;20,294, which comes to &#163;12,176.40.</span></p>

I cannot blind myself to what I know about the parties&#8217; financial positions.  When granting limited permission to appeal I urged the parties to go to mediation, as the sums involved were so small.  I have no idea whether any mediation took place; it seems to me obvious that it should have.  The parties could have protected their positions, if they wished to, by making appropriate offers but neither has done so.  Bearing in mind that the wife succeeded on child maintenance and the husband has succeeded on spousal maintenance, I am going to make no order as to the costs of the appeal.</span></p>
