The children were removed from the care of their mother, CM, and father, LW, following injuries caused to MN in April 2016. MN was placed with foster carers, where he remains. MY was placed with the paternal grandmother KY until the conclusion of the November hearing, when she moved to live with MN at the foster placement. MN suffered an acute subdural haemorrhage, and was found to have a chronic subdural haemorrhage, posterior rib fractures and fractures to the distal right and left femoral metaphases. I determined in the December judgment the father had caused the acute injuries and both parents were in the pool of perpetrators for the chronic injuries. In addition, I found there had been a failure by both parents to protect the children who were at risk of future significant physical harm and neglect due to the parents daily drug use, the number of adults staying in the home and significant emotional harm caused by the volatile nature of the parents relationship and their neglectful behaviour towards the children. The mother has filed a notice of appeal regarding the finding that she was in the pool for the chronic injuries to MN.</span></p>

It is right she has taken some steps. I am told she is living in a safe house, has lined up the various agencies to support her and wants to put herself forward to care for the children. Despite my very real reservations about her ability to work openly and honestly with professionals and the risks inherent with her remaining in the pool of perpetrators for the chronic head injury and fractures I will give the mother a short period of time to consider what steps, if any, she proposes to take regarding the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38(6)</ref> application having considered the terms of this judgment.&#8217;</span></p>

SK observed this was the first she had heard of this aunt or cousin. Little change has been observed of the mother in contact, there is limited effort to sit calmly with the children and develop MY&#8217;s language.

The findings in the December judgment detail that the children had experienced multiple traumatic experiences whilst being in the care of their parents and the inability of the mother to empathise with her children&#8217;s experience is detailed in the judgment. SK observes that it is through this evidence of the mother being unable to respond to the children&#8217;s emotional needs that MY learnt she could not rely on her parents to meet her needs and this is likely to have been the trigger for her developing self-soothing behaviour and a level of independence that is unusual for a child of her age. Such presentation is suggestive of MY developing an avoidant attachment style. </span></p>

Children with attachment difficulties require </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;parenting that will help them to experience increased safety and security so they can learn to use their parent as a secure base; as someone they can leave and return to&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> This has not been the children&#8217;s experience whilst being parented by the mother in the past. Ms K considers that whilst the mother will try to do this she does not consider her emotional state is stable enough due to the extent of her previous traumatic experiences, which remain largely unresolved. SK&#8217;s view, having considered the way the mother is reported to respond to MY&#8217;s challenging behaviour in contact, is that she is unable to meet MY&#8217;s emotional needs. Whilst SK recognises that MN doesn&#8217;t currently present the same attachment difficulties as his sister due to the high level of care he has received with his foster carer he would be at real risk of developing such behaviour were he to live with the mother.</span></p>

An initial viability assessment involving 7 hours interviewing, with a brief report summarising opinion on risk and prognosis which could probably be produced in 10 days. Finally, a risk assessment using the same information collected for the viability assessment, to produce a comprehensive risk assessment report which he expected to be able to produce within three weeks. In his email he said he usually carried out risk assessments whilst the parent is in placement but he can provide a report on risk and prognosis to help inform the court&#8217;s decision making about whether a residential placement might have any prospect of addressing the risk concerns within the children&#8217;s likely timescale needs. </span></p>

Mr Pizzey&#8217;s assessment was comprehensive, there was only limited challenge to the report in the last hearing and he was clear that irrespective of the perpetrator of the injuries to MN he did not support the mother caring for the children due to the history of her emotional difficulties caused by her background, her previous relationships and her dependence on drugs and alcohol. His evidence was clear that she would not be able to make the necessary changes to prevent the likelihood of future significant harm to the children.

TBR has recently confirmed to the mother&#8217;s solicitor her recent involvement with the mother. Those are positive steps which the mother should be encouraged to continue. These are some of the steps recommended by Dr Keating that will enable her to seek to establish some stability in her life. However, in my judgment, she is still in the very early stages of accessing this essential support which has to be looked at in the context of the chronic and wide nature of her difficulties. On any view she has been deeply damaged by her past experiences, it is difficult to imagine how she could have had a more difficult background. In his most recent report Dr Keating emphasises abstinence from drugs and alcohol as if she did relapse she will very quickly revert to previous problems and rapidly decline. She has clearly made a promising start with the drugs but her evidence in relation to alcohol was that she had reduced her intake but not stopped, so that risk remains current. Dr Keating also goes on to say that this abstinence is not the only factor in her recovery and she will need therapy to address the underlying issues, which includes her vulnerability to forming unsuitable relationships. That has not really started yet. Dr Keating emphasises the need to properly monitor any progress. As he concludes in his recent report </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;Someone with 6 months of abstinence who is demonstrating good involvement in the recovery process might be thought of as showing additional evidence of intention and commitment. Someone with 1 year&#8217;s abstinence who is active in their own recovery might be considered as showing </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">some signs </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">of stability&#8217; [</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">emphasis added].

As I found in the December judgment she is an accomplished liar, who has effectively deceived the professionals over a long period of time, even those who have been there to help and support her. I obviously have to consider whether the fact that she lied about matters in the past means is she likely to continue that behaviour or be unreliable about other matters. Her position about her recent drug use is backed up by the drug tests, which supports the conclusion she has told the truth about this. Against that is her reason for the lies in the past; her fear of the children being removed. If the children are returned to her care, even for a short term assessment, it is very likely the same considerations will apply and it is in my judgment very likely she would conceal matters of concern from the professionals again, because of her fear of losing the care of the children. This would be particularly so as she will realise this may be her last chance to care for them. Such behaviour in this case is likely to put the children at very great risk of significant future emotional and physical harm, as it did in the past. Her lack of understanding as to the risks the children were put at in her care were still just dawning on her in her oral evidence (for example, the risks of giving MN to DW so soon after he arrived in the home in the state he was in). Her ability to work with professionals has been seriously compromised by her long standing dishonesty in the past. The powerful force of fear of removal of her children will remain ever present if the children are returned to her care, based on her previous behaviour there is every likelihood the mother will behave in the same way in concealing information. She would remain wanting to present herself in the best possible light, which is very likely to lead her to resort to her previous dishonesty to mask any difficulties she may be experiencing or, more likely, risks that her behaviour would leave the children exposed to.</span></p>

It does not deal with the findings made about her relationship with BH and what, if any, contact she still has with him. The mother has a history where she has seamlessly moved from one relationship to another, each one being abusive and controlling. She has recently moved back to her flat, to the area where the social contacts she had caused her so many difficulties and the father&#8217;s flat is only a short distance away. With the background to this case bail conditions alone are unlikely to provide sufficient protection. Without effective and established support, both social and professional, the risks of the mother forming another unsuitable relationship are very high.  </span></p>

He details in paragraph 3.4 of his report the extensive enquiries he made. His contact with the parents was in late September/early October. By that stage, as the mother made clear to him, the parents had been separated for a number of months. His summary at paragraphs 1.11 &#8211; 1.15 are clear and I agree with them.

Unless she experiences consistent and stable parenting that she can rely on to provide the emotional security her welfare requires it is very likely she will develop an avoidant attachment disorder, which would have long term implications for her emotional and psychological health. The recent evidence of the mother&#8217;s contact show no real sign of the mother listening to and acting on advice, the detrimental impact on MC&#8217;s behaviour of the mother&#8217;s actions are clear in the reports from the foster carer.

I do not consider it necessary to have any further assessment of this mother&#8217;s ability to be able to care for these children. The evidence I have, from a number of different sources, clearly demonstrate that any placement of these children with the mother, however supportive the setting will put them at risk of harm due to her lack of emotional stability, the high risk of relapse by her to her previous harmful behaviour, her lack of candour and risks to the children&#8217;s current attachments and ability for form secure attachments in the future. The real issues as to whether the mother can retain abstinence, break the pattern of abusive relationships and engage in work to address the very significant issues from her own childhood and the loss of L have barely started to be addressed. Dr Keating is clear the timescales for abstinence from alcohol and relationships before there can be any confidence about sustained change by this mother, in reality it is a year&#8217;s abstinence by someone who is active in their own recovery. In my judgment that sustained change and stability is required before there can be any consideration of placement of these two vulnerable children in her care. The risks now do not require any further assessment, the evidence available establishes what they are. Whilst it is superficially attractive to accede to Mr Storey&#8217;s invitation to adjourn for only a few days for Mr Bell to undertake a paper assessment, I do not consider such information is necessary for the court to deal with this case justly as any placement of the children with the mother, however supportive, will cause significant delay to the children, risk disrupting their current secure placement and have a very high risk of breakdown.</span></p>
