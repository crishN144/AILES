The girls were not at school over that period and they were, therefore, exposed to the deterioration of their parents&#8217; relationship without respite. The emotional impact of that on these girls is a significant contributory factor to their current difficulties set out in the Judgment of 14 July 2022. The court made clear that although these parents have diametrically opposed personalities and diametrically opposed views on the parenting of their children, the main thing the girls urgently need is to see their parents managing to work together on parenting issues without strain and without conflict.</p>

On 7 June 2022 on the papers and without a hearing, DJ Saunders directed the parents to file evidence, the mother by 23 June 2022 and the father by 3 July 2022. That order was available to the court and the parties on 9 June 2022. The father was keen that all matters could be dealt with together but the mother wished to file substantial evidence on the Covid-19 issue. At the start of that hearing I indicated that I would hear the parties&#8217; evidence and determine as many of the issues as I could, applying the Overriding Objective. In the event, the court could only get to the end of the evidence on 9 June before running out of time, despite sitting late.</p>

There is a dispute, relevant now only as to costs, as to whether at the end of the hearing on 9 June 2022 the court indicated that the timetable for written submissions allowed time for the parties to file evidence and submissions on the Covid-19 issue as well, thereby allowing the court to deal with all issues in its Judgment unless an oral hearing was sought. The parties did file evidence as directed by Judge Saunders, the father did file submissions but the mother did not. The issue was listed for hearing on 25 July 2022 with a time estimate of two hours.</p>

In cases that concern vaccines that are part of national programmes, the question of whether expert evidence is necessary will only arise if there is an identifiable, well-evidenced, concern about whether, due to their individual circumstances, a vaccine is contraindicated for a particular child, or if there is, as MacDonald J put it in M v H, &#8220;new peer-reviewed research evidence indicating significant concern for the efficacy and/or safety&#8221; of one or more of the vaccines that is the subject of the application&#8230;&#8221;[19]</span></p>

In cases that concern vaccines that are part of national programmes, the question of whether expert evidence is necessary will only arise if there is an identifiable, well-evidenced, concern about whether, due to their individual circumstances, a vaccine is contraindicated for a particular child, or if there is, as MacDonald J put it in M v H, &#8220;new peer-reviewed research evidence indicating significant concern for the efficacy and/or safety&#8221; of one or more of the vaccines that is the subject of the application&#8230;&#8221;[19]</span></p>

That is, of course, a factual difference which may lead to more parents of younger children deciding not to vaccinate their children, however I can see no reason why that should lead to the application of different legal principles in the event of a parental dispute or, indeed, if so, what those different principles should be. The JCVI would not have recommended the making of an offer of vaccination to <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> younger children aged 5-11, and the government would not have accepted that recommendation if either body doubted the efficacy and/or safety of the vaccine for <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> of that coterie of children.</p>

Vaccination is not mandatory. Any parent who wishes to look in detail at the science, available as it is for public consideration, is perfectly entitled to decide that in the case of their particular children they do not agree to vaccination. The factors cited by Mr Hoar have contributed to the mother&#8217;s position although I have already determined that she struggles in principle with any decision about vaccination and she would prefer to leave every such decision to the children to determine. Nonetheless I accept that she is influenced by the factors cited in the Judicial Review and the factors cited before me. If both parents held same view it would be perfectly lawful for them to do so and for the girls not to be vaccinated.</p>
