His parents shall be referred to as Mother and Father in this judgment. This is a finding of fact hearing to determine, if possible, who caused injuries to the child which were identified in March. During the relevant timeframe the child was also cared for by Mrs X in the home she shares with her husband, Mr Y.  They are intervenors in the proceedings. </p>

They are both reading for their PHDs. They planned to have a child and following a miscarriage the Mother conceived the child in 2017. It was their intention to use a nursery to care for their child as they were  both working during the day, however they realised that nurseries could only take children aged three months or over. For visa reasons the Mother needed to return to her clinics and study when the child was only 3 weeks old. They therefore sought the help of Mrs X, a woman recommended to the Mother as a good childminder by a colleague. The Mother and her maternal grandmother visited Mrs X prior to the birth and an agreement was reached that Mrs X would care for the child until he could attend nursery. Mrs X has three children of her own. </p>

In such circumstances I must also look at each individual and ask whether one or more persons in the pool may be excluded on the basis that there is no real possibility that they caused the injuries because, for example, they had only fleeting contact with the child. In addition, Mr Howe QC brought to my attention relevant passages in A-C (A child) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1321" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1321" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1321</ref>, a case involving injuries to a baby and a pool of 4 potential perpetrators.  In that case the judge found that F was the perpetrator. F appealed on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to enable the judge to conclude that on balance he was the perpetrator in circumstances where there was in effect nothing to choose between M and F so far as likelihood was concerned. Miss Judd QC on his behalf stressed the fact that judges must not strain to identify a perpetrator. At para 33 McFarlane LJ comments that in order to move the case from the realm of theory or suspicion there was a need for some established fact or facts upon which a reasonable inference that F was responsible could be drawn and the appeal was allowed on the basis that there was not an &#8216;ounce&#8217; of fact to go in the evidential balance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.08in">&#8220;In what Mr Geekie described as a simple binary case like the present one, the identification of one person as the perpetrator on the balance of probabilities carries the logical corollary that the second person must be excluded. However, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability. Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together, and no doubt comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them. However, in the end the court must still ask itself the right question, which is not "who is the more likely?" but "does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?" In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, there are clear dangers in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this could lead to an identification on evidence that fell short of a probability. Although the danger does not arise in this form where there are only two possible perpetrators, the correct question is the same, if only to avoid the risk of an incorrect identification being made by a linear process of exclusion.  </p>

It makes it clear that I must not approach the case in a linear fashion by saying &#8216;if not A,B or C then it must be D nor on the basis of &#8216;who is most likely&#8217;? In each case I must examine the evidence to see whether it establishes that a person has caused the injury on a balance of probability. Indeed, at para 28 it is obvious that the correct approach is not to exonerate by a process of exclusion or on the basis that one potential perpetrator is less likely than another to have caused an injury. An identification is only possible on the evidence if it is more likely than not that X caused the injury. </p>

Memory is not a mental record which is fixed in time and can be replayed accurately at will on demand. Our memories are often affected by retelling, by the sharing of experience and by the fact that we may have a stake in the outcome of events.

Interpreters were in court to assist those who gave evidence in English with difficult or nuanced concepts but it remains the case that all those who gave evidence were giving it in very unfamiliar surroundings, being accused of serious harm inflicted on a child and being asked questions by highly skilled advocates. I intervened on a few occasions with suggestions to assist, for example requiring advocates to ask shorter questions or asking them to phrase those questions in a non-colloquial manner. I permitted extensive examination in chief, regular breaks and ensured that the evidence itself was not rushed, bearing in mind the basic Article 6 rights of each party. On every occasion that there were any questions raised about interpretation the parties had the opportunity to consult with the other interpreters present in court, especially those who had long standing involvement with the case and were therefore able to appreciate any subtle nuances in dialect.

None of the adults put forward an accidental event to explain the child&#8217;s injuries. The child was only 9 weeks old when those injuries were discovered so the possibility of potential birth injury was investigated. Test results showed that the child may have a very rare platelet abnormality so the effect of that was also considered. The question of timing of the injuries was also examined in detail. The timing was not only relevant to who had care of the child but also as to whether he was injured on one or more occasions. It was also sensible to investigate whether someone who was not there when injury was caused and had no reason to believe that it had been would or should have been aware that something was wrong with the child. </p>

Dr Saggar&#8217;s evidence in this was clear and compelling. The child had blood test results which showed a very rare lack of platelet aggregation when tested as a reaction to ADP. Dr Keenan opined that this platelet dysfunction - which he identified but did not diagnose on a single test -was a mild platelet dysfunction which does not cause spontaneous bleeding. Such conditions may cause nose bleeds or a slight increase to bruising but are not associated with severe or internal bleeding. I am satisfied that, even if the mild platelet dysfunction was confirmed on retesting, it would neither have made the child more susceptible to suffering the injuries, nor would it have caused the injuries that he suffered. The only effect which could have any relevance would be that it may have caused the bleeding to last slightly longer than in a child who did not have the platelet dysfunction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.08in">In this case there is very little assistance to the identification of a perpetrator from the medical evidence. The child was shaken on two separate occasions but if there was no significant change in his functioning the perpetrator and any carers may not have appreciated that there had been a significant injury. Subdural haematomas can be clinically silent and they are often only diagnosed, as here, when a child&#8217;s head circumference becomes abnormal. A child with these injuries may vomit, but most babies vomit so with non-specific symptoms there was nothing to make anyone aware of what had happened.  </p>

As Mr Tughan QC rightly concedes, this was not a case where a child collapses with significant hypoxic-ischaemic changes injury in the arms of a perpetrator. Nothing about the presentation described by any of the adults on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March or the experts&#8217; medical evidence assists with the timing of the second shake to be pinpointed on that day or any other day save within the parameters I have outlined. </p>

Children can be and are abused in otherwise fortunate homes but the framework of common features assists judges in pulling together the strands of the bigger picture. There is no history of intimate partner violence or emotional abuse in either family, no history of physical or sexual abuse to the adults when they were children and no poverty or significant socioeconomic disadvantage. Both families show no evidence of substance misuse of any kind and the couples appear to be in stable and secure relationships. Similarly, there is evidence of household rules, boundaries and routines in both families, albeit the routine for the child was developing as he grew. The parents clearly had an organised routine before he was born, he was planned and they were very happy when he was born. </p>

I formed the clear assessment that she is a genuinely caring person who does not think ill of anyone and is genuinely perplexed as to what has happened to her son. Her description of reading the evidence and the allegations about her conduct made by Mrs X was genuine surprise rather than anger or shame. She was realistic about what happened in May when she was admitted to hospital and did not try to minimise it or explain it away. She has the self-possession to contradict her husband, candidly stating that he didn&#8217;t do as much childcare as he said and she remained good humoured throughout even when asked searching and difficult questions. Her evidence about losing a child through miscarriage and her reaction to that was heartfelt.  </p>

Yet where many parents would have been accusing the police and social workers of misconduct she said that she felt they were doing their job. In my assessment that was an example of how measured and calm she is as a person. She is a perfectionist and the breakdown of her mental health must have been very significant for her. In my assessment she is carrying a heavy burden of guilt. The question for me is whether that is a guilt at placing her baby at 3 weeks old with a childminder so she could satisfy her visa requirements and her work commitments or because she harmed him in a moment when her circumstances seemed overwhelming? </p>

In her texts she was texting in Arabic to another Arabic speaker so the precise English translation is on occasions irrelevant. It&#8217;s what she meant to say and how it was received that matters. As will be seen below my overall assessment of Mrs X was that she lied about many things during the proceedings and tried to hide those lies behind excuses of mistake and mistranslation. Even allowing for the circumstances of giving interpreted evidence I found her to be almost totally lacking in credibility. </p>

An example of this was when he was asked to describe the fit. All he could do was copy his wife&#8217;s description and it was striking to me as I watched that that was what he was doing. He even looked towards her for reassurance. What she had described would have been a very memorable event yet he couldn&#8217;t remember whether he had seen the child&#8217;s eyes rolling or him struggling to breathe. In my assessment the reason for this was that he wasn&#8217;t sure what she had said he had seen. I have reminded myself that memory isn&#8217;t a video archive and that the event may not have lasted long but his responses were extraordinary. When asked by Miss Ball QC to describe the noise the child made on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> he replied: &#8220;It was a kind of breathing difficulty, maybe&#8221; (exactly the phrase used by his wife) and used phrases like &#8220;I think so&#8221; and &#8220;I guess&#8221;.

Sadly, her plans to breastfeed did not work out and by the beginning of March had come to an end. Occasionally her plans didn&#8217;t work out as they should. On occasion the child was ill or clingy and she felt she needed to remain with him and cancel her work, for example on 8 and 13 March. I am sure that the decision-making process on those days was emotionally difficult for her as a new mother. She clearly must have felt torn between work and academic demands and the needs of her baby son who she clearly adored.

Mrs X described her as being significantly upset, requiring consolation.  In my assessment this demonstrates that she may be a person whose reaction to things not going to plan is more significant than one would expect. Most people would be frustrated in such a situation and may shed a tear or two but Mrs X described something more than that and from that time the Father delivered the child in the taxi. Equally this demonstrates that the parents work together as a couple and that they could be flexible to change arrangements and responsibilities. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.08in">It is clear that the Mother suffered stress induced psychosis and was admitted to hospital in May. The evidence shows that during her admission she sought reassurance and asked for forgiveness. The Mother states that her words were part of a prayer which she routinely says, and this was confirmed by Dr K. It was suggested to the Father that both he and the maternal grandfather tried to explain this very significant stress on the Mother&#8217;s exams rather than on what had happened earlier in the year and that the family had minimised the injuries to the child. The written evidence demonstrates that in fact the family were open and honest about what had happened. I accept the Father&#8217;s evidence that the breaking point for the Mother in his view had been some exams which she had not expected. Equally, I accept  that in addition to the fact that they had had to come to terms with a potentially inflicted injury or injuries to their son, that they had been interviewed by the police, had had their home searched, had had to stay in a hotel because they had nowhere else to go, had to tell family in their home country what had happened and move out of their home so that the maternal grandparents could move in to their home, been separated from their first born son, had supervised contact and were the subject of care proceedings. The enormity of these matters cannot be denied and the fact that she prayed for forgiveness is no more or less in my assessment than many others do in the context of their faith.  86. It is significant that the child suffered from colic from at least midJanuary to early March. Both parents were concerned about his colic and they asked Mrs X to give him infacol with his milk. The child was obviously uncomfortable with colic, pulling his knees up to his chest, making fists and crying. Both parents were concerned about the colic and it probably led to some interference with their &#8211; and their baby&#8217;s- sleeping. </p>

She was evidently delighted by the birth of her much-wanted son.

The family had suffered some financial difficulty due to the situation in their country of origin and they had not been sure whether they would have any further payments. Mrs X did childminding to help with family finances and to pay for some of the family shopping. It was very poorly paid &#8211; just &#163;4 per hour- and I am sure that on occasions she must have felt exploited. She was caring for two 2 year old children (her daughter and a boy toddler about the same age) in addition to the child. There must have been times when the noise caused by the children interfered with Mr Y&#8217;s concentration and I don&#8217;t accept that these children were so well behaved and quiet that they didn&#8217;t cause tension. I accept the Father&#8217;s evidence that when he collected the child on one occasion the older children told him that his son had been crying. Caring for children in those circumstances must have been very stressful on occasion. Mr Y, on his own evidence, undertakes no childcare tasks and it seems likely that Mrs X was carrying a heavy burden. Mr Y spent a significant part of each day in his study completing his PHD and in my assessment the couple minimised the impact of her childminding on their home life.  </p>

Their lack of candour and Mr Y&#8217;s evidence attempting to exonerate his wife at every turn has not helped them at all in this respect. As Mr Tughan QC points out Mr Y told the police in interview that Mrs X was &#8220;mostly&#8221; responsible for the care and the obvious inference from that is that he was caring for him for some of the time. In his statement he said that he cared for the child when his wife went to the bathroom. </p>

I found his evidence that the children never bothered him to be disingenuous. Their home was small and a crying baby or fractious toddler would have disturbed his concentration. In my assessment the only possible contribution to the child&#8217;s injuries would be the stress on Mrs X to prevent interruption of his study. He had very limited opportunity to harm this child and I am not satisfied that the local authority evidence is sufficient to show on a balance of probabilities that he perpetrated the injuries nor that they have demonstrated on the evidence that that there is a realistic possibility that he caused these injuries. I accept his regret at his wife accepting the child into their care related to the child being  too young; he also regrets the impact the proceedings have had on their family life, including separation of the family for a period of time. </p>

What turns on this evidence whether she meant 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> or 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>? Firstly, I am satisfied that she told the police that it was the 2nd. She had access to her phone, knew that she was to be questioned about events and in my assessment, had already started to concoct a scenario which would show her as a dedicated childminder and the Mother as a reckless and irresponsible mother. The further importance of it is that it is suggesting that the child had been unwell in her care. I am satisfied that if this were true then she did not communicate the illness in any way to the Mother or the Father. She explained that she had to top up her Lebara credit that day which is why she didn&#8217;t say anything but also claimed it was a mistake as she actually meant the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>. Both can&#8217;t be true. I think it is likely that since it was so near to the relevant dates that she did mean the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March and to say that he was unwell in her care on that day. There is a separate entry for 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and I am clear that she would have deliberately referred to both days as separate events. Her subsequent description of small vomits and larger vomits does not account for that. In my assessment she referred to this day as part of her plan to give a clear indication that the child was unwell at that time and she has changed her story to suit the emerging evidence of what happened to him. </p>

The Mother is a woman who took her wedding and engagement rings off when she was caring for her son because she was so cautious about harming him. I think she would have been concerned about his immunisations and, given his vomit earlier that day, would have been particularly concerned to ensure he was well enough to have the immunisation. </p>

There is clearly a large difference between a child bringing back a small amount of milk &#8211; posseting to use the &#8216;old fashioned&#8217; phrase &#8211; and I am satisfied that Mrs X was giving the clear impression of vomit without any qualification as to it being &#8216;small&#8217; or &#8216;large&#8217;.

The Mother said that the discussion about the child being sleepy during the day did happen but had in fact been in mid-February. In my assessment if Mrs X felt that the child was in pain she did not communicate this to the Mother. Even if there was no time at handover she could have texted. In my assessment she is again reinforcing the picture of the Mother as a mother who was too in a rush to be concerned about her son&#8217;s health. </p>

I have asked myself if the Mother sent her husband because she knew that the child had been injured and she wanted to distance herself from that but I do not think that was the reason. Her demeanour when she gave evidence about that day was entirely consistent with a concerned mother who reacted immediately when told her son was ill and ensured he was picked up as quickly as possible. </p>

She would have known when she picked him up and later that evening that he was unwell but, knowing that she had shaken him before and he had been okay afterwards she may have hoped that he would recover again. In my assessment this did not happen. If she had harmed him and wanted to keep him away from anyone there was no reason to take him to Mrs X&#8217;s home. She could have kept him at home all day. Both women were clear that he was well when he arrived. The medical evidence that the child may have been more irritable or clingy would fit with his mother&#8217;s description of his presentation that morning. </p>

Later that evening they decided that the Father would take the child to the GP in the morning rather than have an out of hours appointment. I find that the Father lied when he said that they had exams in the morning, although I think the reason was because he was trying to get an earlier appointment, and like many people he was trying to give reasons for them not having to wait until the early hours (2am) to be seen. I also find that he was less than candid about the contribution he made to the child&#8217;s care. I acknowledge that it was quite unusual in his culture for him to put his wife&#8217;s studies as a priority in their relationship and that he is as proud of her academic achievements as his own. He is self possessed and family orientated but he undoubtedly exaggerated the contribution he makes. The Mother was the one who got up in the night for most of the feeds and did the majority of nappy changes. I&#8217;m sure he played a sufficient role in his son&#8217;s life for there to be a possibility that he caused the injuries but I&#8217;m satisfied that in reality the division of labour so far as the child was concerned was far from equal and he could have done more. In my assessment the reason for his lies was firstly to get an early appointment and secondly to portray himself in a favourable light as a hands on father. I do not think that his lies were to conceal guilt or to point blame at anyone else. </p>

They both say that it was late and the child had settled.

The Father took the child to the GP for example when he had colic and there are recorded visits on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February and 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March in addition to the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.

He took him before 8 am which shows appropriate concern. I&#8217;m satisfied that it was the Father who drew attention to head circumference and set in train the events which led to admission and the discovery of the injuries. </p>

The phone records show that she didn&#8217;t and yet Mr Y told the police and filed a statement to say she had.  I&#8217;m satisfied on the evidence that Mrs X told him that she had when in fact she had not and that she deliberately lied to him. I find that he believed what she said and was therefore prepared to say that was what had happened even though he had not seen or heard it. The only alternative is that she &#8216;faked&#8217; a telephone call. The effect would have been the same, namely to deceive him and to avoid alerting the Mother and therefore the Father. The telephone records demonstrate that she did not call at all and her revised evidence that she was panicking and may not have made the call were in my assessment disingenuous and trying to cover up the deception which the records showed. I think it&#8217;s likely that he told her to contact the Mother and she may well have told him that she had but he did not see her try to call, did not hear her leave a voicemail and lied about that. I don&#8217;t think he was particularly interested or concerned about the child and he left his wife to the task of looking after the child. His willingness to give evidence about things his wife told him rather than what he had actually done or seen seriously undermined his credibility. He was arrogant when he gave his answers and displayed a disregard for the importance of assisting the court. I find that the principal motivation of his evidence was to exculpate his wife. </p>

If what Mrs X describes was accurate there was every reason to call 111 at the very least and to call the Mother as a priority.

I know in this case that the child was shaken forcibly on two occasions whist in one home or the other. The medical evidence is not particularly helpful as to timing but shows the wider timeframes. There is little corroborative material, although there is the primary, independent evidence of the phone calls and text messages and I have been able to identify factual occurrences as a result. I have then been able to look at whether any individual has lied about those facts and examine why they may have lied. Ultimately, I have to decide whose evidence I place greater weight upon. </p>

Described by some advocates as &#8216;unsatisfactory&#8217; I have to say my conclusions were that that was an understatement of the quality of Mrs X&#8217;s evidence. When looked at as a whole, giving allowance for translation and &#8216;confusion&#8217;, there is a clear thread of mendacity running throughout her evidence. From the moment she saw the police and social worker on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, by which time she knew there was a clear concern that the child had been injured, she twisted the evidence to exculpate herself and to implicate the Mother.  </p>

On each occasion I am satisfied that it was a knowledge of her own guilt, fear of detection and a desire to point the finger of blame at the Mother which was the reason for the lies. I am therefore satisfied that there is factual evidence on which to base my decision which, taken together with my overall ability to assess Mrs X in the witness box as she gave her evidence and the reasons for the lies she told, enable me to find on a balance of probabilities without any straining of the facts that Mrs X caused the injuries to the child by shaking him on two occasions when he was in her care in late February and mid March 2018. </p>
