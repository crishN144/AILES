Threshold is based upon A&#8217;s admission to hospital on 29/07/2020 with multiple and significant bruises to her face and back together with scratches and blood spots on her eyeballs.  There was also concern as to a leg fracture suffered in June 2020 which was at the time assessed to have an innocent explanation and this is confirmed by report of Dr Watt. The Local Authority accept that this injury is not suspicious. It is accepted that A suffered these injuries. The mother says that they are self -inflicted.</span></p>

The earlier leg fracture was also reconsidered although this is accepted as an accidental injury. </span></p>

Dr Y is a Consultant Paediatrician with a specialisation of children with autism.  She said that A had presented with significant multiple injuries on 29/07/20, including bruises to the face and back, both eyelids and bleeding under the outer covering of the left eye (conjunctiva), abrasion (friction burn) with a linear pattern to her face, bleeding from the mouth, reddening and swelling of the face and extensive bruising to her back. Dr Y considered it is more likely than not that the injuries on A&#8217;s face and back resulted from several impacts with a significant force of different types (for example bruises are caused by blunt trauma, but friction burns require contact with an abrasive surface), and possibly at different time points. Therefore, the explanation provided of A causing the majority of those injuries to herself by self-injurious behaviour sometime between midnight and 8 am on 29/07/20, while in a travel cot with soft bedding, was not consistent with the variety, location and severity of the findings.</span></p>

She doesn&#8217;t sleep and when she was given melatonin this seemed to make her more hyperactive and it was much better now, she was on Phenergan.</span></p>

I also bear in mind that it was the mother who had to pursue A&#8217;s broken leg and she was persistent in getting help for A. She had also requested a helmet which I was told was not available except for children who fell over because of mobility issues. I also consider that A had been prescribed Melatonin and I accept the mother and Dr Z&#8217;s evidence that this can make a child hyperactive and that is why she was changed back to Phenergan which has made a difference in calming her. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I have considered the point the Local Authority have made about the time A was in her cot. The mother checked her at midnight and then around 8 am. Whilst the bedroom was not next door to the mother, from the Police and the mother&#8217;s evidence it was not far away from her room. It is understandable that the mother would not want to put A or B in a room with an electrical meter or near the front door. I also bear in mind there are no perfect parents in the world although this mother appears to score very highly at all other times. She had left A in a travel cot. It might have been slightly longer than usual but a parent in this situation could not imagine the injuries that might have resulted. I take the mother&#8217;s point that A was a bad sleeper and listening to her on a baby monitor would probably have meant that she never had any sleep. We all must live in the real world and be realistic about what the mother could manage in the circumstances. I don&#8217;t think this is a failure to protect point. A harmed herself in her mother&#8217;s arms in front of doctors and her behaviour, as I have said, is off the ordinary scale.</span></p>

The mother had phoned her support worker. A was extremely distressed. The mother gave her a bath which the Local Authority say was unnecessary as she could have simply wiped away the blood. For a child without A&#8217;s difficulties this might be true. I have never met A but the description of her would suggest to me that the mother was trying to calm her before taking her to hospital bearing in mind she didn&#8217;t like strange places and trying to get her ready must have been difficult in this state. There is no suggestion by her support worker that there was any undue delay.</span></p>

Dr Z describes A throwing herself about which could have caused the bruising to the face and head. HH described her hitting herself and putting her fingers in her eyes. I accepted the evidence of Dr Cartlidge that the injuries to her eyes were most likely caused by A by her fingernails or hands. The bruising to her back could have been caused the day before. I am satisfied that the mother could not necessarily document every injury because A regularly hurt herself. The bruises seem to be bruises on bruises. Whilst ordinarily I am told that bruises to ears will most usually indicate abuse, I rely on Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s evidence that pinching would give a bigger bruise. A throwing herself to side to side could account for bruising to her ears. In any event I am not obliged to say how they were caused but I don&#8217;t think the mother or G caused them. Dr Saggar said that she may have bruised more easily and Dr Cartlidge said he caused red marks by normal handling.</span></p>

I take the point that these are doctors not lawyers. However, it does seem to me that although it is said that it didn&#8217;t affect the evidence ultimately, I was concerned that Dr Z and HH did feel under pressure to agree that these injuries were non-accidental and therefore inflicted by someone .It is difficult to reconcile Dr Z&#8217;s written evidence and statement to the Police with his very clear evidence that this was a loving mother who coped extraordinarily well and deserved a halo.</span></p>

I don&#8217;t blame the Local Authority for issuing them because the photographs do present a very serious picture. I am aware of the trauma both children and the family must have suffered because of this and I am very sorry that they have had to wait for so long for this to be rectified. I am aware that Dr Z was placed under pressure and of course it is easy for someone not involved directly to ask why he did what he did? However, safeguarding is very difficult at times, we all make mistakes and the consequences of getting a decision wrong have enormous ramifications, sometimes in the death of a child and this was a very difficult case. Dr Z is a kind and hardworking Paediatrician and that was evident in his evidence.</span></p>

I fully accept that it is a tool for teaching and learning but I would like the hospitals to be aware of cases such as this one where there might be issues of non -accidental injury and the dangers of  a group of doctors in effect deciding what has happened to a child. I can well understand if there are issues of treatment or other medical matters which may need to be discussed and I can see the advantages of a peer review meeting as a tool for teaching and learning in those circumstances. There is a very real issue of doctors and other professionals being swayed by a group opinion when the members of the group haven&#8217;t had any clinical care of that patient.</span></p>

LL is of course head of safeguarding. I can well understand her anxiety when she saw A&#8217;s photographs which all the professionals say made the injuries look so much worse than when they were presented. I was very shocked when I saw the extent of her injuries. I bear in mind this is an extraordinary case because of A&#8217;s extreme behaviour and disabilities. LL was not responsible for the Peer Review meeting, but I do think that she should have been aware of the dangers involved in holding something of this nature. I do understand that she was in a very difficult position because it is in effect a continuing professional event for the doctors, but I do hope that this can be reflected upon. She was absolutely adamant that these were inflicted injuries. Whilst I fully accept that they had to be investigated sometimes life is stranger than fiction.</span></p>

This of course would have been much less apparent to the people who had no actual knowledge of A&#8217;s behaviour. Sadly, parents do cause their children injury and it must be borne in mind that this is an exceptional, rare case where a child has caused herself significant injuries. The mother has to her credit worked well with social workers and the Guardian and she will continue to be involved with the Local Authority which will be necessary to support her with looking after A. I do hope the current difficulties can be resolved. All the parties conducted themselves very well. </span></p>
