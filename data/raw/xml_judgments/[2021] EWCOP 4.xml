MN&#8217;s father died in 2017 having refused treatment for cancer, and professionals believe that MN wishes to follow his father&#8217;s precedent. MN told a sibling: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I&#8217;m going to do what Dad did&#8221;</span>.

In the event MN has bladder cancer, if left untreated, there is an as yet unquantifiable risk that he will suffer a painful deterioration due to blood clots forming in his bladder and could be prevented from urinating. While the precise timescales are unknown, without a cystoscopy procedure, MN may experience a quicker and more unpleasant death resulting from a cancerous growth metastasising. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am delivering this judgment in the midst of the &#8216;second wave&#8217; of the Covid-19 pandemic. Hospital admissions, and the consequent pressure on intensive care units and more generally, presents a challenge for all concerned. In his evidence before me, Mr W<span style="color:#FF0000"/>referred me to the National Cancer Waiting Times Monitoring Dataset Guidance (Version 11.0, September 2020). This I assume to be the most up-to-date guidance available. It provides that the proposed treatment here should generally be scheduled within 31 days of a formal diagnosis. While a formal diagnosis has not been made due to MN&#8217;s refusal to engage in investigations, it is, as I have indicated, considered highly likely by MN&#8217;s treating clinicians that he has bladder cancer. As a result, the applicants originally asked the court to list a substantive hearing today, so that treatment might take place on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2021. As a consequence of the severe restriction on the number of beds available to elective surgical patients, due to Covid19, I was informed that it was unlikely to be possible for the procedure to take place before March 2021. I was told in oral evidence by Mr W that while enquiries had been made with two neighbouring NHS Trusts about the availability of elective urological surgery, the other Trusts face similar (or worse) situations. Mr W explained that currently, in addition to the extremely limited number of beds available for elective surgical cases (around an eighth of the Trust&#8217;s pre-pandemic capacity), an ITU bed would not be available for MN in the event he had an adverse reaction to the procedure. This is because the ITU beds are fully occupied by Covid-19 patients.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Thus, we find ourselves in the invidious position where, notwithstanding the fact that MN&#8217;s condition requires urgent examination and treatment, it is simply not deliverable. Without knowing the size of the obstruction, it is difficult for the treating clinicians to predict MN&#8217;s prognosis without treatment. However, in the likely event that MN does have bladder cancer, it will eventually metastasise, if it has not already done so, and sadly cause his death.  </p>

Both of the applicants have a clear connection to MN as the public bodies responsible for his treatment and the application is made in order to provide MN with medical treatment. The provision of life-sustaining treatment is the benefit to MN of the declaratory relief and orders sought. In light of the repeated unsuccessful attempts to engage MN to date and his longstanding diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, I agree that this benefit cannot be achieved in any other way.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I was profoundly concerned about the risks for MN of adjourning a decision about his treatment until March 2021. In his evidence, Mr W explained that because MN has an obstructed kidney, he is likely to have a muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This means that it is very unlikely that it will be possible to cure MN with the TURBT procedure alone. However, if MN had a superficial (rather than muscle-invasive) cancer, there is a risk that by delaying treatment, the cancer becomes muscle-invasive and more difficult to treat. Further, assuming MN has a muscle-invasive cancer already, delay increases the risk that the cancer will metastasise elsewhere in his body. Mr W reemphasised that in any event, MN was very unlikely to be offered radical curative treatment, such as chemotherapy followed by the removal of the bladder (cystectomy), for the reasons I have outlined above. Instead, the objective of the treatment would be to prevent bleeding and blood clots. This was unlikely to be affected by whether or not MN&#8217;s bladder cancer had metastasised. </p>

Specifically, I queried whether the extensive rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines amongst those in their 80s and 70s might take the pressure off the NHS by mid-February 2021, which I understand to be the time by which it is hoped that virtually all in that age group would have been offered a vaccine. Mr W informed me that it is his experience that those in these age groups are not ventilated on intensive care units, and consequently, that the pressure was unlikely to ease significantly for the foreseeable future. He did however consider that by mid-March 2021, the position ought to look much better.  </p>
