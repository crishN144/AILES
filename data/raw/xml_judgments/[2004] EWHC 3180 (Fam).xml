The respondent to the application, C's father (F), and M were never married. M's application is the most recent in&#8722;court litigation between the parents, the first round of which was decided by Mr Justice Johnson in January 1996, and is reported as <span style="font-weight:bold">P v P </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 2 FLR 230" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 2 FLR 230</ref>.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">On 14 May 2004 District Judge Bradley transferred the application to the High Court at the invitation of counsel then appearing before her, and directed that it should be listed for what was described as a Case Management Conference to decide 'which if any of the component parts of the application should proceed'. That hearing took place before me on 17 November 2004 when I heard submissions from Mr Howard Shaw for M and from Mr Singleton QC appearing with Mr James Roberts for F. I announced my decision there and then and gave directions intended to facilitate and govern the efficient expeditious and proportionate disposal of the issues which remain between the parties. This now is my judgment which I give leave to report.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">M is now 41 and F 47. Their relationship lasted about six months from March to September 1993. C was born the following June. M at some stage made application to the Child Support Agency, and it seems that in parallel to the intermittent court proceedings which I shall describe there has been a running battle of applications and other proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref>. At the outset of his 1996 judgment Johnson J referred to the seeming absurdity that F's liability could under the regulations then extant be calculated at zero when he lived in a house worth well over &#163;2 million, had the use of three motorcars which cost &#163;190,000, and enjoyed a corresponding lifestyle.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">For reasons which are elaborated in his judgment Johnson J rejected the invitation advanced by Mr Posnansky QC (who then appeared for M) which would have allowed a hard case to make bad law, and declined to adopt the expedient of dressing periodical maintenance payments up as a lump sum payable by instalments. What he did do however was to fix the sum which F should settle for the purpose of the acquisition of a home for M and C until, in accordance with the terms of the trust deed the detail of which was thereafter agreed between the parties, the property should revert to F. The amount in question was &#163;90,000. In addition that judge ordered F to pay a lump sum of &#163;24,300 of which &#163;15,000 related to his estimate of the cost of the additional furniture which would be required when M moved from the accommodation she and C then occupied.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">M did not attempt to appeal that decision, and F might well have expected, so far as his responsibility to house C was concerned, that the order defined its limits. He complied with that order: a two&#8722;bedroom flat in NW6, selected by M, was acquired by the trust and furnished, and M and C now live there together with M's second child now aged four. The father of that child, says M, is untraceable and has never provided any financial support.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">There was further litigation between the parties in 1999 which resulted in an order made by Mr Horowitz QC (as he then was) sitting as a deputy High Court judge. There had been intervening developments culminating in a decision of the Child Support Appeal Tribunal on 4 September 1998 as a result of which F's liability in respect of C was recalculated at &#163;143.40 per week. The application upon which Mr Horowitz QC adjudicated, amongst other things, related to claims in relation to school fees (for by now C was at a London private day school) and a 'top up' order in relation to which it was claimed that the court at that stage of the CSA saga had jurisdiction. Provision was made for F to meet the school fees (and some but not all the extras). The judge made findings of fact which ruled out a 'top<span style="color:#FF0000">&#8722;</span>up' order at that stage.</p>

	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">At the time when M issued her current application in March 2004 she was awaiting the outcome of a further appeal procedure within the CSA system which, she again hoped, would pave the way for this court to make a 'top up' order. It is one of the forms of relief which she hopes to achieve as part and parcel of her current applications. Whether or not her expectation that the relevant procedures would by now have been concluded was a reasonable position to hold, the fact is that the Tribunal hearing in question will not take place until next spring. Meanwhile F is paying just under &#163;450 per month for C, plus her private school fees which currently run at the rate of about &#163;10,500 per annum. The fact that finality (if indeed it will be such) had not been reached by the time of the hearing before me led to an ill&#8722;advised and last&#8722;minute application to adjourn until the outcome of the Tribunal hearing is known. That is not a sensible rationale for deferring what is essentially a jurisdictional argument based upon the construction of Schedule 1 and consideration of the way in which it has been interpreted and applied. As a result of the decisions taken at this hearing these parties can more realistically prepare for and maybe even negotiate their way out of the trial of the remaining issues.</p>

She makes it plain in addition that she seeks the 'top&#8722;up' payment referred to above.</p>

From this the gist of her claims as formulated at that stage emerges. In summary:</p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.5in">She contends that the existing settled property is now too small and that she (M) needs a four bedroom house or flat so that each of her children may have a bedroom and to accommodate guests. She values her existing property at &#163;320,000 and suggests that &#163;700,000 would enable her to rehouse. The claim under this heading is therefore for additional funds of the order of &#163;380,000, but a further &#163;45,000 also would be needed (and only F could pay it) for stamp duty, and conveyancing costs on sale and purchase.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">So far as the application for transfer of property is concerned, the documentation thus far filed in support of the application offered no hint as to what particular property to which F (in the language of the statutory provision) is 'entitled (either in possession or in reversion)' M has set her sights upon as the target she seeks to have transferred 'to the applicant, for the benefit of the child, or to the child herself'. In answer to my inquiry Mr Shaw was however able to clarify that M does not intend (if indeed jurisdiction exists) to direct C's claim against F's home (which Mr Shaw estimates may now be worth of the order of &#163;5 million) or against any of his shareholdings in public or private companies, but rather against a three bedroomed property in immediate proximity to his home in Belgravia. Given thus fortuitously the opportunity to respond to the specific claim, F maintains that he disposed of his interest in that property to a company for approximately &#163;450,000 as long ago as 1994. M revealed that it would be her contention that the company in question is one of which he is the sole director. Again, none of this affects the point of construction but the complexities and scale of the way in which M may develop and extend her case underline how appropriate it must be to stop the claim sooner rather than later if indeed there is no jurisdiction to pursue it.</p>

The Child Support Act so ordains. This was conceded only on the eve of the hearing before District Judge Bradley, who gave M leave to withdraw her application for those forms of relief, save in relation to school fees. The existing school fees order made by Mr Horowitz QC needs amendment, as to which there is no dispute, to provide for payments to be made to whichever is the next school C will attend. M seeks a relatively modest increase in the scope of the extras to be paid for by F, although he is suspicious (as on the information thus far provided it seems to me he is entitled to be) about the estimates M has made in this (and other) areas.</p>

However, these provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> were (as will be demonstrated) closely modelled on parallel provisions now reflected in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 23</ref> and 24 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> where powers arise 'on pronouncing a [relevant] decree or at any time thereafter'. I am quite satisfied that all that sub&#8722;paragraph (3) means is that where indeed there is power under any of the provisions of the paragraph to grant relief, then it matters not at what stage and age of the child's life the application is made. The short point of construction which does arise is whether the sub&#8722;paragraph (5)(b) embargo on making 'more than one order [requiring the settlement of property or requiring the transfer of property] against the same person in respect of the same child operates to inhibit the court from making any further order of either sort once it has already made one of the other <span style="font-style:italic">or </span>of the same description; or only from making another of the same sort and so leaving it permissible to make a subsequent one of the other description.

Thus if a transfer of land were directed to be made 'to the applicant for the benefit of the child' M would hold as bare trustee for C; and an order for the transfer of land 'to the child herself 'would give rise to the land being held in trust as a result of the combined operation of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law of Property Act 1925</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(6)</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> and Schedule 1, paragraph 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47" uk:canonical="1996 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996</ref>.</p>

Furthermore, the court has power to make lump sum orders even in favour of an applicant child who has attained adulthood in specified circumstances (paragraph 2); and on the occasion of varying or discharging an order for periodical payments or secured periodical payments (paragraph 5(3)). Thus the diversity of circumstances in which more than one lump sum may be ordered is wide.</p>

What he seeks to shut off from consideration at final hearing is M's attempt to seek to finance the upgrading of her accommodation by this limb of her application if (as I have decided they do) her claims for both forms of property adjustment order must fail. I am therefore not here concerned directly with jurisdiction, but with a request on behalf of F that I should at this stage rule whether the attempt to obtain from him a further &#163;425,000 or so to finance the substitution of a &#163;700,000 home for the existing &#163;320,000 flat is so devoid of any prospect of success that I should at this stage stop it in its tracks.</p>

He submitted that there is no reason why the present settlement should not be varied so that further monies go into it by way of a lump sum, and that there is no embargo against using a lump sum towards housing. He elaborated the submission by suggesting that the award of a lump sum for this purpose might be subjected to conditions, such as would require the money to be used towards housing which would in due course revert to F, in accordance with the same provisions as govern the trust of the existing accommodation.</p>

This initially appeared to F to be a high limit bearing in mind that M had by this stage of the hearing produced as an open document a formulation of what remains of the lump sum claims under headings totalling just over &#163;70,000. But there remains also the claim for a secured fund for future education. F at the same point in the hearing offered &#163;27,000 in relation to the lump sum claim. So that, although the gap between the parties still stood at &#163;43,000 (that is almost exactly just two thirds of what so far has been lost in costs), it is perhaps more amenable to negotiation after further discussion and the exchange of information than was the case when the upgraded housing, by whatever route, remained an issue.</p>
