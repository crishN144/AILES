It is also common ground - and I so find - that Mrs Meek is wholly unable to participate in any decision as to the making of a statutory will, or the calling in of the security bond.</p>

She was married, but her husband, Bert, died as long ago as 1961.  He was at the time some 44 years of age.  Gladys and Bert&#160;Meek had one child, Barbara, but she died in 2010, aged 67.  Bert Meek had died intestate, and letters of administration had been taken out to that estate on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;September 1961 by Gladys Meek as his lawful widow and only person entitled to his estate on intestacy.  The net value of the estate was &#163;606/8s.  Barbara also died intestate, and her estate passed to Mrs Meek absolutely.</p>

Margaret&#160;Lynne Parkin (known as Lynne,) is the daughter of Frank Parkin, Mrs Meek&#8217;s brother, who died in 1984.  Lynne Parkin is now 55 years of age.  Jason Parkin is the son of Frank&#8217;s deceased son, Kevin Parkin, who was Mrs Meek&#8217;s nephew; and Jason is 43 years of age.</p>

Mrs Johnson is aged 61.  She is a great niece by marriage, being the granddaughter of Bert Meek&#8217;s sister, Phyllis.  Mrs Miller is 72 and she is a daughter of Bert&#8217;s sister, Gladys.  The appointment of Mrs Johnson and Mrs Miller as Mrs Meek&#8217;s deputies was joint and several; and they were ordered to obtain and maintain security in the sum of &#163;275,000 in accordance with the standard requirements as to the giving of security.</p>

In summary, having made various gifts and transfers of cash, and having been alerted to the fact that such transactions might be outwith the scope of their authority as deputies, in October 2011 Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson, acting in person, applied (in an application described by Senior Judge Lush as &#8220;eccentric&#8221;) for ratification of unspecified gifts which they had made.  In their application they stated that they had &#8220;acted as we thought the Court of Protection order granted us, enabling us to gift and donate in relation to the size of the estate&#8221;.  As Mrs Meek was 92 years old, they said that they believed that approximately &#163;200,000 would be adequate, and if that were not enough for her to live, on it was said that there was no way that she would &#8220;go short&#8221;.  The court subsequently joined the Public Guardian as respondent to the application and directed investigations into the deputies&#8217; conduct.  A final hearing took place on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>&#160;April, and Senior Judge Lush&#8217;s written judgment was handed down on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>&#160;April&#160;2013.</p>

Senior Judge Lush ratified charitable gifts totalling &#163;57,352, gifts to Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson and their families totalling &#163;13,500, and gifts to Susan Grimshaw (who is a friend dating back to university days of Barbara&#160;Meek) and her family totalling &#163;2,500.  </p>

The deputy&#8217;s costs were anticipated as being in the order of some &#163;30,000.  Those of the Official Solicitor, representing Mrs Meek as her litigation friend, were estimated in the order of &#163;20,000.  The costs of Lynne Parkin were estimated at some &#163;12,600, and those of Jason Parkin at some &#163;11,000.  The combined costs of Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson were estimated to be in the order of some &#163;18,000.  That makes something in the order of &#163;92,000 in total, which would leave little more than &#163;20,000 remaining in Mrs&#160;Meek&#8217;s estate, although this takes no account of the funds owed to Mrs Meek by Mrs Johnson and Mrs Miller.  Mrs Meek&#8217;s annual income is approximately &#163;9,400, and her annual expenditure is estimated to be about &#163;34,500, so there is an annual income shortfall of around &#163;25,000.  In addition to the costs to which I have already made reference, the deputy has also incurred fees in the order of &#163;15,000 independently of this statutory will application and its associated costs.  </p>

He suggests that as a condition for the court not seeking to call the sum calculated as owing in full, or directing an account, the former deputies should be required to waive any further claims for expenses against the estates of either Mrs&#160;Meek or Barbara.

P&#8217;s wishes and feelings will always be a significant factor to which the court must pay close regard, but the weight to be attached to those wishes and feelings will always be case-specific and fact-specific.  In some cases, in some situations, they may carry much, even, on occasions, preponderant, weight.

However, Mr Justice Morgan and Senior Judge Lush have expressed doubts.  As Mr Justice Morgan pointed out, the making of the gift and/or the terms of the will are not being made by P, but by the court; and, furthermore, insofar as there is a dispute between family members, the unsuccessful members are not likely to think that he had done the right thing.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Speaking for myself, I do not consider that either Lord Justice Lewison, or the present President of the Court of Protection, were oblivious to the considerations identified by Mr Justice Morgan in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re: G (TJ) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2010/3005" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCOP 3005" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 3005 (COP)</ref>.  In my judgment, what Mr Justice Lewison referred to as &#8220;the right thing&#8221; is to be judged from the perspective, not of any relatives or friends who may be competing for a share of the incapacitous person&#8217;s testamentary bounty, but rather from the perspective of the well-informed, and disinterested, objective bystander.  Nevertheless, &#8220;the right thing&#8221; is to be judged, as Baroness Hale&#8217;s recent speech makes clear, by reference to the standards of the incapacitous person himself, and not by what the reasonable incapacitous person might be thought to think.  Further, in my judgment, the concept of being remembered &#8220;as having done the right thing&#8221; still has relevance even if, because of the lack of testamentary capacity, the right thing has to be done for the testator by the Court of Protection.</p>

In the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re: JC </span>[2012] COPLR 540<span style="font-style:italic"/>Senior Judge Lush (at paragraph 53) stated that he had doubts about the effectiveness of the balance sheet approach in statutory will applications.  He said that the balance sheet approach worked satisfactorily in certain cases, where a risk analysis was involved; but in the case he was considering, Senior Judge Lush said that he had struggled to identify any &#8220;factors of actual benefit&#8221; or &#8220;counterbalancing dis-benefits&#8221;, or &#8220;risks of possibility of loss&#8221; or &#8220;possibilities of gain&#8221;.  He did, however, recognise that, despite his doubts about the efficacy of the balance sheet approach, there would usually be at least one factor of &#8220;magnetic importance&#8221; to assist the judge in reaching a decision.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I must say that I do not, at least in the present case, share Senior Judge Lush&#8217;s doubts about the efficacy of the balance sheet approach.  At paragraph 53 of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s position statement, a balance sheet approach is adopted; and I have found it particularly useful, as will appear later in this judgment.  In my judgment, it may be helpful to prepare a table of arguments for, and against, both the making of a statutory will and, if it is decided that one is appropriate, the identification of the various beneficiaries, and the shares of the incapacitous person&#8217;s estate which should pass to each of them.  This exercise is not one that involves the exercise of a judicial discretion.  It requires an exercise of judicial judgment; but one that is very much a value judgment, which inevitably involves weighing various factors against each other in the balance before deciding where the balance falls.</p>

The giving of security is governed by rule 200 of the Court of Protection Rules and regulations 33 to 37 of the Lasting Powers of Attorney, Enduring Powers of Attorney and Public Guardian Regulations 2007 (Statutory Instrument 2007/1253) as amended.</p>

Effectively, the bond scheme offers an alternative to a deputy bringing an action against a previous defaulting deputy to recover lost or stolen funds.  It provides an immediate, and straightforward, mechanism by which the court can ensure that an incapacitous person is compensated for losses that have been incurred through the default of his deputy.  It avoids the delay and expense which the incapacitous person would otherwise face in bringing proceedings against a defaulting deputy, who may be of questionable solvency, and enforcing any judgment obtained within those proceedings.  The defaulting deputy does not get off scot-free, but he is instead likely to face proceedings brought by the bond provider.</p>

In that case, Sir&#160;James&#160;Munby was considering the <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> principle.  In applying that principle, Sir James considered whether the Court of Protection was required to treat the incapacitous person&#8217;s best interests as determinative.  Although he found it unnecessary to reach any concluded decision on the point, his view was that when the Court of Protection was considering a question of <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span>, it was fundamentally deciding not what should be done for, or on behalf of, the incapacitous person; it was deciding only which court should make those decisions.  Therefore his view was that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(5)</ref> did not apply.</p>

In my judgment, the &#8220;best interests&#8221; principle <span style="font-weight:bold">does</span> apply to a decision by the court whether to call in a security bond provided by a defaulting deputy.  I accept that when the court is considering a question of <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span>, it is not making any decision for or on behalf of the incapacitous person.  But it seems to me that that is not the position where the court is deciding whether a security bond provided by a defaulting deputy should be enforced.  Such a decision is clearly one made &#8220;for or on behalf of&#8221; the incapacitous person because the decision will affect the amount of the incapacitous person&#8217;s estate.

Miss Hughes submitted that the court had a discretion whether or not to call in the security bond, and that there was at present no guidance as to how that discretion should be exercised.  Miss Hughes submitted for the Official Solicitor that it should be a rare case indeed when the court decided not to ratify gifts made by a deputy, but refused to call in the security bond.

Calling in the security bond would merely short-circuit that process, and save the incapacitous person the costs and delay of suing the defaulting deputy, and enforcing judgment against him.  It is said by the Official Solicitor that failure by the court to call in the security bond would denude the incapacitous person of the protection which Parliament, the Office of the Public Guardian, and the court intended him to have, which is implicit in the security system itself.  If the court would not, almost as a matter of course, enforce the security bond in circumstances where the deputy had run away with a significant portion of the incapacitous person&#8217;s estate, then it is said that this would significantly undercut the effectiveness of the whole system, and the benefit which persons lacking capacity generally obtain from paying the premiums on security bonds year in year out.  It is said that the impecuniosity of the defaulting deputy cannot be a reason for the court to refuse to enforce a security bond because this fact would make it all the more difficult for a new deputy to obtain satisfaction independently.</p>

This was because such a deputy would almost invariably be able to say that they were close to the incapacitous person, and, notwithstanding their default, he would not wish them to suffer, and therefore the security bond ought not to be called in.</p>

A reluctance on the part of the court to refuse to call in a security bond, where the defaulting deputy was close to the incapacitous person, would very significantly undermine the protection which Parliament had decided that the incapacitous person should enjoy.</p>

The Official Solicitor submits that the personal chattels should go to Susan Grimshaw or, failing her, to her daughter Rachel, or Rachel&#8217;s issue.  In the light of the most recent visit by the representative of the Official Solicitor to Mrs Meek&#8217;s room, it would appear that the scope of that gift of personal chattels is likely to be extremely limited.  The residuary estate is proposed by the Official Solicitor to be divided into eight equal parts.  Two parts should go to Rachel Grimshaw, with substitutionary provisions for her issue.  Two parts should go to each of Christadelphian Care Homes and National Trust for Scotland; and one part should go to each of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Ashbourne Animal Welfare.  There should also be a cross-accrual provision.  The Official Solicitor supports the application of the panel deputy for the court to direct the Public Guardian to call in the former deputies&#8217; security bond.</p>

Mrs Preston&#8217;s position is that her clients should be given an opportunity to repay half of the agreed amount outstanding of &#163;250,000 within three months.  The residue should only be called in during Mrs Meek&#8217;s lifetime if she requires any further sums to meet the annual shortfall of income over expenditure in the order of &#163;25,000 a year.  The remaining &#163;125,000 of the amount owed should be satisfied out of the presumptive entitlements of Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson under the statutory will.  Mrs Preston acknowledges that it is in Mrs Meek&#8217;s best interests for the bond to be called in, rather than for the deputy to take proceedings against Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson; but she says that it is not necessary or appropriate for the bond to be called in immediately or all at once.  Half of the bond should be called in in three months, and the remainder only after Mrs Meek&#8217;s estate falls to be distributed, unless Mrs Meek needs further capital during her lifetime.  Mrs Preston submits that her clients should not be placed under the additional stress of the bond being called in.

Mr Ross stressed the fact that Bert Meek had died in 1961, at the age of 44, and that Gladys&#8217;s brother, Frank, had died early from emphysema, apparently at the age of 61.  Throughout some 88 years until 2007, when she first suffered a lack of testamentary capacity, Gladys had resolutely refrained from making a will, even though she had taken out letters of administration to her late husband&#8217;s estate in 1961 on his intestacy, and even though she and Barbara had been involved in a number of property transactions which would have afforded them the opportunity of making a will.  Mr Ross submitted that it would be an exercise in unjustified paternalism for the court to assume that Gladys could not, had she wished, have made a will, even one in favour of Barbara, but with provision for a substituted beneficiary, or beneficiaries, if Barbara should predecease her.  He pointed to the fact that Mrs Meek was, on the evidence, an intelligent woman.  He made the point that, for many, many years, Gladys&#160;Meek had visited Scotland and attended the Christadelphian Church, and yet she had at no stage thought fit to leave them even a modest pecuniary legacy in a will.</p>

Lynne herself accepted that Gladys was a difficult and unbending lady.  She agreed with the proposition that once one had fallen out with Gladys, there was no going back.  As against that evidence, I do bear in mind that Lynne said that even though Gladys had fallen out with Ida (Mrs Meek&#8217;s sister), she thought that Gladys would still have wished to leave something to Ida in her will if Ida had still been alive, and had survived Gladys.  When I questioned Lynne about that, she said that her reason for saying that was because she thought that they would have made it up in the end.</p>

I accept the submission that they are the only people who have any real continuing claim on the bounty of Gladys Meek, albeit to some extent that is simply because she has inherited through her daughter.</p>

I accept that it is appropriate for two parts to pass to the Christadelphian Care Homes, two parts to the National Trust for Scotland, one part to the RSPB and one part to an animal welfare charity.  In the absence of any better candidate, it seems to me that it is appropriate for that animal welfare charity to be a local welfare charity, Ashbourne Animal Welfare, whose principal activities are the rescue and re-homing of cats and dogs, the provision of necessary veterinary care and treatment, and the promotion of good practice in animal care and welfare.</p>

But it is clearly stated by Mrs Johnson in her witness statement that that donation was set up by Mrs Johnson and Mrs Miller rather than Gladys Meek.  In those circumstances, and given that there is no other evidence of any interest on the part of Gladys Meek in the deaf, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to include that charity as one of the beneficiaries under the statutory will.</p>

Particularly given the likely costs of these proceedings, and the consequent effect upon Mrs Meek&#8217;s existing assets, it would be imprudent in the extreme for the deputy to wait before taking any action as by that stage he could not be confident that he would have the necessary funds available to see the proceedings through.  Moreover, Mrs Meek needs the income which would otherwise be generated by the funds which her former deputies have misappropriated.</p>

It cannot be in Mrs Meek&#8217;s best interests to require what is left of her dwindling resources to be expended on litigation when a straightforward alternative is available.  I also accept that the whole purpose of requiring a deputy to provide security, the premiums for which are paid at the expense of the incapacitous party, is to put in place a cheap, quick and simple mechanism to reimburse the incapacitous party&#8217;s estate in the event of a deputy&#8217;s default.</p>

His submission was that because of the way in which they had conducted themselves, and abused their fiduciary position with regard to Gladys Meek, it could not be said to be in her best interests for any reduction to be made in the amount to be called in on the security bond.  He emphasised that Gladys Meek and her daughter, Barbara, had lived modestly, and would have been horrified had they known, and appreciated, the nature and effects of the conduct of Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson.  Even if they were now to repay the money back, or if it were to come back to the estate through enforcement of the security bond, it would not be appropriate to allow the former deputies anything.</p>

The reason for that is that Gladys Meek needs the money brought back into her estate quickly.  Care costs have been depleting Mrs Meek&#8217;s estate over time, and they will represent a significant factor for the future.  The Official Solicitor is very concerned for the money to come back into Mrs&#160;Meek&#8217;s estate so that she can have the security of knowing that her future care home fees will be met.</p>

In the present case, I am not satisfied that there is any sufficient reason for not taking that course.  The whole purpose and object of the security bond is, as has been submitted, to provide a speedy and effective source for remedying any default on the part of a deputy.

In my judgment, the amount for which it should be called in should be the full amount of the bond, in the sum of &#163;275,000.  It is acknowledged by Mrs Johnson and Mrs Miller that they owe Mrs Meek &#163;250,000.  I am entirely satisfied that the balance of &#163;25,000 represents loss suffered by Gladys Meek&#8217;s estate as a result of the defaults of Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson.  When one looks at the figures to which I have already made reference, I have no doubt whatsoever that the unnecessary expenditure in legal costs that has been, and will be, incurred by the panel deputy exceeds the sum of &#163;25,000, and therefore the full amount of the bond ought to be called in.</p>

In my judgment, it would not be in Mrs Meek&#8217;s best interests for this to be done.  Were the police to be alerted to this, I have no doubt that they would wish to contact the deputy, and that further costs would be incurred by him which would have to be defrayed out of Mrs&#160;Meek&#8217;s estate.  I am also concerned that any police investigation would raise a serious risk that Mrs Johnson and Mrs Miller would be advised to cease any continuing contact with Mrs Gladys Meek whilst the police investigation, and any subsequent prosecution, were continuing and pending.  I am also concerned that a police investigation might result in an approach, or approaches, whether directly by the police themselves, or indirectly through Social Services or some other body, to Mrs Meek; and again that would not be in her best interests.  I am also concerned that it may be that any police investigation would involve Mrs Johnson or Mrs Miller in having to fund the defence of those criminal proceedings; and again that might operate to Mrs Meek&#8217;s detriment in diverting resources away from her continuing care.  So, for those reasons, I am not proposing to direct that the panel deputy should refer the matter to the police.</p>

On 8 May I received the draft of this judgment for approval. On the same day I sent an email to all the parties&#8217; representatives informing them of my provisional view that now that Mrs Meek had passed away, there was no reason why my judgment should not be published in full; but that I would welcome representations from the parties on the point. On 12 May I received a characteristically helpful email from Mr Rees stating that his client (the former panel deputy and applicant) had no views one way or the other as to whether the final judgment should be anonymised, that being a matter for the court, but making certain observations on the law. Mr Rees drew my attention to two authorities: <span style="font-style:italic">Re: C (Adult Patient Publicity) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 2 FLR 251" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 2 FLR 251</ref> (Sir Stephen Brown P) and <span style="font-style:italic">Newcastle upon Tyne Foundation Hospitals Trust v LM</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/454" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 454" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 454</ref> (Peter Jackson J).

He does however raise the issue of Susan and Rachel Grimshaw because they became involved in these proceedings at the Official Solicitor&#8217;s request, and they are neither parties to, nor legally represented in, the proceedings. Indeed, in the context of not making public information passed to them about the case, the Official Solicitor had informed the Grimshaws that the proceedings were in private. Had Mrs Meek not died, it is said to be very unlikely that they would have been named in any judgment. Now that it is proposed to publish the judgment in full, the Official Solicitor would simply draw the court&#8217;s attention to the issue of the Grimshaws&#8217; rights under Article 8 of the ECHR, which need to be considered as part of any decision about whether they should be named, or should remain anonymous, in the judgment. The court is very grateful to the Official Solicitor and Miss Hughes for raising this issue, and for the assistance that they have provided in this regard.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">I have concluded that this judgment should be published in full, without anonymisation. I accept Mr Rees&#8217;s submission that this court has the jurisdiction, notwithstanding the death of Mrs Meek, to make an order under rule 91 (2) (b) of the Court of Protection Rules 2007 authorising the publication of the text of the whole of this judgment and of the court&#8217;s order. By rule 93 (1) such an order may be made at any time and of the court&#8217;s own initiative, although only where it appears to the court that there is good reason for making the order. Whilst aspects of the Court of Protection&#8217;s jurisdiction plainly disappear on the death of the protected person (so that, by way of example, it can no longer authorise the making of a will or the making of a gift by the protected person after his death), other aspects (such as the power to make a costs order or to call in a security bond) plainly endure. The fact that rule 93 (1) (b) provides that an order permitting the publication of the full text of a judgment (under rule 91 (2) (b)) may be made &#8220;at any time&#8221; makes it clear that the Court has the jurisdiction to authorise the reporting of an unanonymised judgment, even after the protected person&#8217;s death, provided always that it is satisfied that there is good reason for making such an order. In the present case I am satisfied that there is such good reason; and I make an order under rule 91 (2) (b) accordingly authorising the publication of the text of the whole of this judgment on an unanonymised basis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">I accept that the death of the protected person (P) will not automatically render it appropriate to authorise the publication of any relevant Court of Protection judgment in unanonymised form; but it is clearly a relevant consideration. P&#8217;s death means that P no longer has any need for the special protection afforded by anonymity. However, as Sir Stephen Brown recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> (cited above), the court must consider the potential effect on P&#8217;s relatives and other family members, on clinicians treating P, and on persons caring for P, if they knew that on P&#8217;s death, their anonymity might be lost. That public interest also extends to those who provide witness evidence for the purposes of Court of Protection proceedings. The court must be sensitive to the article 8 right to respect for the private and family life of such persons, as well as of P. Such sensitivity must extend not only to those who feature in the proceedings presently under consideration, but also to those involved in any previous relevant proceedings, whose identities may be exposed by the publication of an unanonymised judgment in the instant proceedings. It is in the public interest that those who aspire to care for an incapacitous person, or to manage his affairs, should not be exposed to the full glare of public criticism if they genuinely fall short. To do so might discourage others to take on such a role. But the court must also be sensitive to, and weigh in the balance, the article 10 right to freedom of expression, including the right to receive and impart information. It is an important constitutional principle, and an aspect of the rule of law in any democratic society, that justice should be open to public scrutiny; and the media form the conduit through which the public may receive information about court proceedings. It is clearly in the public interest that those who may be found, not simply to have fallen short of the high standards required of them by the Court of Protection, but to have abused the trust placed in them properly to care for P or to manage P&#8217;s affairs, should be exposed to the full glare of publicity. The knowledge of the risk of this may serve to deter others from doing the same.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">In the present case, I am satisfied that the publication and reporting of the unanonymised text of this judgment affords no risks (whether to their article 8 rights or otherwise) to anyone other than Mrs Johnson and Mrs Miller. The statutory next-of-kin of Mrs Meek, and also her former panel deputy, have no objection. Mrs Grimshaw and her daughter can only receive credit for their role in P&#8217;s life, and for their limited, and modest, involvement in this litigation. There is no conceivable criticism of any of those who have treated or physically cared for Mrs Meek during her lifetime. Even the conduct of Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson towards Mrs Meek is not without its positive aspects since (as I have recorded) they have been there for Mrs Meek when no one else was, they have done a great deal for her, and she loved them to bits. However, there is force in Mr Radford&#8217;s point that had this litigation taken the form of a claim to recover moneys allegedly procured as a result of undue influence exercised against a person now deceased, there would have been no question of anonymity. In my judgment, the general rule (in rule 90(1)) that hearings in the Court of Protection are to be held in private (which, as a <span style="font-weight:bold">general</span> rule, should, in my judgment fall to be reconsidered) was never intended to afford a shield to those who abuse the trust of those whose interests the rule was promulgated to protect. In my judgment, not only is there good reason to make an order in the present case, but there is no countervailing reason not to do so.</p>
