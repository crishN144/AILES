	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The primary application with which I have been concerned is the application by H to strike out W&#8217;s application to set aside a financial remedy order made by Mostyn J on 25 January 2022 on the ground of H&#8217;s misrepresentation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In October 2021 Mostyn J heard the parties&#8217; financial remedy applications following the breakdown of the marriage between W and H.  He gave judgment on 5 November 2021.  In his judgment he tackled the division between the parties of H&#8217;s interest in private equity funds which he had established with another founding partner.</p>

	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The formula which the judge adopted in order to determine the marital element is set out at paragraph 15 of his judgment.  Put broadly, W was to share in the marital element of H&#8217;s carry in the funds which was calculated as the period measured in months from the establishment of the fund to the date of trial as a percentage of the total number of months from establishment until the close of the fund, so as to enable her to share in that element which reflected marital carry.  Crucial to the calculation was the date of the establishment of the fund and the date of anticipated closure.  </p>

	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The dates which the judge accepted were not in dispute at trial. Fund 1 was established in October 2016.  Its first close was in March 2017 and the term of the fund was 8 years from the first close.  The judge operated on the basis that close would be in 2025, unless extended.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is now common ground that the close was not 8 years from 2017, but in fact 8 years from 2015.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It follows that the judge&#8217;s calculations were wrong because the period of post separation (or post trial) was exaggerated, and the consequence was that the percentage of the value that W received from Fund 1 was under-calculated.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H accepts that his evidence to the judge that the fund had some 4 years to run was inaccurate as it had only 2 years from trial (in round figures).  He says that this was an innocent mistake made by him as a result of wrong information being recorded by professional advisors in the documents upon which he relied.  W says that he must have all along known the truth of the situation, and certainly by the time of trial.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The order of the judge further provided for H to give information and documentary evidence of fund activities as set out at paragraph 16 of the order.  That information would have enabled W and her advisors to be on the same footing as investors in the fund and to be able to see what steps were being taken and when in respect of the closure and consequent distributions.  H failed to provide any such documentation, which left W in ignorance.</p>

I recall that I was concerned on pre-reading that there appeared to be an intermingling by W of arguments which related to her construction application but also a set-aside argument which was not before the court.  Many of the questions which W sought H to be compelled to reply to were material to a set-aside application rather than construction.  </p>

First, H&#8217;s argument both by way of statement and presentation to the court at the hearing before Mostyn J was that 2025 was the correct date.  It was, after all, his business and he was the one who should know.  Secondly, there were many other documents which gave the erroneous date of 2025, all of them provided by H. He cannot put on W the burden of discovering his error.</p>

Henderson v Henderson abuse of process, as now understood, although separate and distinct from cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel, has much in common with them. The underlying public interest is the same: that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twice vexed in the same matter. This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in early proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not. Thus while I would accept that lack of funds would not ordinarily excuse a failure to raise in earlier proceedings an issue which could and should have been raised then, I would not regard it as necessarily irrelevant, particularly if it appears that the lack of funds has been caused by the party against whom it is sought to claim. While the result may often be the same, it is in my view preferable to ask whether in all the circumstances a party&#8217;s conduct is an abuse than to ask whether the conduct is an abuse and then, if it is, to ask whether the abuse is excused or justified by special circumstances. Properly applied, and whatever the legitimacy of its descent, the rule has in my view a valuable part to play in protecting the interests of justice.&#8221;</span></p>

The proper course is for parties to put their cards on the table so that no one is taken by surprise and the appropriate course in case management terms can be considered by the judge. In particular parties should not keep quiet in the hope of improving their position in respect of a claim arising out of similar facts or evidence in the future.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances I conclude that I should not strike out W&#8217;s application as an abuse of the process of the court.  My decision is consistent with the ratio of Sharland v Sharland [2015] UKSC 60.  It does not sit easily with me to say that an admitted wrong should be unable to be corrected except in the clearest of circumstances, which in my judgment do not arise here.  Insofar as there has been an avoidable duplication of costs, that is something that I can deal with at a later stage.  </p>

I accept that W&#8217;s pleadings of dishonesty, such as they are, are deficient but, her argument that H must have been aware of his false presentation bearing in mind the steps that were taken to establish a continuation fund within months of the conclusion of the proceedings before Mostyn J is one of a number of arguments that gives rise to an arguable case.</p>

H will argue, I am told, that if the case is reopened as to the calculation of W&#8217;s interest in Fund 1, he will argue that the judge seriously over-valued his interest in Fund 2.  I know nothing about the detail of it other than it appears to be common ground that the fund has underperformed.  </p>

However the benefits of such mediation are obvious and the body language of the parties in court indicated to me that they agree.  I have the power to adjourn proceedings for that mediation to take place, and it is a power that I intend to exercise having considered with counsel when an appropriate time would be.</p>
