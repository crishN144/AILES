The court will see that the total estimated costs per annum where a suitable qualified, experienced and supervised care team leader is not available equals &#163;47,565.60. The estimated costs per annum where a suitable qualified, experienced and supervised care team leader is available, and pharmacy visits and supervision can be provided by him/her, equals &#163;36,138.40.</span></p>

If Helen were to receive care and case management services from a professional, then I wholly agree with Judy that the duties detailed in her report would be necessary to ensure Helen is safe and well.  A couple of times historically I have tried to decrease the amount of care and case management that I provided to Helen, as I wanted to see whether this was possible and whether I could try and have paid employment as well. Unfortunately, there was an almost immediate clear deterioration in Helen&#8217;s physical and mental well-being and I could not bring myself to continue at the decreased hours. I found that I was soon providing the same amount of hours as I had been previously.</span></p>

I would always wish to prioritise Helen&#8217;s well-being and it has only been recently that I have been able to commence private tuition for a few hours each week, earning approximately &#163;50 per week term time (approximately &#163;20 per hour). I am teaching adult GCSE Maths Class Wednesday evenings for 2&#189; hours and attending college Wednesday afternoons for 4 hours to do a PGCE. I am therefore not available for Helen during these times and I have had to reschedule a couple of her medical appointments already. I will be monitoring any effect on Helen&#8217;s well-being closely, but this is less demanding on time than previous attempts.</span></p>

Therefore, there will be no tax or National Insurance Contributions consequences on such payments made for caring duties. Similarly, where payments emanate out of a Trust Fund set up for this purpose there is unlikely to be an enforceable contract, therefore, there should be no question of tax being assessable as employment income or of a liability for Class 1 NICs. Caring activity under these circumstances would not be gainful employment so there will be no liability for Class 2 NICs. The services provided are unlikely to be regarded as commercial in nature or amount to valuable consideration so there will not be a charge to tax on trade profits or on income not otherwise charged to tax.&#8221;</span></p>
