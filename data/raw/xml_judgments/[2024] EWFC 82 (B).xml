The mother has been represented by Mr Gulliver of counsel, the father represented by Ms Lau of counsel and A, through her Children&#8217;s Guardian, Ms Holt, has been represented by Ms Wilkinson of counsel.  I am grateful to all of them for the way in which this case has been sensibly conducted and for their extremely helpful written closing submissions to me.  I invited them to prepare an agreed chronology and that document has proved very helpful.</span></p>

If father has abused A in the way alleged, there has been significant sexual, emotional, and physical harm.  If he has not, given the repeated sexually explicit matters A has referred to, A must have been coached into thinking/saying these things happened to her.  The only person who could have done this is Mother.  Given A&#8217;s age, the coaching will have been deliberate and sustained and A has suffered significant emotional and sexual harm as a result.  A has also had unnecessary medical examinations by the GP and unnecessary professional involvement from the Local Authority and [Therapeutic Services]&#8221;.</span></p>

Beyond issues of social stigma, perpetrating adults are often reluctant to make admissions in the context of family proceedings in circumstances where they face, or may face, criminal prosecution.  The alleged victims of sexual abuse are often vulnerable children with other difficulties that can affect the credibility of their allegations, which allegations often emerge a considerable time after the alleged abuse has taken place, and therefore long after any physical evidence that may have existed has disappeared.  The allegations may emerge in a piecemeal fashion, with children often not reporting events in a linear history, reporting them in a partial way and revisiting topics more than once.  Such children may, whether by reason of their age, or the impact of the alleged sexual abuse or other difficulties, be idiosyncratic, inconsistent, or unreliable historians.  The age, psychological state and/or views of the child may mean &#8230; that the court does not hear their accounts challenged forensically in cross examination and, accordingly, is deprived of one of the key forensic tools for testing the truth of a disputed account before the law.  The child may suffer from psychological sequalae that may or may not be the product of sexual abuse but which, in any event, makes the assessment of their reliability even more difficult.  It is not unknown for children to lie about having experienced sexual abuse or to fabricate allegations of the same.</span></p>

What is remembered of an experience by a child or young person will not be a complete picture akin to a photograph or CCTV recording and will vary depending on the age at which the experience took place.&#160; What an adult may consider to be a key element of a remembered experience, and therefore key to assessing the reliability of the memory, may not be significant from a child&#8217;s perspective.&#160; The physiological processes involved in the encoding, storage and retrieval of memories are susceptible to internal and external influences.&#160; Within this context, children&#8217;s accounts can be affected by their level of functioning, their emotional state and their levels of suggestibility.&#160; It is also possible for a child to &#8216;remember&#8217; an event that has not in fact occurred, or which has not occurred precisely in the way remembered. &#160;The child&#8217;s recollection of past experiences can be influenced by the process of questioning the child&#160;&#8230;</span></p>

In her evidence, Mother went further and said that she is now convinced that her first concerns back in 2022 of abuse were correct and that her father has been abusing A every time he has had the opportunity whenever A has visited him for contact.</span></p>

She was able to describe things that A had said to her, which supported what Mother said of some of the things that A had earlier said to her.  However, what was clear from her evidence was that A made allegations against her father only when her mother was present.  On one such occasion, going to her mother and whispering before speaking of things she said had been done by her father.</span></p>

Some of them stop with A in mid-sentence, A is clearly prompted in others and led, numerous times.  A knows she is being recorded by her mother, and these are clearly not spontaneous interactions.  Despite the explicit allegations in the videos, A does not seem upset, the mother does not appear emotional, both of which are sharply at odds with what is being discussed in the videos.</span></p>

Where, in the same way that a child is seldom seen being sexually abused, a child is being manipulated to make what are false allegations, it is hardly likely to be seen enduring that process by anybody else.  What is known, is that the moment Mother stopped A&#8217;s contact to her father, she effectively stopped A&#8217;s contact with the outside world.  A stopped going to nursery.  She spent all her time with her mother, and it is noteworthy that all the allegations that Mother relies on took place with her mother present.</span></p>

There has been no repeat.  A said nothing at nursery.  She has said nothing since starting at school.  That may be because she has tried to put things behind her and/or she regards school and nursery as safe places.  Alternatively, it may well be that she knows that there is no need for her to say anything more.</span></p>

She made new and extremely serious allegations against the father suggesting additional things said by A for the first time in the witness box, things that had not appeared in her witness statement to the police, her witness statements in the proceedings, or anywhere else.  Mother&#8217;s evidence of the abuse lacked any emotional empathy for A.  What she showed was anger towards the father.</span></p>
