Since October 2013, when I dealt with the initial fact-finding enquiry, the case has absorbed more than 24 days of court time.  It returned to me in circumstances I shall describe on 7 March 2018.  On that occasion it was agreed that there was insufficient time to enable me to deliver a judgment at the conclusion of the case.  This is my reserved judgment in what I hope and intend to be the final occasion on which the court will be called upon to consider the financial repercussions of these highly acrimonious divorce proceedings.</span></p>

Before setting out my conclusions about these matters, I propose to deal briefly with the background to these proceedings.

During the marriage, properties were acquired in Moscow as investment vehicles.  The husband was earning a substantial income and was able to accumulate savings.  By the time they separated in mid-2010, their assets amounted to more than &#163;6 million.  In the context of the marital breakdown, each made serious allegations about the other in terms of litigation misconduct.  As I was subsequently to find after a ten day fact-finding hearing in October 2013, each had behaved reprehensibly in terms of their obligations to one another and the court to make full and frank disclosure of their financial circumstances.  The husband had failed to disclose the existence of an offshore bank account which held US$850,000.  His non-disclosure was aggravated by the fact that he forged bank statements which would otherwise have revealed the extent of his fraud.  For her part, the wife had undertaken a series of property transactions without the husband&#8217;s permission which resulted in a financial loss to this family of c. &#163;1 million.  To add insult to injury, by the time of what was anticipated to be the final hearing in July 2014, their combined costs bill stood at some &#163;1.25 million.</span></p>

Of that sum, &#163;1.76 million was tied up in pension funds which were already being drawn by the husband who had effectively retired from paid employment.  As I found, their combined (unpaid) costs bill then amounted to just under 40% of the remaining liquid resources which were needed to provide homes for each of them, an income stream for the wife and the discharge of a significant raft of debt which she had built up.  As I said then,</span></p>

The near financial ruin which these proceedings have inflicted on this family is compounded by the fact that, even now, each continues to spend significant further sums on various private detection agencies doggedly pursuing the other in terms of their mutual suspicions that each has still to make full and frank disclosure of their finances.  They are sums which this family cannot afford &#8230;..&#8221;.</span></p>

The wife is now being sued by her previous solicitors who have already obtained a partial default judgment against her in respect of unpaid legal costs.  The husband is still living in rented accommodation in Edinburgh with his young family. He accepts that his aspirations in respect of a future housing fund will inevitably be much more modest than he (and the court) had originally envisaged.  Whilst the wife appears to have been dividing her time between England and Russia, she continues to occupy the former family home in Berkshire whilst she is in this jurisdiction.  Although she is not paying rent, there is a mortgage on that property of just under &#163;300,000.  Under the terms of the original order, that liability is for her account.  </span></p>

The wife accepts that she may well leave England when she no longer needs to be here for the children. However, without rehearsing at length the oral evidence which I heard on this subject, I am satisfied that the wife is fully aware of the urgent need for funds to be realised from the sale of this property.  Whatever aspirations she may once have had, the plain fact of the matter is that, without releasing equity from this property, neither the husband nor the wife is going to have the financial means to run their lives, clear debt and provide for their future needs in terms of homes and incomes.&#8221;</span></p>

A mechanism was put in place for marketing Property R on the basis that, after top-slicing costs, tax and an education fund for the children of &#163;100,000, each party would receive 50% of the net proceeds or the equivalent of c.&#163;926,000 less any claw back for additional tax and expenses.  From his share of the sale proceeds, the husband was to pay the wife a capitalised sum of &#163;30,000 to cover his future contribution towards the children&#8217;s expenses.  His contribution was crystallised at that level because of (i) the children&#8217;s ages, and (ii) his dependence on pension as his sole source of income.  In relation to costs, I allowed him to defer a sum of approximately &#163;70,000 which was the final contribution I directed him to make from his share of the Property R proceeds towards a global costs liability of &#163;400,000.</span></p>

The expectation was always that the husband would not be in a position to buy a home for himself and his family until the Property R sale proceeds had been distributed.  His pension then provided him with approximately &#163;42,600 net per annum.  At the time of the final hearing in 2015 he retained cash assets of some &#163;230,000 which fund was to be used to supplement all his living expenses (including his rent) until the Moscow property sale had been completed.  The wife would continue to receive the rent from the two Russian investment properties (a total of c.&#163;92,000 per annum) until the end of the (then) current tenancy when the property would be marketed for sale with vacant possession.  Thereafter she would have the Property A rental monies and her share of the Property R proceeds to invest as she saw fit as an income producing fund.  </span></p>

The notional reattribution is properly anchored to this departure.  I bear in mind, too, that in terms of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Wells </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">sharing, she is receiving predominantly liquid (or at least realisable) assets.  That should provide her with a degree of financial autonomy in terms of her future decision-making which will not necessarily be available to the husband in circumstances where a substantial percentage of his share of the assets will remain tied up in pension.  Furthermore, in terms of overall fairness, I am satisfied that the award which I have made properly reflects the existence of non-matrimonial property acquired by the husband prior to the marriage which represents an unmatched contribution by him.&#8221;</span></p>

Had the wife informed the court in July 2014 that, within a matter of less than a month, she would have removed their child from her local school in Maidenhead and relocated to Russia, he would have sought the sale or transfer of Property FC.  As this was the only property within the jurisdiction of the court, he feared that the wife would have even less incentive to comply with the court&#8217;s order to sell Property R and he would thereby be deprived of the means of enforcing a significant element of the financial award which I had made.  In terms, he would have no means of purchasing a property for himself and his family.  In essence, with Property FC no longer required as a home for the wife and/or any of the three children of the family, the husband sought an amendment to the terms of my order which would enable him to retain the property on the basis that the wife would thereafter be entitled to deduct the agreed equity from any sums he would otherwise be entitled to receive from the sale of Property R.</span></p>

I substituted an interim judgment in the sum of &#163;69,906 which was the element of the costs to which she accepted they were entitled.  A separate three day hearing has been listed for October 2018 before a different judge, Mrs Justice Gwynneth Knowles, when that issue will be resolved.

These include the Property FC mortgage and various loans which she has taken out to reduce her outstanding legal costs.

He describes his financial reserves as &#8220;negligible&#8221;.  In the three years since the July 2014 hearing he has had to sell more or less the entirety of his shares.  He, too, is in debt and has incurred a personal loan from two friends in addition to a &#163;20,000 bank loan.  He continues to rent a small two bedroom studio apartment in Edinburgh for which he is paying &#163;1,300 per month in rent.  His only income is his pension which produces some &#163;35,200 net per annum.  His financial predicament and his frustration with the lack of any discernible progress in relation to the sale of Property R underpin his current application for an order for the sale of Property FC.  From those proceeds, he seeks payment of &#163;1 million (his anticipated entitlement at the time of the original hearing from the Property R sale) in order that he can now purchase a home for himself and his family.</span></p>

Notwithstanding the fall in its value, she, too, seeks her full share of the net sale proceeds in accordance with my mainframe judgment and order.  She contends that the husband should bear the liability for any local sales tax from his share of the proceeds. In addition to various other transactional reimbursements related to the two properties, she sought to enlarge her original financial claims to include a share of the husband&#8217;s pension fund.  This is her case notwithstanding the fact that if her proposals in relation to Property R were to be implemented, the husband would receive nothing at all from the sale.  Her proposals were silent as to how he should rehouse himself and his family in circumstances where she is to retain Property FC.</span></p>

After four years of ongoing litigation, a final consent order was made by Holman J in the Family Division in January 2013.

Under the terms of the original order made by Holman J, the wife was to retain the Monaco and Moscow properties with the husband retaining the French property.  None of these transfers had been effected by the time the matter came back before Moor J two years later.  The judge found that the husband bore a very considerable measure of responsibility for the failure to arrange for the transfer of two of those properties.  However, in relation to the Moscow property, the husband advanced a number of reasons why it had been impossible to make progress.  In fact, as the judge found, the husband had agreed to sell the property to one of his business associates without advertising his intention to the wife or her advisers.  That transaction was combined with a loan of some &#8364;3 million which was paid to the husband.  Because the loan remained unpaid, the lender was able to secure an order in the Russian courts for a transfer of the legal title of the Moscow property into his name.  That transaction had effectively prevented the simultaneous transfer of all three properties as envisaged by the terms of Holman J&#8217;s original order.</span></p>

The facts of that case can be simply stated.  In 2012 a deputy district judge made property adjustment orders by consent in respect of three Welsh properties.  Some seventeen months later in 2013, and by consent, he rearranged certain aspects of his orders but without any alteration to their underlying proprietary or economic effect.  Those substantive orders were not implemented.  Three years later, in 2016, the wife appealed the second &#8220;implementation&#8221; order.  The substantive appeal was heard by a circuit judge in 2017.  The judge found that the substantive orders remained executory.

That new order significantly altered the economic impact of the substantive orders made in 2012 and 2013.  The effect of his order was to reduce by 50% (from 70% to 20%) the husband&#8217;s share in one of the three properties.  In practical terms, that represented a reduction of c.&#163;46,000.  A matter of weeks prior to the making of the new order, the husband was adjudged bankrupt.  The effect of the new order was that there was only a sum of some &#163;3,000 available for the benefit of the husband&#8217;s unsecured creditors.</span></p>

Here, the original order was made not by consent but following a five day fully contested distribution hearing and the delivery of a formal judgment.  The wife&#8217;s application for permission to appeal that order was rejected by the Court of Appeal.  Whilst there has been no formal application constituted under FPR 2010 r. 9.9A by either party, each of the parties - acting as litigants in person - has made a plethora of applications designed to achieve a variation or rescission of the 2015 mainframe order in circumstances where they both accept that the failure to sell the Property R property requires the court to revisit the terms of its original order.  The case management directions which I have made since January 2017 when the Court of Appeal refused the wife&#8217;s application for permission to appeal have been tailored to the provisions of rule 9.9A.  This hearing has been the effective rehearing envisaged by rule 9.9A(5) in terms of the invitation which both parties extend to the court to rehear the financial remedy proceedings or &#8220;otherwise make such other orders as may be appropriate to dispose of the application&#8221;.</span></p>

I explained exactly what I anticipated each party would receive on the basis of the best evidence available at the time.  That took the form of evidence from the various agents instructed locally in relation to the value of the Russian properties.  I factored into my judgment how those receipts would meet needs on both sides of the case and the basis of the departure from an equal division of the assets which I found to be justified on the facts of this case.  No one anticipated that, some four years later, Property R would remain unsold and/or that its sale would produce a sum very significantly below the agreed value of US$3 million to US$3.5 million.  Given the amount which had been spent on legal costs by that point, the equity in Property R was a very substantial element of the underlying matrimonial balance sheet.</span></p>

Given the manifest difficulties which have been encountered in selling the property since 2015, this appears to be the only sensible way to deal with matters.  Mr Sear realistically concedes that the evidence will not support a finding that the wife deliberately frustrated a sale by standing in the way of attempts to market the property.  She has breached her undertaking not to let the property following the termination of the last formal tenancy granted to Mr K.  The wife&#8217;s evidence (disputed entirely by the husband) was that the current occupants did not have the benefit of a formal lease, although they have nevertheless paid in advance some form of &#8216;licence fee&#8217;.  Those funds have been paid by the wife to her former solicitors in order to reduce her liability for outstanding legal costs.

I remind myself that her rationale for moving back to Russia shortly after the final hearing in 2015 was to establish residence in Moscow in order to mitigate what she regards as &#8220;the family&#8217;s tax liability&#8221;.  I have no up to date evidence as to what this particular liability will be and I suspect the position will not crystallise until the property has been sold.  On the husband&#8217;s case, Property A has a net value of &#163;450,000.  Applying a 30% tax deduction, and on the wife&#8217;s case, this would produce a net equity after both taxes of just under &#163;306,500.</span></p>

She accepts that the transfer was a unilateral decision on her part and that the husband was not consulted or informed prior to the transfer.  I know not why that step was taken in the midst of these proceedings and I do not propose to make any findings in relation to the wife&#8217;s motives.  However, it was an inappropriate step and, even without the wife&#8217;s concession, I propose to treat Property A as an asset which remains available to her.  Under the terms of the original mainframe order, it was agreed that the wife would retain the property as an investment vehicle which she would utilise to generate funds towards her future income needs.   She proposes that 50% of its net value (which she calculates to be &#163;150,000) should be assumed to be the husband&#8217;s entitlement but should be set off against the sums which she alleges he owes to her in respect of expenses she has incurred on the children and the Property FC mortgage since 2015.  She proposes to sell Property A in 2019 once D has graduated and to apply the net proceeds (or whatever sum is then required) towards discharging the raft of debt she has incurred over the course of the last three years.</span></p>

Whether she retains it and lets the property or continues in an attempt to sell and invest the proceeds elsewhere will be a matter for her.  For the purposes of testing what is fair and equitable to both parties in terms of an outcome, I have to factor in a value for Property R.  I accept that, absent a sale or any recent offers, any value attributed to the property has an element of speculation.  There is no formal updated expert evidence before the court.  In the light of what I know about the attempts over the last three years to market the property, I suspect that even evidence from one or more of the international estate agents who have previously expressed an opinion as to value would be of doubtful weight in terms of a reliable prediction as to value.  The thrust of the advice which has been given to both parties since 2015 by the Moscow agents is that they must simply offer the property for sale and see what offers are received.</span></p>

Deducting costs of sale at 4% (US$72,000) and local sales tax at 30% (US$540,000) leaves a net equity of US$1.188 million, or c.&#163;900,000.</span></p>

The husband&#8217;s entitlement would be some &#163;220,000 less in round terms, i.e. &#163;427,200.  That would be the only cash available to him for his housing needs although it would come clear of any of the deductions for which I provided in my mainframe order of 2015 since these would be set off against his notional share of the Property A equity.  In addition to her share of &#163;640,800, and subject to any (then) outstanding liabilities, the wife would retain at least &#163;300,000 from a sale of that property.  Thus, she would have assets of approximately &#163;940,000 plus a further &#163;900,000 in Property R.  I do not have an up to date capital value for the husband&#8217;s pension fund which was worth &#163;1.76 million in 2014.  Its value has already been diluted by his earlier election to carve out a dependant&#8217;s pension for his (much younger) wife after his death.  In my judgment that was not a choice which should attract any criticism:  it was plainly a sensible course given the age of his wife and their dependent child.  However, even if for illustrative purposes one offsets his pension against the Property R funds, on the basis of each of the parties&#8217; proposals there is still a significant imbalance in the cash funds which will be available to each to meet future housing needs.  The wife has liabilities.  I bear in mind she also has the land at K which was valued at &#163;14,000 in 2015. She maintains this is now worth very little and secures a debt which is owed to her family.  I am conscious that she has a residual liability for her legal costs over and above the contribution of some &#163;70,000 odd which the husband has still to make and I propose to return to this aspect of her needs shortly.</span></p>

I do not expect the husband to have to spend any less if he remains in the Edinburgh area.  He told me that the value of the small studio apartment which he currently rents is c. &#163;400,000.  That property is clearly unsuitable as a long term proposition.  I reject the wife&#8217;s suggestion that his wife&#8217;s mortgage capacity should be taken into account for the purposes of assessing the husband&#8217;s future housing needs.  Apart from the fact that she works part-time, she does not presently have indefinite leave to remain in this country although she does have a resident&#8217;s visa.  I doubt that she would secure a mortgage but, even if she did, it is unlikely to be in a sum which would make very much difference to the housing budget which I have found is reasonable in this case.</span></p>

There is evidence from Knight Frank in Moscow that, as at July 2016, the property could be let for US$12,000 per month.  Even if that figure is discounted, Mr Sear contends that the property should be generating at least US$4,000 per month.  To the extent that Property R is not available for commercial letting until the end of this year, that is the result of the wife&#8217;s decision to accept an &#8216;up front&#8217; occupation or licence fee from the present occupants to reduce the burden of her ongoing costs liability.

The husband has had to continue to pay rent and additional legal costs.  The wife has not had the benefit of his contribution of &#163;80,000 towards the children&#8217;s education and maintenance costs.  The Property FC mortgage was always for her account on the basis that she was retaining the property.  Whilst I attempted to address the issue of the mortgage payments during her absence in Moscow by allowing the husband to let the property, this did not happen.  The husband maintains that he could not secure vacant possession as their elder daughter was living at the property.  The wife contends he failed to make alternative arrangements for her accommodation.  It seems to me that is now water under the bridge.

She confirmed that she used the remaining funds dispersed from the children&#8217;s paternal grandmother&#8217;s trust to pay the mortgage in 2015.  These she appears to have apportioned as debts which she must repay the children.  Together these account for over &#163;30,000 of her stated liabilities.  She has borrowed &#163;25,000 from her sister for legal fees.  She also includes as a liability the &#163;40,000 licence fee which she paid to the solicitors acting for her former matrimonial solicitors in the debt recovery proceedings.  I confess that I do not understand how this sum can be considered an extant liability.  In relation to the so-called &#8216;family&#8217; debts (some &#163;55,000), it will be a matter for the wife to arrange her financial affairs so as to discharge her indebtedness, both &#8220;soft&#8221; and &#8220;hard&#8221;.  For example, in terms of funds which she says she must return to the children, it may well be that &#8211; with their ongoing education costs being met in part as a result of the capital contribution which the husband will be making &#8211; she can defer that obligation with the children&#8217;s consent.  Her sister may also be prepared to wait for repayment.

At the time of my original judgment in 2014 we were all operating on the assumption that Property R would be sold; no one expected a delay of more than four years.  Accordingly, I propose to make a contingent lump sum order in the wife&#8217;s favour.  In the event that she is adjudged liable to pay interest to her former solicitors, the husband will pay to her from his share of the matrimonial assets a lump sum equal to 50% of that interest element.  I know not what might happen in relation to costs in the debt recovery proceedings.  The wife is a litigant in person but, as I have said, her former solicitors will have incurred costs in pursuing their claim.  It may be that they will seek costs in the event that their claim succeeds.  Whatever the outcome of that litigation, I propose to limit the husband&#8217;s exposure to 50% of the interest element if it is found to be due and payable.  He has not been involved in those proceedings.  I have already extracted from his share of the assets a costs penalty which properly reflects the extent of his litigation misconduct in concealing assets from the court.  To go further and to require him to contribute towards the costs of parallel litigation in which he has had no involvement or representation would be a step too far in my judgment.</span></p>

She is the person who is best placed to determine whether, and when, to sell the property.  I am satisfied that there is sufficient equity in the property to meet her future income needs whether she retains it as a commercial rental investment or in the event that she decides  to sell and reinvest elsewhere. Whilst I appreciate the husband&#8217;s concerns about extracting cash from Property A, it seems to me that in circumstances where both parties are intending to purchase new homes in this jurisdiction, it would not be fair to the wife to restrict her entitlement to the Property FC proceeds to &#163;160,200 which is the basis of the husband&#8217;s present proposal.  I accept that this sum would not be sufficient to enable her to begin her search for an alternative property.  Pending the sale of Property A, she will be in a position where she has to rent a property and I suspect, given past history, that she would deplete these funds to the extent that receipt of the balance of her award in due course would still leave her with a shortfall.  Whilst renting might be acceptable on a short-term basis, as she herself accepts, the husband&#8217;s proposal will leave her with virtually all the risk in liquidating Property A as a cash fund.  I am also concerned that the husband&#8217;s proposals leave her with a cash fund of c.&#163;520,000 as a housing fund whilst he retains liquid assets of c. &#163;850,000.  I am aware that the wife will also have the benefit of any value in Property R but, as I have already explained, that property is earmarked for future income generation and she has now (sensibly, in my view) abandoned any claim to a share in the husband&#8217;s pension funds.</span></p>

Needs were the driving factor in my original decision and, as one of the section 25 factors, they remain pivotal to the outcome of this hearing.  Despite the apparent convenience of leaving the two Russian properties in the wife&#8217;s hands, there is insufficient equity in the English property to enable both parties&#8217; housing needs to be met from that source.  An equal division of the Property FC equity will not enable either to purchase suitable accommodation and the unequal distribution which the wife seeks would produce a result which is unfair to the husband given the value she would be retaining in Property A.  I can see no alternative but to sell Property A.  That property must be sold as swiftly as possible.  The wife will need to realise the equity in that property to rehouse in England.  In order to incentivise her to make progress with the sale, I propose to allow the husband to make his contribution of &#163;80,000 towards the children from his share of the proceeds.  His costs liability must come from the sale of the English property.  I am also going to weight the division of the English sale proceeds in his favour.  In circumstances where the balance of the wife&#8217;s capital will be coming from the sale of the Russian property, she will be best placed to conduct the sale and ensure it is transacted as swiftly as possible.  I know not whether the transfer of the property into D&#8217;s name will delay matters but, if it does, this is a situation which is wholly of the wife&#8217;s making.</span></p>

Whilst that represents a smaller uplift in his favour than my original judgment provided, it is as close to it as I can get in the context of this case whilst still meeting needs.  The only further adjustment to these figures will be the payment by the husband to the wife of the contingent lump sum award in respect of the outstanding third party claim for interest.  Should that claim succeed, he will be liable for 50% of any interest element which is due and payable.  I am conscious that any such liability will impact upon the potential housing funds of both parties.  In circumstances where it is not possible on the evidence to attribute blame for the delay in selling Property R squarely at the feet of the wife, I regard it as the only fair way of sharing this liability.</span></p>

In the event that Property A sells for more than my assumed mid-point valuation, the wife will retain any uplift.  That factor will, I hope, operate as an additional incentive in her efforts to market the property.  I appreciate that she will be receiving less than the husband to buy a house but I bear in mind that she will be retaining another property worth nearly &#163;1 million.  Whilst that property has been earmarked for income generation in the future, she could, if she chose, sell Property R and divert part of the proceeds into a more expensive home in England.  There would then be scope later on in life for her to release equity from her English home for the purposes of supplementing her retirement income.  These are all decisions for her.  The husband will continue to receive his pension but that fund gives him no flexibility in terms of any further release of capital.

The lack of interest from purchasers to date at the agreed valuation of &#163;1.4 million may well be the result of the general uncertainty in the property market (the national </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Brexit </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">effect) and/or the prospect of some local development in the vicinity of a golf course.  The husband is concerned that any reduction in the price achieved will impact upon the sum which he receives to meet his future housing needs.  For the purposes of my judgment, it was agreed that I should work on the basis of a gross sale price of &#163;1.4 million (see paragraph 60).  That was the figure which Savills, the marketing agents, had recommended as representing the value of the property at the time.  Because the husband&#8217;s open proposal was based upon a deferred sale in March 2019, the actual value to be realised was always speculative.  As is often the case in financial remedy cases, the court has to proceed on the basis of the best evidence available at the time.  It was for this reason that I framed my judgment (and will frame my final order) on the basis of a percentage division of the Property FC proceeds.  Insofar as there remains a shortfall below the assumed value of the property when a sale is completed, that shortfall will necessarily be borne between the parties on a pro rata basis.  I have assessed their future housing needs to be broadly equal.  Budgets for rehousing may have to be trimmed significantly on both sides, even on a needs basis.  In this context there is no scope for further adjustment so as to enhance the husband&#8217;s share of the net proceeds because to do so would necessarily reduce the funds available to the wife.  In this context I can only ask the parties to look to the roles which each has played in the haemorrhage of costs which, over more than five years of increasingly acrimonious litigation, has transformed their financial position from one of relative prosperity to one where each may struggle financially to meet basic needs.</span></p>
