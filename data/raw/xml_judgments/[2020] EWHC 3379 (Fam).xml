On 27 July 2020 the mother wrote to the father&#8217;s solicitors to seek changes to the parenting plan, in essence a new agreement. </p>

The mediation was again held on the terms set out in the standard FMA agreement. On this occasion, unfortunately, the parties were not able to reach any agreement, but they continued to negotiate directly with each other outside the mediation process. The father alleges that a new agreement was reached on 3 September 2020. Negotiations continued on the wording of a proposed Child Arrangements Order but the terms of that order could not be agreed. The father then issued a C100 application in the Family Court at Reading on 2 October 2020. As I have said, the mother initiated these summary return proceedings on 19 October 2020. </p>

These discussions cannot be referred to in these proceedings both as a matter of law and under the agreement of the parties as set out in the mediation agreement. The only material arising from the mediation that the father is entitled to refer to is the agreed parenting plan signed on 18 February 2019, which forms the concluded agreement between the parties. To the extent that the father seeks to rely on matters discussed within mediation, but which did not form part of the agreement, he should be prohibited from doing so. She seeks a direction that the offending documents be refiled with specific identified references to the mediation discussions removed. </p>

As such, it would not be in the interests of justice or in the interests of the particular child to prevent him from doing so. Excluding this material would, she says, deny the father a fair trial. It might also lead to a risk of harm to E&#8217;s wellbeing and her ongoing relationship with her father should the consequence be that she is returned to the USA, when otherwise she would have remained in England.  </p>
