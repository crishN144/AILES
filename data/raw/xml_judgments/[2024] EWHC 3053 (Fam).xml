	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By an application dated 26 May 2023 pursuant to Part 18 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (&#8220;the FPR&#8221;), the General Dental Council (&#8220;the GDC&#8221;) made an application for an order pursuant to FPR 12.73, for permission from the Family Court to the disclosure of documents in public law proceedings concerning the children of the third respondent, KK, who is a dental technician. The GDC sought to use this material in proceedings before its Professional Conduct Committee in Fitness to Practise proceedings. The precise remit of the application for disclosure sought by the GDC has been refined following case management directions and the creation of further schedules of documents. However, KK faces serious allegations about his Fitness to Practise arising from the court&#8217;s findings about his domestically abusive conduct towards his then partner and the mother of the children in the public law proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In summary, the reason this application has been made in the High Court is because, following a request made on 23 July 2019 by the GDC to the local authority for the disclosure of information relating to the care proceedings, the local authority &#8211; Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council &#8211; provided a significant volume of documents from and connected with the care proceedings to the GDC in the absence of any order from the family court authorising such disclosure. Additionally, witness statements were also provided at the request of the GDC by two social work professionals and the solicitor advocate who represented the local authority at the final hearing in the care proceedings. It is obvious that this extensive disclosure was made in contravention of s.12 of the Administration of Justice Act 1960. Accordingly, this court was required to resolve (a) the properly constituted application subsequently brought by the GDC for disclosure of documents from and connected to the care proceedings and (b) any prospective contempt proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With the consent of the GDC, the local authority and KK, this judgment has been much delayed to await the completion of a process by which improperly obtained documents whose disclosure was not sanctioned by this court but which were held by the GDC were destroyed and/or returned to the local authority. This process took some considerable time because material had been distributed to third parties involved in the fitness to practise proceedings and the identification of just what had been distributed and what was in the GDC&#8217;s possession was a complex task, not without its own difficulties. I am satisfied that this process is now complete and that this judgment can now be published.</p>

They were unrepresented, having provided their consent to the disclosure sought at the start of these proceedings (the children&#8217;s solicitor communicating consent on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian).  KK who was a party to the care proceedings was represented by Mr Simon Crabtree; the GDC was represented by Mr Joseph O&#8217;Brien KC; and the local authority was represented by Mr Michael Jones KC. I am grateful to all the advocates for their written and oral submissions and for the collaborative approach taken by each of them to assist the court in resolving the issues.</p>

Subsequently, I received updates about what I will call the rectification process and communicated with the parties in order to establish that this process was complete. Despite the rectification process being less than straightforward, no further hearing was necessary. </p>

Where information is received by the GDC which supports a fitness to practise allegation, s. 27(5) of the 1984 Act provides that the Registrar shall refer the allegation to the Investigating Committee and, if the Registrar considers an interim order may be required on one or more statutory grounds, may also refer the allegation to the IOC at any time up to the point at which the Investigating Committee convenes. The 1984 Act provides for the investigation of allegations and, further, it delegates to officers of the GDC the power to exercise features of the Investigating Committee. These officers are called Case Examiners whose function is defined in secondary legislation. Interim orders, which apply to dental care professionals, are made in accordance with s. 36V of the 1984 Act.</p>

The failure to comply with such a request within 14 days may result in the GDC applying for an order in the County Court requiring the information to be supplied and for all the documents to be produced.

Following receipt of this initial information, the GDC investigation revealed a number of allegations and escalating physical assaults and abuse by KK against Witness A over an extended period between October 2016 and September 2018. The GDC initially approached Greater Manchester Police (&#8220;GMP&#8221;) for information about the criminal investigation. On disclosure of relevant information which it held about KK, GMP alerted the GDC to the involvement of the local authority with KK. On contacting the local authority, the GDC was signposted to the information governance department and subsequently the GDC caseworker made a request for information to the local authority using a template letter. On 26 July 2019, the local authority provided 22 documents, including some from the public law proceedings.</p>

On 21 November 2019, the Case Examiners considered the allegations and made a referral to the PCC and IOC. The Presentation Lawyer with conduct of the post-referral investigation contacted the data protection office at the local authority on 10 December 2019, requesting permission to disclose the documents given to the GDC by the local authority for the purposes of proceedings before the IOC. Approval was given by the data protection office on 11 December 2019.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 8 January 2020 and after an adjournment requested by KK, the IOC considered the information referred by the Case Examiners and decided not to impose an interim order. During the hearing, KK relied on an extract of information from the care proceedings that had not been obtained or disclosed by the GDC. Following this hearing, the Presentation Lawyer instructed a paralegal to contact social workers and other witnesses identified from the information provided by the local authority. This was with a view to obtaining witness statements relevant to the investigation. Two social workers were identified and permission was granted by the local authority for them to provide statements. The Presentation Lawyer wrote to one of the social workers on 5 February 2020 and the letter contained a request for further information which was copied to the data protection office on 6 March 2020. Further information was provided by the data protection officer on 13 March 2020. Statements were obtained from the two social workers and yet further disclosure was provided by the local authority on 1 May 2020. During the process of obtaining statements, one of the social workers disclosed (a) the threshold document which set out the basis upon which the court had determined the children had experienced significant harm and (b) the supervision order granted by the family Court in April 2019.</p>

On 2 November 2020, the IOC determined that an order of suspension in respect of KK for a period of 12 months was necessary to protect the public and otherwise was in the public interest. On 26 January 2021, the GDC investigation concluded with disclosure of the charges against KK and the supporting material. Allegations of assault relating to the children were dropped, thereby confining the allegations to KK&#8217;s behaviour towards Witness A. </p>

This included requests for further disclosure of documents from the local authority. Because of the issues raised on behalf of KK, the Presentation Lawyer made enquiries of one of the social work witnesses and then contacted a lawyer who had represented the local authority during the care proceedings. These contacts resulted in the disclosure of the threshold document and the adjournment of the substantive hearing before the PCC. KK&#8217;s representative objected to the threshold statement being before the PCC but that objection was later withdrawn and the redacted threshold statement remains before the PCC. </p>

In discussions during breaks in the evidence and following the conclusion of Witness A&#8217;s evidence, counsel for KK advised the GDC representatives that there was information in ongoing family proceedings suggesting that Witness A was no longer abstinent from alcohol and that he intended to adduce this. This would have necessitated the recall of Witness A. During discussion, KK&#8217;s legal representative stated that the information related to Witness A&#8217;s compliance with testing and attendance at supervision appointments. Those discussions prompted for the very first time consideration as to whether permission had been obtained by the GDC to rely on materials from the family court proceedings. In consequence, the GDC applied to adjourn the proceedings part heard on 10 May 2023.</p>

This power is contained in rule 12.73 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 [&#8220;the FPR&#8221;] which also sets out certain limited circumstances under which communication of information relating to proceedings that have been held in private is automatically permitted.

Additionally McFarlane P noted that applications for disclosure should only be granted if the criteria in Re C were satisfied and it was necessary and proportionate to do so (paragraph 82). In 2022, the Court of Appeal in P (Disclosure) once more endorsed the Re C approach and noted that (a) the circumstances in which disclosure decisions were made will be variable and will require the court to make an evaluative judgement and (b) Re C did not create a presumption in favour of disclosure (paragraph 18).

He noted that the cloak of confidentiality surrounding care proceedings had been &#8220;significantly lifted&#8221; by the successive relaxation of the rules concerning disclosure in the FPR and that there were moves towards much greater transparency in care proceedings for the reasons explained in Re P (A Child) [2013] EWHC 4048 (Fam). Since Baker J&#8217;s observations, the move towards greater transparency in the family court has accelerated, not just with respect to care proceedings but with respect to family proceedings generally. In that regard, I note that, at the time of writing this judgment, a pilot is taking place in three family courts (Cardiff, Leeds and Carlisle) to provide greater transparency in all proceedings relating to children. The aim of the pilot is to introduce a presumption that accredited media and legal bloggers may report on what they see and hear during family court cases, subject to strict rules of anonymity. Those observations provide context but play no part in this court&#8217;s decision on disclosure which must have regard to authoritative case law.</span></p>

It is plainly and strongly indeed in the public interest that he carries out that responsibility and that an unsuitable person does not continue employment as a probation officer.

The experts involved in the case had advised the court that the mother posed a risk to any child in the mother&#8217;s care.

Re D and M (Disclosure: Private Law) [2002] EWHC 2820 (Fam) concerned private law proceedings for contact, during which the father admitted having a consensual sexual relationship with his half-sister. Applying Re C, Hedley J refused to allow disclosure to the police but permitted disclosure to the relevant local authority on condition that there would be no further disclosure without the court&#8217;s permission. In his judgment, Hedley J drew attention to the fact that parents who gave evidence in private law proceedings did not have the protection of s. 98 of the Children Act 1989. The effect of s. 98(1) is to require a witness to answer all questions irrespective of whether he might thereby incriminate himself but s. 98(2) provides that any such answer may not be used in criminal proceedings. However, s. 98 only applies to public law proceedings and does not apply to private law proceedings under Part II of the Children Act 1989.</span></p>

Equally, those would be matters for the court to have considered if the court were considering whether to initiate contempt proceedings. An allegation of contempt of court is serious and should not be raised lightly. But where (i) contempt proceedings have been initiated by a party, (ii) there is no requirement to obtain permission, and (iii) it is not contended the application is vexatious or abusive, the court should proceed to determine the application. Matters such as late compliance, apology or explanation for default (where applicable), fall to be considered in the context of penalty, if the public bodies found to have committed contempt of court.&#8221;</span> [53]</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Regrettably, this process proved rather more complex than envisaged. On 1 July 2024, the GDC applied for an extension of time to comply with the order. The process of establishing where unauthorised items of disclosure werelocated, was much more problematic than had been realised in April 2024. The proceedings before the GDC had encompassed 11 interim order hearings; 4 extensions of the interim order in the High Court; 3 substantive hearings before the Professional Conduct Committee and 6 preliminary hearings before the Practice Committees. Consequently the unauthorised disclosure was repeated in whole or in part in various orders and guises throughout the GDC&#8217;s data storage. Additionally, a significant number of staff and external associates, such as Counsel, had been involved with the proceedings. At the time the application for an extension was made, about 85% of the 5,629 files in the main storage area still needed to be reviewed with other areas requiring substantial work and at least 149 individuals needed to be contacted to ascertain whether they held unauthorised disclosure arising from their work on behalf of the GDC. The witness statement from the GDC filed in support of the extension of time stated that it hoped to have completed all its investigations and the deletion of all unauthorised material no later than 13 September 2024. Neither the local authority nor KK objected to the extension which I granted.</p>

However, in the process of checking this statement, it was discovered by the GDC in-house lawyer that one contractor &#8211; a barrister &#8211; had not been formally contacted as part of the deletion exercise. This omission was notified to the court at the same time that the Chief Executive&#8217;s statement was filed.

For all three, the care proceedings concluded over 5 years ago and there is no evidence that disclosure of relevant information to the GDC will in any way adversely impact on their welfare to any serious degree. Their interests, especially given the confidential nature of those proceedings, have also been protected by a careful process of agreement as to relevance and to redaction to preserve confidentiality of names which has been carried out by the local authority and KK under the supervision of this court. I note that I have not been asked to adjudicate upon any matter arising from that process. Furthermore, the proceedings before the GDC have been held in private with no reporting of them at all and with disclosure of documents restricted to the Panel, the lawyers (including independent legal advisors), necessary support workers at the GDC and those representing KK. </p>

The first document in dispute was the threshold document which set out the facts establishing that the children had either suffered or were likely to suffer significant harm whilst in the care of their mother and KK. This document was approved by the family court and adopted as part of the court&#8217;s decision making, as set out in the final order concluding the care proceedings dated 11 April 2019. It is noteworthy that this document contained a number of concessions made by KK about his behaviour. In oral submissions, Mr Crabtree accepted that KK had conceded that the Children Act 1989 section 31(2) threshold had been met but he did not recognise the document which was in the possession of the local authority. Both KK and the children&#8217;s mother disputed its contents. It was common ground between all the advocates that, very surprisingly, the local authority had not been able to locate the original threshold document approved by the court in 2019 despite a concerted effort to do so and so there was a degree of uncertainty about the provenance of the threshold document in its possession. Having thought about this carefully, I decided that the threshold document in the local authority&#8217;s possession should be disclosed but should be clearly marked to the effect (a) that both KK and the children&#8217;s mother disputed its contents and (b) that the local authority had been unable to establish that this was the document which the court approved. The threshold document is clearly highly relevant to the allegations faced by KK before the GDC and merits disclosure on that basis, being a document approved by the family court. However, given the caveats about its provenance, the weight which can be attributed to that document will ultimately be a matter for the PCC to determine.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second document in dispute was a statement obtained by the GDC from the local authority&#8217;s in-house lawyer, detailing amongst other matters the discussion between the advocates at the final hearing in the care proceedings. Thus, the statement contained information relating to the care proceedings but was not prepared for use within those proceedings and thus falls into a slightly anomalous category of document not covered by the FPR. The statement was prepared at the request of the GDC without the local authority giving proper scrutiny or thought to the appropriateness of such a statement from its own in-house lawyer. In my view, this statement falls firmly within s.12 of the AJA and, in my view, should never have been made. I decided to refuse disclosure of it to the GDC.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the same category, was another statement from a local authority employee, a senior social worker, which contained information about the family prior to the commencement of the care proceedings as well as material which postdated the instigation of those proceedings. For the same reasons as indicated above, I refused disclosure of those parts of the statement post-dating the instigation of care proceedings. I also directed that the exhibits to the first part of that statement should only be disclosed if they were included in the local authority documents authorised for disclosure by the family court in the care proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The unauthorised disclosure which occurred in this case should never have happened. Mr Crabtree submitted how very seriously aggrieved KK was at having to defend himself and his livelihood without the financial resources to do so in proceedings before the GDC which were tainted by the improper acquisition of highly sensitive documents from the local authority. KK drew a distinction between the local authority and the GDC, firmly believing that it was the GDC which led the local authority into error. He thought that GDC employees and those of the local authority who should have known better should be named and shamed in my judgment. He urged me to make a costs order against both public bodies.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For its part, the local authority recognised the seriousness of its misconduct and recognised that it would be identified in my judgment. It had made an unreserved apology to KK and would be responsible for payment of part of his costs in these proceedings. However, Mr Jones KC pointed to the strenuous efforts which the local authority had made to ensure that unauthorised disclosure of material from care proceedings would not occur in future. It had set up training for staff in the authority and produced a protocol which addressed how requests for information relating to care proceedings were to be managed in future. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Likewise, the GDC accepted the seriousness of what had taken place and had offered a fulsome apology to KK. It offered to bear its fair share of KK&#8217;s costs in these proceedings and it too had engaged in an extensive programme of education and training for its staff to prevent a similar occurrence in future. The GDC accepted that it would be named in my judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given all the above, both public bodies submitted that naming individuals in their respective organisations who were at fault and who should have known better was neither necessary nor proportionate. To embark on such a process would necessitate those individuals having to obtain their own legal advice (though probably supported and funded by their employer); and to make submissions to the court on an informed basis. This would cause considerable delay and significant cost to, ultimately, the public purse. Both the GDC and the local authority emphasised that what had occurred was due to ignorance rather than any deliberate or malicious intent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have thought carefully about whether I should instigate contempt proceedings against both the GDC and the local authority. Applying the factors set out by Steyn J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">JS v Cardiff City Council</span> (see above), I have concluded that contempt proceedings are not warranted in the circumstances. First, compliance with the requirements of the relevant rules contained in the FPR has now been achieved and the court has ruled on the principle of disclosure generally and on disclosure with respect to certain documents. Furthermore, an extensive process of rectification has been undertaken by the GDC to identify and destroy all unauthorised disclosure in its possession. That process has consumed significant time and resources within the GDC which is a salutary reminder of the consequences for a public body of failing to comply with the court&#8217;s rules and processes. I am however satisfied that the GDC has completed the rectification process and that it now only holds disclosure authorised by the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, both public bodies have offered an unreserved apology to KK and to the court and both have put in place measures to ensure such unauthorised disclosure does not occur in future. Both will also be liable for KK&#8217;s costs in these proceedings, each paying half of the total sum. I have considered carefully the explanations offered by each for their conduct and accept this arose from lamentable ignorance in both public bodies about (a) the confidential nature of family court proceedings and consequently (b) the need to obtain the court&#8217;s permission for any disclosure of family court documents. For its part, the local authority misunderstood the obligation on it to assist the GDC by supplying it with information and documents in circumstances where it was perfectly plain that the GDC&#8217;s powers to require documents were subservient to statute and to the provisions of the FPR. The GDC also failed to understand the limits on its powers when legal proceedings had taken place which bore directly on matters of professional concern to it. Neither public body acted maliciously. Contempt proceedings would take up precious court time and resource as well as the resources of two publicly funded bodies and would, in my view, be disproportionate. </p>

It is plain that there was a woeful ignorance about the confidential nature of documents produced for the purpose of care proceedings and about how requests for disclosure should be managed. The costs incurred by the GDC and the local authority have been significant and both have been shamed by what occurred. I hope what took place in this case will not happen again.</p>
