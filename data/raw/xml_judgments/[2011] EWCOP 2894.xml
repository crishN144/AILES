HN put the point to FL&#8217;s GP in September 2009 Dr JT who was content with the medication, see Dr JT&#8217;s letter of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September 2009. HN&#8217;S reaction appears to have been to pursue Dr JT. HN was also unhappy that Dr JT did not agree with a further assessment of FL in London. I was provided with the opinion of FL&#8217;s current GP dated 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2011 and the report of Dr C, Consultant Psychiatrist dated 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2011 both of whom are content with FL&#8217;s current treatment regime.</p>

HN&#8217;s solicitors threatened injunction proceedings to prevent FL from being discharged from the hospital back to the Z Home before a best interests meeting took place; see their letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2008. HN sought to impress me that her solicitors wrote this letter without her instructions but there was no later attempt to retract the threat or to apologise for it.
