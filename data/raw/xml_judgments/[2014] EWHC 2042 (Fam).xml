It is salutary to record that CF was merely 3 years 9 months old when court proceedings were first issued in respect of his future; he is now over 6 years old.   At a final hearing in relation to the boys over a year ago, the Children&#8217;s Guardian stressed that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the boys needed a decision to be made urgently&#8230;</span>&#8221; (see the judgment of Ms Recorder Ray [&#8216;Ray&#8217;]).  Ms Recorder Ray acknowledged at the conclusion of that hearing that the children &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">need final decisions as soon as possible &#8230; their opportunities for successful placement together will diminish quickly over time.</span>&#8221;</p>

MGF had previously been negatively assessed as a potential Special Guardianship carer for the children; serious concerns had been raised about his failure to protect his daughter (the mother) from harm as she grew up in his care.  I pause here to reflect that the mother&#8217;s decision to take EF to X to be cared for by her father whilst she returned to England to fulfil the second (unlawful) part of her plan was fraught with risk and uncertainty.

Such a personality style features behaviours that may be erratic and/or unpredictable.  This is due to the need to seek sensation and avoid boredom.  Individuals with such personality profiles may demonstrate difficulties placing others needs, including those of children before their own and have a reduced ability to experience empathy for others in part due to an over-inflated self-worth.  Due to an increased and unusual need for attention or self-recognition, combined with personal insecurity, they may demonstrate emotional and attachment instability that impacts negatively upon relationships with associates, partners and family members.  They may seek to manipulate others to achieve their own wishes by engaging in behaviours that are generally considered to be socially unacceptable</span>.</p>

She states that she often gets angry with people who do things slowly and she thinks that it is necessary to place strict controls on the behaviour of members of her family.  Evidence of mother&#8217;s impulsive personality traits is illustrated through her numerous lifestyle choices, including illicit substance abuse, glamour modelling and &#8220;escorting&#8221;.  She reported a reluctance to relinquish this lifestyle and also chose to place her own needs above those of her children through continuing to use substances.  Further she discussed that she &#8220;took advantage&#8221; of her ex-partner &#8230; and described becoming &#8220;bored&#8221; within the relationship.  Such examples have evidenced her need to engage in sensation seeking behaviour and a wish to avoid boredom, and further, demonstrate a willingness to engage in behaviours that are generally considered to be socially unacceptable</span>.&#8221;</p>

There were three other girls in my room, and I was not taking things, and I told the staff and that was why I was moved</span>&#8221;), and that this could account for traces being found. This possible explanation was not mentioned in the instructions to Lextox nor was it mentioned to Dr. McKinnon (or indeed otherwise in the evidence leading up to this hearing); it was suggested for the first time by the mother from the witness box.  Had it been a serious argument, I am sure that it would have been referred to sooner, and for this reason, I reject this challenge to the positive test result.</p>

Lextox (the sampling agency) has provided a comprehensive answer to these challenges, compellingly confirming strict adherence to rigorous standards at all times, which I accept.  Moreover, the mother did not question any aspect of the collection process at the time.  For these reasons I reject this further challenge to the positive test results.</p>

The father was, frankly, vague about it, volunteering only when pressed that it &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">probably</span>&#8221; occurred on the train.  On an issue of life-changing importance, it is incredible that the father would be unclear about the context or circumstances of the conversation which had (on his account) happened only a matter of minutes, or at most 2 hours, earlier; alternatively, it is astonishing that he would have communicated such information on a commuter train on the way to court, displaying remarkable insensitivity to the mother.   If it did take place as described, I would have expected the mother (who was easily upset at various points during the hearing) to have shown some emotion during the father&#8217;s evidence; she showed none.  If there was a conversation at all, I suspect (but do not find) that it was of a different order; it seems to me more likely that the father and the mother jointly agreed the father&#8217;s position as a tactical manoeuvre &#8211; a last throw of the dice. </p>

Moreover, a <span style="font-style:italic">perceived</span> risk and/or <span style="font-style:italic">fear</span> of abduction is (or may) be just as potent an affliction on any placement than abduction itself; it is to be noted that even within these proceedings, comments made by the children in the foster home suggested that a further abduction was being planned &#8211; significantly raising anxiety levels among the carers and professionals.  It would be contrary to the interests of the children to impose this level of anxiety on the foster carer.

The children experienced considerable disruption; the boys were removed from the care of their foster home (where they had been for 15 months), without preparation or warning, to the other side of the world, only for them to be returned some months later after the parents had reflected on the error of their decision.  It was a futile act, condemning the children (as the mother herself acknowledged) to the status of &#8216;exiles&#8217; &#8211; an outcome which the mother, with even a modest time to reflect, realised was wholly contrary to their interests.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have reflected carefully on the prospects of long-term foster placements for the children weighing carefully the powerful considerations which I have outlined and discussed above.  I have concluded that the detriments of such a placement greatly outweigh the potential benefits.  There are plainly advantages in the children remaining where they are, but overall I do not regard this as an outcome which would necessarily be in the children&#8217;s interests. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In reaching this conclusion, I have attached considerable weight to the <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8</span> rights of the family members, but consider that interference with those rights is not just justified, it is necessary, to achieve outcomes in the children&#8217;s best interests. The care plans of the authorities for the children should be endorsed, with one revision &#8211; namely to give greater prominence to parallel planning to find a family for a sibling group of three.  I am satisfied that the benefits of adoption do outweigh the benefits of long-term foster care, but not conclusively so.  As the searches are undertaken so it may be that individual factors identified as of relevance to the decision will assume different importance. I wish to emphasise that the children should, if at all possible, remain together; this is plainly in their interests.  The children have a close sibling relationship; they have endured much instability in their short lives, and some of that instability has experienced by them together.  They have experienced already a number of material and life-changing losses; they will, I am sure, experience another significant loss through the reduction and probable elimination of contact with their natural parents.  </p>
