	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Neither party behaved flexibly in their open negotiations. H did not move from a position which sought to implement the terms of the unsigned Post Marital Agreement. W consistently sought &#163;10m or more and, far from moderating her position, increased her claims; by the time of trial her open position was for not less than &#163;10.6m However, the fact is that H&#8217;s open offers have been far closer to my eventual award than those of W. His first open offer exceeded, in net effect terms, the decision which I arrived at. By the time of final hearing the net effect of his proposal was less (because of the incidence of costs and interim expenditure), amounting to &#163;7.15m, approximately &#163;300,000 less than my award. W fell well short of her ambitious claims, by some &#163;3 million. I am not persuaded that I should notionally add to my award of &#163;7.45m the sums paid by H under maintenance pending suit orders, and other incidentals, which W invites me to do so as to assert that the total sums received by her exceed &#163;8m (which is still about &#163;2.5m less than the award). To do so might suggest that it is in the payee&#8217;s interests to attempt to secure interim maintenance during proceedings (by voluntary payments or court order) so as to assist in later costs arguments by totting up everything spent on him/her during the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept that aspects of H&#8217;s litigation conduct were less than satisfactory. On balance, W was largely successful in her maintenance pending suit application (for which costs were reserved), and H was unsuccessful at a case management hearing in seeking to persuade me to direct a redaction of any references to the fact and timing of without prejudice negotiations (it having been agreed that the content should not be revealed to the court). I also take the view that H approached the Post Marital Agreement on the basis that it was decisive and should not under any circumstances be departed from, even though W had not signed it. That was the gravamen of his open offers. It was explicitly stated in his Form E that there should be an abbreviated <span style="font-weight:bold">Crossley v Crossley <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2007/1491" uk:canonical="[2007] EWCA Civ 1491" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWCA Civ 1491</ref> </span>hearing. In narrative evidence, H expressly stated that an order should be made in the terms of the unsigned Post Marital Agreement. It was only in closing submissions that his counsel tempered that stance, saying that the Post Marital Agreement was highly influential rather than determinative.  </p>

She did not succeed in persuading me that the Post Marital Agreement should be cast aside and ignored because of H&#8217;s alleged exercise of undue pressure on her. She did not persuade me that H was colluding with his father to conceal the likely receipt from him of vast sums immediately after conclusion of the proceedings. In a case driven by needs, she did not satisfy me that she should be entitled to a sum to purchase a second home in Switzerland, which was the main difference between the parties&#8217; cases on needs, although she did establish a greater income need than H was prepared to accept. </p>

	    <p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">There is a risk in needs based awards, such as the one I have made, of requiring the payer to act as the ultimate insurer of the payee&#8217;s costs with little or no incentive on the payee to negotiate reasonably. An applicant for a financial remedies award can, and frequently does, seek a sum which, inter alia, clears all indebtedness including costs. Thus, however high the level of costs incurred by the payee, he/she will frequently seek what amounts to an indemnity for any costs outstanding so as to be able to exit the marriage debt free. Similarly, if and insofar as the payee has already spent large sums on legal fees which have been provided by the payer (either voluntarily or by way of a court imposed legal services funding order), he/she will argue that to be required to reimburse the payer will lead him/her into debt. It is, in my view, important for parties to be aware that even in needs based claims no litigant is automatically insulated from costs penalties, notwithstanding the possible impact on the intended needs award. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, although H is to be criticised for aspects of his litigation conduct, W must bear, in my judgment, greater responsibility in the light of her disproportionate needs claim. The most influential factor to my mind is the negotiating stances of the parties. W missed the mark by a wide margin whereas H was proximate to my decision. The combined costs amount, depressingly, to 13% of the total assets. I shall order W to pay &#163;150,000 by way of costs, which takes into account the competing arguments on each side. For the avoidance of doubt, I am looking at the costs aspect holistically, and this decision takes into account the interlocutory hearings and the arguments pursued at trial. Strictly speaking, my costs decision reduces W&#8217;s overall award below the total needs based calculation which I have alighted upon although:</p>

If that were not the case, no court could ever make a costs award in a needs case (and needs cases account for the vast bulk of litigation in this field). That cannot be right. Otherwise, the payer runs the risk of, directly or indirectly, being responsible for all costs on each side even if the payee has litigated unreasonably.</p>
