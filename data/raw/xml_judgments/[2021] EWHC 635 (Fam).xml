I gave brief reasons for my decision at the time and indicated that a written judgment would follow.  This is that written judgment. </p>

I shall refer to the four children collectively as &#8216;the children&#8217; and to the two older children on whose behalf the joinder application was advanced as &#8216;the older children&#8217;.  The children&#8217;s father (&#8216;F&#8217;) seeks their summary return to Canada.  The mother (&#8216;M&#8217;) resists the application.  As a consequence of my decision on joinder, I adjourned the final hearing which had been listed before me to 27 and 28 January 2021.   </p>

I also heard briefly from Ms Lilian Odze, an officer of the Cafcass High Court team who interviewed the children in person (not remotely) on 21 December 2020 and prepared a report dated 6 January 2021 (the parties all agreed that Ms Odze could address the court for the purposes of giving her views on joinder without being sworn). </p>

M relies upon two exceptions: grave risk (Article 13(b)) and the children&#8217;s objections (Article 13(2)).  If she establishes either one, the court will have a discretion as to whether the children should return (although if Article 13(b) is established it is &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">inconceivable</span>&#8217; that the court would nevertheless order a return: <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Children) (Abduction: Rights of Custody) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2007/55" uk:canonical="[2007] UKHL 55" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] UKHL 55</ref><span style="font-style:italic"/>at paragraph 45). </p>

If she returns, F agrees to the children living with her until the matter can be considered by the Canadian courts.  Subject to an issue as to the adequacy of the protective measures proposed by F, it seems to be that it would be very difficult for M to establish an Article 13(b) exception in such circumstances.  On the other hand, if M refuses to return, the children will either have to live with F or be accommodated in foster care.  None of the children wishes to live with F; during the course of their interviews with Ms Odze, all of them alleged that he has been physically abusive to the older three children by hitting them as a form of punishment.  The older children have also made allegations of abusive conduct against the paternal grandmother. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">As to the child objections exception, M&#8217;s position is also highly relevant.  Ms Odze made it clear in her report that she did not consider that any of the children have expressed <span style="font-style:italic">objections</span> to returning to Canada.  A told her that he did not want to go back because of his paternal family but also said &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">If I was to live with my Mum, I would feel fine</span>&#8217;.  YG stated &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I want to stay here&#8230; all my family is here and I really really like it here.  I love Canada but I think we are all better off here</span>&#8217;.  YB expressed a positive wish to return to Canada: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I kind of want to live with my Mum but live in Canada</span>&#8217;.  S stated that he wanted to live with M, not F, but was neutral as to the choice between England and Canada (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">wherever</span>&#8217;).  Based upon what the children said to her, in my view, Ms Odze was undoubtedly correct to conclude that none of boys expressed an objection to returning <span style="font-style:italic">to Canada</span> provided they lived with their mother in that jurisdiction.  It is debatable whether what YG told Ms Odze amounted to an objection or &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">a mere preference</span>&#8217; to remaining in England, but this is not an issue I need to resolve. </p>

She referred to her &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">real fear&#8217;</span> of doing so and had no doubt that returning would cause her depression to return, which in turn &#8211; she asserted - would have an impact upon the children.

On 23 December 2020 she emailed M&#8217;s solicitors asking for clarification.  M&#8217;s solicitors replied that same day stating that they were taking instructions.

Ms Odze responded (a few minutes later) that this was not something she would be recommending as, so far as she was able to ascertain, the children &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">did not form an objection to returning to Canada as long </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">as they</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">lived with the mother and not the father</span>&#8217; (emphasis in original text). She added that this was the reason she had sought information as to M&#8217;s position and went on to explain that in the event that the mother refused to return she would need to consider what proposal to make given her safeguarding duties and in the light of the allegations of physical harm which the children had made against F.  </p>

She was strongly critical of M&#8217;s eleventh hour change of position, whereby following receipt of the Cafcass report she had communicated that she would not return to Canada.  She submitted that before the children were wrongfully retained in this jurisdiction F had enjoyed a &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">close and loving&#8217;</span> relationship with them, something approaching joint care.  By contrast, over the past six months he has been denied a meaningful relationship; indirect contact has become increasingly difficult.  Ms Papazian stressed that despite F holding parental responsibility for the children, M has excluded him from important decisions and events in their lives; examples included the children&#8217;s enrolment in school and M&#8217;s failure to keep F informed when YB broke his finger and needed medical treatment or in relation to welfare visits that were made by the police.  Ms Papazian submitted (and I paraphrase) that M&#8217;s conduct since receiving the Cafcass report was a form of tactical manoeuvring driven by a realisation, upon reading the report, that her opposition to F&#8217;s application was likely to be unsuccessful. </p>

Matters were complicated by M&#8217;s recent change of position, but &#8211; in Ms Odze&#8217;s view &#8211; the court would not normally allow itself to be &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">held to ransom&#8217;</span> as M was attempting to do.  I canvassed with Ms Odze the possibility of joining the children on the basis that she would act as their guardian and Mr Netto would be their solicitor (as opposed to the normal course whereby they would be represented by Cafcass Legal).  Ms Odze considered that it would be very difficult for her to work with the children&#8217;s legal team in circumstances where they had been highly critical of her report. </p>

These are matters which will need to be considered by the trial judge.  The court will need to evaluate the issues raised as to M&#8217;s credibility and consider whether, as a loving parent, M is indeed likely to allow the children to return to Canada without her in circumstances where she contends that this would not only be contrary to their interests but &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">intolerable</span>&#8217; for them. The court will also need to consider whether, if that is her stance, it is entitled to infer that the circumstances for the children upon any return fall short of the high threshold in Article 13(b): see in this regard the decision of MacDonald J in <span style="font-style:italic">AT v SS (Abduction: Art 13(b): </span></p>

This creates an invidious position for the children in which, potentially, they face being separated from their mother and having to live with their father or in foster care upon a return to Canada.  The older children also face the possibility of having to be separated from their younger siblings (an outcome to which all of the children would have strong objections).   </p>

At the time Ms Odze prepared her report, in the absence of a clear response to her specific enquiries and in view of the content of M&#8217;s second statement, she was entirely justified to prepare her report on the assumption that if the court were to order the children&#8217;s return, M would go back to Canada with them.  I reject the suggestion that Ms Odze failed to grasp the relevant legal principles.  On the contrary, it seems to me that she was entirely correct to draw a distinction between the children&#8217;s opposition to living with F and an objection to returning to Canada.  When she was preparing her report, this was not an example of a case in which it is &#8216;artificial&#8217; to distinguish between those two notions, as M had not stated that she would not return.  As well as reciting the children&#8217;s views, part of Ms Odze&#8217;s role was to subject them to scrutiny and analysis.  It will be a matter for the court to consider her analysis and decide whether or not to accept it. </p>

It does seem to me (at least for the purposes of the decision I need to make) that the older children are clearly expressing objections to returning to Canada.  The primary reason for this is that a return would mean becoming separated from M and, as matters stand, having to live with F.  In circumstances where that is a real prospect, the children have described in some detail to Mr Netto why this is unpalatable for them.  They have provided him with a greater level of detail than they gave to Ms Odze.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr James Netto is a solicitor of great experience who specialises in international child abduction proceedings.  I am confident that he will properly discharge his duties as guardian to the older children and conduct proceedings on their behalf in accordance with their interests.  As I have said, I consider that it is in their best interests that he be appointed to fulfil that role. </p>
