It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, while others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. These are the consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not the provenance of the state to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting.

	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">&#8220;There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</p>

It is for the local authority to prove its case.&#160;It is not for the mother to disprove it. In particular it is not for the mother to disprove it by proving how the injuries were in fact sustained. Neither is it for the court to determine how the injuries were sustained. The court&#8217;s task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability. Where, as here, there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not &#8216;has that possible alternative explanation been proved&#8217; but rather it should ask itself, &#8216;in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">I agree with the judgment of Ward LJ. Family judges deal with increasingly difficult child cases and are much assisted in their decision-making process by professionals from other disciplines: medical, wider mental health and social work among others. The courts pay particular attention to the valuable contribution from paediatricians and child psychiatrists as well as others, but it is important to remember that the decision is that of the judge and not of the professional expert. Judges are well accustomed to assessing the conflicting evidence of experts. As Ward LJ said, judges are not expected to suspend judicial belief simply because the evidence is given by an expert. An expert is not in any special position and there is no presumption or belief in a doctor however distinguished he or she may be. It is, however, necessary for a judge to give reasons for disagreeing with experts' conclusions or recommendations. That, this judge did. A judge cannot substitute his views for the views of the experts without some evidence to support what it is he concludes.</span></p>

The potential for harm to a child in such circumstances is self evident but in order to ensure that it is considered in every case, Parliament has enacted an amendment to the 1989 Act to provide for the same: by s 31(9) as introduced by s 120 Adoption and Children Act 2002 harm explicitly includes impairment suffered from seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another: in colloquial terms, domestic abuse.</p>

A clear distinction is to be drawn between the relevance and admissibility of evidence which describes the harmful circumstances in which a child is being cared for and the same evidence when it is used to suggest that a person has a propensity to commit a particular act. In other words, the evidence will be very relevant to harm or its likelihood in s 31(2) and the court&#8217;s assessment of risk in s 1(3)(e) of the 1989 Act but not necessarily to perpetration. It may be forensically unwise for the court to attach much, if any, weight to this evidence if it is directed only to the question of propensity&#8230;</p>

	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.11in">No judge would consider it proper to reach a conclusion about a witness&#8217;s credibility based solely on the way that he or she gives evidence, at least in any normal circumstances. The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities.  However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence.  Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable. </p>

However, it is not helpful for the judge to give an indication of percentages as to the likelihood that one or other of the possible perpetrators was responsible and judges should be cautious about amplifying in this way a judgment in which they have been unable to identify a specific perpetrator (<span style="font-style:italic">Re S-B (Children)</span> [2010] 1 FLR 1161, SC).</p>

At this stage, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability. Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together and comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them. Within this context, the right question is not &#8216;who is the more likely?&#8217; but rather &#8216;does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?&#8217; In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, the Court of Appeal highlighted a clear danger in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this can lead to an identification on evidence that falls short of a probability;</p>

Note that the Court of Appeal has suggested that, in the context of the requirements of the Children Act 1989, s 31(2), the terms &#8216;non-accidental&#8217; and &#8216;accidental&#8217; injury are, in addition to being tautologous and oxymoronic, unhelpful, the threshold criteria not being concerned with intent or blame but rather with an objective standard of care (<span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Split Hearing)</span> [2014] 1 FLR 1421, CA).</p>

In determining whether a person is properly included in the pool of potential perpetrators, it is essential that the court weighs any lies told by that person against any evidence that points away from them having been responsible for the injuries (<span style="font-style:italic">H v City and Council of Swansea and Others</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 195). In these &#8216;uncertain perpetrator&#8217; cases, the correct approach is for the case to proceed at the welfare stage on the basis that each of the possible perpetrators is treated as such (<span style="font-style:italic">Re O and N: Re B</span> [2003] 1 FLR 1169, HL). The House of Lords held in that case that it would be grotesque if, because neither parent had been proved to be the perpetrator, the court had to proceed at the welfare stage as though the child were not at risk from either parent, even though one or other of them was the perpetrator of significant harm. The judge conducting the welfare hearing should have regard to the facts found at the preliminary hearing when they leave open the possibility that a parent or carer was a perpetrator of proved harm and that conclusion should not be excluded from consideration.</p>

Superficially Dr Cummings&#8217; note is consistent with Dr Singh&#8217;s statement that &#8220;Mum reported that the Child started crying inconsolably at 2pm&#8221; [C139] but that statement is inconsistent with the next phrase in Dr Singh&#8217;s statement which is &#8220;and mum noticed at 6pm that evening that the Child has been crying more than usual&#8221;; if the Child was crying inconsolably from 2pm it seems unlikely the Mother noticed it at 6pm and was able to project back it started at 2pm or that it was &#8220;inconsolably&#8221; at 2pm but &#8220;more than usual&#8221; at 6pm. In any event, the reference to 2pm is not in Dr Singh&#8217;s note which records &#8220;Mum noticed at 6/7pm last night that the Child has been crying more than usual and appeared uncomfortable&#8221; [J163] which suggests something different about the cry at 18.00-19.00 which is broadly consistent with the Mother&#8217;s evidence.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">What Dr Cummings records is also now inconsistent with the Mother&#8217;s evidence which is of fluctuating distress. When Dr Cummings was cross-examined she accepted there was no discussion about what happened between 2pm and 6pm and she did not recall any detailed conversation as to whether the Child went to sleep or seemed better or worse overnight. The evidence of distress from 2pm is generally consistent with a crying child during the afternoon of the day before. The most contemporaneous recording of the distress is from the 111 transcript which records the Mother reporting the Child having &#8220;swelling in her left leg&#8221; from &#8220;last evening&#8221; [J7] and she cried for &#8220;about three to four hours continued&#8221;, it is not clear if this is the evening before or that morning [J10] but what is clear is that it was not continuous from 2pm. Given the proximity to the event and the limitations in Dr Cummings&#8217; recall I prefer the Mother&#8217;s evidence that the Child had been crying from some point early on the afternoon of 19 February but not continuously through to admission on 20 February 2023. For completeness Dr Edate recorded that the Child was crying at 14.00 [J190] and this was more than usual at 18.00 [C24f] but accepted she may have taken this from the other records.</p>

I find it very strange that the Mother did not think to try changing the Child&#8217;s nappy or looking for a rash under her clothing or another physical sign of the cause of the distress given that she had last changed the Child on return home earlier in the afternoon. I asked her what she had actually done in the time between being concerned and calling the Father and the Father&#8217;s return home and she said she &#8220;was holding her in my arms and walking in the room to calm her down&#8221;.

That evidence differed from the Mother&#8217;s which was the calls were when she was outside Primark which they went to straight from the Gurdwara and were to tell him she was waiting outside. When the issue came up later in his evidence that was the Father&#8217;s revised evidence and he denied having earlier said those calls were about groceries he needed to buy. It did appear there was genuine confusion on his part and I do not believe he had intended to suggest the calls at 15.27 and 15.34 were about groceries and rather thought he was answering a question about the calls at 18.31 and 18.34 which appear immediately below on the call log at [O10].</p>

In answer to the Local Authority&#8217;s questions the Father had said that later in the evening &#8220;the Child was settled and sleeping in her mum&#8217;s lap&#8230;and I thought I can make phone calls&#8221; from the yard outside. On behalf of the Guardian he was taken back to the call log at [O10] and asked if the 3 calls at 20.33, 21.04 and 21.07 were those calls. He said they were, one to a friend and 2 others he did not recognise. Those calls were 17, 0 and 6 seconds in duration respectively. The next call is a received call from the Mother at 21.18 and then again at 21.26, he then made 3 calls to the Mother in quick succession before receiving a final call from the Mother at 21.42. The explanation for those (matching that given by the Mother) was that the Child was sleeping on her lap and she could not go to the window or come outside to speak with the Father but it begged the question why, if he only had 3 quick calls to make, he was still outside at 21.18, 21.26 and 21.42. His explanation was that maybe he was talking to his landlord who lived in the house across the yard from where the parents lived. He had earlier accepted it was a cold night and this explanation did not seem very credible.</p>

In my opinion, shin bone fractures in a very young child who is non-mobile could not have been caused by the child herself. She did not have any of the conditions which can lead to fractures without significant trauma. Her vitamin D levels were low, but there was no evidence of any bony changes (rickets) or metabolic biochemical changes (calcium profile and liver profile) which could indicate that she had high bone fragility. The Radiology Reports have not identified any radiological evidence of any bone disorders which could increase her susceptibility to fracture. In my opinion, a fracture of the shin bone requires significant trauma and it has been described as being a spiral fracture, and these are usually caused by torsion being applied to the leg with significant force which can lead to the fracture. The likelihood of this being caused accidentally with the lack of any plausible history is low and, in my opinion, a significant fracture in a very young child is likely to have been </p>

However, on the balance of probabilities, the Mother is more likely to have caused the injury given her oral evidence that the handling of the Child on return home was by her: she put the Child in the bouncer, she put the Child on the bed, she undressed the Child and changed the nappy whilst (on her oral evidence) the Father was out. On his return, the physical evidence of injury was detected. Even if she was mistaken in her oral evidence, she gave no evidence of the Father handling the Child when he was present.</p>

That is to say, did the Child suffer harm attributable to the care given not being that which it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give her? In closing submissions I was referred to a decision of HHJ Wright in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>[2013] EWCC B8 (Fam) in which he said &#8220;Nor is it possible to conclude at what point &#8216;normal day to day handling&#8217; - a vague phrase at best, and which must include the use of reasonable force and pressure at times - crosses over to the point where S&#8217;s vulnerable bone structure was compromised and exceeded&#8221;. That observation is apt to cover this situation where the Child suffered fractures in circumstances where I have found that it is unknown whether the Child&#8217;s vitamin D deficiency actually did result in reduced bone fragility compared to children without that deficiency. That uncertainty multiplies the uncertainty as to the force required to cause a fracture in a child without vitamin D deficiency.</p>

Whilst there are multiple examples of internal inconsistencies in the parents&#8217; respective evidence and as between them, I have to address my mind to the guidance of Macur LJ: is this inconsistency proved on balance to be deliberate untruth or does it rather arise from confusion or mistake? For the avoidance of doubt there is no evidence of lying &#8220;for a reason&#8230;which does not point to&#8230;guilt&#8221; such as &#8220;shame, humiliation, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear, distress, confusion and emotional pressure&#8221;. I acknowledge there is at least the possibility of &#8220;misplaced loyalty&#8221; in the sense of one parent seeking to protect the other but there is no evidence of this behaviour or collusion. Also, for the avoidance of doubt, the inconsistencies relate to a significant issue, that is when and how in the course of 19 February the Child came to suffer a metaphyseal fracture.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">Therefore, does it arise from mistake or confusion? I remind myself that the parents were in a stressful situation both on 19 February 2023 when the Child&#8217;s condition presented itself causing the Mother to phone the Father and on the discovery of unusual symptoms. They were in a stressful position in hospital with an injured child and (if innocent of using excessive force) seeking answers to how that could have happened. It was compounded by another (if innocent again) unexplained fracture. In addition to medical professionals, they were engaging with Children&#8217;s Social Care and the police and ultimately their Child was removed from their care. If they had never behaved unreasonably in their handling of the Child, that must have been enormously distressing. The distress was likely compounded by English not being their first language, hampering easy, clear communication and fear their child may not be returned once removed. Over the subsequent weeks and months, they were asked to recall, ultimately at this trial in quite granular detail, the events of a day some time past and in relation to which they had no expectation at the time they would need to recall it. Inevitably, that leads to less than perfect recall; indeed it would be suspicious if there was perfect, consistent recall. I also remind myself it is not for the parents to prove these were mistakes in recall, it is for the Local Authority to prove they were lies.</p>

It does not exonerate the Mother on any version, although might have exonerated the Father but for Dr Yadav&#8217;s evidence that the fracture could have occurred in the hours before the swelling was detected rather than immediately before. But this begs the question, why the mother would seek to exonerate the Father by implicating herself? Nor is it consistent with the Father&#8217;s behaviour when the Child was removed on 27 February 2023. He was clearly saying let the Mother stay with the Child; would he have said that if he was trying to escape blame? Or if he was to blame and desperately wanted the Child to remain with at least one parent this would have been the time to own up. None of this points to the inconsistencies being lies.</p>

Further, she had already, on her own admission, informed the Father something seemed to be wrong so waiting was not going to exonerate her. Whilst I noted above the behaviour suggested indifference or wilful avoidance of discovering the cause of injury, I do not think it points to excessive force having been used.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">A further factor when considering if the fractures were non-accidental is that they are in the same leg but, as I have found, on different occasions. Counsel for the Mother invites me to consider the likelihood of a parent losing control and injuring the Child using the exact same mechanism on 2 occasions. There is some, but limited, merit in the submission. If the perpetrator lost control dressing the Child and applied excess force putting a sock on causing the first fracture and the Child was equally resistant to being dressed on another occasion, then it is quite plausible for the perpetrator to again apply excess force putting a sock on. There are only 4 limbs to choose to apply excessive force to and only 2 lower limbs so the probability of a second injury in the same limb as the first is either 25% (1 in 4) or 50% (1 in 2 lower limbs); in other words not unlikely.</p>

When put in this blunt way I simply cannot be satisfied that the Local Authority have made out their allegation that the injuries were perpetrated by someone using excessive force, force which exceeded that which a reasonable parent would be expected to use. The inconsistencies in recall are not sufficient to plug the gap in the medical evidence. Where the Local Authority could clearly prove lies pointing to guilt the answer may have been different but that is not this case.
