There was a shoulder dystocia during the birth, meaning that following the birth of her head, the baby&#8217;s shoulder got stuck behind the mother&#8217;s pelvic bone.  This led to a number of manoeuvres being required.  The first two manoeuvres were undertaken by the midwife and obstetric registrar, NLD, namely that Mother was placed into the McRoberts position (knees up) and suprapubic pressure was applied.  As these were not successful, internal manoeuvres were required and these were undertaken initially by NLD and then by the consultant CAD who was called upon to assist; these were posterior arm manipulation followed by &#8220;wood screw&#8221; which involved turning the baby.  The latter manoeuvre was effective in freeing AD&#8217;s shoulder and she was then delivered.</span></p>

Despite the rib fractures being missed, Doctor Olsen, the instructed radiologist, was very clear that they were there to be seen on the first x ray.  Thus, there is an upper time limit for the causation of those rib fracture injuries; they must have been caused in the first 22 hours of life.</span></p>

Both of them had provided witness statements at an early stage when matters were fresh in their mind for the purposes of the internal investigation by the hospital.  This investigation had not concluded that the first set of rib fractures were birth injuries; rather they were considered to be &#8220;unexplained&#8221;.

One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people's memories are unreliable and believe our &#8239;memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors &#8239;are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; &#8239;and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate."</span></p>

Is that the mark of a cautious man, whose statements are for that reason to be respected, or is he taking time to fabricate? Is the emphatic witness putting on an act to deceive me, or is he speaking from the fullness of his heart, knowing that he is right? Is he likely to be more truthful if he looks me straight in the face than if he casts his eyes on the ground perhaps from shyness or a natural timidity?

This is not to say that judges (or jurors) lack the ability to tell whether witnesses are lying. Still less does it follow that there is no value in oral evidence. But research confirms that people do not in fact generally rely on demeanour to detect deception but on the fact that liars are more likely to tell stories that are illogical, implausible, internally inconsistent and contain fewer details than persons telling the truth: see Minzner, "Detecting Lies Using Demeanor, Bias and Context" (2008) 29 Cardozo LR 2557. One of the main potential benefits of cross-examination is that skilful questioning can expose inconsistencies in false stories."</span></p>

However, the observations of Lord Hoffmann and Lady Hale, quoted at paragraph 12 above, make it clear that the same approach is to be applied to the identification of perpetrators as to any other factual issue in the case. This issue shows quite clearly that there is no necessary connection between the seriousness of an allegation and the improbability that it has taken place. The test is the balance of probabilities, nothing more and nothing less.</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">35. Of course, it may be difficult for the judge to decide, even on the balance of probabilities, who has caused the harm to the child. There is no obligation to do so. As we have already seen, unlike a finding of harm, it is not a necessary ingredient of the threshold criteria.

Sometimes this will be necessary in order to fulfil the "attributability" criterion. If the harm has been caused by someone outside the home or family, for example at school or in hospital or by a stranger, then it is not attributable to the parental care unless it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it. Sometimes it will desirable for the same reasons as those given above. It will help to identify the real risks to the child and the steps needed to protect him.

Four people had looked after the child during the relevant time for the more recent injury and a large number of people might have been responsible for the older injury. The Court of Appeal held that the judge had been wrong to apply a "no possibility" test when identifying the pool of possible perpetrators. This was far too wide. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P, at para 26, preferred a test of a "likelihood or real possibility".</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">42. Miss Susan Grocott QC, for the local authority, has suggested that this is where confusion has crept in, because in Re H this test was adopted in relation to the prediction of the likelihood of future harm for the purpose of the threshold criteria. It was not intended as a test for identification of possible perpetrators.</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">43. That may be so, but there are real advantages in adopting this approach. The cases are littered with references to a "finding of exculpation" or to "ruling out" a particular person as responsible for the harm suffered. This is, as the President indicated, to set the bar far too high. It suggests that parents and other carers are expected to prove their innocence beyond reasonable doubt. If the evidence is not such as to establish responsibility on the balance of probabilities it should nevertheless be such as to establish whether there is a real possibility that a particular person was involved. When looking at how best to protect the child and provide for his future, the judge will have to consider the strength of that possibility as part of the overall circumstances of the case."</span></p>

			<p class="paragraph" style="margin-left:1.25in"><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">"46. Drawing matters together, it can be seen that the concept of a pool of perpetrators seeks to strike a fair balance between the rights of the individual, including those of the child, and the importance of child protection. It is a means of satisfying the attributable threshold condition that only arises where the court is satisfied that there has been significant harm arising from (in shorthand) ill-treatment and where the only 'unknown' is which of a number of persons is responsible. So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way. Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible. In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not. There is no room for a finding of fact on the basis of 'real possibility', still less on the basis of suspicion. There is no such thing as a pool of one.</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">47. It should also be emphasised that a decision to place a person within the pool of perpetrators is not a finding of fact in the conventional sense. As is made clear in&#8239;</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Lancashire</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">&#8239;at [19],&#8239;</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">O and N</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">&#8239;at [27-28] and&#8239;</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">S-B</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">&#8239;at [43], the person is not a proven perpetrator but a possible perpetrator. That conclusion is then carried forward to the welfare stage, when the court will, as was said in&#8239;</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">S-B</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">, "consider the strength of the possibility" that the person was involved as part of the overall circumstances of the case. At the same time it will, as Lord Nicholls put it in Lancashire, "keep firmly in mind that the parents have not been shown to be responsible for the child's injuries." In saying this, he recognised that a conclusion of this kind presents the court with a particularly difficult problem. Experience bears this out, particularly where a child has suffered very grave harm from someone within a pool of perpetrators.</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">48. The concept of the pool of perpetrators should therefore, as was said in&#8239;</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Lancashire</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">, encroach only to the minimum extent necessary upon the general principles underpinning s.31(2). Centrally, it does not alter the general rule on the burden of proof. Where there are a number of people who might have caused the harm, it is for the local authority to show that in relation to each of them there is a real possibility that they did. No one can be placed into the pool unless that has been shown. This is why it is always misleading to refer to 'exclusion from the pool': see&#8239;</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Re S-B</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">&#8239;at [43]. Approaching matters in that way risks, as Baroness Hale said, reversing the burden of proof.</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">49. To guard against that risk, I would suggest that a change of language may be helpful. The court should first consider whether there is a 'list' of people who had the opportunity to cause the injury. It should then consider whether it can identify the actual perpetrator on the balance of probability and should seek, but not strain, to do so:</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">&#8239;</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:#000000">Re D (Children)</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">&#8239;[2009] EWCA Civ 472 at [12].</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000"> Only if it cannot identify the perpetrator to the civil standard of proof should it go on to ask in respect of those on the list: "Is there a likelihood or real possibility that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries?" Only if there is should A or B or C be placed into the 'pool'.</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">50. Likewise, it can be seen that the concept of a pool of perpetrators as a permissible means of satisfying the threshold was forged in cases concerning individuals who were 'carers'. In Lancashire, the condition was interpreted to include non-parent carers. It was somewhat widened in&#8239;</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">North Yorkshire</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">&#8239;at [26] to include 'people with access to the child' who might have caused injury. If that was an extension, it was a principled one. But at all events, the extension does not stretch to "anyone who had even a fleeting contact with the child in circumstances where there was the opportunity to cause injuries":&#8239;</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">North Yorkshire</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">&#8239;at [25]. Nor does it extend to harm caused by someone outside the home or family unless it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it:&#8239;</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">S-B</span><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">&#8239;at [40].</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">51. It should also be noted that in the leading cases there were two, three or four known individuals from whom any risk to the child must have come. The position of each individual was then investigated and compared. That is as it should be. To assess the likelihood of harm having been caused by A or B or C, one needs as much information as possible about each of them in order to make the decision about which if any of them should be placed in the pool. So, where there is an imbalance of information about some individuals in comparison to others, particular care may need to be taken to ensure that the imbalance does not distort the assessment of the possibilities. The same may be said where the list of individuals has been whittled down to a pool of one named individual alongside others who are not similarly identified. This may be unlikely, but the present case shows that it is not impossible. Here it must be shown that there genuinely is a pool of perpetrators and not just a pool of one by default."</span></p>

			<p class="paragraph" style="margin-left:1.25in"><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">"62. Failure to protect comes in innumerable guises. It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child.</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">63. Such findings where made in respect of a carer, often the mother, are of the utmost importance when it comes to assessments and future welfare considerations. A finding of failing to protect can lead a Court to conclude that the children's best interests will not be served by remaining with, or returning to, the care of that parent, even though that parent may have been wholly exonerated from having caused any physical injuries.</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">64. Any Court conducting a Finding of Fact Hearing should be alert to the danger of such a serious finding becoming 'a bolt on' to the central issue of perpetration or of falling into the trap of assuming too easily that, if a person was living in the same household as the perpetrator, such a finding is almost inevitable. As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, "nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another". Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their long-suffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm."</span></p>

The approach in R v Lucas is not confined, as it was on the facts of Lucas itself, to a statement made out of court and can apply to a "lie" made in the course of the court proceedings and the approach is not limited solely to evidence concerning accomplices.</span><span class="scxw92106442" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><br/><span class="scxw92106442">&#160;</span><br/><span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000">99. In the Family Court in an appropriate case a judge will not infrequently directly refer to the authority of R v Lucas in giving a judicial self-direction as to the approach to be taken to an apparent lie.

One highly important aspect of the Lucas decision, and indeed the approach to lies generally in the criminal jurisdiction, needs to be borne fully in mind by family judges. It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the "lie" is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is "capable of amounting to a corroboration".

Sometimes the linkage will be obvious, as where the facts proved establish physical harm. But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect. In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority's case was that the father 'lacks honesty with professionals', 'minimises matters of importance' and 'is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance'. Maybe. But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect? The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise. The local authority's evidence and submissions must set out the argument and explain explicitly why it is said that, in the particular case, the conclusion indeed follows from the facts. Here, as we shall see, the local authority conspicuously failed to do so. </span></p>

It is also a tautology: the true distinction is between an accident which is unexpected and unintentional and an injury which involves an element of wrong. That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and/or an intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction. While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction from, say, negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely, findings of fact that at least satisfy the significant harm, attributability and objective standard of care elements of section 31(2). </span></p>

On 2 August 2021 the date of the latest chest x ray available to him, the callus remained fairly soft and the fracture lines remained clearly visible.  He described this as very unusual for fractures which were 6 weeks old and which would be expected to have healed more or less completely.  </span></p>

Applying her knowledge of clinical genetics, she was unable to say that the alteration in one gene only (known as a recessive) would be likely to produce a clinical effect. For that she would expect there to be alterations in both genes such that the patient would not be a mere carrier of one mutation. Because the Sparc gene is involved in the production of collagen, the &#8216;double defect&#8217; would be likely to result in bone fragility and quite possibly a propensity to bruise easily. However, because AD&#8217;s SPARC gene variant is heterozygous, Dr Price would be unable to rely on it for a diagnosis of OI or some related abnormality. </span></p>

Beyond that it was very difficult to say very much. He agreed that the Father&#8217;s low DEXA scan result was within range but at the bottom end and that made it difficult for him to express any opinion on causation without exercising caution. He did not consider that the prospects of the Sparc gene mutation giving rise to bruising as being very likely.  Taken as a whole it is right to characterize Dr Allgrove as being highly cautious, not to say sceptical that the SPARC gene variant could account for the totality of AD&#8217;s injuries, but a possibility that he could not exclude entirely.  He did agree that it remained possible that there was a pre-disposition to fracture on normal handling and he did note that bone strength continued to develop in the neonatal period such that it was not necessarily surprising that there had been no further known fracture events.</span></p>

Both were theoretically possible, but would be regarded as incredibly rare and it was impossible to say which of the two was more likely.

( I have to treat this opinion with some caution in the light of the evidence of Dr Price which followed). Her view that the only two possible explanations were some form of non-accidental injury and a birth related injury. She thought the most likely of the two was that this was a non-accidental injury.  This view was informed partly by the fact that, having looked at obstetric notes and procedures done during delivery, she concluded that there didn&#8217;t seem to have been any manoeuvre that occurred that put pressure on ribs (as was subsequently confirmed by the obstetricians) and partly informed by the fact that the child presented some weeks later with similar injuries which were unexplained and which she considered to be more likely than not non- accidental injuries. </span></p>

She was pressed as to what her conclusion would be if it was found that the initial fractures were genuinely unexplained, and she indicated that as far as she was concerned it was for the judge to decide observing that the only reason that the injuries remain unexplained is that no one has explained it and that this justified &#8216;keeping in mind&#8217; non-accidental injury. </span></p>

The rib fractures were not immediately identified but were identified at 19.35 following a Neonatal review.  Thereafter at 20.04 on 20 June AD was taken straight to NICU the intensive care ward where she remained until she was discharged to the post-natal ward at 17.00 on 21 June 2021.</span></p>

However, I have accepted the unchallenged evidence of the obstetricians that they are unable to identify any manoeuvre which would cause compressive force to the chest. To the extent that ACD was a little more diffident about ruling out supra-pubic pressure as a cause, it seems to me that that was probably due to the fact that he was not present when that intervention was taking place.  As he was giving evidence as a witness of fact, not an expert, it would have gone rather beyond his role to be categorical about that aspect of the evidence, in relation to which he was relying on his past experience combined with his knowledge about the rarity of rib fractures being caused in birth.

None, as I understand it, has been described as specifically due to supra-pubic pressure.  Supra-pubic pressure is a manoeuvre which is routinely used in cases of shoulder dystocia and during which the infant&#8217;s body is free above the mother&#8217;s pubic bone.

The difficulty with that submission, it seems to me, is in the highly nuanced nature of the expert evidence. Despite the unusual features in the case (the slender appearances of the bones and the strikingly unusual healing pattern of the bones, the abnormal genetic presentation) each of the experts dealing with the evidence from the point of view of their respective fields impressed upon me that none of these features are diagnostic in nature.  The state of knowledge at this point of time is that none of the medical experts is able to put forward a unifying theory which explains all of AD&#8217;s injuries.</span></p>

If that is right, the probability is that the mother called the father because she had already discovered the marks on AD (which were at that stage just marks and not bruises) and she wanted to discuss the marks with him and perhaps ask his advice as to what to do. It would make sense that their concern for AD would override any consideration of the Covid regulations and that they would want to discuss it in person.</span></p>

It is difficult to envisage the mother injuring AD after the support that she had called for had arrived.  Moreover, if the father had injured AD in that short period, I really cannot envisage the mother covering for him in those circumstances.  My strong impression of her having regard to all of the evidence is that if faced with clear evidence of that nature she would put AD&#8217;s welfare before her own relationship.</span></p>

JD2&#8217;s text to LC timed at 17.54 to the effect that JB was here &#8220;now&#8221; was suggestive of him having just arrived.

In my judgment it is important to bear in mind that they were all aware that AD had suffered rib fractures and were all concerned for her welfare and following the second set of injuries, they were aware of both the further rib fractures and the bruises.  It is unsurprising that the more experienced parents &#8211; in particular mothers &#8211; might regard themselves as being in a position to offer advice and guidance to the young mother and father in this case &#8211; and perhaps there was a particular tendency to think that the father required guidance.</span></p>

In respect of the leg cycling, there seems to have been a difference of opinion between them as to whether this technique is one which should only be used when the baby was settled or not or whether it could be used to help a windy or constipated baby who may be unsettled.

The mother had taken the view that it was the way she had winded AD which had caused the bruising and indeed it has been accepted by the medical experts as a possible mechanism &#8211; with the issue being whether it would have required rough handling or could occur with normal handling.</span></p>

Whilst I did not consider any of the family witnesses to be doing anything other than seeking to assist the court to reach the truth, JD2 has had a unique perspective as a result of the joinder of her as intervener - with the benefit of hindsight that now appears to be somewhat unnecessary; that status has, however, given her access to the wide canvass of evidence.  She was party to the initial discussions between family members and her instincts were entirely protective of AD, as were those of the other family members.  She is a nursery nurse who has had safeguarding training and will have had a child protection perspective as well as a family perspective.  Uniquely, however, she has also had the opportunity to consider matters in the light of the developing medical evidence.  She has had the opportunity to reflect upon whether her observations were coloured by her perspective that AD must have been subject to abuse; she became quite emotional in considering that point.  She did not resile from her unfavourable evidence about father suggesting that she should say she had come earlier than she in fact had on 1 August, although she did now ascribe that to panic.  Overall, she had a lot of opportunity to observe the father and mother caring for AD.  I found her evidence about how the father interacted with AD and her perception of him as a loving father and of the mother as a loving mother are ones on which I can put considerable weight.</span></p>

It was put to him that these were in poor taste which he accepted.  Nevertheless, it does not seem to me that any of these assist me with the matters that I have to decide.  Humour is highly subjective and context and age specific and these sort of jokes can easily be overinterpreted in the context of a child protection enquiry.  They do not in my judgment advance the question of whether an otherwise devoted parent is likely to have injured a child.</span></p>

To the extent that both may be attributed to the SPARC variant, that is best described as a theoretical possibility.  To that limited extent I accept the submission made by Mr Crabtree about the dangers of over-reliance on the SPARC gene variant as an explanation for the fractures themselves, given the caution with which Dr Price and Dr Allgrove expressed themselves.  </span></p>

The court must look at each possibility, both individually and together, factoring in all the evidence available including the medical evidence before deciding whether the "fact in issue more probably occurred than not"&#160;(Re B: Lord Hoffman).</span></p>

It seems to me that the language of exoneration is more properly applied to uncertain perpetrator cases where wrongdoing is established and the court seeks to mark its clear view that one or more individual can firmly be established as being not responsible.  To that extent it does not apply to a case where the threshold criteria have been found not to be crossed because the fact of inflicted injuries have not been proved.  Accordingly, whilst I would not be minded to use the word exoneration, I am content for there to be clear recordings on the order which could include that no adverse findings were either made against JD2 or indeed sought by any party and that the court considered her to be a witness of truth who sought to assist the court.

The Court does have concerns about the way that the relevant NHS Trust dealt with the issue of disclosure.

	      <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Nevertheless, the upshot of the proceedings has been that the parents have been separated from their child for the best part of a year and it is appropriate for the court to express its regrets that they have had to endure that separation, even as it concludes that it has been inevitable.  It is possible that the parents may have difficulty processing or emotionally adjusting to these matters; there is also the risk that they have missed out, at least in part, on the opportunities that most parents have to learn naturally about their child and her development through constant parenting.  Although the separation has been mitigated by regular contact, and the evidence as to their parenting skills is extremely encouraging, it seems to me to be appropriate that these young parents are supported by the local authority in the resumption of their care of AD  - for as long as they need it  - via a child in need plan.  They will certainly need support with the transition, and may require longer term support in building their relationship with AD, and emotional support or counselling.  In addition, support with any follow up medical interventions would also be appropriate in the light of the observations of the experts.</span></p>
