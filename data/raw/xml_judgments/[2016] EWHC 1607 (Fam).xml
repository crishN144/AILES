The Father has however been provided with a full bundle of documents.  He has also received the Mother&#8217;s Position Statement which I can see he has annotated extensively.  Bearing in mind that the Father appears in person, I have afforded him every chance to put forward any arguments that he considers relevant. I have given him a much wider license than I would have extended to a lawyer because as a lay person he has inevitably struggled to identify the key points in an area of law which is not without its complexity.  I should also add that he struck me as a very excitable and at times rather overwrought personality who needed to say what he considered to be relevant whether it was or not.</p>

The Father also told me that he has a rented property here in the UK, in Reading.  He works as a &#8220;Remote Political Analyst&#8221; and he told me that in the course of that employment he provides monthly reports to a London firm with branches elsewhere in the UK, for example in Surrey.  His home is in Reading and this has been his home since August 2008.  I note that Reading is a town with which the Father has long established connections.  He gained his PHD there in July 1990.   The Property in which he lives in Reading is rented, through an agency, and he pays &#163;850.00 per month. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I pause to say that all this clearly establishes that the father lives permanently here in the UK.  In his evidence, the father told me that he was the one who cares for SJ, by which I first understood him to say she lived with him and he was responsible for her day to day needs.  I pressed him so that I was sure that he understood what I was asking him i.e. who has day to day care of SJ? Although he persisted that it was his task, it was quickly clear that it was not.  Self evidently it could not be, given the child lives in Algeria.  I consider these exchanges revealed a rather distorted thought process on the father&#8217;s part as well as signalling to me that he appears to have lost his bearings in this litigation i.e. the responsibility of both parents to promote the welfare of their child.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">What has become clear therefore is that SJ is no longer cared for by either of her parents.  I stress this to emphasise to the Father that SJ&#8217;s right to be brought up by either her Mother or her Father and with knowledge of both is a fundamental right of hers.  The Father is denying her this. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is asserted by the Mother that she is desperately worried about SJ&#8217;s well-being.  In earlier proceedings, the Court found that SJ was well looked after in the Mother&#8217;s care. The Court has also declared by &#8216;no later than 12 March 2015&#8217; SJ had become habitually resident in Poland.   The reasoning is found within the detailed Judgment of Mrs Justice Roberts (Neutral citation number <span style="font-weight:bold"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/1926" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 1926 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 1926 (Fam)</ref></span>).  It is clear that in the past the Mother took SJ to Poland without the Father&#8217;s consent and contrary to the principals of the Hague Convention 1980.  It was for this reason that Mrs Justice Roberts conducted a welfare enquiry to see where SJ&#8217;s best interests lay.  She did this with the benefit of a CAFCASS Report and concluded that the child should remain in the custody of her Mother.  She sets this out in Paragraph 10 of her Order of 12 March 2015 in these terms: </p>

Should the Mother&#8217;s above allegations about SJ&#8217;s emotional welfare be accurate, this would also compound Cafcass&#8217; concerns about any substantial increase in contact.</span></p>

When I pressed D on his understanding of the issues flowing from a return order from SJ&#8217;s perspective, he said to me, &#8220;She will readjust very quickly.  She can visit her mother at any time&#8221;.  He then went on to liken his daughter&#8217;s predicament to that of Madeleine McCann.  He said that his case was similar to that of someone who had stolen a large amount of money and given it away to charity, by which he meant that the mother had done something wrong but was now trying to make it look right.  He told me that there were &#8220;thousands of Poles flocking into this country&#8221; and SJ&#8217;s welfare needs would be met here.  I gained the impression throughout the course of his submissions to me that he was intent above all else to establish his rights vis &#224; vis SJ and to punish the mother for her wrongful abduction of the child.  That impression was reinforced by his final remark to me that if there was any restriction whatsoever on his contact with SJ, he would not want to have any contact with her at all.  I have to say that I found that an astonishing statement from him, particularly in circumstances where he had previously assured me that, if SJ remained in Poland, he would make whatever arrangements were necessary to travel to see her.</span></p>

She said that she agreed, in accordance with the welfare arrangements approved by both the Polish Court and English Court (i.e. that the Father was to have contact with SJ in Poland but was not to take her abroad), that SJ could go for a holiday with her father.  It is extremely unlikely, on the history of this case alone that the mother would have agreed to SJ being taken to Algeria.  I find the father&#8217;s assertion entirely unconvincing.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in"> Certainly by 29 January 2016 the Mother had applied to the Polish Court in Plock, where the Court found that it was &#8216;conclusively proved&#8217; that SJ had been &#8216;abducted by her Father&#8217; outside of Poland, and the search for her continued.  The Father said that he decided that having taken SJ to Algeria that he would not return her to the Mother.  He contends that SJ told him a variety of allegations about her home life in Poland which led him to conclude that it would be unsafe to return her.  Having listened to him, I find him to be an entirely unreliable chronicler of the history of this case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">In April 2016 there was produced a document dated 7 April 2016 which is signed by the Mother purporting to be in agreement between her and the Father, the objective of which is to secure the return of SJ to her Mother in Poland. There are a number of terms identified as &#8216;pre-requisites&#8217;. I find it difficult to follow the Father&#8217;s explanation as to how this document came into existence.  I am bound to say that I first understood him to be suggesting that it was a fabrication of the Mother&#8217;s alone.  However, during his evidence, he said that a number of those &#8216;pre-requisites&#8217; had been suggested by him.  He remained insistent that the Mother stole 63,000 Euros from him (recorded at paragraph 8 of the document).  He told me that the University fees that she had borrowed should be repaid to him and indeed that is in the agreement too.  He told me that he suggested a provision that he was not to be required to leave any travel documents concerning him with the Mother and that he had also suggested that all of SJ&#8217;s travel documents should remain with him and that he would bring them to the Mother should the Mother request them in Poland.  Finally, he said that the term at paragraph 7 about SJ moving to the UK (not Algeria) upon completion of her primary education he says was suggested by the Mother&#8217;s sister. Also included was the specific provision that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it is not up to the child or the Mother,  as SJ&#8217;s removal was wrongful and should not be done again&#8221;</span>.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The phrase &#8216;in principle&#8217; is one that has been used by the Father extensively throughout this litigation.  I have no doubt that he agreed to this recital and that it is accurate.  Accordingly, only a matter of 10 weeks ago the Father was certainly contemplating the return of the child and in May 2016, I am satisfied, acknowledged in principle that she should be with her Mother.  That is nothing like the position I hear today. The Father has been extremely critical of the Mother and of what he now regards as her un-Islamic lifestyle, which he has described as &#8220;debauched&#8221;.  He has been dismissive of her care of their daughter and of her choice of partner.  He plainly does not consider it appropriate for SJ to be brought up where her Mother lives with a Christian man.  I should perhaps add here that the Mother converted to Islam to marry the Father.  As I am delivering this judgment the Father interjects that SJ accused the Mother&#8217;s partner of abuse.  Whether on the Father&#8217;s own account, i.e. having wrongly retained SJ in Algeria or on the Mother&#8217;s account that he abducted his daughter, it is plain that the Father is in breach of both the Orders of the Polish and of the English Courts. Indeed, just as the Mother conceded that the way in which took SJ to Poland was wrong, the Father, in his evidence, made a similar concession that his retention of SJ in Algeria was in defiance of the Order.</p>

The Mother urges me to exercise the jurisdiction of this Court in effect to secure the enforcement of its own Order by directing that the Father cause the return of SJ to Poland either by his family or by her travelling alone as an unaccompanied minor. To make this realistically achievable, it is further contended that it would be absolutely essential to prevent the Father from leaving England.  This would achieve leverage to ensure compliance.  </p>

There are three main reasons for caution when deciding whether to exercise the jurisdiction: first, that to do so may conflict with the jurisdictional scheme applicable between the countries in question; second, that it may result in conflicting decisions in those two countries; and third, that it may result in unenforceable orders. It is, to say the least, arguable that none of those objections has much force in this case: there is no applicable treaty between the UK and Pakistan; it is highly unlikely that the courts in Pakistan would entertain an application from the appellant; and it is possible that there are steps which an English court could take to persuade the respondent to obey the order.</span></p>

The Court charged with the responsibility to resolve the present parental dispute must clearly be the Polish Court, where the child is habitually resident (as this court has found it to be).   However, the child can only be protected at present by this Court in effect as a conduit to return the child to Poland.  The solution really lies only in the hands of this Court, both because the child has British citizenship and because the Father is in breach of the Order of this Court.

Such an order is made either under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 5</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref> or pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction. Another example is where a foreign parent who might be disposed to misuse a period of contact in England in order to remove a child overseas is ordered in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction to surrender his passport".</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">It would be in my judgment a wholly appropriate use of this power to prevent the Father returning to a country which is not a contracting state of the Hague Convention and which is also not an EU member state because were he to return there he would effectively prevent the enforcement of the order of this court and the order of the Polish Court.  As Mr Hames suggests, it would allow him both to escape the consequences of the abduction (or wrongful retention) as well as to escape any punishment for contempt of the Orders of this Court.  From his perspective as the matter lies entirely in the father&#8217;s hands, it may only be a limited inhibition of his freedom as it would immediately fall away on SJ&#8217;s return.  Looking at the wider picture the Father has UK citizenship, he is habitually resident here, living in his own well settled accommodation.  </p>
