They entered into a relationship in 1991 which has endured unbroken to date. From 1991 to 1996 they lived in the USA but moved in 1996 to Managua, Nicaragua. T took up employment there with an international development agency. It was their joint aspiration to parent children and, whilst living in Managua, they decided to explore the route of adoption. At this point two further people enter into the story.</p>

C was the child of a member of M&#8217;s extended family who wished to place C for adoption within the family. M and T decided that they would adopt both children and bring them up together in a family unit. All the necessary formalities were undertaken in Nicaragua and the adoptions were approved.</p>

In the end the arrangement was that T would adopt J and M would adopt C and that arrangement was confirmed by the orders of the competent court in Nicaragua. The children were placed and all four lived together as a family. Although C was adopted in 2001, she had been living with M since 1999 when she was then some five weeks old.</p>

The details of that move are immaterial to this case other than to say that it was entirely lawful. Once here, M changed C&#8217;s surname by deed poll to a hyphenated combination of the surnames of M and T. Moreover all parties now have UK nationality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unhappily M and T had not been prepared for the fact that J&#8217;s experience before placement had left her with an attachment disorder. That manifested itself in particular in a very difficult relationship between J and M. M and T sought appropriate professional help for the issue but it is the fact that the relationship between J and M was such that T and M feared for the stability of the family. In 2004 T and M decided to live in separate homes albeit within easy walking distance. J continued to live with T whilst C divided her time between T and M. That arrangement has persisted to the present time. Although C spends longer with M than with T each week, the arrangement can and should be described as shared care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M and T see each other pretty well on a daily basis, the family often have time together at weekends and in particular they take holidays together. The tension between J and M has eased and C seems unaffected by that relationship enjoying, as she does, excellent relations with T and J as well as with M. In fact C had not appreciated that she was in a different legal relationship as between M and T nor that J was not legally her sister. Thus it is that M and T decided on this application so that they could enjoy an equal status in respect of C as they had always intended and as was anyway the reality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application is formulated on the basis of being an application by a couple, M being the mother of C and consenting to that application, no other consents being required.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the heart of that issue is the question as to whether or not this court should recognise the adoption order in Nicaragua; if so, then M will indeed be the mother (and only legal parent) of C whereas, if not, the legal mother will be the biological mother who (as it happens) has since left Nicaragua. Despite the enquiries of the Nicaraguan authorities, the identity of the birth father has never been established.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.56in">A more recent example may be found in the judgment of Ryder J in D -v- D (FOREIGN ADOPTION) [2008] 1FLR1475. The key questions seem to be: first, was the adoption order obtained wholly lawfully in the foreign jurisdiction; secondly, if it was, did the concept of adoption in that jurisdiction substantially conform to the English concept; and thirdly, if so, is there any public policy consideration that should mitigate against recognition?</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first question is clear enough and has to be determined on the individual facts of each case. The second question relates to the concept of adoption for the word itself can bear many shades of meaning from the idea of complete substitution of adopted family for natural family at one end of the spectrum through to an idea much more closely akin to our concept of Special Guardianship. Clearly the English court should not be recognising (and thus giving effect to) a foreign adoption unless what was conferred by that order is substantially the same as would be conferred by an English order. The third question relates to matters that would be repugnant to our jurisdiction as, for example, if what in reality was involved was the buying and selling of children irrespective of their actual welfare needs.</p>

First, she satisfies me that this adoption was obtained fully in compliance with the laws and procedure of Nicaragua; the order was and remains valid in that jurisdiction. Secondly, she satisfies me that the Nicaraguan concept of adoption is broadly in accord with that of England and Wales; in particular the effect of the order in Nicaragua is to achieve the complete substitution of M as the legal parent for the biological parents who retain no remaining rights.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment there is no public policy consideration in this case, that should mitigate against recognition. Accordingly I propose to recognise the validity and effect of the Nicaraguan adoption order made in respect of C in favour of M. I therefore declare that under the law of England and Wales that M is the mother (and only legal parent) of C.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.56in">Clearly the crucial words are &#8220;living as partners in an enduring family relationship.&#8221; These words are no doubt chosen so as not to require the residence of both in the same property. That is not surprising as historically many a parent has had to work abroad whilst the family remained at home without in anyway imperilling an enduring family relationship. Nor is that unusual today with people having to move jobs often at short notice. What is required is: first, an unambiguous intention to create and maintain family life, and secondly, a factual matrix consistent with that intention. That is clearly a question of fact and degree in each case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Here the parties live in a committed and exclusive relationship recognised by our family law and spend significant time as a unit of four. The background to the case and the shared care arrangement is entirely consistent with the concept of a family of four. In my judgment, the parties in this case bring themselves within the ambit of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/144" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 144</ref> (b) and thus <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/50" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 50</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. They are thus entitled to make a joint application to adopt C.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further matter which needs to be considered arises from Section 42. It is not immediately clear to me whether Section 42 (2) or (3) applies to this case. If Section 42 (2) applies, no difficulty arises. If Section 42 (3) applies, no difficulty arises over time provided C has had her home with the applicants &#8220;at all times&#8221; during the relevant period. It is true that in RE CSC(an infant) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1960] 1 WLR 304" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1960">[1960] 1 WLR 304</ref>, a fairly strict approach is taken (but this again is a question of fact). I am satisfied on careful consideration that all formal and procedural requirements in this case have been met. Thus the order may be made if the welfare of C so requires.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have read with care the Annex A report from the local authority and the report from the Guardian. I have considered with care the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. I have had regard to the lifelong perspective required in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1 (2)</ref> and the detailed matters in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1 (4)</ref>. It is unnecessary to go through each in turn though some specific observations should be made. There is no doubt that C wants very much the order to be made; she wishes T to have the same status in her life as does M and she wishes legally to be J&#8217;s sister. She has of course, lived with T as well as M since she was 5 weeks old. Because this was a placement in the extended family, she remains in touch with relatives. They all support the making of the order. It should be added that the making of the order will make C a beneficiary under certain trusts that exist in T&#8217;s family and that benefit is likely to be materially significant. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When one draws all these matters together, I am satisfied that the welfare of C requires the making of an adoption order in favour of T and M. I have found that M is the mother of C and consents to this application. I have satisfied myself that all the procedural requirements have been met. In these circumstances the law requires that the order sought should be made and that I now do. In my judgment a transcript of this judgment should be obtained at the joint and equal expense of the applicants on the one hand and the guardian on the other.</p>
