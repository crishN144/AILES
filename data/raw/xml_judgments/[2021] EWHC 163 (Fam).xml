	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This is an application concerning Danny Godfrey. He is a little boy who was born on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2021. Danny is presently an inpatient in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit which falls under the aegis of the University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust. It is the Trust who makes this application, pursuant to the inherent jurisdictional powers of the High Court. They seek a declaration that it is lawful and in Danny&#8217;s best interests to discontinue mechanical ventilation. The likely consequence of this will be to bring Danny&#8217;s life to an end. </p>

For reasons, which I will come to in a moment, Mr Ozzy Godfrey, Danny&#8217;s putative father does not have &#8216;parental responsibility&#8217; and has not been registered on the birth certificate. Though Mr Godfrey and his father attended to register the birth, there were technical reasons why he was not identified as the father. I will return to this issue below.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Danny&#8217;s mother was Danielle Jones, she was born in March 2002. At 18 years of age she gave birth to her son Danny. Danielle was living at home with her parents. She had been in a relationship, of some duration, with her boyfriend, Mr Ozzy Godfrey, who is also 18 years of age. When Danielle became pregnant she did not tell anybody about her pregnancy. As Miss Gollop QC, who appears on behalf of the Trust has impressed upon me, it was not only her parents that Danielle did not tell. She did not tell her boyfriend. She did not tell any of the healthcare professionals and she did not avail herself of any ante-natal treatment. This was a completely concealed pregnancy. </p>

An ambulance was called, and the paramedics quickly discovered that she was pregnant. The critical care team had no options open to them other than to commence CPR on arrival, and to perform a caesarean section. It is calculated that there was a period of around half an hour (minimum) between Danielle&#8217;s collapse and the arrival of the critical care team. Her baby, Danny, was delivered at 12:20, in a pale, floppy and unresponsive condition. He was immediately given oxygen, and although it is difficult to be accurate, on arrival at hospital in due course, his gestational age was estimated at approximately 36 weeks, just 2 weeks short of fullterm. Tragically, Danielle died before she reached the hospital.  </p>

I have heard this morning, from the Consultant in Neonatal medicine at the hospital where Danny is being treated (Dr A). Dr A is one of five Consultant Neonatologists who has been concerned with Danny&#8217;s care. He has prepared a statement which sets out the treatment that Danny has been receiving and in which he evaluates Danny&#8217;s prognosis and future welfare needs.  </p>

It was immediately obvious, upon delivery, that Danny&#8217;s wellbeing had been significantly compromised. He was given breathing support by the critical care team, initially by facemask, but very quickly upgraded to the insertion of an endo-tracheal tube. With the support of that tube, it was possible to ventilate Danny and to provide him with oxygen. He was taken to the hospital, and an initial blood-gas test showed a very high level of acid in the blood. In simple terms, that was a powerful indicator that the supply of oxygen to his brain had been significantly compromised. His physical presentation, his floppiness and lack of any response at all, coupled with the blood-gas readings, indicated to the doctors that he had suffered what is termed an hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) i.e. deprivation of blood, oxygen and brain swelling. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Danny was quickly transferred to intensive care for support and to undergo therapeutic hypothermia (TH) treatment. I was told that this is now recognised treatment for any infants presenting with HIE. It consists of reducing the infant&#8217;s core temperature, very significantly, to 33.5 degrees C. This is undertaken to provide a block to evolving brain injury. At the same time, Danny was receiving mechanical ventilation; he had a central venous and arterial catheter inserted; he received antibiotic treatment and intravenous fluid support. His brain activity was assessed regularly by ongoing clinical examination reinforced by cerebral functioning monitoring (CFM), which consists of single channel EEG and amplitude integrated EEG traces. </p>

He has displayed no evidence at all, of any interaction or consciousness. He has revealed no heart variability in response to any kind of stimulus. It has been ascertained that he does not have a gag reflex. He displays extended posture and presence of clonus at the right ankle i.e. involuntary muscle contractions. His pupils have not responded to light, and he has demonstrated no normal movements, although there have been some infrequent clonic movements which are indicative of seizure activity.  </p>

The MRI scan was reviewed by a specialist Consultant Paediatric Neuroradiologist. Those scans revealed what are described as &#8220;widespread restricted diffusion, affecting deep grey structures, cortex, hippocampi and vermis&#8221;. These are all different areas of the brain that process functioning and responses e.g. memory, posture, movement etc. What was also noticed was &#8220;a loss of white and grey differentiation involving the deep grey structures&#8221;. In simple terms, what that indicated was a near-total deprivation of blood and oxygen. Although it was not possible to be conclusive, the neuroradiologist also saw some abnormal features within the brain stem. That is a very serious neurological sign. It suggests that not only was the deprivation of oxygen and blood near-total, but that it was also prolonged.  </p>

The structural injury to his brain is static; there is no further treatment that can be given that will reduce the severity of his injury. He is dependent on mechanical ventilation through endotracheal tube and has shown no sign of consciousness or any meaningful neurological activity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dignity can be an elusive concept, at least when one discusses it in the artificiality of  the court room. But in the hospital, in paediatric intensive care, in particular, it is far more tangible and much easier to capture. As I have observed now, in a number of cases, one of the advantages of &#8220;sitting remotely&#8221; via video conferencing platforms, is that it is possible for the judge to meet with patients and families in circumstances which seem a long way from the formality of a court room. In the course of the pandemic  I have found myself in people&#8217;s kitchens, living rooms, in care homes and by hospital beds. This unanticipated advantage has permitted greater access to the court. Today, it has enabled me to visit Danny in the hospital. I met his nurse, I met with his grandparents and I was able to see him in his intensive care bed. He was </p>

The family visit daily, often for long periods and they participate in Danny&#8217;s practical care. He is surrounded by toys. There was a large Winnie the Pooh, there is a monkey, there is a small traditional teddy bear with a big bow. Most movingly, there is a white fluffy bear which belonged to Danny&#8217;s mother. It looked almost new, and it brought home to me, with powerful force, how very young his mum was when she died. </p>

It is provided by a charity called Cots for Tots. There are two per family. The mini boo are exchanged between family and baby intending to communicate their respective scent or smell and to reassure each. It is not clear whether Danny has the capacity to enjoy these. Many of those who work with  very seriously unwell infants have told me that they believe that notwithstanding enormous damage to the brain, they see some surviving kinaesthetic connection or bond between family, parent and child, which appears to endure and perhaps goes beyond medical understanding. As the family are listening to this ex tempore judgment, I pass this on in the hope that it offers some consolation.  In any event, what was utterly clear to me, is that Danny, in his present circumstances, in the most tragic of situations, is nonetheless suffused by the love of his family on both sides. Their grief and their distress has not inhibited them from communicating their love to their grandson and son. It is easy to see that they have preserved and guarded his dignity.  </p>

It may be that on withdrawal from the ventilator breathing may recover spontaneously. This would have no impact on the functioning of the brain, nor would it render further active treatment any less futile. It would permit of no pleasure or interaction or engagement of any kind. He would be at risk of suffering, perhaps due to aspiration, but also in consequence of a range of invasive interventions that might be required even palliatively.  </p>

All have concluded that the prognosis is bleak with a very high likelihood of death, and an inevitability of profound disability to the degree that it would be impossible for him to derive benefit from continued life.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>The current clinical plan is to provide ongoing mechanical ventilation, intravenous hydration, treat seizures and to prevent any discomfort for Danny. It follows but, needs to be said in these extremely difficult times, that Danny has a need for privacy. And for his family to be around him. The hospital has been able to facilitate this. If Danny somehow manages to breath independently, following the withdrawal of ventilatory support, milk feeds will then be provided on an ongoing basis, accompanied by pain relief. Danny&#8217;s best interests will continue to be reviewed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As Dr A identified in his evidence, until the ventilator is actually disconnected, it is impossible to be sure what the response will be. It may be that Danny will die very quickly, but it is possible that he may sustain independent breathing. This is a traumatic dilemma for his family. As Dr A recognised, there are circumstances, where a brain has been profoundly compromised but can sometimes reorganise its function so that different parts of the brain take on duties that might not otherwise have been required from them. It might be possible, Dr A tells me, for Danny to survive even as long as 12 months, though he was not of the view that this was very likely. If he were to survive after the withdrawal of ventilatory support, Dr A considered carefully the question of whether nutrition and hydration would be appropriate at all. As he discussed this issue, it was plain to me that he found it to be a very difficult and delicately balanced one. Nutrition and hydration constitute &#8216;treatment&#8217;. Dr A&#8217;s conclusion is that Danny cannot benefit from active treatment. It is not obviously logical therefore, to continue nutrition and hydration in circumstances which are a form of active treatment. Dr A recognised this as a paradox. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dr A frankly acknowledged that he found this aspect of the care plan to be extremely difficult. However, ultimately, he came to the conclusion that the continuation of nutrition and hydration, whilst it might prolong Danny&#8217;s death, had the countervailing impact of preserving his dignity. One option opened by this potential outcome is that it might conceivably be possible for Danny to go home to his family. Freed from the ventilator, less awkward and greater spontaneity of interaction becomes a possibility. It may only mean that Danny can die at home, in privacy and in the arms of his family.  That is no small consideration, provided that it is driven by Danny&#8217;s needs alone. Whilst I too find this a delicate balance, I consider that the family and the treating clinicians have thought long and anxiously about it. I am persuaded that the care plan as drafted reflects Danny&#8217;s best interests. </p>
