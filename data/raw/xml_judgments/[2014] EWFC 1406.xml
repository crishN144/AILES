	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have been hearing applications by the Queen&#8217;s Proctor to dismiss a large number of divorce petitions and also, in many of the cases, to set aside decrees of divorce (some nisi, some absolute) obtained in consequence of what can only be described as a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice on an almost industrial scale. At the outset of the final hearing on 9 April 2014 &#8211; the hearing was in open court &#8211; an important question arose in relation to the possible impact on the reporting of the proceedings of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/61" uk:canonical="1926 (16 &amp; 17 Geo. 5) c. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Act 1926</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/61" uk:canonical="1926 (16 &amp; 17 Geo. 5) c. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1926 Act</ref>).

The consequence, inevitable if unintended (for many affected to believe that the shame and humiliation of having to endure a hearing in public would deter the bringing of divorce suits, and some even to be astonished by what the evidence in such cases revealed of behaviour in the bedroom), was a torrent of salacious newspaper reporting. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The point is made by counsel for the Attorney-General that this is a statute which is mandatory in effect; it does contain a criminal sanction and therefore must be construed restrictively. No point arises, as I have already said, as to the merits of any reporting of details likely to be made public in the course of the evidence. It is merely a question as to how that will be achieved.</p>

For that reason the question has been raised at the outset of these proceedings. However, it seems to me that the court simply cannot construe the statute in a way which is contrary to the language of the statute itself. I have to rule that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/61" uk:canonical="1926 (16 &amp; 17 Geo. 5) c. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Act 1926</ref> does apply to these proceedings. The Attorney-General has through counsel indicated that he would not be very anxious to institute criminal proceedings if by some oversight there was a breach of the strict letter of the law. That is not a matter which is before me, but it seems to me that until or unless Parliament were to intervene <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/61" uk:canonical="1926 (16 &amp; 17 Geo. 5) c. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> does apply in this instance.&#8221;</p>
