He is a dual British and Russian citizen who has spent just under a year of his life in Russia and the remainder in England.  His parents' short marriage broke down in April 2014 and since June 2014 his time has been divided equally between them in consequence of a series of court decisions.  His father now seeks a child arrangements order under which Daniel would live with him or at any rate continue to be cared for by both parents in England.  His mother seeks permission to relocate with him to live in Moscow, her native city and Daniel&#8217;s birthplace, with contact with the father occurring in England and in Russia.  </span></p>

If it is refused, his mother will have to remain here, and he will experience a predominantly English upbringing.</span></p>

It is important to remember that it is brought about by the choice of the parties concerned. It is necessary to recognise that transnational parenting brings a very high price to either or both in the event of a relationship breaking up. It is a fact, certainly in my experience, that the impact upon breaking up is devastating upon one parent or the other and sometimes both. But a system of private law in which responsibility is very firmly placed with parents &#8211; and the court interferes really only at their request &#8211; depends upon the court assuming that parties that go into transnational parenting agreements go in with their eyes wide open, fully alert to the consequences of it going wrong. Of course that is a somewhat artificial assumption, but it is one necessary to be made if transnational parenting is to be accommodated within the philosophy of Parts I and II of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Accordingly, the undoubted grave impact on parents will really only weigh with the court if and insofar as that impact has its effect on the child with whom the court is concerned.</p>

In my judgment, these cases establish the following propositions. First, that the child's welfare remains the court's paramount consideration as prescribed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Secondly, in discharging the obligation to make the child's welfare paramount, the court is to have regard to the checklist applicable in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>. Thirdly, in furtherance to the views of Black LJ in <span class="Emphasis">K v K (Relocation: Shared Care Arrangement)</span> and Munby LJ in <span class="Emphasis">Re F (Relocation)</span>, the court should not categorise cases in accordance with the concepts of primary or shared care, but should use the facts of the case and the answers arrived at in consideration of the checklist to describe the arrangements for care on the ground as they have been, as they are at date of the hearing and as the parties intended them to remain had it not been for the question of relocation.</p>

An assessment of parental capacity and the effect of a change of circumstances inevitably looms large.

The flashpoint seems to have been when the father returned Daniel and started to plead with the mother to return to live with him and to say that he would take Daniel away from her, despite her making it clear that she did not want to have a conversation of that kind.  She then struck out at him, making contact about four times.  None of these were enough to cause injury, but it was a nasty scene.  The police were called by members of the public.

However, there is no history of behaviour of this kind in the mother's past.  Ms Leifer considers that anger is a feature rather than a prevalent problem.  I agree.  I find that the mother has become increasingly exasperated in the context of her relationship with the father and at times lost control of herself.

In the short term, both parents have broadly equal capacity to meet Daniel's needs.  However, my assessment is that there is a distinct difference between them in terms of their capacity to meet his longer term needs.  Having reflected on the history, and observed each parent giving evidence, I find that the mother is very much the more dynamic, energetic and insightful individual.  This is seen from her career progression and social network.  The fact that she was in command of Daniel's arrangements for the first two years of his life is not entirely due to geography, but also to the fact that she is the more competent and dependable individual.  Her outbursts of anger, which she charitably characterises as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">"emotion</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">", have been born of frustration at the father&#8217;s relative passivity, no doubt partly arising from his very difficult experiences in detention.

It is to be hoped that he will succeed in this, but as stated above, I think it unlikely that he will get far when he has the alternative of staying at home with Daniel full-time or part-time.  </span></p>

She would, I find, show Daniel an example of energetic self-reliance, offering him a wider field of possibilities for his future than he would receive in the father's care or in shared care in England.  This is epitomised in a small way by the fact that she has gained a good grasp of English in a short time, to the extent that she was able to give evidence in English with little help from the interpreter, while the father has never made any effort to learn Russian, simply saying that he is not interested.  I do not draw from this the conclusion that Daniel must therefore remain in England, because English is the only language that both parents speak.  Instead, I see it as casting light on their relative qualities and abilities.</span></p>

The mother said that she would accept support from them in future but was nearly sure that they would not in fact provide it.

It does not, however, follow that there would continue to be an equal division of his time in the longer term.  Given the parenting history and the parents' personalities, that arrangement is in my view unlikely to be in his interests once he reaches school age, even if the parents by then lived close to each other.

However, I consider that he would adapt to his new circumstances.

Having come here in the mistaken belief that she and the father could make a fulfilling life together, the mother would feel trapped and isolated if she was forced to remain here for the rest of Daniel's childhood after such a short and unsuccessful attempt to live as a family.  Until the parents' separation, there was a common assumption on both sides of the family that the natural consequence of a breakdown in the relationship would be the return of the mother and Daniel to Russia.  That assumption only fell apart as a result of unexpected events in June that reversed the established pattern.  To require the mother to remain in England for at least the next 15 years would leave her with a justifiable sense of bitterness that is not in Daniel's interests.  </span></p>

In the longer term, however, I consider that the father would reassess his situation.  If he is to be in a position to set an example for Daniel and even to support him financially, he needs to regain control over his life and maximise his chances of rebuilding his situation, in particular by getting a job.  This is not likely to happen if he is relying on Daniel to give meaning to his life, when it is Daniel who should be relying on him.     </span></p>

I therefore return to the evidence of Ms Leifer.  In circumstances where a professional witness has been selected by the parties it is unfortunate that she should face criticism from both sides.  Nonetheless, I myself had significant reservations about Ms Leifer's assessment, despite the careful and sympathetic approach that she has taken.  My concern arises to a significant extent from her unfamiliarity with relocation cases.  Her assessment seems to have been heavily influenced by a perception, shared by the father and his family, that Russia would be a difficult and even dangerous place for Daniel to grow up in, and that if he lived there, he would move beyond their reach.  Moreover, and leaving aside the international dimensions, I found that Ms Leifer&#8217;s investigation did not illuminate or draw appropriate conclusions from the past parenting history, the parents&#8217; very different qualities and abilities, and the consequences of all that for Daniel&#8217;s future.  I am also unconvinced by her ready optimism that the mother's practical difficulties in England would be resolved and that a rapprochement between the mother and the father and the father's family would be likely.  I further and centrally consider that Ms Leifer has focused unduly upon Daniel's &#8216;here and now&#8217;, prioritising the preservation of something recently achieved, rather than considering the significance of the past arrangements and looking at the realistic prospects for his long term future.</span></p>

His mother will resume her role as his primary carer and will be able to return to her own country.
