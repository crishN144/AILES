	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the fact finding judgment in this public law proceedings concerning three infants who are each the subject of care proceedings brought by Stockport MBC; L J and K. Although there are three infants of two separate but related families the principal facts which this court is being asked to find concern the brain injuries sustained by L (born on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014; the son of AM and DT) which led to his admission to hospital on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2015. Fortunately, although L needed surgical intervention shortly after his admission he is recovering well and has been released from hospital and was placed in the care of his mother&#8217;s step-mother who is caring for him and his younger sister K, born on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015 after the original care proceedings began and now the subject of care proceedings herself. The third subject baby is J (born in June 2015; the daughter of SM and LS interveners in the case of L &amp; K). Following agreed arrangement with the local authority she has remained at home with her mother and father.</p>

The welfare decisions in respect of L and K will be dealt with in a separate judgment along with other case management issues that have arisen in the currency of these proceedings. It is abundantly clear that the local authority and the parties must be given time to assimilate the decision of the court in order to put in place the best possible care plans for these two very young children. Indeed the social worker makes allusion in her written evidence to the difficulty that she found herself in in trying to plan before the court had made its decision for this is a case where there was no evidence of other indicators of abuse or neglect in respect of L, a fact referred to by the expert witnesses and others. </p>

LS was present for some of the time that L was in SM&#8217;s care. Shortly after his admission to hospital on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2015 concerns were raised by the medical staff that the bleeding seen in L&#8217;s brain and eyes came about as the result of an inflicted injury, in the absence of any infection or an explanation of an accidental injury or injuries. L, a baby of less than three months, was observed to have a bruise on his cheek. Child protection agencies were alerted and there was a police investigation.</p>

Although they did not suggest that anyone had ever maliciously or deliberately inflicted an injury on the baby it was evident from the outset of the proceedings as they had not reported a collapse of the baby (prior to his admission to hospital after his parent&#8217;s had taken him to an out of hours GP service) that the questions raised on behalf of AM and DT pointed towards a pool of possible perpetrators included those who had cared for L in the two weeks prior to his admission. Indeed as the medical evidence of chronic as well as acute haemorrhages, the lack of evidence from AM and DT about the baby when and how L became ill and the absence of other injuries such as an impact injury, neglect or previous physical injuries led to the difficulties the expert witnesses had in narrowing the timing of a possible insult to the brain. In these circumstances it was obvious from the way the case was put on behalf of AM and DT that the possible perpetrators included two children and a vulnerable young woman with learning difficulties; who by the time this trial started was due to give birth herself in a matter of days and did indeed have her baby during the trial.</p>

Dr S reported that certainly young babies can scratch themselves but that she did not expect a bruise to be self-inflicted at this age; therefore she thought it was most likely to be a non-accidental injury. She noted the bruise seen on L&#8217;s left cheek about the time of his eight week check and that it was unlikely to be self-inflicted and raised a concern about a possible non-accidental injury having happened at an earlier date. Dr S was of the opinion, in the absence of any other external injury to the head, or history of a significant traumatic event, shaking had inflicted the subdural haemorrhages.</p>

She said (as was repeated by the expert witnesses in their reports and evidence) that subdural bleeding is caused by trauma and that rotational forces such as those generated by shaking with or without impact are significant factors in generating subdural bleeding. She noted that there was no history of a traumatic event and that the majority of children found to have non-accidental or inflicted injury also have retinal haemorrhaging. The fresh blood seen on the scan and on being aspirated along with and fresh blood being found in the lumber puncture fluid at SH meant that the neurosurgeons were of the opinion that bleeding around L&#8217;s brain had occurred within the last seven days.</p>

The history reported by the family sounded as if L had developed symptoms on the evening of New Year&#8217;s Day as after that he was reported to have been crying excessively, not feeding and vomiting. It was difficult to precisely time events but evidence suggests that after subdural haemorrhage due to shaking babies do not act normally, therefore it was most likely that the event occurred close to presentation; however, it was possible it could have happened a few days previously.  </p>

The meeting involved a discussion with a consultant Neuroradiologist and other radiology consultants; having looked at the MRI scans the general consensus was that the appearances could all be due to a single recent event but, on balance, it was felt that there had been more than one event i.e. a recent event and an older event. The main reason being the presence of septations or membranes which form within areas of subdural bleeding once they have been present for some time and the blood products break down. Septations suggested chronic subdural which means bleeding that happened more than two weeks prior to scanning</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore in conclusion, Dr S reported, as L presented with subdural haemorrhage, retinal haemorrhage and facial bruising and the clinicians concerned had not found any evidence of any medical condition that would pre-dispose him to such injuries, and, in the absence of a history being given of any serious accident these are likely to be non-accidental injuries inflicted by one of his carers. There was definitely an episode of trauma close to the time of presentation at SHH. On reviewing all the evidence it was possible there was just one episode of trauma but on balance it is more likely that there was more than one episode with one close in time to presentation and another several weeks earlier. The report also confirmed that the blood tests were normal and there was nothing noted which would account for L&#8217;s injuries and that the later skeletal survey removed concern about the femur. Dr S thought that the good progress that L was making indicated that his prognosis was good as were the prospects for a full recovery.</p>

AM&#8217;s mother moved several times when AM lived with her as a child; her mother was involved in more than one abusive relationship and abused drugs and alcohol. AM spent many weekends with her maternal or paternal grandparents. She was sexually abused when she was about 5 years of age by the older son of one of her mother&#8217;s partners. In 2000/1 her family returned to England from Wales and they did not move round for a period, but AM&#8217;s mother continued to abuse alcohol, and she had difficulties in managing her son&#8217;s behaviour resulting in local authority intervention. AM&#8217;s behaviour in school deteriorated and she was sent to live with an uncle in S-shire until she began truanting. She was sent back to S in 2009, aged14. Her relationship with her mother was strained and she lived with her maternal grandfather&#8217;s wife (her step-grandmother). </p>

She was given alcohol and drugs, including ecstasy, cocaine, and cannabis and sexually exploited and abused along with other young girls. To her credit she had the courage to co-operate with the police in 2013 and a criminal trial took place against 5 men, arising out of a major police child sex exploitation operation, three of whom were convicted of a variety of sexual offences including rape. It would seem from AM&#8217;s own evidence that she had little support from her mother and she told me she was angry with her until quite recently. AM looked to her mother and the rest of the family for support after she had had her baby L. Since she has separated from DT she has lived with her mother and her younger half-siblings.</p>

DT&#8217;s mother abused alcohol and after her third husband committed suicide her abuse of alcohol intensified.

It is his own evidence that by thirteen he had started using cannabis and that he continued to do so regularly. DT had also used cocaine on occasion and at times drank alcohol. It is cannabis that is his drug of choice and he told the court that he smoked it daily and that his use of it escalated after his mother died. He believes it has affected his memory by causing memory loss, and has affected his speech causing him to mumble and slur his words.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From E&#8217;s ABE interview and from her later video-recorded questioning by counsel E described sitting on the sofa with L and handling him by cradling him in her arms and then lifting him up to give to her sister R who was standing in front of her. She demonstrated holding him facing out towards R. She showed that she had held him by holding his body under his arms and demonstrated that she had not handed him straight to her sister but had moved him in a curving motion to her sister. She said that his arms moved about but that his head had not; indeed her description of the way she held the baby mirrors very closely the picture that was taken in the restaurant, by his mother, some few hours previously.</p>

In her ABE interview with the police which took place on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2015 the movement that she physically demonstrated was not forceful and covered a very short distance to her sister standing in front of her. At the time she was nine years old and R was thirteen. Dr Cartlidge the consultant paediatrician instructed to provide this court with a paediatric overview in his report dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2014 described the incident as follows (after watching the ABE interview) &#8220; <span style="font-style:italic">During a brief period of reduced supervision, [E] lifted [L] into the air like a rocket. In my opinion this event did not cause the intracranial injuries for the following reasons: - there was no history of an accident at this time:-[L] had no adverse symptoms and yet he would have been unwell immediately after the event that caused the subdural bleeding and retinal haemorrhages.&#8221;  </span></p>

She said that L himself was happy and laughing when she did it. R told her mother what E had done when she returned to the living room very shortly afterwards. SM&#8217;s evidence is that she was not worried about L as he seemed fine at the time, but that she had told E not to do it. She said that the girls liked to tell tales on each other and that she was in no doubt that if E had done anything really harmful to the baby R would have exaggerated or dramatized the event. L was fine, she had watched him all evening; as he was watching the Christmas lights.</p>

SM was  (and is) an experienced mother and her evidence was of someone who is confident in caring for a very young baby. She described L as being wakeful during the night; he did not cry or seem distressed but was vocal making &#8220;baby noises&#8221; and this, in turn, kept her awake as she was aware of his presence and that he would need feeding at some point so she took him in bed with her and fed him during the night; L was well and fed without difficulty. </p>

Thirdly, he said a mixture of both is possible, that is that the fluid was a mixture of acute traumatic effusion and chronic subdural haematoma. If the fluid was chronic subdural haematoma with membrane formation some of the fresh subdural blood could have formed as a result of a spontaneous re-bleed, but against that proposition are two facts, re-bleeds do not normally cause encephalopathy which L had on presentation in mild form, and secondly fresh blood was seen in the posterior fossa without any of the other fluid which means that this fresh blood could not be explained by a re-bleed into a pre-existing chronic subdural haematoma, therefore, it follows that the fresh blood was caused by a recent event.</p>

The injury occurred between those two points. Mr. Richards&#8217; opinion was that whatever happened before 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December/1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January an acute event occurred on that day. The three features which suggest a recent head injury are; encephalopathy; fresh subdural bleeding; and retinal haemorrhages. The exact forces required to cause such injuries are unknown but they can be caused by a single forceful shake which would cause the movement of the head backwards and forwards, and which would be recognised by a mentally competent witness to be inappropriate handling of an infant.

The only likely explanation is that she did not want her mother to see the state of the baby. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The whole of that night AM says that L did not sleep or feed properly and the next day was the same with taking no more than a couple of ounces of milk which he then vomited up. He was sick, not feeding and asleep after being given Calpol; when not dosed with Calpol and she could give him no more he started crying and screaming as he had on the previous night. AM has not explained why she did not call for medical assistance for nearly 24 hours. I did not find AM to be a credible witness. Although it is to her credit that in the description that she eventually gave to the court she did not try to hide the changes in her child on the night of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2015, I cannot put her lies and omissions to one side as they directly concern the events in question. Her repeated response that she could not remember the events of the evening and night of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>/2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2015 can only have been as a result of avoiding the answers she should have given.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It has been submitted that DT was not the most reliable witness and a poor historian of fact, which was not surprising, given that he was constantly smoking cannabis. That must affect his ability to, as he said, remember times and dates but I gained the impression that he was trying his best to remember what had happened and he certainly did not attempt to present himself in a favourable light. He seemed, and I have no doubt that he was, regretful about not taking L to the hospital; he said so explicitly on more than one occasion during his evidence. His regret at what he has missed out with L when he was at home was heartfelt. I accept his evidence and where it differs from that of AM I prefer his except in one regard; I find that although he admitted assaulting AM in April of 2015 it is more likely that he hit her head on the sofa, rather than push it onto the sofa, and, that he did this more than once.</p>

The situation got worse when his mother died; the time he did not spend at work and he wanted to be around his friends smoking cannabis. He spent about &#163;30 everyday on cannabis. He gave AM and L very little support which he now regretted. I accept not only did he do very little child-care but that, as AM said, she often stopped him when he tried. I do not, therefore find it surprising that he accepted what she told him about the baby, including on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2015 when instead of seeking medical help they drove to her mother&#8217;s. No doubt his disengagement from mother and child was exacerbated on this as on other occasions by his smoking cannabis over several hours prior to his return home.</p>

On their return home that L began to cry, he looked the same but more tense although his eyes did not roll to the back of his head. He knew that L had not been fed since the day before. He recalled being told that the bruise to L&#8217;s cheek was as a result of L pinching himself which he accepted; he was an experienced father and had left the care of L almost entirely to AM.</p>

SM did not dissemble or avoid questions put to her, unlike AM. She is an experienced a mother of four children and that was apparent form her evidence about her own children as well as about L when she had looked after him. SM did not attempt to paint a picture of her children that was coloured by a desire to illustrate them in the best possible light. She described their sibling rivalries and the way the sisters would try to get each other in trouble in a way that would be familiar to anyone who has ever been a sibling themselves.</p>

This explanation was rejected by the expert witnesses and their opinion is confirmed by the complete lack of any ill effects on the child afterwards. He was well he had showed no signs of brain injury. I discount the fact that he slept a bit longer than usual on the afternoon of the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2014 as explicable by the change in his routine as he had been in the habit of sleeping in his mother&#8217;s bed with her; in any case he was still a very young baby and sleeping a great deal during the day is not a remarkable event in a child whose chronological age was about two months.</p>

The baby&#8217;s head falling back as he was changed was expressing discounted by Dr Cartlidge, as there would have needed to be signs of impact which there were not; and, L was fine and healthy afterwards, continuing to be so (according to his parents) until some 6 hours after he was safely delivered home.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All the experts were of the opinion that the most likely explanation for the injuries found on L were caused by someone shaking him. I have set their evidence out in detail above and I do not intend to repeat it here. Although they did not identify when the child became ill which would, in turn, identify when he was injured they, quite properly and carefully, left such findings to the court. The description given by AM and by DT in their oral evidence points disclosed the point at which L stopped being normal and became ill which was some hours after he returned home on the afternoon of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2015. Their descriptions are of a baby that was clearly unwell and displaying the symptomology of an infant who has suffered trauma to his brain. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I conclude on the basis of the evidence in this case pertaining to this child that L was shaken by his mother shortly before his father returned to their home at 10 pm on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2015. I find that AM caused the acute subdural haemorrhages and other brain injury to her son by shaking him on the evening of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2015. I do not know precisely how this happened but it is more likely than not that as she was tired and hung-over had been caring for the baby on her own for many hours had become frustrated when feeing him. This is conclusion is supported by the bruise on his cheek observed at hospital and mostly likely to be inflicted by AM when she pinched him while trying to feed him.</p>

She may have been frightened, shocked and even surprised at the effect on L but as she has offered no explanation and has sought to mislead about the events of that evening any attempted analysis of her response would be speculative. It was the evidence of both AM and DT that L was already in considerable distress (as described by DT and set out above) when he returned home. DT would not have been aware of what AM had done and she did not tell him. </p>
