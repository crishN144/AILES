The decision I make today will have profound consequences for CB and for her birth family, in particular her mother and her half-sister.  It is because of these profound consequences that this case has attracted a considerable amount of attention both in England and in Latvia.  This is because it involves the proposed adoption in England and Wales of a national of Latvia.  </span></p>

They point to the fact that, if an adoption order is made, CB&#8217;s connections with her Latvian heritage will be lost or severely diminished.  They stress CB&#8217;s right to maintain her cultural identity and her citizenship and the loss which would result from an adoption order in respect of &#8220;language, nationality, citizenship, culture and religion&#8221;.

The Guardian is of the opinion, very strongly, that CB&#8217;s placement needs to be secured by the making of an adoption order.  CB, in her opinion, needs to be confident of her place in her new family and to know that it is permanent.  The benefits of an adoption order significantly outweigh any loss to CB, including the loss of her connections with her birth family and her Latvian heritage.  </span></p>

She explained, as set out in her position statement, that the Guardian decided not to see CB again.  CB has expressed anxieties about whether her placement is secure.  The Guardian did not want to increase those anxieties by further questioning her.  She has carried out a full assessment and it did not appear to her that anything has occurred which undermines her earlier assessment.  It is, for example, clear to the Guardian from the social worker&#8217;s recent statement that CB is thriving in the prospective adopters&#8217; care. </span></p>

This is the only way in which she will feel, and be, sufficiently secure to progress and develop in a manner which is consistent with her best interests.
