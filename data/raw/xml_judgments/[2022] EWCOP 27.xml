It consists of     23 pages and has been signed and dated by the Judge. The Judge has given permission for the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition that in any report, no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name, current address or location [including school or work place]. In particular the anonymity of P and the members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court. For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and current addresses of the parties will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain.</span></p>

She was born in Iran and moved to the UK in 2002 to live with her family.  She has two sons, HS and SS, and one daughter, KS.  P suffers from Alzheimer&#8217;s dementia and a number of other physical health conditions including double incontinence.  She has a history of falls and injuries and requires support in all aspects of her care needs, with the assistance of two members of staff for any transfers.  Although she is reported to have spoken some English in the past, having grown up speaking Farsi, as a result of her dementia it appears that she has lost the ability to communicate in English.</span></p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient&#8217;s point of view.  That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail.  We cannot always have what we want.  Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient&#8217;s wishes are.  Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament.  In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that &#8216;It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless.&#8217;  But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient&#8217;s wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;</span></p>

It is agreed that there are only 3 available options before me at this point &#8211; (in no particular order) P remaining in her current placement, moving to live with KS or moving to live with SS and his family (either of which would be on a trial basis).  KS did appear to try to ask for other options to be considered in her written and oral evidence (D302 D359-D360), such as a more expensive package of care and support if P were to live with her or for P to move to Iran, but these are no more than suggestions from her and are not available options for me in this hearing.  Even if a move to Iran were to be an available option at this point, the professional evidence in this case is very clear that P is now too frail to attempt such a move and the level of disruption that it would mean for her would be bound to be extremely harmful.</span></p>

In a one-day final hearing (the time estimate having been agreed between the parties and me and with KS having the benefit of legal representation at the pre-trial review), it is not going to be possible to go into the minutiae of those allegations and all agreed that detailed fact-finding about them was not necessary or proportionate.  The Local Authority is not seeking findings about the allegations against KS.  Whatever the rights and wrongs of what happened at P&#8217;s previous care home, the relationship between KS and the care home broke down with allegations being made both ways as I have already noted in this judgment.  As a result, conditions were attached to contact arrangements between KS and P to preserve P&#8217;s placement at the previous care home whilst a replacement care home could be found.  It is also not in dispute that a previous attempt to provide P with a package of professional support at KS&#8217;s flat broke down within a week, with the agency alleging that this was because of KS&#8217;s behaviour and KS making allegations about the care agency.  </span></p>

Her experience of working with KS was that she did not have a healthy dialogue with KS because KS will not listen and either told the social worker that she was lying or wrong.  The social worker was clear that KS would not mean to cause P harm but may unintentionally cause her harm (albeit not significant harm) if she doesn&#8217;t follow professional advice, something that KS strongly disputed.  The evidence around how P was toileted in her current care home supports a finding that KS may at times fail to accept professional advice, I find.  P had been hoisted frequently to use the commode, despite this not being recommended by professionals caring for her, and despite both the OT assessor and the social worker noting that hoisting appeared to cause P distress.  It appears that the sole reason P was being hoisted was because of KS asking for this to be done, though again I would stress that this may not have been through KS intending to cause P distress or harm and probably stemmed from KS&#8217;s own belief that this was right for P.  </span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">In relation to the likelihood of a care package breaking down if P were to be placed with KS, the social worker told me that this was based on the two previous instances of care breaking down, ie once before at KS&#8217;s flat within a week and with the previous care home.  This was also something referred to in her final statement (D331).  In the evidence filed, the initial social work statement at D9 also makes clear that concerns about KS&#8217;s ability to work with professionals also arose when P was in hospital, and again KS raised safeguarding concerns about one of the hospitals concerned.  Again, regardless of the rights and wrongs of these issues, this evidence demonstrates that more often than not there is an extremely challenging and difficult relationship between KS and professionals providing care for P with allegations being made of inappropriate behaviour on both sides.  Frequently behavioural contracts have had to be put in place to manage this (D9 again).  In my view, KS is extremely protective of P and probably genuinely believes she is simply trying to get the best for P (something that the social work evidence acknowledges), but it seems clear to me that KS at times may have had unrealistic expectations of what could be provided during Covid restrictions and what is reasonable to expect of carers.  This would be bound to lead to friction on both sides and, since I can see no evidence of KS demonstrating any understanding or acceptance that she may need to do things differently in future in P&#8217;s best interests, I find that there is a high risk of difficulties arising with any care agency providing care in KS&#8217;s flat as the social worker told me.  In fact, in KS&#8217;s oral evidence when asked about P being hoisted for toileting, her response was to deny that she had asked for this, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  KS&#8217;s response to this is something that corroborates the social worker&#8217;s description of KS simply accusing her of lying or being wrong.  As the social worker told me, if P were to be living in KS&#8217;s flat where KS had greater control, this would add to concerns about the extent to which KS would be able to take on board professional advice and allow the carers to care for P in accordance with that advice rather than KS&#8217;s requirements for P&#8217;s care, I find.</span></p>

The sole distinctions that the allocated social worker draws between the options are that, in her opinion, there is a risk of the care package breaking down if P were placed in KS&#8217;s flat, and only the option of her current placement would allow P to see her family as freely as is in P&#8217;s best interests (D325).</span></p>

Both KS&#8217;s flat or SS&#8217;s house would mean that P could only have a bed wash as opposed to a full body wash in a bath or shower.  In terms of KS&#8217;s flat, there were accessibility concerns which would mean that P could only leave the flat in an emergency, whereas at SS&#8217;s house she would be able to go into the garden and would be able to go out into the wider community once a ramp was fitted.  At KS&#8217;s flat P would have to use the lounge as her bedroom, but at SS&#8217;s house she would have her own bedroom.  There were no identified OT reasons for excluding either option or preferring either option in the assessment, but in her oral evidence to me the OT assessor did note that being able to access the garden and being able to see as much of her family as possible would be bound to improve P&#8217;s quality of life, and that it would be better for P to use pads rather than be frequently hoisted for toileting as this clearly caused P distress.  She did note that many people lived in situations where they could not leave the premises save in an emergency, so this was not in itself a reason to rule out KS&#8217;s flat.</span></p>

In turn, this means that a placement with KS would mean no access to the wider community for P as the social worker has noted.  Lack of space in KS&#8217;s flat would also mean that the main lounge in the flat would have to function as P&#8217;s bedroom, in turn preventing KS from using this space for entertaining any guests of her own.  Culturally, it is acknowledged that P would have more Farsi spoken to her if she were to live with either SS or KS than in her current placement.  However, the social worker notes that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">&#8220;it is likely that it is dementia rather than language that is the major factor hindering communication &#8211; family may be more alert to non-verbal cues although care staff are trained to pick up on these signs which tends (sic) to be universal&#8221; (D326).</span></p>

There is another Farsi speaking resident at the care home too, who apparently has some interaction with P.  It is also clear from the evidence of all parties that P is moved around the care home and into the garden giving her variety and stimulation (D327).  It appeared from her oral evidence as if KS accepts that the current arrangements are meeting P&#8217;s cultural needs, as well as that the care home generally is meeting P&#8217;s care needs.

There would also be flexibility to allow for a live-in carer should P&#8217;s needs require that at a later stage, though this is not assessed as necessary now given that there are two people able to care for her at the moment (D328).

It would not be in P&#8217;s best interests to be the ongoing subject of allegations and counter allegations about her care, I find.  This is because it has the potential to undermine the actual care that P receives (if for example it again resulted in a care agency withdrawing their services), but more importantly it has the potential to expose P to the conflict even if indirectly and in circumstances where she does not understand why there is conflict.  As the social worker noted, just because P has diminished cognitive function does not mean that she is not sensitive to the emotions of those around her.</span></p>

She told me that in her over 20 years of experience as a social worker she normally only has about one or two cases per year where a care home says that they cannot handle the family conflicts and the demands that this places upon staff and the impact on other residents of staff time being taken up by issues arising from the family dispute.  The fact that all of P&#8217;s children have made requests of the care home to detail how often visits have taken place, and the petty and very unseemly spat about whether or not photographs have been removed from P&#8217;s room is evidence of this sort of extreme and challenging behaviour which a care home should not have to manage on top of everything else.</span></p>

HS also told me that he had lost part of his family, namely his sister, and that was clearly very distressing for him.  Tragically for this family, it is evident that there is a very deep and long-lasting rift between P&#8217;s children.  More significantly, for P this means that she does need to be protected from the consequences of this acrimony, I find.</span></p>

As the OS submitted in closing, it is not in dispute that before P reached a point where she was not capable of making her own decisions about visiting family, she would regularly visit her family. It is also abundantly clear to me that all of P&#8217;s children love her and care very deeply about her remaining time being as positive as is possible.</span></p>

A case was put by KS that she had had a closer relationship with P than her brothers.  SS accepted that in their childhood KS may well have been closer to P since SS and HS came to the UK to study whilst KS remained with P in Iran.  However, as SS pointed out, that does not mean they did not become close later and all the evidence before me in fact shows that each of her children clearly loves P and cares deeply about what happens to her.  They all visit P as often as they can, the only limitations on this (outside of Covid outbreaks as HS told me) are the fact that SS and HS are at some distance from the care home and work, but even so SS normally visits at least once a week, and HS every two weeks and would like this to continue and to be able to visit P on holidays and other important days.  KS visits P daily but she is much closer to the care home and does not work. I am also aware that in terms of P&#8217;s culture of origin, caring within the family is usual (as is the case in many cultures) and indeed perhaps expected as a starting point.  This is something that the evidence of KS&#8217;s niece refers to as well (D403), though as SS notes in his statement dated 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> March 2022 this does not mean that those requiring specialist care do not receive that in care homes in Iran (D430).  KS in making a tentative proposal for P to move to Iran noted that this may be in a care home (D302).  I find there is no cultural bar to placement in a care home if P&#8217;s best interests require this.</span></p>

How much of that spoken Farsi she may understand at this point is debatable, given the medical and social work evidence, but it seems likely that the presence of her family would be reassuring as the evidence of P&#8217;s legal representative shows (see for example D200).  As the social worker noted </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">&#8220;within her family environment, P would have easier access to Persian culture, but there is no way to objectively measure the significance of this for her due to P&#8217;s advanced dementia&#8221; (D337).</span></p>

This is not my understanding of the social work evidence, which confirms at D337-D339 that the Local Authority is prepared to pay up to the current fee level of P&#8217;s current care home, ie up to &#163;2114 per week, for a package of care regardless of where P is placed.  The Local Authority therefore appears to have adopted a cost neutral stance in assessing the various available options as all are subject to the same financial ceiling.  If KS&#8217;s case is that there should be another option (and it seems this may be what she has tried to set out in her final statement as I noted earlier in this judgment), then this is not an available option for me at this hearing and I can only choose between available options as the case of N v A CCG makes clear.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">Leaving aside the issues about the allegations against KS, as the OS has submitted, one of the key aspects of P being placed with either KS or SS is whether this would prevent her from having as much contact with her family as possible.  KS says that she would not be able to visit P daily if P were to live with SS, and both SS and HS have expressed concerns about visiting P if she were to live with KS given the existing tensions.  KS has given evidence both in her statements (D298-D299 and D363) and orally that she does not see a problem with her brothers visiting her flat and that if required she would leave the flat when they visit.  When I asked her to clarify how she envisaged the practical communications around visiting working, she initially said that a simple text or email would suffice, but then said that they could also just turn up when they wanted.  In terms of arrangements for her visiting P if P were to live with SS, she again said that a simple text or email would suffice.  When I asked her how that would work if she received a response to the effect that it was not convenient because of some reasonable appointment or similar for P, she immediately assumed that any such response would in fact be false and an attempt to prevent her visiting P. She went on to suggest to me that they may need a third party to be involved, to help with making arrangements and monitor communications about them, and she thought that perhaps social services could do this. Similarly, SS gave me evidence about his belief that KS would make excuses or change her mind about arranged visits leading him to believe she would try to prevent visits taking place.  This is very clear and extremely sad evidence about the lack of trust between P&#8217;s children and of the acrimony between them, I find.  It is the extremely fraught relationship between KS, HS and SS which I find is more likely to significantly impact on the amount of contact that P would have with her family if P were to live with either SS or KS.  Regardless of the rights and wrongs of how that fraught relationship has been caused, the tension is palpable when I have dealt with the parties in this case and clearly conveyed in the written evidence in the Bundle.  That tension is bound to discourage people from visiting P as frequently as would be ideal for P, and potentially expose P to that tension in circumstances that would not be conducive to P having a calm and pleasant home environment.  The arguments about whether family photos have or have not been taken down by KS also highlights this as a concern and I did not find KS credible when she told me that she knew nothing about the photos being removed and clearly did not believe the email from the care home about this.  Given that nobody disputes that P does derive great benefit from regular visits from her family, it is in P&#8217;s best interests for those visits to be promoted and facilitated as the OS has submitted.  I have considered whether KS leaving the flat as she suggested might mitigate the impact on P of this family conflict, but it seems clear to me that the fact of the conflict itself would be likely to discourage HS and SS (and their wider families) from having as much contact regardless of whether KS were to leave the flat when they arrive.  And I am not confident that this would enable P to see her family in a calm way that does not expose her to their emotions in a negative way.  Despite KS saying that they have never exposed P to their conflict directly, this ignores the indirect impact on P if those visiting her or looking after her feel upset or angry about the arrangements and also ignores the fact that some of the evidence does in fact support a conclusion that at times the family conflict has had an impact on P in terms of the demands placed on her carers in answering questions from family members.  I am also concerned that KS&#8217;s evidence to me demonstrated a complete absence of understanding of that indirect impact on P, as well as a complete lack of understanding of how the general family conflict may discourage others from visiting P.  In this case, I find that the care home does represent </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">&#8220;neutral ground&#8221; (D325)</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> for family visits as described by the social worker.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The fact that there is a history of problems between KS and those providing care to P, both at KS&#8217;s home and in her previous care home as well as when P was in hospital, does legitimately raise a concern about the sustainability of any care package for P with her family, I find.  The risk of such issues undermining her placement in her current care home is considerably mitigated by the fact that the care home has been managing the fraught family dynamics since P moved there, and a statement of expectations of all concerned has now been agreed and produced in the course of this hearing, clearly designed to reduce the potential burden on care staff and the care home of the consequences of the lack of trust between the various family members.  However, the concerns about the risk of care breakdown are very much secondary to the concern that placement with either SS or KS may result in fewer family visits for P, I find. As was submitted by both the Local Authority and the OS, somewhat unusually I do find that the least restrictive option for P is for her to remain in a care home where she is deprived of her liberty because this enables her to continue to have frequent contact with all her family.  She clearly derives great enjoyment from this contact, and it is something that in turn will help improve her quality of life with all of the other positive benefits for her health and well-being that will flow from that. I find that it is in her best interests to remain in her current care home as a result and will make final declarations to the effect that it is in her best interests to remain living there and to receive the package of care and support that is being provided there.  As this results in a deprivation of her liberty and the proceedings have been reconstituted as being a challenge under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, I will also authorise a deprivation of liberty for P.</span></p>
