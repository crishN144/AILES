The proceedings were commenced by a Part 8 claim form issued on the application of Sheffield City Council (&#8220;SCC&#8221;) on 8 September 2004. SCC is the local social services authority with responsibilities for E. SCC commenced the proceedings because of its concerns about E&#8217;s relationship with an older man S.</p>

At the beginning of September 2004 SCC discovered that E and S were planning to be married on 18 September 2004. Concerned that E&#8217;s relationship with S had become abusive, and that E was at risk of domestic violence and sexual exploitation at S&#8217;s hands, SCC began these proceedings, wanting to stop them marrying or associating and asserting that it is in E&#8217;s best interests neither to marry nor to associate with S. SCC invokes the inherent jurisdiction: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re F (Adult: Court&#8217;s Jurisdiction) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] Fam 38" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] Fam 38</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Adult&#8217;s Lack of Capacity: Carer and Residence) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2003/1909" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 1909 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 1909 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 1235" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 1235</ref>.

The Official Solicitor was ordered to conduct enquiries as to E&#8217;s capacity &#8220;to conduct this litigation &#8230; to decide where she should live &#8230; to decide whether she should have contact with [S], and the extent of that contact &#8230; [and] to get married to [S]&#8221;.

He left open for further consideration the question of E&#8217;s capacity on the matters which are the subject of the litigation, saying, hardly surprisingly in the light of Dr M&#8217;s report, that he was not in a position to present the court with a concluded view. Later the same day (30 September 2004) the proceedings came before Hogg J. She made an order declaring that E &#8220;has the capacity to litigate&#8221; and directed that Dr M was to file a final report on E&#8217;s capacity by 28 October 2004. She also directed that the matter was to be listed for a final hearing on the first open date after 10 December 2004. (I understand that it has in fact been listed for hearing on 31 January 2005.) The order recited that E and S had agreed not to marry until further order or conclusion of the proceedings.</p>

Such was the press of business in my list that this was simply not possible.

Failing that it would be necessary to re-fix the hearing of the preliminary issue, with no assurance that an early hearing would be possible.

The first is that every adult (that is, everyone who has attained the age of 18 years) is presumed to have capacity, and that the burden of proof is on those who assert the contrary. It follows that E does not have to establish that she has capacity to marry; the burden is on SCC to prove that E does not have capacity to marry.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other is this. The general rule of English law, whatever the context, is that the test of capacity is the ability (whether or not one chooses to exercise it) to understand the nature and quality of the transaction. The classic statement of principle goes back to the advice of the judges to the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">M&#8217;Naghten&#8217;s case </span>(1843) 10 Cl&amp;F 200. That, of course, was a criminal case where the judges were concerned to define the ambit of the defence of insanity. But on this very general level of abstraction &#8211; that capacity is dependent upon the ability to understand the nature and quality of the transaction &#8211; the same basic principle applies whether the question is as to capacity to enter into a contract, to execute a deed, to marry, to make a will, to conduct litigation, to consent to a decree of divorce, or to consent to medical treatment: see, for example, the various cases collected together by Chadwick LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Masterman-Lister v Brutton &amp; Co (No 1) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2002/1889" uk:canonical="[2002] EWCA Civ 1889" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWCA Civ 1889</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 WLR 1511" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 WLR 1511</ref>, at paras [57]-[61].</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Some years ago the question of what amount of mental capacity was required to make a man responsible for crime was considered in <span style="font-style:italic">McNaughtens Case </span>(1843) 10 Cl&amp;F 200. No doubt the question is treated somewhat differently in a criminal suit to what it is here (the difference I will explain presently); but there is, as you will easily see, an analogy between the cases which will be of use to us in considering the points before us. Lord Chief Justice Tindal, in expressing the opinion of all the judges, said &#8211; &#8220;In all cases every man is to be presumed to be sane until the contrary is proved, and it must be clearly proved, that at the time of committing or executing the act the party was labouring under such defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.&#8221; </p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">That, in my opinion, affords as nearly as possible a general formula which is applicable in all cases in which the question arises, not exactly, perhaps, in the terms I have read, but to the extent I will explain to you. It is essential, to constitute responsibility for crime, that a man shall understand the nature and quality of the thing he is doing, or that he shall be able to distinguish in the act he is doing right from wrong. Now a very small degree of intelligence is sufficient to enable a man to judge of the quality and nature of the act, and whether he is doing right or wrong, when he kills another man; accordingly he is responsible for the crime committed if he possesses that amount of intelligence. And so in reference to all other concerns of life, &#8211; was the man at the time the act was done of sufficient capacity to understand the nature of the act? Take the question of marriage. It is always left in precisely the same terms as I have to suggest in this case. If the validity of a marriage be disputed on the ground that one or other of the parties was of unsound mind, the question will be, was he or she capable of understanding the nature of the contract which he or she had entered into. The same will occur in regard to contracts of selling and buying. Again, take the case suggested by counsel, of a man, who, being confined in a lunatic asylum, is called upon to give evidence. First, the judge will have to consider, was he capable of understanding the nature and character of the act that he was called upon to do, when he was sworn to speak the truth? Was he capable of understanding the nature of the obligation imposed upon him by that oath? If so, then he was of sufficient capacity to give evidence as a witness.&#8221;</p>

Mr Gordon argues for what he calls the minimal competence test, which he defines as the capacity to understand in broad terms the nature and effect of the proposed treatment. It is common ground that C has the legal capacity to initiate these proceedings without a next friend, within the terms of RSC, Ord 80. Mr. Gordon contends that the capacity to refuse treatment is no higher and is equally no higher than the capacity to contract. I reject that submission. I think that the question to be decided is whether it has been established that C&#8217;s capacity is so reduced by his chronic mental illness that he does not sufficiently understand the nature, purpose and effects of the proffered amputation. </p>

The question is always whether the litigant has capacity to litigate in relation to the particular proceedings in which he is involved. Chadwick LJ in the passage I have quoted from para [75] of his judgment formulated the test as being &#8220;whether the party to legal proceedings is capable of understanding &#8230; the issues on which his consent or decision is likely to be necessary in the course of <span style="font-style:italic">those</span> proceedings&#8221; (emphasis added).

In this sense litigation is analogous to medical treatment. Some litigation, like some medical treatment, is relatively simple and risk free. Some litigation, on the other hand, like some medical treatment, is highly complex and more or less risky. Someone may have the capacity to consent to a simple operation whilst lacking the capacity to consent to a more complicated &#8211; perhaps controversial &#8211; form of treatment. In the same way, someone may have the capacity to litigate in a simple case whilst lacking the capacity to litigate in a highly complex case.

But in the present case, and typically in cases of this kind, the underlying issue in the litigation relates to the litigant&#8217;s capacity: sometimes his capacity to consent to medical treatment; sometimes, as here, capacity to decide where to live and capacity to marry. The Official Solicitor is concerned to explore the relationship between these two different types of issue as to capacity. The point is far from academic, for the Official Solicitor is often engaged in litigation where questions arise in relation to each type of capacity. Not infrequently, for example, as he tells me, he agrees to act as guardian ad litem of a parent, the respondent to adoption proceedings, who lacks the capacity to litigate but who, on investigation, is nonetheless found to have capacity to give agreement to the making of an adoption order in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(1)</ref>(b)(i) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1976</ref>.</p>

There may be different answers to the questions, Does this person have litigation capacity? and, Does this person have subject-matter capacity? As Bracewell J said, it all depends on the circumstances. There is no principle, either of law or of medical science, which necessarily makes it impossible for someone who has litigation capacity at the same time to lack subject-matter capacity. That said, however, it is much more difficult to imagine a case where someone has litigation capacity whilst lacking subject-matter capacity than it is to imagine a case where someone has subject-matter capacity whilst lacking litigation capacity. Whilst it is not difficult to think of situations where someone has subject-matter capacity whilst lacking litigation capacity, and such cases may not be that rare, I suspect that cases where someone has litigation capacity whilst lacking subject-matter capacity are likely to be very much more infrequent, indeed pretty rare. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that only in unusual circumstances will it be possible to conclude that someone who lacks subject-matter capacity can nonetheless have litigation capacity.</p>

It seems to me that Dr M should now be asked to report on all aspects of the case, including the question of whether E has litigation capacity, and that in relation to this latter question her preliminary report dated 24 September 2004 should not necessarily be treated as determinative of the issue.     </p>

It is true that there are some obscure dicta, in the earlier commentators on the law &#8230; , that a marriage of an insane person could not be invalidated on that account, founded, I presume, on some notion that prevailed in the dark ages, of the mysterious nature of the contract of marriage, in which its spiritual nature almost entirely obliterated its civil character. In more modern times it has been considered, in its proper light, as a civil contract, as well as a religious vow, and, like all civil contracts, will be invalidated by want of consent of capable persons.&#8221;</p>

Having referred to Blackstone&#8217;s observation that &#8220;modern resolutions have adhered to the reason of the civil law, by determining that the marriage of a lunatic, not being in a lucid interval, was absolutely void&#8221;, he continued:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Here then the law, and the good sense of the law, are clearly laid down; want of reason must, of course, invalidate a contract, and the most important contract of life, the very essence of which is consent. It is not material whether the want of consent arises from ideotcy or lunacy, or from both combined: nor does it seem necessary, in this case, to enter into any disquisition of what is ideotcy, and what is lunacy; complete ideotcy, total fatuity from the birth, rarely occurs; a much more common case is mental weakness and imbecillity, increased as a person grows up and advances in age, from various supervening causes, so as to produce unsoundness of mind. Objects of this sort have occurred to the observation of most people. If the incapacity be such, arising from either or both causes, that the party is incapable of understanding the nature of the contract itself, and incapable, from mental imbecillity, to take care of his or her own person and property, such an individual cannot dispose of her person and property by the matrimonial contract, any more than by any other contract. The exact line of separation between reason and incapacity may be difficult to be found and marked out in the abstract; though it may not be difficult, in most cases, to decide upon the result of the circumstances; and this appears to be a case of that description, the circumstances being such as to leave no doubt upon my mind.&#8221;</p>

She has been residing previously with a married couple, and must have known that they lived together in a manner differently from unmarried persons like herself. She remained up to the time of her own marriage perfectly respectable and chaste; she went through the solemnity in which the hands of herself and her husband were joined. A child was born of the marriage in due time and not sooner. She, who was aware of what the proprieties of life required, and had remained chaste until this time, after the celebration of this marriage and not before, allowed the communication of her husband. That shews that she was aware she had performed a solemn act, imposing new duties, and she was constant to her husband during the rest of her life &#8211; a period of nearly thirty years.

Nor do I consider that it would be useful to borrow from my predecessors, or to attempt myself to form any exact definition of what constitutes soundness of mind. I accept for the purposes of this case the definition which has been substantially agreed upon by the counsel to whom I have to express my obligations for the very able assistance they have given me, namely, a capacity to understand the nature of the contract, and the duties and responsibilities which it creates. It is to be observed, however, that this only conceals for a moment the difficulties of the inquiry, for I have still to determine the meaning to be attached to the word &#8220;understand.&#8221; If I were to attempt to analyse this expression, I should encounter the same difficulties at some other stage of the investigation with reference to some other phrase, and I should still have to determine, on a review of the whole facts, whether the respondent came up to the standard of sanity which I must fix in my own mind, though I may not be able to express it. I may say this much in the outset, that it appears to me that the contract of marriage is a very simple one, which does not require a high degree of intelligence to comprehend. It is an engagement between a man and woman to live together, and love one another as husband and wife, to the exclusion of all others. This is expanded in the promises of the marriage ceremony by words having reference to the natural relations which spring from that engagement, such as protection on the part of the man, and submission on the part of the woman. I agree with the Solicitor General, that a mere comprehension of the words of the promises exchanged is not sufficient. The mind of one of the parties may be capable of understanding the language used, but may yet be affected by such delusions, or other symptoms of insanity, as may satisfy the tribunal that there was not a real appreciation of the engagement apparently entered into.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;This case is one, it seems to me, of the very greatest difficulty. The position of the petitioner is most deplorable; there can be no question that she has gone through a ceremony of marriage with a mental degenerate. But that is not the question. The question is whether the respondent was mentally capable of understanding the nature of the marriage contract, and the duties and responsibilities which it creates. As Sir J Hannen said in <span style="font-style:italic">Durham v Durham</span>, a mere comprehension of the words of the promises exchanged is not sufficient. The mind of one of the parties may be capable of understanding the language used, but may yet be affected by such delusions, or other symptoms of insanity, as may satisfy the tribunal that there was not a real appreciation of the engagement apparently entered into. Now that the respondent knew that he had proposed marriage and the effect of the ceremony and its primary consequences I cannot doubt, but whether his mind at the time was in such a condition that he appreciated and understood the effect of the ceremony is more doubtful. The evidence of members of his family has satisfied me that he was not normal, and that there have been in the past recurrent periods during which he behaved in an unaccountable way after consuming large quantities of alcohol. I have had before me, too, a number of mental specialists, who tell me on their responsibility, and indeed on their oath, that there were with the respondent recurrent periods in which he was the victim of what are called &#8220;grandiose delusions.&#8221; If I had believed that the petitioner had been imposed upon by a rascal &#8211; as I was at one time much inclined to believe &#8211; I must have refused her the relief which she sought. But I have come to the conclusion that at the end of January and the beginning of February the respondent really held the deluded belief that he was an officer holding a responsible and trusted command, and that he suffered from delusions as to his own <span style="font-style:italic">persona</span>, as to his position in the world, and as to his capacity to perform any of the obligations which he undertook &#8211; delusions which rendered his life at that time an unreal thing. On that finding I hold that he was mentally incapable of entering into the contract of marriage and I pronounce a decree nisi of nullity of marriage.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are thus, in essence, two aspects to the inquiry. The first is whether the person understands the nature of the marriage contract. But this, as the authorities show, merely takes us to the central question: Does he or she understand the duties and responsibilities that normally attach to marriage? This in turn leads on to two further questions: (1) What are the duties and responsibilities that normally attach to marriage? In other words, What are the essential attributes of the contract of marriage that the person has to be mentally capable of &#8220;understanding&#8221;? To this question, as we have seen, Sir James Hannen P sought to provide an answer in <span style="font-style:italic">Durham v Durham</span>. (2) What is meant for this purpose by &#8220;understanding&#8221;? To this question, the President chose not to provide an answer. For, having defined the test as being &#8220;capacity to understand the nature of the contract, and the duties and responsibilities which it creates&#8221;, he continued:</p>

He says that the fact that a woman may not understand all the implications of the character of a man whom she wishes to marry is completely irrelevant unless, perhaps, it demonstrates that her want of understanding is so profound that she lacks the capacity to marry anybody at all. He says that it is not the business of SCC or even the court to adjudicate on the wisdom of contracts to marry. If a woman of 21 has the capacity to marry a &#8216;suitable&#8217; partner then she has the capacity to marry anybody, and that is her business and nobody else&#8217;s.</p>

Unless SCC is prepared to go this far &#8211; and she suggests that in truth it is not &#8211; then the reality, she submits, is that the court is being invited to reserve to itself the right to vet not merely S but also any of E&#8217;s future suitors. The logical conclusion of SCC&#8217;s argument that the court should determine whether E has the capacity to marry S is, she says, that E&#8217;s right to marry must be subject to the approval by SCC and/or the court of any potential suitor. There is, she says, no basis in law for this and no basis in law for discriminating in this way between potential spouses. What if E were undecided between two suitors? Is it suggested that SCC or the court should be able to select one over the other? SCC&#8217;s case, she says, is, in essence, that it is not in E&#8217;s interests to marry S.

In all the cases, as we have seen, the question has always been formulated in a general and non-specific form: Is there capacity to understand the nature of the contract of marriage? Two things about this formulation are noticeable. The test is capacity to understand the <span style="font-style:italic">nature </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic">contract of marriage</span>. The test is not capacity to understand the <span style="font-style:italic">implications </span>of a <span style="font-style:italic">particular marriage</span>. Putting the same point somewhat differently, and this is really Mr Whitfield&#8217;s core submission, the <span style="font-style:italic">nature of the contract of marriage </span>is necessarily something shared in common by all marriages. It is not something that differs as between different marriages or depending upon whether A marries B or C. The implications for A of choosing to marry B rather than C may be immense. B may be a loving pauper and C a wife-beating millionaire. But this has nothing to do with the nature of the contract of marriage into which A has chosen to enter. Whether A marries B or marries C, the contract is the same, its nature is the same, and its legal consequences are the same. The emotional, social, financial and other implications for A may be very different but the nature of the contract is precisely the same in both cases. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, Mr Whitfield and Miss Waddicor are right, in my judgment, when they say that the analogy of consent to medical treatment is not helpful. It is not, in my judgment, an appropriate analogy at all, not least for the reason Mr Whitfield gave, namely that medical procedures, as he rightly says, vary whilst the contract of marriage is the same for everyone. As Mr Jay points out, medical treatment may be minor or life-threatening, anodyne or controversial. Someone with what one may call borderline capacity might well, for example, as he comments, understand the nature of simple and risk-free treatment but not the nature of complex or controversial treatment. (In the same way a child may have &#8216;Gillick&#8217; capacity to consent to dental treatment, the mending of a broken arm, a tonsillectomy or even an appendicectomy, whilst lacking the capacity to consent to more serious treatment: see <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] AC 112" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] AC 112</ref> at pp 169, 201.) But it is this very point that Mr Whitfield correctly turns against Mr Jay. One can sensibly say that marriage is marriage; one cannot in the same way simply say that medical treatment is medical treatment. Medical procedures vary. The contract of marriage is necessarily, and indeed as a matter of law, the same for everyone.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a further reason why there is, as it seems to me, no true analogy between capacity to marry and capacity to consent (or refuse consent) to medical treatment or, indeed, capacity to litigate. Marriage &#8211; as opposed, perhaps, to its fiscal consequences &#8211; is not something on which the average person needs to obtain either expert advice or expert assistance. Litigation and medical treatment, in contrast, are both activities where the average layman needs, and is accustomed to obtaining from an appropriately qualified professional person, expert information, advice and assistance. The contract of marriage, as Sir James Hannen P observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Durham v Durham </span>(1885) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="10 PD 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">10 PD 80</ref> at p 82, is in essence a very simple one which, as Karminski J pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">In the Estate of Park deceased, Park v Park </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1954] P 89" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1954">[1954] P 89</ref> at p 100, &#8220;any person of either sex of normal intelligence should readily be able to comprehend.&#8221; Medical treatment and litigation, on the other hand, are of their very nature complex, technical and capable of being properly understood by a layman only with the benefit of appropriate expert advice. </p>

In a marriage, by contrast, the principal undertakes the central activity &#8211; participation in the marriage ceremony &#8211; himself. He does not require an expert to perform the ceremony on his behalf. That is one very obvious difference. But there is another difference which is even more important for present purposes. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Typically, where a doctor or a lawyer is retained to act for a patient or a client, he will, prior to that culminating activity (the surgery or the advocacy), have given the patient or the client, to use the language of medicine, a diagnosis, a prognosis and advice as to treatment. (Although the conventional terminology may be rather different a lawyer&#8217;s professional activities in the course of litigation can be analysed in very much the same way.) Thus in the simple case the doctor will give a diagnosis (you are suffering from appendicitis), followed by a prognosis (unless treated you will die) and then advice as to treatment (you need surgery: an appendicectomy). In the more complex kind of case there may be a number of possible diagnoses (I think you are suffering from X, but there is a chance you are actually suffering from Y). And there may be a number of possible outcomes depending upon various treatment options (treatment X, if successful, gives you a 90% chance of a cure, but carries with it a 30% risk of failure; treatment Y, if successful, gives only a 40% chance of a cure, but carries with it only a 5% risk of failure; and it is not possible to attempt treatment Y if treatment X has already been tried unsuccessfully). So the information and advice that the patient has to be able to obtain, receive, take in, comprehend, retain, believe and weigh (to borrow the language of <span style="font-style:italic">In re C (Adult: Refusal of Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 WLR 290" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 WLR 290</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re MB (Medical Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 2 FLR 426" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 2 FLR 426</ref>) will typically be both technical and complex &#8211; sometimes highly technical and exceedingly complex &#8211; reflecting an art or a science which the doctor may have had to spend many years mastering and which is often expressed in an unfamiliar and very technical &#8216;jargon&#8217;. The contract of marriage, in contrast, is very simple. The marriage ceremony is expressed in words which even if they date from the age of Shakespeare can be understood by anyone of normal intelligence. Of more direct importance, the nature of the marriage contract &#8211; the concept of marriage &#8211; can likewise be expressed in simple words which anyone of normal intelligence can understand. And there is simply no equivalent, in the case of a decision to marry, to the expert&#8217;s diagnosis, prognosis and advice which typically precedes a decision to undergo surgery (or the similar professional activities which typically precede a decision to litigate).</p>

There, as here, proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction have been commenced by a local authority, though in that case it is not SCC. The same solicitors act in that case for W as act here for E. In that case a very similar letter of instructions, dated 3 August 2004, was sent to another Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr E. The questions posed of Dr E were in terms very similar, though not identical, to those asked in the present case of Dr M.

If he does, then, at least in relation to that issue, the Family Division cannot exercise its inherent declaratory jurisdiction, because it is fundamental that this jurisdiction can be exercised only in relation to those who lack the relevant capacity. But if he does not have capacity to marry then that is that. No court &#8211; neither the High Court of Justice nor the Court of Protection &#8211; has any jurisdiction to supply consent to marriage on behalf of an adult who lacks the capacity to give consent himself. If an adult lacks the capacity to marry he cannot marry. And if, nonetheless, he purports to marry, the validity of the &#8220;marriage&#8221; can be challenged in the usual way. And if an adult lacks the capacity to marry, a purported &#8220;marriage&#8221; is no better than it would otherwise be merely because the Family Division has granted a declaration that it is in that person&#8217;s best interests to marry or even if it has granted a declaration (I adapt the form of declaration used in &#8216;residence&#8217; and &#8216;contact&#8217; cases) that &#8220;it is lawful, as being in his best interests, for him to marry X&#8221;.</p>

On the other hand there can be circumstances in which, consistently with the doctrine of necessity, medical treatment can be administered notwithstanding the absence of consent. It follows that although it is proper for the Family Division, once incapacity has been established, to inquire into such questions as whether it is in an adult&#8217;s best interests to have a surgical operation, or whether it is in his best interests to live here rather than there, there is simply no purpose in the Family Division even embarking upon an investigation of whether or not it is in his best interests to marry. The lawfulness of surgical treatment depends either upon consent or, where the doctrine of necessity applies, upon best interests. The lawfulness of a marriage depends exclusively upon consent. Best interests are neither here nor there. So it would be a purposeless exercise in futility for the Family Division even to embark upon an investigation of whether or not it is in an adult&#8217;s best interests to marry &#8211; either to marry at all or to marry X.</p>

If he is capable of consent, and has consented, the law does not ask how the consent has been induced. His own consent, however procured, is his own act &#8230; The law looks no further back.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one final point. In deference to Miss Waddicor&#8217;s careful submissions, and because the point is fundamental to what this case is all about, I have dealt in some detail with the role of the court and the extent of its jurisdiction in cases where what is in issue is an adult&#8217;s capacity to marry. One question which I have not been asked to consider is whether the court can, and if it can whether it should, grant an injunction to restrain the marriage of someone who lacks capacity to marry. There is no doubt that, generally speaking, this branch of the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction extends not merely to declaratory relief but also to the grant of injunctive relief: see <span style="font-style:italic">A v A Health Authority, In re J (A Child), R (S) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2002] EWHC 18 (Fam/Admin), <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] Fam 213" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] Fam 213</ref>, at para [44]. And notwithstanding the qualification which I there expressed it is now, in my judgment, clearly established that the jurisdiction in such cases is not limited to the grant of interlocutory injunctions but extends to the grant of final injunctions. I have myself granted such injunctions in previous unreported cases involving incompetent adults. That said, I prefer to express no views, one way or the other, as to whether this jurisdiction is exercisable or properly exercisable to restrain a marriage. It should not be assumed I am suggesting that it cannot be. But equally it should not be assumed I am saying that it can be. This is an issue which may have to be resolved at trial. I prefer to say no more about it. Nor do I express any views about the proper approach to the question of capacity in relation to matters of &#8216;residence&#8217; and &#8216;contact&#8217;. That, again, is not a matter which is before me. </p>

It creates mutual rights and obligations, as all contracts do, but beyond that it confers a status. The position or status of &#8220;husband&#8221; and &#8220;wife&#8221; is a recognised one throughout Christendom: the laws of all Christian nations throw about that status a variety of legal incidents during the lives of the parties, and induce definite lights upon their offspring. What, then, is the nature of this institution as understood in Christendom? Its incidents vary in different countries, but what are its essential elements and invariable features? If it be of common acceptance and existence, it must needs (however varied in different countries in its minor incidents) have some pervading identity and universal basis. I conceive that marriage, as understood in Christendom, may for this purpose be defined as the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.&#8221;</p>

Thus conjugal treatment may be enforced by a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. Adultery by either party gives a right to the other of judicial separation; that of the wife gives a right to a divorce; and that of the husband, if coupled with bigamy, is followed by the same penalty. Personal violence, open concubinage, or debauchery in face of the wife, her degradation in her home from social equality with the husband, and her displacement as the head of his household, are with us matrimonial offences, for they violate the vows of wedlock. A wife thus injured may claim a judicial separation and a permanent support from the husband under the name of alimony at the rate of about one-third of his income &#8230; Offences necessarily presuppose duties. There are no conjugal duties, but those which are expressed or implied in the contract of marriage.&#8221;</p>

The minds of the parties must also be capable of understanding the nature of the contract into which they are entering. The precise nature of that contract may vary with the religious beliefs which the parties practise or profess. Some people may regard marriage as a sacrament; others, while still regarding marriage as a sacred and solemn obligation, do not believe in its sacramental nature. But as Sir James Hannen P pointed out, the essence of the contract is an engagement between a man and a woman to live together and to love one another as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others. It may be in the present times that submission on the part of the woman is no longer, as it was in 1885, an essential part of the contract. But so far as the husband is concerned there remains the duty to maintain her which is, I think, implicit in what Sir James Hannen P described as the duty to protect.&#8221;</p>

For, although we live in a multi-cultural society of many faiths, it must not be forgotten that as a secular judge my concern, to adopt Sir William Scott&#8217;s words, is with marriage as a civil contract, not as a religious vow.</p>

It is recognised that her body is not her husband&#8217;s, but her own. The husband cannot restrain her physical liberty. He cannot administer any physical punishment. Her freedom of occupation cannot be restricted by him. All professions (save the ecclesiastical) are open to her. She possesses full political rights. The Sex Disqualification Removal Act, 1919, is significant in the breadth of its implications. By virtue of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1884, no decree for the restitution of conjugal rights can be enforced by attachment, with the result that neither husband nor wife can force the other to return to conjugal association.&#8221;</p>

One is that it is the husband&#8217;s duty to provide his wife with a roof ever her head; and the children too. So long as the wife behaves herself, she is entitled to remain in the matrimonial home.&#8221;</p>

Traditionally, the husband earned the money, and the wife looked after the home and the children. This traditional division of labour is no longer the order of the day. Frequently both parents work.

It is not for the husband alone to provide the matrimonial home or to decide where the family is to live. Husband and wife both contribute. And where they are to live is, like other domestic matters of common concern, something to be settled by agreement, not determined unilaterally by the husband. Insofar as the concept of consortium &#8211; the sharing of a common home and a common domestic life, and the right to enjoy each other&#8217;s society, comfort and assistance &#8211; still has any useful role to play, the rights of husband and wife must surely now be regarded as exactly reciprocal.</p>

In my judgment the matter can be summarised as follows: Marriage, whether civil or religious, is a contract, formally entered into. It confers on the parties the status of husband and wife, the essence of the contract being an agreement between a man and a woman to live together, and to love one another as husband and wife, to the exclusion of all others.

And as we have also seen, Kennedy LJ&#8217;s formulation of the corresponding questions in the context of capacity to litigate is very similar: (i) does the litigant have the mental ability to recognise the problem; (ii) can the litigant obtain and receive, understand and retain relevant information, including advice; and (iii) can the litigant weigh the information (including that derived from advice) in the balance in reaching a decision.</p>

But there is, in my judgment, an important &#8211; in truth a crucial &#8211; distinction between, on the one hand, the capacity to litigate or to consent (or refuse consent) to medical treatment and, on the other hand, the capacity to marry. And it is a distinction which makes this analysis much less important in practical terms in the case of capacity to marry than in the two other situations. The distinction, as I have already said, is that marriage is not something on which the average person needs to obtain either expert advice or expert assistance. Litigation and medical treatment, in contrast, are both activities where the average layman needs, and is accustomed to obtaining from an appropriately qualified professional person, expert information, advice and assistance. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The contract of marriage is in essence a very simple one which any person of normal intelligence can readily comprehend. Medical treatment and litigation, on the other hand, are of their very nature complex, technical and capable of being properly understood by a layman only with the benefit of appropriate expert advice. Where the issues are as complex as typically they will be if the question is whether someone has the capacity to litigate or has the capacity to consent (or refuse consent) to medical treatment, then it is appropriate and helpful to approach the issue by reference to the analyses in <span style="font-style:italic">In re C (Adult: Refusal of Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 WLR 290" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 WLR 290</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re MB (Medical Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 2 FLR 426" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 2 FLR 426</ref>. But I doubt whether such a refined analysis is either necessary or indeed particularly helpful where the issue is as simple as the question whether someone has the capacity to marry. Medical science has no doubt made immense strides since Sir James Hannen P first formulated the relevant question in <span style="font-style:italic">Hunter v Edney (orse Hunter) </span>(1881) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="10 PD 93" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">10 PD 93</ref>. And in this post-Freudian world we have &#8211; or think we have &#8211; a much greater understanding of how the human mind operates than was vouchsafed to our Victorian ancestors. But Sir James Hannen&#8217;s test remains as clear and workable today as it was in 1881. The question remains as it was in 1881, Is E capable of understanding the nature of the contract of marriage? There is no need, as it seems to me, to over-analyse that simple question by bringing to bear on it the analyses in <span style="font-style:italic">In re C (Adult: Refusal of Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 WLR 290" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 WLR 290</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re MB (Medical Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 2 FLR 426" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 2 FLR 426</ref>.

There is in fact, as it seems to me, an important public interest &#8211; an important element of public policy &#8211; lurking behind the questions I have been considering. Marriage creates a status from which certain legal rights and duties automatically stem. Marriage also carries with it not merely all those intensely human, personal and emotional advantages that are obviously so important for so many but also a wide range of legal, social and fiscal advantages, many of which, of course, enure not just for the benefit of the married couple themselves but also for the benefit of their children. I do not enter into the debate about whether it is better for children to be brought up by parents who are married rather than by parents who are unmarried. I merely observe that, even in this day and age, and despite everything that has been done to eliminate the disadvantages of illegitimacy, there are still many respects in which the children of the married enjoy benefits and advantages denied to the children of the unmarried.</p>

We must be careful not to set the test of capacity to marry too high, lest it operate as an unfair, unnecessary and indeed discriminatory bar against the mentally disabled. </p>

The annulment of other contracts would only affect property; but this would do that, and more &#8211; it would tell upon the happiness, character, and peace of the parties. The appalling character of these consequences is well calculated to impress the courts with the solemn duty of requiring a clear case for the application of the general principle to this delicate and important contract.&#8221;</p>
