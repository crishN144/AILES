Both parents have children from previous relationships who continue to live with their other parent in [  X  ]. The mother recounts a difficult childhood in [  X  ], being abused and growing up in a children&#8217;s home between around age 8 to 20. J has not had contact with her child from the previous relationship since that child was aged 2 (she is now 15). M had a long term relationship in [  X  ] which ended in 2017.

They moved in together and were engaged (and remain so) in 2021. I understand they planned a child but J suffered pregnancy complications and had a termination. Between April and August 2022 they separated and for at least part of this time J was in a relationship with R. The parents had lived in a shared household with him and a number of other individuals when they first lived together in this country. In August 2022 the parents resumed their relationship and shortly after this J fell pregnant with N. He was born on 27 April 2023 at gestation week 37/3. It seems there were no complications although he was a relatively small baby. He came home with J, and M took a week off work to help. In the early days he suffered with Jaundice but there were no significant concerns.</span></p>

It appears there was an early concern as to meningitis. However, following further investigations bleeding on the brain was discovered and N was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). Whilst at GOSH further investigations were undertaken leading to a concern that N may have suffered an inflicted head trauma. In the course of his admission extensive checks were undertaken to ascertain whether N had any underlying conditions or disorders that might explain his presentation. An overall account is given on 20 July 2023:</span></p>

We have found it difficult to link these findings in terms of underlying cause and will not be able to say definitively whether the two processes are related. So far, we have not found a medical explanation for either finding. The MRI changes indicate bleeding caused by traumatic head injury and the retinal haemorrhages found on Ophthalmology examination are consistent with traumatic head injury. It is important that medical disorders are excluded as far as possible and for completeness we await the final enzyme test for glutaric aciduria (skin biopsy result), a rare condition associated with bleeding tendency. If this test is negative, the medical consensus is that the intracranial and retinal haemorrhages are most likely to be due to a non-accidental injury. </span></p>

I am most grateful for the assistance they each gave the Court. Proceedings of this sort cannot function without a community of clinicians and experts prepared to investigate our cases in a fair, professional manner and without fear of challenge.  The experts in this case listened with care to the points put and gave appropriate consideration to alternative propositions. Where they disagreed they did so in a respectful manner providing clear explanations as to why they could not agree. They made appropriate concessions where they felt the same were justified. They did not stray outside their area of expertise and identified where it was appropriate to defer to other witnesses. They were measured in their approach and appropriately distinguished between degrees of confidence in a manner that was helpful to my assessment.</span></p>

As to timing, the experts could not determine whether the presentation was as a result of a single episode or not. The most significant evidence as to timing came from Mr Jayamohan and Dr Cleghorn. They narrowed down the sentinel event leading to admission to being on 27 May 2023 having regard to the child&#8217;s encephalopathic presentation and the presence of effusions. They were clear that one was looking to identify when the child was last found to be presenting in a manner normal for that child and to date the event to after that point.</span></p>

N presented in this manner on admission, he was irritable and jittery, he had a high heart rate and there was an initial concern as to a brain infection, then he had seizures. This fits with clinical encephalopathy (Mr J). If N was acting in a normal manner at midday on the preceding day then it is likely the sentinel event occurred thereafter. It is not likely he would have the injuries and then have interacted with others in a normal manner to the point no-one thought there was a problem. Whilst one can have a deterioration one would not have a lucid period although the deterioration might be masked whilst the child was asleep. Whilst this might differ with the severity of the injury N progressed rapidly, he stopped breathing and there was a fear of meningitis. It should not be misunderstood how sick he was. The presence of effusions and the clinical presentation indicated the sentinel event happened on 27 May 2023 (Mr J). Changes would occur fairly quickly. N was at the higher end of severity in this case. He was significantly unwell and had to go into intensive care (Dr C).</span></p>

From experience clinicians treating seizures with anti-seizure medication do not see these symptoms as a result (Dr W). It is not likely a seizure could cause the eye haemorrhages seen in this case as it was most unlikely a child of this age would be able to exhibit the necessary movements through seizure that would be required to cause what is seen. We would expect to see different features if hypertension were the cause with a cluster of haemorrhages around the optic nerve. Here they are present through the retina itself (Mr G). Varying intracranial pressure is not a likely cause of the bleeds. The changes in pressure for N were intended by the treatment plan in operation and were not an unexpected change. It was not pathological in origin. Some of the symptoms were not explicable by seizure in any event (Mr J). An EEG was carried out and there were no signs of epilepsy syndrome. There was unusual brainwave activity but this was related to the areas of the brain where there was identified brain abnormality. This suggested the seizures were likely related to the brain injury he had suffered. It would be very unusual to have an underlying epilepsy syndrome that only presented with encephalopathy several weeks down the line. One would expect to see this in the first days of life. The EEG does not support this suggestion (Dr C).</span></p>

If they did not resolve then we would be seeing a population of children with increasing head circumference which we do not. It is unlikely a birth related situation might predispose the child to later subdural haemorrhages (Dr W). New born babies do present with retinal haemorrhages but there are no inherent factors which predispose an ordinary infant to retinal haemorrhage (Mr G). For there to be a predisposition would suggest a re-bleed yet N did not have the necessary membranes for this to be the case (Mr J).</span></p>

He did not actually hit her and she was not scared of him but this was physically abusive on any objective assessment. She described M as a match that would &#8216;explode&#8217; and said this happened on around 5-6 occasions.

I bear in mind they come from a very different culture and note it was not so long ago that such a viewpoint held significant purchase in this jurisdiction. They cannot perhaps be blamed for holding to this view but whilst this may explain how they have responded to the presence of the same (by accepting it) this does not change the nature of the behaviour.</span></p>

M has consumed alcohol at a problematic level for a number of years and his problematic consumption clearly predates the relationship. He gave some indications of background factors that have led to this state of affairs and gave me the very strong sense that he relies on alcohol to soothe himself at times of stress and when he is feeling overwhelmed. He particularly references strong feelings of despair when the couple lost an ectopic pregnancy in around 2021. He turns to alcohol and it is the classic crutch on which he has come to rely.</span></p>

Yet it is clear he has struggled to remain abstinent or to control his consumption when times have been difficult. Both parents agree he would work hard and long hours and would mainly drink at the weekends, although he would on occasion come home having drunk after work. He would drink beer or vodka and during certain periods would be drinking 1L a day or on his own case in around April-August 2022 up to around 2.5L of vodka per weekend (this is 100 units a weekend). When drinking his behaviour would become impulsive (see the TV incident).</span></p>

In their first property there were a number of other adults including 7 men. This caused M some problems given his jealous feelings. One of the men was R. It seems R and M would have known each other but only to a limited level. In April 2022 J and M separated and she commenced a relationship with R. The exact quality of the relationship is not entirely clear but it was an intimate relationship of which M was aware. During this period M and J remained in contact and it was at this time that M was drinking to a very high level. In August 2022 M and J resumed their relationship.

Even after N was born M went onto Facebook and found a picture of R and sent it to J alongside one of N commenting as to their likeness.

M gives an account of N being largely sleeping during the day when not being fed. Whilst N was sleeping M also slept, played on his console or watched television. There appeared to be very limited engagement with N aside from feeding although M explained he did play with N for a period and N interacted by pulling his hair (beard). He seems to have fed him at around 12 noon, 3pm and 6pm although the 6pm feed was slightly unusual in that N struggled to feed and was &#8216;fussy&#8217;. The feeding took twice as long as usual. N had been crying for around 10 minutes in an increasingly escalating manner whilst waiting for the feed. A sense of how this was is given in police interview when M refers to N being &#8216;angry&#8217;. At around this time M noted two scratches to the side of N&#8217;s face but put this down to the child scratching himself.

They explain there had been previous &#8216;twitching&#8217; to the arms, legs and chin but not this movement and not on this day. N took his bottle but shortly after vomited and brought up a large quantity of milk (either 1 (M) or 3 bottles (J)). J was concerned and phoned a friend which settled her. The parents resolved to monitor the situation that night. N continued to be sick during the night feeds although he took a morning feed without doing so.

However, he did not say whether his card had funds on it to permit the same. The tone of J&#8217;s evidence was that finances were very tight at this point.

These symptoms taken together are well recognised to be associated with abusive head trauma and shaking in particular.</span></p>

On the evidence available to me it seems likely this was a single event given the relatively concentrated time period under consideration. Whilst, absent an admission I cannot form an absolutely clear understanding of what happened I am satisfied the applicant is correct to put its case not on the basis of a malicious or conscious wish to inflict harm (which would not fit with the wide canvas of evidence) but a more likely loss of control over a short period during a period/moment of stress or frustration (which is consistent with the wide canvas). I accept the other parent was not present when this happened and medically there is no basis on which that parent could have been aware of what had taken place in their absence. As to the extent of the shake it will have been a motion which any bystander would have considered excessive but it may well have been a limited (and possibly highly limited) number of anterior/posterior motions. In simple terms this could have been one shake which was over in a second or two.</span></p>

That morning N had been normal and this would in my assessment of the evidence have been inconsistent with an already existing injury. At the point at which J left for work he was well. Evidence of his normality can be found in the limited evidence from M of N interacting with him in a small way during the day and taking his first two feeds without incident.</span></p>

One would be looking to place it within the very few minutes of time when M was running the bath and she was making the bottle and undressing N. However, the evidence of the surrounding circumstances and her presentation at that time make this a vanishingly small likelihood and this is fortified by the fact that there is within the lay evidence prior irritability on the part of N surrounding the 6pm feed. Shortly after the bath N was seen to be showing head jerks which I find are associated with the developing encephalopathy. I doubt these presentations would have presented quite so rapidly as a result of a pre-bath shake. They are more consistent with a developing situation over the prior 2-3 hours. Further I would have expected there to have been something of note which M would have seen or heard or sensed had there been a shake during the pre-bath period.</span></p>

There is clear evidence of M being anxious and stressed and impulsive in his behaviour. He was I find still concerned about the relationship with R and had only days earlier sent the picture. I struggle to find him reconciled to the situation. On this day he was caring for N for the full day for the first time and of course J was out of the house all day. This would likely have been playing on M&#8217;s mind. There is evidence of N becoming very upset and crying and of M suffering without sleep and being somewhat distracted by his gaming. Whilst I do not find evidence of alcohol consumption on the day in question it may well be that an inability to soothe by reference to alcohol may have left M more, not less on edge. </span></p>

I can readily see J distinguishing between his attitude to her and to the child. The problematic signs (alcohol and domestic abuse in particular) have been a central part of my analysis and are relevant but I do not consider this is sufficient to find that J in failing to act and protect N prior to May 27 has contributed to what happened.</span></p>

But I am concerned as to her lack of curiosity and the failure to take obvious points to their logical conclusion. She appears to have prioritised the question of the ongoing relationship over a real scrutiny of what the evidence suggested. I should not be thought to be suggesting what she should now do and I leave open the role that M may in due course play in N&#8217;s life but I agree with the applicant that this will be a matter requiring close consideration.</span></p>

I draw nothing from the account of the fall or the occasion of the scan. The former may well have happened and the latter may simply be a matter of language confusion. It is the sort of evidence which parents will often grasp for when seeking an innocent explanation of what happened. I take a similar view as to the seizures and twitching. This is not probative evidence as to dishonesty but likely evidence of a natural wish to find an explanation even if this requires the facts to be reshaped to permit the same. To an extent this is human nature in action.</span></p>

There will be many parents faced by such a dilemma who act without delay and rush to hospital. But I can also empathise with parents in far more challenging circumstances who are forced to weigh a series of countervailing features and come to act with less haste. This tells me nothing as to J&#8217;s understanding as to causation at this time.</span></p>
