	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;margin-right:0.11in">I am concerned with the interests and future of S.  S was born in the Autumn of 2017, so she is now 18 months old.  S is the daughter of her mother, M, and her father, F.  S has lived since her discharge from hospital with FC1 and FC2 (&#8220;the FCs&#8221;) in the capacity initially as foster carers for the Child and Family Agency of Ireland (&#8220;the CFA&#8221;) and latterly, after the English courts accepted the transfer of the care proceedings, as foster carers for an English local authority (&#8220;the LA&#8221;).  S has an older sister, Y, born in the summer of 2013, whom she has never met and who was adopted, following care and placement order proceedings in England, concluding in September 2014, the adoption order being made in 2016.  S also has a younger sibling, X, born in late 2018.  X was also placed by the CFA with the FCs, pursuant to orders in the courts of the Republic of Ireland (&#8220;the RoI&#8221;), at birth.  The girls have lived together, with the FCs, ever since. </p>

The parents, asserting as they do that the SGO represents no more than a holding position while they improve their circumstances, before resuming the care of their daughters in due course, seek an order that contact continue at the level of the last 18 months, that is, thrice weekly.  Conversely, the LA and the CG assert that the placement with the FCs is a permanent one and thus that the purpose served by ongoing contact relates more to imbuing S with a sense of self and identity through her childhood, rather than the perpetuation of a significant, day-to-day relationship with her parents.  The LA would have suggested contact every two months.  The FCs, however, with full knowledge of what is entailed, and currently and, it is thought, for the foreseeable future taking X to contact three times every week, at least through the remainder of the two-year care order made by the courts of the RoI, consider that monthly contact between S and her parents is both manageable and appropriate.  In those circumstances, the LA and the CG do not disagree. </p>

Altered relationships among cognitive, emotional, and sensorimotor (body) levels of information processing are also found to be implicated in trauma symptoms. Sensorimotor Psychotherapy is a method that integrates sensorimotor processing with cognitive and emotional processing in the treatment of trauma. Unassimilated somatic responses evoked in trauma involving both arousal and defensive responses are shown to contribute to many PTSD symptoms and to be critical elements in the use of Sensorimotor Psychotherapy.  </span></p>

Traumatised individuals are plagued by the return of dissociated, incomplete or ineffective sensorimotor reactions in such forms as intrusive images, sounds, smells, body sensations, physical pain, constriction, numbing and the inability to modulate arousal. </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.81in;margin-right:0.31in"><span style="font-style:italic">These unresolved sensorimotor reactions condition emotional and cognitive processing, often disrupting the traumatised person&#8217;s ability to think clearly or to glean accurate information from emotional states.  Conversely, cognitive beliefs and emotional states condition somatic processing.  For instance, a belief such as &#8220;I am helpless&#8221; may interrupt sensorimotor processes of active physical defence; an emotion such as fear may cause sensorimotor processes such as arousal to escalate. Most psychotherapeutic approaches favour emotional and cognitive processing over body processing, and it has been shown that such approaches can greatly relieve trauma symptoms.  </span></p>

The amgydala, a structure in the brain, is part of the limbic system that is involved in the expression of emotion, especially fear, autonomic reactions and emotional memory.  Dysfunction in this structure is linked with traumatic stress reactions.  Traumatic stress alters the way the body responds to stress, affecting mediators such as stress hormones and neurotransmitters.  Music therapy plays a protective role and drumming exercises have been found to greatly reduce stress by altering their brain-wave patterns. </span></p>

This assessment underpinned and informed the LA opinion that ongoing contact between S and her parents after this court&#8217;s final order would serve the purpose of meeting S&#8217;s needs in relation to identity and sense of self.  She was not moved in cross examination to depart from this view.  The LA view had initially been that contact six times each year would adequately fulfil this function.

The LA has not mirrored this stance in relation to the contact with S alone.  Without proper evidence I can take this matter no further.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;margin-right:0.11in">It is important to note that while an adoption order is all but irrevocable, a special guardianship order is susceptible of variation or discharge.  However, the bar is set high: any application to vary or discharge brought by a parent requires leave, which will only be granted if the parent can demonstrate <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a significant change in circumstances since the making of the special guardianship order&#8217;</span>.  (See sub<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 14</ref>D(3)(b) and (5), <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>).  It is important to note that, while establishing a requisite change in circumstances will open the door to being given permission to proceed with an application, it will in no way be determinative of that application.  The paramountcy of the child&#8217;s welfare will, as always, steer the adjudication of the application.  If, effectively, a change of the child&#8217;s place of residence and primary carers was being sought, it is likely that, other things being equal, significant account would be taken of the longevity of the child&#8217;s placement with the special guardian(s), the degree of attachment to them and the likely impact on the child of a significant change in her circumstances.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;margin-right:0.11in">It seems to me that the prospects (a) of the successful conclusion of the proposed therapy, and (b) within the sort of timescales the parents propose, are very much less than solid.  There is a whole host of uncertainties inherent in the proposed process.  First, it is currently unclear whether there is an appropriate provider of the Sensorimotor Psychotherapy required by M.  While it is more likely that F could find appropriate therapists, the second difficulty is funding: I am not persuaded by any evidence that either the CFA or the Irish Health Service will necessarily fund what is identified as needed; nor do I consider it realistic to suppose that the parents will be able to fund this, especially over a sustained period, as they contend.  Thirdly, for both of the parents, the level of engagement and commitment required is huge.  Whether either or both are able to engage to the extent and for the duration needed is entirely untested.  I accept their relative doggedness (as demonstrated, for example, by their move to the RoI in order to defeat the prospect of non-consensual adoption), but what is required to engage in this sort of therapeutic process is of an entirely different magnitude.  Melanie Gill spoke of the mental and physical pain which is to be expected during the therapy she proposes for M; the outpouring of negative memories can be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;very upsetting&#8217;</span> and the process may also be &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">just physically too painful&#8217;</span>; she told me that, for this reason, many are simply unable to maintain attendance and commitment.  The prospects of prolonged, successful engagement are entirely uncertain.  Fourthly, the timescales, it seems to me, are longer than the parents might hope.  In relation to the Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, Melanie Gill&#8217;s evidence was that this would take weekly commitment for <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;at least two years, maybe more.&#8217;</span>   Even at the point of the &#8216;successful&#8217; conclusion of the proposed therapy, it is likely that significant </p>

They began their parenting of S as foster carers for the FCA of Ireland, latterly as foster carers for the English LA.  Across these two guises they have had the care of S for 18 months.  There is no suggestion but that they have provided an excellent standard of care at all times.  It is clear that S is settled in the home and attached to each of them.  I have read a long and comprehensive assessment of them, their lifestyle, their characteristics and their abilities.  It is entirely positive.  I have heard the oral evidence of the English social worker and the CG.  In relation to the FCs, this was also expressed in glowing terms.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;margin-right:0.11in">I have already set out above that this is not and cannot be the intention underpinning or even an aspiration co-existing with the special guardianship order.  The placement with the FCs is to be S&#8217;s long-term placement.  As such, the purpose of the contact between S and her parents changes markedly.  It is no longer contact at a deliberately high level, with a view to its being consistent with a court-ordered assumption by the parents of the care of S at some point in the near future.  Rather, it is contact at a level sufficient for S to have a knowledge of and some relationship with her parents, in order to allow her to establish and maintain a healthy sense of identity, of self and of her life story as she grows.  Moreover, she must be enabled fully to develop in the family now judicially sanctioned as being permanent for her.  The focus must be on her enjoying a normal family life with </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;margin-right:0.11in">None of this is consistent with her seeing her parents at the frequency that she does.  It is of little relevance that X continues to do so: I was told by Mr Leahy that, if there comes a point when the Irish courts or the CFA consider that her reunification with her parents is effectively ruled out, then contact monthly, or even less frequently than that, may well result.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.62in;margin-right:0.11in">In my view, the preference expressed by the FCs that contact between S and her parents take place monthly more than provides for its revised purpose.  The impact on S of the change in her circumstances will be mitigated entirely, in my view, by there being a phased reduction plan (as in fact proposed by the LA) and the fact that she can now spend the time she would have spent in contact enjoying activities with her carers in her baby sister&#8217;s absence. </p>

It was suggested during submissions that the FCs be given absolute discretion to decide the level of contact, the proposed order containing recitals as to their current views in relation to its appropriate frequency and purpose.  If, for whatever reason (and I stress there is currently no suggestion that this would happen) the FCs decided that there should be no contact, or virtually none, and if the order were deemed unassailable in the Irish court due to the provisions of Articles 21 and 26 of BIIa, the parents might wrongly be left with no remedy. </p>
