The father&#8217;s case was that it was always intended to be temporary. The family spent six months in Country B from June to December 2020 and then returned to Country A.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">In February this year the mother contacted a domestic abuse charity stating that she was the victim of emotionally abusive and controlling behaviour. In July she filed for divorce. In August, just as she and N were supposed to be moving to the UK with the father she left him, with the assistance of the local social services department, taking N with her. For two weeks she cut off contact with the father. After that, the father was contacted by the social worker in order to arrange contact with N. At first the mother agreed to overnight staying contact (despite having told social workers earlier that she feared the father would abduct N if he had the opportunity) but then on advice changed her mind. Contact supervised by a social worker was arranged and agreed between the parties. N was dropped off with the social worker by her grandmother. The supervised contact visit took place at a park close to the social work office, but when the social worker was looking the other way the father disappeared with N. When she tried to contact him he did not respond. The police were called but they were not able to find them. It seems that the father must have left Country A with N almost immediately, driving over several borders without detection even though she did not have her passport.</span></p>

The father did, however, provide for the mother to have virtual contact with N  as soon as he arrived here. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">First, a return order as things stand would mean, for N, a sudden change of primary carer. The father&#8217;s case is that he acted as primary carer for her during the relationship because the mother worked, and of course since he brought N to this country in August he has been her sole carer. She is a child who has had to cope, at a very young age, with the separation of her parents, followed by over two weeks where she did not see her father at all, and then a move of country. Before her parents separated she was bound to have been exposed to the toxic relationship between them (including an admitted occasion when the mother spoke very disparagingly about the father to her). This will mean that she is likely to be vulnerable now, as things stand, and could very well be seriously affected by such a dramatic change as the mother proposes. Professor George submits that the mother&#8217;s complete refusal to agree that the father should be able to return with N and to undertake that she can remain in his primary care pending an inter partes hearing is a matter of great concern and demonstrates what is likely to be her attitude upon a return. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">Second, and very much tied up with the first point, is the fact that the mother is only offering virtual contact to the father after a return. Professor George points out that after the mother decided to leave the father taking N with her, he was cut off completely from contact with her, including virtual contact. Virtual contact would not have created any risk of abduction. There is no explanation, Professor George says as to why she did this, which leads the father to fear that a return to Country A will lead to a complete separation between him and his daughter, and she not be permitted to see or have any relationship with him. Whilst there is a hearing listed in Country A on 4</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> January this is only a short hearing where it is unlikely that substantive decisions will be made, such will take a long time to come to fruition. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">The father also states that the mother&#8217;s care of N was at some points, remiss. She allowed N to swallow a stone, which could have been extremely dangerous although fortunately it was not. She also allowed N to fall off a high bed by not ensuring that there were guards around it, and also to slip on wet ground (which she had been warned about) and hit her head on a hard surface. </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">Professor George also points to the mother&#8217;s unwillingness to use her best endeavours to vary the prohibited steps order made by the Country A court which prevents the father from crossing the border with N so that it makes clear that the prohibition should only apply to his leaving the country with her, not entering. This, along with her refusal to agree to an order or undertaking that he should be permitted to return to Country A with N and not to be separated from her pending the first court hearing means that the court cannot ameliorate the grave risk of psychological harm for N if a return is ordered. It also demonstrates, he says, her attitude towards him and the relationship he and N have. The mother, he submits is using the Hague proceedings to bring about an unplanned change of primary carer and to pre-empt a proper decision by the Country A courts at a proper on notice welfare hearing. Further, her proposed undertaking to the court that she will not seek to promote any prosecution of the father for child abduction do not mitigate the risk that he will be arrested if he returns. </span></p>

They are not in themselves of the most serious type, and in any event the father&#8217;s evidence has been contradictory. He argued that the mother should come to England to see N, and he has been willing to facilitate contact (including staying contact) when she did.

N will move suddenly from living in the sole care of her father in England to the sole care of her mother in Country A.

I accept that the father was responsible for caring for N on weekdays when the mother was working during the course of the relationship, but at other times (after the mother finished work and for weekends and holidays) the parties cared for N together. The mother is hardly a stranger to N even since the most recent separation. She has cared for N alone many times before. N will miss her father, of that there is no doubt, but I bear in mind that the court of Country A has had several hearings in this case already and is seized of this case.

In the meantime N will be going to live with her mother who she knows well and to live with her and her grandmother. She will at least be able to have virtual contact with her father. I note that the arguments between the parties when the mother shouted and threw a phone took place when the parties were living under the same roof and things were very fraught. This is unlikely to recur in the same way now they are separated.</span></p>

Nor does the risk of the father being arrested for child abduction. In those circumstances, whilst I accept the undertakings that the mother is offering, I do not need to look to protective measures to ameliorate an Article 13b risk. </span></p>

He quite properly points out that it is a standard feature of cases such as this for the requesting parent to agree to orders (or give undertakings) to ensure first that the other parent is able to return together with the child to the country of habitual residence, and then to remain caring for them pending an inter partes hearing.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">The parents&#8217; relationship has been extremely fraught over the last months and possibly longer. They each make allegations against the other. Proceedings for divorce were issued in Country A in the summer of 2022, and in August social services (or an equivalent) were consulted by the mother. The courts of Country A have made several orders and another hearing is listed on 4</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> January. It seems to me, looking at the documents I have been provided with, that there has been a quite detailed consideration of this family by the judge or judges there. This has included making an order that N should be placed in the custody of her mother. I note the court declined to make this order on the mother&#8217;s first application but did so on the next occasion when it was apparent that the father had removed N to this country. I do not think it would be right for this court to override the decision of the Country A court by making a different order in advance of the next hearing. Making an order that N should remain in the care of her father until that time has a superficial attraction, but looked at more carefully there are risks and benefits either way. In every case where a relationship breaks down with allegations by both sides, difficult interim decisions have to be made. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">One of the risks in this case is of a further abduction if N is not returned to the care of her mother to take back to Country A. The father&#8217;s act in removing N during a period of supervised contact and bringing her to this country across several borders without a passport was deceitful to say the least. Although I can understand his distress and frustration at the mother&#8217;s decision not to move to England, at her disappearance and lack of contact with N for over two weeks (plus disappointment at a change of contact arrangements) the father&#8217;s conduct was very serious, particularly as he refused to tell the mother his address in England unless and until she was prepared to come over to visit N. I note the reason that the mother told the professionals in Country A in August that she was worried about direct contact was the risk of abduction, so her assessment of what the father might do turned out to be justified. Professor George submits that the father would be very unlikely to breach an order made here, because this is the place he wishes to live and work, but this is still a less safe option than placement with the mother. In any event, in my judgment it is the courts of Country A which are best placed to assess the risk of future abduction and how to protect N after her arrival in that country. </span></p>
