	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an ex-tempore judgment, given when I am making an order by consent. I am sitting in the Family Drugs and Alcohol Court (FDAC) where I am concerned with C who is a boy born on 22 June 2023. He is the son of the first and second respondents. The Applicant Local Authority issued care proceedings shortly after his birth. They sought and I made, an interim care order on 23 June 2023, authorising his separation from the parents into a foster placement. </p>

Mother&#8217;s three older children could not remain in her care due to her drug use and involvement in abusive relationships. Mother accepts using crack cocaine while she was pregnant with C. Father has a history of cocaine and alcohol misuse. He has an extensive criminal history. The parents, at the time of C&#8217;s birth, were making efforts to deal with these issues, but struggled to engage on a consistent basis with support services and found it difficult to be open with and trusting of professionals.</p>

It has to be said that the parents, much to the delight of all concerned, have not looked back since. The FDAC programme is an opportunity for parents to gain the support they require, with the skilled expertise of a variety of professionals and other sources of support. It is intense and extremely demanding, particularly for parents who have a long history of avoiding and hiding from authority figures. These parents have grasped this opportunity with both hands. </p>

The parents will receive continued support from the same professionals to ensure that the recovery they have started is maintained and built upon. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C was moved to a foster placement shortly after birth. In December 2023 he transitioned to the care of his parents and is thriving. Despite their past experiences and behaviours, the parents have achieved and maintained abstinence from illicit substances, they have engaged in therapeutic work to address their past trauma and have engaged in painful safer relationships work. They have been open and fully reflective and are able to articulate the benefits of this and how they have put the learning into practice. They have attended court every fortnight and in every non-lawyer review, have been very open with me about the challenges of the process. Since C has been in their care, they have shown that they are able to provide a safe, healthy and stable environment in which he can live. They are attuned to C&#8217;s needs and are working together to meet them. They still have a long way to go with many challenges ahead and they will need to show the same determination and resilience, as well as the confidence to seek support when needed. This, in my judgment is why a Supervision Order is necessary. It will ensure that there is a &#8220;soft landing&#8221; after the FDAC process, where C is supported in his family by the same people who have built up a solid, open relationship with the parents. However, C is safe and happy and nothing more than this order is required or would be proportionate.</p>

Children belong with their parents if that can be safely achieved.</p>

They have responded to this. Some parents require more help than others yet with a team of skilled professionals, providing targeted, intensive treatment and support, can still break their harmful patterns of behaviour. In this case, I have reviewed the progress with these parents every two weeks, always keeping an eye on the timescale for C. These parents have received encouragement, praise and challenge throughout and have learnt, despite their history, to trust in a system and professionals that will give them a voice and work with them.</p>
