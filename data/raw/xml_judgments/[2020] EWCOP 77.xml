At the age of 16, DK went into the care of [Area B] council. There have been a series of placements in different areas of the country. DK&#8217;s ongoing exposure to sexual exploitation and trafficking led to involvement by the National Referral Mechanism. In October 2019, DK moved placement once more (to Leeds) after she spoke of an imminent plan to marry an older man whom she barely knew. DK had given her address to this man and was at risk of exploitation. She spent some time in one placement in Leeds before moving to her current placement. &#160;</span></p>

Accordingly, the joinder application by KK was adjourned with my approval until 16 June 2020 which was the soonest date that I could hear it whilst also allowing sufficient time for alternative counsel (Ben McCormack) to be instructed to act for KK.  The issue of disclosure remained listed before me, as HHJ Lynch had directed, on the morning of 22 May 2020 when I heard submissions on behalf of LCC and DK. However, I did not give any Judgment then on that issue. The issue of disclosure only requires determination </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">if </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">the Court is satisfied that the test for joinder of KK as a party is satisfied.

If she is joined, then &#8211; as Mr McCormack submitted &#8211; there would need to be a further hearing at which he could address the Court further on behalf of KK (albeit submissions for KK would have to be made in the absence of knowing the information sought to be withheld).      </span></p>

All counsel have put their respective cases in a skilled and measured manner in seeking to persuade the court of their opposing positions.  It has proved to be a challenging task in balancing the factors which pull in opposite directions. To complicate matters further, in opposing the joinder application, LCC and the Official Solicitor rely upon written evidence which has not been disclosed to KK. That evidence is material to the balancing exercise which informs the court&#8217;s decision. But it cannot be disclosed to KK because, to do so would - of itself - be to act contrary to DK&#8217;s best interests.  This means that KK (and those who act for her) are unaware of what that written evidence contains and why it is said to weigh against her joinder application.  This has necessitated this Court preparing a Supplemental Judgment (not to be seen by KK or her legal representatives) which addresses that evidence. This is an unusual course but one that was proposed to the Court as the best way of ensuring that DK&#8217;s interests are protected.</span></p>

It is emphasised on KK&#8217;s behalf that she has played a parenting role in DK&#8217;s life since the age of 4 months. DK calls her &#8220;mum&#8221; and regards KK&#8217;s children as her siblings.

Mr McCormack made clear on behalf of KK that she denied exerting an improper degree of control over DK and that KK&#8217;s case was that DK depended upon her and would phone her regularly. As to the specific incident recently when DK attempted to take an overdose of medication, Mr McCormack confirmed (as LCC&#8217;s Position Statement acknowledges in its final sentence) that KK completely denied acting in the manner alleged. In relation to paragraph 7(i), it was acknowledged on KK&#8217;s behalf that KK had made allegations which had been investigated by the police. KK, he said, would take any step necessary to assist in the determination of the facts by the Court of Protection.  At the core of his submission was that if LCC advances a case that these are </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">facts</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial"> that the court needs to decide to determine welfare issues, then the only way that this could be dealt with was by joining KK as a party, enabling her to see the evidence relied on and giving her the opportunity, with the benefit of a lawyer representing her, to present her case in response.  He also made the point, conversely, that if LCC took the decision that allegations impugning KK were not claimed to be so important as to require a court fact-finding process, then such &#8220;insignificant&#8221; facts (the word used by Mr McCormack at paragraph 6 of his Position Statement dated 15 June 2020) could not justify the exclusion of KK from proceedings to which she would, in the ordinary course of events, be joined as a party.</span></p>

If the threshold is crossed, then the Court proceeds to makes its welfare determination for the child concerned. A Local Authority bringing such proceedings is required to establish facts on the balance of probabilities that (when protective measures were taken) the child was suffering or was likely to suffer significant harm attributable to the care given or likely to be given to the child, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give.  The &#8220;attributability&#8221; limb of that statutory test, therefore, requires the court to make determinations of fact which relate to the standard of care that the child received or is likely to receive.</span></p>

He submitted that joinder would enable KK to see the evidence (subject to any directions for non-disclosure), provide her own account of DK&#8217;s background, her current circumstances and what she (KK) believes DK&#8217;s wishes and feelings to be.

He submitted that the court&#8217;s case management powers to control what KK can and cannot see as a party was the way of striking, &#8220;the proper balance between the (claimed) need to protect DK by preventing KK from seeing particular aspects of the case, and the need for the court to hear from a close family member as to the issues at the heart of this case&#8221; (Position Statement 15 June 2020, paragraph 15).  Mr McCormack developed these points in oral submissions. He emphasised that KK should be given the opportunity, not just as someone consulted under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.4(7)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, but rather as a party playing a role in the legal process. As Mr McCormack put it, KK should participate &#8220;sitting in the theatre, not sitting in the wings&#8221;.  On the issue of DK&#8217;s residence, he confirmed that KK was not advancing the case that DK should return home but that KK&#8217;s wish was for DK to move to an area much closer to KK&#8217;s home in [Area B]. On the issue of contact, he said that KK&#8217;s wish was for unsupervised contact whilst being &#8220;open minded to reasonable points&#8221; made against that position. But, he said, what she wants is the opportunity to put that case as a party and to see the evidence which founds the basis of a different approach. </span></p>

What is being submitted on behalf of KK is that to ensure that the case is dealt with fairly and to ensure that the parties are on an equal footing, the court should join KK as a party to enable her to be involved in the process.  Disputes &#8211; such as there are &#8211; as to best interest decisions for DK would then fall to be resolved by the court with KK present and participating as a party. These are all important considerations with, I say now, have weighed heavily with me in the decision that I am tasked with making.  </span></p>

The complexity is added to by the fact that LCC and the Official Solicitor rely upon written evidence filed in the substantive proceedings the content of which cannot be revealed to KK as, they submit, to do so would be wholly contrary to DK&#8217;s best interests.  They submit that that evidence (placed within the wider context of DK circumstances and vulnerabilities) weigh heavily on the other side of the balance as the effect of joining KK will lead to consequences which cannot be DK&#8217;s best interests. Further, to take any step of revealing that evidence to KK would be contrary to DK&#8217;s best interests.  This is not remedied, they submit, through the court joining KK as a party and then exercising its powers to redact or limit disclosure of information to KK.  The act of joining KK, in itself, would be to take a step contrary to DK&#8217;s best interests and therefore cannot meet the &#8220;desirability test&#8221;.</span></p>

A proper structure to enable this to happen is essential for DK.
