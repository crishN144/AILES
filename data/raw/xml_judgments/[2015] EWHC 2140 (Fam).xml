This is but the barest outline of the welfare concerns in that case but it suffices to illustrate why Keehan J was so highly motivated to use all the weapons in the court&#8217;s armoury to protect the child and to restrict the behaviour of those who were so cynically abusing her.</p>

In December 2014 HHJ Sapnara heard a fact finding hearing within care proceedings brought by this Local Authority.  Proceedings had been instituted in August 2014.  The subject children were SA, a girl age 17; AA a girl of 14; AN a boy aged 10 and ZA a boy aged 6.  SNA, the respondent in this application is the father of the two boys and the stepfather of the two girls.  At the conclusion of that hearing Judge Sapnara made extensive findings against SNA amounting to systematic grooming of SA over a number of years form a very young age.  It also involved the use of violence and eventually rape per vagina and anus.  The Judge describe SNA in these terms, in her judgment dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2014:</p>

His conduct betrays a significant amount of planning and preparation and grooming involved in the abuse of SA over a number of years from a very young age.  This constitutes a sustained course of abuse.  The escalating nature of the types of abuse that SA has outlined has the ring of truth about it, starting with touching and ending up in full sexual intercourse and discharge of semen.  That progression of abuse is entirely consistent with her developmental progress.&#8221;</span></p>

During this, my most recent interview with [SNA], he disclosed that colleagues at his workplace would leave children in his care. In my view this poses a direct child protection concern and should any of these children be females, in my opinion [SNA] would pose a direct sexual risk to these females.  In my view, it is essential that [SNA] is prevented from having any form of unsupervised access to female adolescence or old pubescent, including in his workplace.&#8221;</span></p>

The Judge will usually be assisted by expert evidence but it is the judge who has the ultimate responsibility not the expert.  The judge HHJ Sapnara found SNA to have perpetrated severe sexual assaults on a child.  To my mind, in the face of his continuing denial, the risk of reoffending remains unquantifiable and therefore must be regarded as high.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are important issues and I reserved judgment to reflect on the arguments.  The concept of the &#8216;inherent jurisdiction&#8217; is by it&#8217;s nature illusive to definition.  Certainly it is &#8216;amorphous&#8217; (see paragraph 14 above) and, to the extent that the High Court has repeatedly been able to utilise it to make provision for children and vulnerable adults not otherwise protected by statute, can, I suppose be described as &#8216;pervasive&#8217;.  But it is not &#8216;ubiquitous&#8217; in the sense that it&#8217;s reach is all- pervasive or unlimited.  Precisely because it&#8217;s powers are not based either in statute or in the common law it requires to be used sparingly and in a way that is faithful to its evolution.  It is for this reason that any application by a Local Authority to invoke the inherent jurisdiction may not be made as of right but must surmount the hurdle of an application for leave pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s100 (4)</ref> and meet the criteria there. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The point is illuminated by considering the fetters that exist on the scope of the inherent jurisdiction in those cases where the needs of an individual child are in issue.  In Holmes-Moorhouse v Richmond Upon Thames London Borough Council <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2009/7" uk:canonical="[2009] UKHL 7" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] UKHL 7</ref> the House of Lords emphasised that a child who is a Ward of Court cannot be regarded as having special privileges, nor has the High Court any power to obtain access to resources for a Ward which would not be available otherwise.  The same principle is reflected in the situation of the incapacitous adult see: Aintree University Hospitals Foundation Trust v James and Others <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/67" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 67" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 67</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Not only is the scope of the inherent jurisdiction restricted but the interface between the Family Court or the Court of Protection and Public Authorities is subtle.  Thus the High Court may try to persuade a Public Authority to act in a way which the court considers to be in the best interest of the child but it must not allow itself to be utilised to exert pressure on a public authority see: R v Secretary of State for Home Department ex p T <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 293" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 293</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The development of Judicial Review, as illustrated by ex parte T (supra), has also served to curtail the exercise of the powers of the inherent jurisdiction.  No power be it statutory, common law or under the prerogative is, in principle, unreviewable.  The High Court&#8217;s inherent powers are limited both by the constitutional role of the court and by its institutional capacity.  The principle of separation of powers confers the remit of economic and social policy on the legislature and on the executive, not on the Judiciary.  It follows that the inherent jurisdiction cannot be regarded as a lawless void permitting judges to do whatever we consider to be right for children or the vulnerable, be that in a particular case or more generally (as contended for here) towards unspecified categories of  children or vulnerable adults.</p>

However well intentioned the ambition to prevent child sexual exploitation generally, this is ultimately to make a utilitarian calculation of social policy.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">The first is that in my opinion the courts of this jurisdiction should be extremely circumspect in assuming any jurisdiction in relation to children physically present in some other jurisdiction founded only on the basis of nationality. Parens patriae jurisdiction has a fine resounding history. However its practical significance has been much diminished domestically since the codification of much child law within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. In order to achieve essential collaboration internationally it has been necessary to relax reliance upon concepts understood only in common law circles. Thus our historic emphasis on the somewhat artificial concept of domicile has had to cede to an acknowledgement that the simpler fact based concept of habitual residence must be the currency of international exchange. The parens patriae concept must seem even more esoteric to other jurisdictions than the concept of domicile. If we are to look for reciprocal understanding and co-operation, so vital with the steady increase in mobility and mixed marriage together with an equal decrease in the significance of international frontiers, we must refrain from exorbitant jurisdictional claims founded on nationality. To make a declaration of unlawful detention in relation to a child of dual nationality cared for by a biological parent in a jurisdiction whose courts have sanctioned the arrangement by order is only to invite incomprehension, and perhaps even stronger reactions, in that other jurisdiction.&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;I accept Mr Everall's submission that the decision nearest in point is the judgment of Ward J in F v S (Wardship: Jurisdiction) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 2 FLR 349" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 2 FLR 349</ref>. In that case Ward J held that where the court in wardship did not have jurisdiction under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> to make an order in relation to a child's care and control it should not assume inherent jurisdiction to make an order for the recovery of the child. In his judgement he categorised such an order as 'a devious entry to the court by the back door where parliament has so firmly shut the front door'. Although his judgment was subsequently reversed on the facts, his conclusions on jurisdiction were not criticised. In my opinion by analogy there is equally no jurisdiction to make a declaration of wrongful detention in similar circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>

I recognise that in this and on this point only I disagree with the approach taken by Keehan J in the Birmingham case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When Keehan J heard the arguments in the Birmingham case these provisions had not come into force and accordingly, the protection that they offer was, at that stage, not available.  I have been told by Mr Lefteri that an application has been made to a Magistrate&#8217;s Court in respect of SNA it is believed that the conditions for the making of such an order are met.  That will ultimately be a matter for the Magistrates Court.  It would seem therefore, that the protection contemplated in this application may, in due course, be available.  Recognising this from the outset Mr Lefteri sought orders in this Court in an attempt to &#8216;hold the ring&#8217; until orders have been made in the criminal courts.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are sound reasons why the criminal courts are the correct venue to consider the making of these orders.  Firstly, and most obviously, Parliament, after proper scrutiny, has carefully defined the scope and ambit of the provisions.  Secondly, notwithstanding the considerable advancements made in achieving much greater levels of transparency in the Family Court, a judge sitting in this jurisdiction will invariably have to protect the identity of the child and in order to do so, preserve, by a side wind, the anonymity of a perpetrator.  I do not believe any right minded person having read my short review of the facts of this case (above) would consider it appropriate to expose this young girl to the inevitable harm of publicity.  The Press, in my experience, have been assiduous in their respect of this principle.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the Criminal Courts however, the focus is different.  There is now, rightly, much greater emphasis on the &#8216;victim&#8217; but that is wholly different to the range of the enquiry necessary in the Family Courts.  In the Criminal Court, where the liberty of the individual is in issue, the public interest in the administration of the criminal justice system must always weigh heavily.  The Criminal Courts are now, frequently, able to conduct trials entirely in the public domain whilst at the same time protecting the identity of the Complainant and, where necessary, his or her relationship to the Defendant.  Certainly, where the Complainant is a minor, society recognises the necessity of this measure.  The family justice system is unlikely to replicate this.  Thirdly, the responsibility for the policing of such orders rest with the police who are far better equipped than social services to monitor compliance.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the light of everything I have set out above it is plain that I have accepted undertakings which, if they had been declined, I would have had no jurisdictional basis upon which to make similar orders.  Judges frequently accept undertakings which are beyond the scope of their specific statutory powers.  This occurs regularly in child abduction cases and in cases involving the Hague Convention.  In the field of matrimonial finance judges will accept and encourage undertakings for example, in respect of the reallocation of stocks and shares or the restructuring of partnership assets which they would be unable to order.  In both these examples however, undertakings are accepted because they further the central objectives of the relevant litigation.  Thus in Hague Convention / abduction cases, undertakings will be given which promote the objective of international comity which is central to the philosophy of the relevant law and Conventions.  In matrimonial finance, undertakings will be accepted which give effect to the very broad criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> and to the prevailing philosophy which encourages resolution of disputes by the parties themselves wherever possible and the promotion of the principle of &#8216;the clean break&#8217;. </p>

These undertakings, in my judgement, do not fall either within the objectives of the applicable legislative framework or within the parameters of the powers of the inherent jurisdiction.   They are entirely extraneous to both.  Having reflected therefore, I do not consider it to have been appropriate in the circumstances to have invited such undertakings from the Respondent.  I propose to discharge them.    </p>
