	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">William Ward was born on 21 April 2005. On 21 July 2005 he was discovered to have fractures of his right tibia. On 16 December 2005 the local authority, Cambridgeshire County Council (&#8220;CCC&#8221;), began care proceedings. The case was based entirely upon the fractures, for CCC accepted that there was no other evidence of ill&#8211;treatment or poor parenting. A fact&#8211;finding hearing, to establish whether the threshold for making a care order had been passed, took place in the County Court before Her Honour Judge Plumstead.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In May 2006, at a conference in London organised by the Eaton Foundation, a support group for families accused of harming their children, the parents met Karen Wightman, a producer/director in the BBC&#8217;s documentaries department. Shortly afterwards the parents began recording a video diary of their experiences, using equipment and tapes supplied by the BBC, with a view to the footage being included in a documentary programme which it was envisaged the BBC might prepare and broadcast on television. There are now 14 tapes representing some 14 hours recording. It is important to note what the mother says in her witness statement. She states &#8220;categorically&#8221; that &#8220;there has been no covert filming of any professionals or anyone at all involved in the case&#8221; other than the family. &#8220;There has been no filming &#8230; of anyone who has had anything to do with the case apart from our family.&#8221; (The word &#8220;of&#8221; does not appear in the statement but counsel for the mother confirmed to me on instructions that this was a slip and that the statement was indeed to be read with the word inserted.) Were the documentary to be made it might incorporate some 30&#8211;45 minutes of the video footage.</p>

The qualification &#8211; and it was a major qualification &#8211; was that various participants in the process wished to preserve their anonymity. There was no objection to the public identification of the family, the child, the children&#8217;s guardian, CCC, the hospital or the Cambridgeshire Constabulary. But the social workers, the police officer, and some at least of the treating doctors and the expert witnesses preferred to preserve their anonymity.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With a view to meeting these objections, at least for the immediate future, the BBC proposed a more limited form of order. In the first place, the BBC accepted that Judge Plumstead&#8217;s judgment should be published with the names of the social workers, the police officer, the expert witnesses and those of the treating doctors employed by the Trust removed. Secondly, the BBC offered, in addition to the previously proffered assurance that the BBC would not disclose into the public domain or to third parties outside the BBC any of the video footage &#8220;if and insofar as such disclosure would constitute a breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref>,&#8221; the further assurance that it would give 14 days&#8217; notice in writing to all of those individuals and to the children&#8217;s guardian of any intention to &#8220;broadcast&#8221; anything &#8220;from the video footage&#8221; which identifies them. When I pointed out that this would not prevent the BBC identifying individuals either by means other than a broadcast (for example, by publishing their names in the <span style="font-style:italic">Radio Times</span>) or, indeed, by broadcasting their names otherwise than by means of the video footage (for example, by a voiceover or in the course of an interview with the parents), Mr Busuttil readily agreed that this was not what had been intended and that, in principle, the BBC was prepared to give notice of any intention to identify, irrespective of the medium or the means.</p>

It also forms the basis of many decisions in a democratic society which are fundamental to its well-being: whom to employ or work for, whom to promote, whom to do business with or to vote for. Once besmirched by an unfounded allegation in a national newspaper, a reputation can be damaged for ever, especially if there is no opportunity to vindicate one&#8217;s reputation. When this happens, society as well as the individual is the loser. For it should not be supposed that protection of reputation is a matter of importance only to the affected individual and his family. Protection of reputation is conducive to the public good. It is in the public interest that the reputation of public figures should not be debased falsely.&#8221;</p>

It is accordingly content to consent to the order being sought by the BBC. Subject to issues of anonymisation, the application is not opposed by either CCC or the Cambridgeshire Constabulary. The same goes for the Trust and for Doctor A and Doctor B, though both, through the mouths of, respectively, Mr David Lock and Mr Brompton, made submissions to the effect that the form of order being proposed by the BCC was inadequate to protect their anonymity in the way which, as they would have it, was necessary if their Convention rights were to be properly safeguarded.</p>

Social workers and police officers in child protection teams, in contrast, are employed in jobs which, in the nature of things, mean that they will not infrequently &#8211; social workers more frequently than police officers &#8211; have to give evidence in care proceedings, evidence which is often a mixture of historical fact and opinion.

This work, though very important, is voluntary. The concern is that if expert witnesses in care cases are publicly identified this will be likely to lead to a further drain on the already diminishing pool of doctors and other experts willing to do child protection work. Doctors and experts in other disciplines may be yet further disinclined to do such work if they see that the evidence they give to the court on the understanding that it (and their own identities) will remain confidential may become public knowledge and be the subject of public criticism. The already inadequate number of experts willing to assist the courts in vitally important child protection cases may, it is feared, be even further reduced. </p>

He points to <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Disclosure)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/411" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 411 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 411 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 142" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 142</ref>, as showing the extent of the problem faced by medical staff. He says that as long as the relevant doctors and other medical staff are continuing to treat children and possibly refer them to social services for suspected child abuse, there is a danger that the events surrounding this case could be publicised. He therefore suggests that a period of up to 20 years (being the approximate period the individual clinicians will continue to work) is potentially needed before the matters could be considered so stale that they would not attract this type of danger if referred to in a broadcast. Recognising the reach of this submission he points, however, to the fact that at all times any media outlet wishing to broadcast or publish would of course have the right to apply to vary the terms of the order.</p>

He asserts that the guiding principle is that the order should last for no longer than is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it is made: see paragraph 6 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Note</span>. The relevant concern here, he says, is the possibility of a television programme broadcast by the BBC which identifies the individuals. Once that concern has gone, if any of them consider that they need further protection against the world at large, they should at that stage, he says, make an application for an injunction in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Note</span>. Furthermore, he says, 28 days after notification by the BBC that the &#8216;television programme of concern&#8217; has gone, pending which they will continue to have the benefit of the protection provided by an order in such terms, should be sufficient time for any of them to prepare an application for further injunctive relief.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Brompton&#8217;s response was to suggest that Mr Busuttil&#8217;s proposal was wholly inadequate. As it stands, he submits, the BBC or the family could &#8211; after the broadcast has taken place or the decision taken not to broadcast &#8211; convey the doctors&#8217; identities to any other organ of the media, who could themselves publish the information with impunity. The right of the individuals affected to make an application if they consider they need further protection against the world at large at that stage, he says, is hollow, for they will know nothing of the intentions of others, whose interest in the matter may have been stirred by a BBC broadcast. He submits that if a <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum</span> order is necessary now, it will be even more necessary then. Mr Busuttil&#8217;s answer was to point out that the order would continue in force in any event until 28 days after BBC has given written notification; in other words, the individuals affected would have 28 days thereafter in which, if so advised, to apply to the court for further injunctive relief <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum</span> or against any specific person in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref> and the <span style="font-style:italic">President&#8217;s Practice Direction </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Note</span>.</p>

He submitted that, in the context of this case and, in particular, having regard to the fact that the BBC has been a party to these proceedings, there is no material distinction between (a) re-applying on notice via the Press Association and (b) serving notice of the existing order (with liberty to the <span style="font-style:italic">mundum</span> to apply to discharge), adding that the former will certainly involve the incurring of another set of costs whilst the latter may not.</p>

It is, in my judgment, the more principled solution. It gives those who are arguably entitled to anonymity protection until just after the event (the broadcast by the BBC) when their anonymity might otherwise be imperilled by the disclosure of the video footage to the BBC which I have authorised. And it gives them adequate time, once the BBC has given them notice, to mount any further application which they may wish to bring in order to continue their anonymity. In the meantime, as I have pointed out, the effect of the <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum </span>injunction will not merely be to prohibit the world at large identifying the social workers, the police officer, the treating doctors and the expert witnesses; it will also prohibit the BBC identifying them in any broadcast unless the BBC has first successfully applied to vary or discharge the injunction.</p>

And it is not for the judge who grants such an injunction to stipulate in advance how such an application, when made, is to be dealt with by the court &#8211; perhaps many years in the future (as in <span style="font-style:italic">British Broadcasting Company v Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council and X and Y</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/2862" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 2862 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 2862 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 101" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 101</ref>) and in circumstances that may be unforeseen or even unforeseeable.

It seems to me not unreasonable to require the BBC in these circumstances to give rather more notice than would otherwise be required. And after all, albeit the actual terms of the assurance proffered by the BBC were not altogether satisfactory, the fact is that the BBC has acknowledged (see paragraph [11] above) that it should give some degree of prior notice of its intentions to those affected by the relief it has (in the event successfully) sought.</p>

As against that, and looking to the realities of a situation where the BBC will know, much sooner than 14 days&#8217; before, precisely when such a documentary will be broadcast, I am wholly unpersuaded that I will be inflicting any disproportionate burden on the BBC by requiring it to give 28 days&#8217; notice.</p>
