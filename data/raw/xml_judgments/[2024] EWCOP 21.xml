On the 12 June 2023 the Judge had a separate meeting with ZZ, who then remained present in the hearing during Dr Rippon&#8217;s evidence. The Judge considered the written submissions from the parties and in his judgment dated 1 August 2023 he made the following findings about ZZ&#8217;s capacity: that he had capacity to make decisions about residence; engage in sexual relations; contraception, and to marry. It was agreed ZZ lacked capacity to conduct proceedings; make decisions about care and support and internet and social media use. The Judge determined he lacked capacity to make decisions about contact with others.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to this hearing the local authority provided further updated information from the allocated social worker, reporting that although ZZ remained in a relationship with TD he also expressed a desire to engage in sexual relations with other female students at his college. The placement also report that ZZ&#8217;s risky and impulsive behaviour is increasingly difficult to anticipate and manage. ZZ&#8217;s multi-disciplinary team continue to meet regularly and the minutes report heightened concern about ZZ&#8217;s anxiety, impulsivity, fixations, comments and deviant behaviour. Mr O&#8217;Brien submits this provides further evidence of the connection identified by Dr Rippon between ZZ&#8217;s complex conditions and his obsessive behaviour, with the result that there is a collective concern that ZZ is at high risk of reoffending sexually due to the anxiety and stress which he is experiencing. Ms Roper submits the court should disregard this evidence in this hearing, which is an appeal against the order on 1 August 2023 on the basis of the evidence available to the court at that time. I agree with Ms Roper. For the purposes of this appeal hearing I have not taken into account the recent updating information.</p>

The first question is whether P is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter. Where the matter relates to sexual relations it will ordinarily be formulated in a non-specific way, although he recognised that there can be situations where the matter for decision can properly be described as person-specific. In those circumstances the information relevant to the decision may be different. At [74] Lord Stephens stated <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The importance of P's ability under section 3(1)(a) MCA to understand information relevant to a decision is also specifically affected by whether there could be "serious grave consequences" flowing from the decision. Paragraph 4.19 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> Code of Practice provides: "If a decision could have serious or grave consequences, it is even more important that a person understands the information relevant to that decision." This again illustrates the importance of "the specific factual context of the case." In this case, for instance, there would be "serious or grave consequences" for JB's mental health if he was incarcerated, see para 40 above. Other potential "serious or grave consequences" for JB would include anxiety, depression, self- harm and retaliatory harm requiring hospitalisation, see paras 10, 17, 38 and 40 above. There could also be "serious or grave consequences" for others if they were the victims of sexual assaults or of rapes perpetrated by JB. These "serious or grave consequences" make it "even more important [in this case] that [ JB] understands the information relevant to" the decision to engage in or consent to sexual relations.&#8221;</span> Although making it clear in [75] there should be a practical limit as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;To require a potentially incapacitous person to be capable of envisaging more consequences than persons of full capacity would derogate from personal autonomy.&#8221;</span></p>

The unpalatable truth is that some capacitous individuals commit sexual assault, even rape, but also have consensual sexual relations. An individual with learning disability, ASDF, or other impairment, may act in the same way, but it is only if they lack capacity to make decisions about engaging in sexual relations that the Court of Protection may interfere&#8217;.</span> In that case the expert evidence, which Poole J accepted, concluded that PN surrenders to his impulse because of his character and outlook, not because of his impairment. His impairments did not cause him to lose his control in other fields of activity, or his sexual control in other settings. His sexual impulsivity was not a manifestation of his ASD and/or learning disability. As Poole J  stated at [16] &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">There is no pattern of impulsivity due to his impairments of which his sexual offending is a part. When with his brother or others whose disapprobation he might want to avoid, he controls any impulses to sexually touch women. He disregards the need for consent but he is able to use the information he retains, namely that the consent of the other person is necessary&#8217;.</span> In that case, on its particular facts, Poole J considered there was no inconsistency in the court finding PN lacks capacity to have contact with others but does have capacity to engage in sexual relations, as he accepted the expert evidence that PN understands sexual boundaries but he does not understand social boundaries. Poole J continued at [28] PN <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">sometimes stares at other people and he stares at women&#8217;s breasts. He knows, as I have found, that he</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">ought not to touch them without their consent. He retains that understanding, and can weigh or use the information even when the urge takes him to touch the other person. However, he does not have the same understanding in relation to staring at or speaking to others. He does not understand the foreseeable consequences of speaking offensively to others, but he does understand the foreseeable consequences of touching them without consent. His lack of understanding in relation to non-sexual contact with others is because of his impairments. That was the conclusion of Dr Ince. Mr Curran&#8217;s evidence is consistent with that conclusion. Sexual boundaries are perhaps clearer and so more easily understood by PN even with his impairments, whereas social boundaries are less clear to him and are not understood by him because of his impairments.&#8221;</span></p>

In her opinion ZZ <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;over-estimates his ability to resist the compulsive urges which he presents with at times&#8217;.</span> She considered he remains at risk of displaying sexually harmful behaviour towards others, particularly children and vulnerable adults. In relation to girlfriends Dr Rippon considered ZZ&#8217;s risk would depend upon their own characteristics, and given his sexual behaviour, whilst he understands that a girlfriend has to consent before having sex she believed ZZ could be quite coercive towards more vulnerable females. In relation to members of the public, ZZ could be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;opportunistic and, if he was experiencing urges and compulsions around sex, he may target others if he is given an opportunity to do so&#8217;. </span>Dr Rippon regards ZZ&#8217;s level of risk is most apparent when he is unsupervised and she considers he can evade supervision.</p>

Dr Rippon considered <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230;that would be one aspect, but I think it is also about ZZ&#8217;s relationship with his proposed partner, how long that that has been, what his feelings are towards her, how invested he is in that relationship, that that would be I think a factor that could help him not act on these urges that he has&#8217;.</span> She went on to explain that what she considers would prevent ZZ from acting on his compulsions or obsessions would be the adverse consequences regarding his relationship with TD, for example her ending the relationship.

Where ZZ is determined to lack capacity to make decisions about his care a further determination that ZZ lacks capacity to decide where to live is not an invariable requirement for the court to authorise a deprivation of liberty in the community. The accommodation is the vehicle for care and treatment. In principle, she submits, there should be no difference whether the placement is in the community or in a care home.

Ms Roper submits whilst there is no dispute ZZ does lack insight, it is quite a leap to say he lacks insight into every part of his behaviour.</p>

The Judge stated [43] <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Dr Rippon did consider that [ZZ] was able to make decisions about contact with [TD] because he knows her so well and has a strong emotional attachment to her. Her concerns about [TD] were about [ZZ&#8217;s] sexual impulsivity and what she considered to be his lack of insight into that aspect of his thinking. That impulsivity equally applies to strangers as it does to [TD], it seems to me. That is because [ZZ], whilst recognising that he is liable to be sexually disinhibited, is unable to do anything about it. That is the essence of the risk that makes him lack capacity when deciding whether to have contact with the world in general. I am unable to see how that situation is any different when it comes to contact with [TD]. Since [ZZ] lacks capacity to make decisions about his contact with people in general because of his inability to understand the risks he poses to others, and his inability, therefore, to mitigate those risks, I am persuaded that he lacks the capacity to make decisions about contact with his mother and [TD].&#8221;</span></p>

The information about what support he would need, with whom he could live and how he would have contact with family and friends are all relevant to the question of whether ZZ understands and can weigh up whether he would be able to live with TD. These were issues explored with him by Dr Rippon. In connection with that he was clear to Dr Rippon that he did not need support from staff.  When asked about this in oral evidence Dr Rippon stated that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;It was mainly in relation to care, the care aspect of any residence that I thought that he lacked capacity in&#8230;if there was an alternative placement available for him, I think he could compare and contrast two placements with the same level of care.&#8217;</span> She considered in her discussions with ZZ what he said about living with TD was more than a pipedream as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230;during the course of both interviews that was what he wanted, that&#8217;s where he wanted to live, that was his&#8230;the place that, you know, that they&#8217;d identified as where he did want to live.&#8217;</span></p>

To do that would have required the Judge to analyse ZZ&#8217;s ability to understand relevant information about the need for the care and support and use or weigh it in reaching a decision.
