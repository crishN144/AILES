I am told she considers herself to be a &#8220;Geordie&#8221;, a point which is of some relevance to the issue of jurisdiction that I will need to determine.  LM is currently in a placement in Scotland subject to interim orders from this court which, among other matters, deprive her of her liberty.  The application was originally brought in 2019, just after LM&#8217;s eighteenth birthday.  As I explain in greater detail below, there has been significant delay in bringing this matter to a final hearing and throughout the hearings to date the court has proceeded on the basis of interim declarations concerning LM&#8217;s capacity and the question of her habitual residence.  </p>

In the light of the written evidence that has been filed and the oral evidence that I have heard, the only point of significant dispute remaining between the parties relates to the question of LM&#8217;s capacity to make decisions regarding her use of the internet and social media.  However, there are other points that I need to resolve in this judgment, not least questions that arise concerning this court&#8217;s continuing jurisdiction to make orders in relation to LM.  Before I do so, I will set out some of the background to this case.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">LM&#8217;s mother has a significant learning disability and this impacted on her ability to care for her children, including LM.  For the purposes of this judgment, I do not need to go into this in any detail, save to say that LM clearly had a very difficult childhood that required professional intervention at various points.  In February 2016, the local authority obtained a forced marriage protection order in relation to LM and, later that year, in August 2016, after LM had alleged that she had been sexually abused, an interim care order was granted to the applicant local authority.  Initially, LM remained in her mother&#8217;s care, but later that year she was received into local authority foster care and a final care order was made in December 2016.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">LM required a degree of care and attention beyond what could be offered in the foster placement and, in October 2017, she moved to a children&#8217;s home in the Newcastle area.  However, that placement too provided to be unsuitable and, in June 2018, the local authority moved LM to a placement in Scotland.  At the time, this was not seen as a long-term placement and no application was made by the local authority under the Children Act 1989 for an order permitting LM to live in Scotland.  However, as events have transpired, LM has continued to live in that placement and continues to live there to this day.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The placement has clearly been extremely successful.  LM is settled and happy there, and it is clear from the evidence that I have seen that there have been significant improvements in her presentation over the years she has been there.  At one point, it appeared that the placement might need to cease upon LM obtaining the age of 21, but I understand it is now agreed that this can be a long-term placement for LM.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">LM is the only person living in the placement, which is in a rural area within Scotland&#8217;s central belt.  She is not free to leave the placement and there are two staff members present on the premises at all times, although arrangements have been considered to permit LM limited periods of time alone at the property subject to remote monitoring.  LM is accompanied on trips into the community by one or two staff members and supervised whilst in the placement.  It is clear that LM is subject to control and supervision such that her placement amounts to a deprivation of her liberty.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">First, as a result of substantial and sustained childhood trauma in multiple settings over many years, LM has been diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder or developmental trauma disorder, which Dr Camden-Smith says is best understood as complex PTSD with onset during the development period.  Dr Camden-Smith explained that LM has previously been diagnosed with attachment disorder, but that this is a childhood diagnosis that does not persist into adulthood, although the underlying condition may do so.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Dr Camden-Smith makes the point that it is worth distinguishing developmental trauma disorder from complex PTSD because the effects of trauma are much more profound on a developing brain than on an adult brain, and Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s report explains the impact of this disorder on LM as follows:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.97in">&#8220;Developmental trauma disorder is associated with high levels of impulsivity, poor emotional regulation, deficits in higher order cognitive processes (particularly executive functions), problems with relationships and attachment, chronic feelings of emptiness, chronically heightened levels of anxiety and arousal, low self-esteem and a poorly constructed sense of self.  It is a chronic and long-standing disorder that is amenable to amelioration by long-term therapy and sometimes medication, but that is likely to be present in varying degrees throughout the person&#8217;s life.  The lack of safe and secure attachments in childhood gives rise to difficulties in learning how to regulate emotions and chronic feelings of emptiness and loneliness.  People with disrupted attachment and childhood trauma place extreme and unobtainable demands on those they depend on due to their underlying belief that their needs will not be met.  They have a fear of abandonment and a belief that those they need will leave them, this can manifest as behaviours that pre-empt abandonment by rejecting people before they can be rejected (such as physical or verbal abuse, running away or hurting people they love).  These unhelpful behaviours can then lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy in which those they love and depend on then find it impossible to meet their intense needs resulting in multiple disruptions of attachments.&#8221;</p>

Although Dr Camden-Smith considers that LM does not meet the diagnostic criteria for formal diagnosis of intellectual disability, her full-scale IQ of 73 is in the extremely low range and Dr Camden-Smith makes the point that LM&#8217;s low level of cognitive function is a further matter that needs to be considered in the context of this case.  </p>

She has made great improvements in the last five years and there is the potential for her to improve further provided that any changes made are made in a slow and considered manner with restrictions gradually being reduced.&#8221;</p>

LM has clearly been living in Scotland for a significant period of time and there is no doubt that she is settled in her placement.   Nonetheless, I need to consider the conditions and reasons for her stay and these, in my view, point towards her remaining habitually resident in England and Wales.  She was initially placed in Scotland because there was no suitable placement closer to her home in Newcastle and, in my view, that remains her principal place of integration and social and family environment.  She has been deprived of her liberty throughout her time in Scotland, which means her experience there is very different to an individual who is not subject to those restrictions.  Most importantly, and a factor which I consider has magnetic importance in this case, her stay has, since the outset of these proceedings, been constantly subject to interim orders of the Court of Protection authorising the placement and the terms of the restrictions on her liberty.  </p>

I, therefore, agree with the submission that has been made to me by Mr Davies that the interim nature of the orders that have thus far been made authorising her placement in Scotland, deprives LM&#8217;s residence there of the necessary degree of stability which might otherwise have led to a change in her habitual residence.</p>

Mr Gray has pointed me to the decision of Hedley J made in a children context regarding interim placements.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Residence Order: Placement out of the Jurisdiction) </span>[2004] EWHC 3243 (Fam) at [9], the judge held:</p>

I think it must follow from that that they cannot have acquired habitual residence as yet in the UAE.  As they remain the daily responsibility of the local authority in this jurisdiction under interim care orders, it seems to me that inevitably this is their habitual place of residence even though a temporary placement elsewhere has been authorised, a placement which can only be temporary until a permanent order is in place.&#8221;</p>

Therefore, as the Court of Appeal identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Hackney </span>at [123], there should normally be substantial grounds in order to justify the court reconsidering the issue of jurisdiction after it has decided it.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The case of <span style="font-style:italic">Hackney </span>also identified that, in cases where there is a change in habitual residence involving a move to a non-contracting state, although the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">perpetuatio fori</span> does not apply, the courts of England and Wales may nonetheless be able to retain jurisdiction by virtue of their domestic law.  Given that the 2000 Convention does not apply at all in the present case, I therefore explored with counsel whether (if I concluded that there had been a change of habitual residence) there was any applicable domestic law which could be used in this case to make orders regarding LM.  The MCA 2005 does not assist in this regard as the Court of Protection&#8217;s jurisdiction is limited by Sch.3 para 7 to cases where the person is habitually resident in England and Wales.  Mr Davies identified the inherent jurisdiction as being a possible route to making such orders, as this can be used to protect the interests of vulnerable British nationals in certain circumstances.  However, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to use the inherent jurisdiction in a case where, assuming there had been a change in her habitual residence, LM would be subject to the protective jurisdiction of the courts of Scotland, and indeed it is not clear that the inherent jurisdiction can be used to authorise a deprivation of liberty of an incapacitous adult at all (see the comments of Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">Wakefield MDC v DN </span>[2019] EWHC 2306 (Fam) at [48]).  Ultimately, this issue does not arise in the present case given my finding that LM remains habitually resident in England and Wales.</p>

However, I recognise that changes in her circumstances may alter this position.  In my view the making of a final order in this case which will not be temporary and not be subject to an ongoing review is likely to tip the scales such that LM will then acquire habitual residence in Scotland fairly rapidly thereafter.  Even though that final order will be time limited, it will be a final order.  The current proceedings will be at an end and my order will not be subject to any further automatic review by the Court of Protection.  Assuming that such an order does indeed cause a shift in LM&#8217;s habitual residence then any future application to approve changes to the restrictions on her liberty, or to extend the duration of the authorisation will lie to the courts of Scotland.</p>

She originally considered that LM had capacity to make decisions about residence and about internet and social media use, but lacked capacity in other regards.  Following further questions posed to her by the parties, Dr Camden-Smith in her addendum report changed her view regarding LM&#8217;s capacity for internet and social media use, but remained of the view that LM had capacity to make decisions about her residence.</p>

In her report of 19 July 2023, Dr Camden-Smith concluded that LM had capacity to make decisions about her residence.  However, this was subject to a qualification that this capacity existed &#8220;provided that she is offered a choice of residences that meet her care needs.&#8221;  Although Dr Camden-Smith stuck to her view on this point in her addendum report of 27 September, both Mr Gray and Mr Davies have argued that this qualification imposed by Dr Camden-Smith misunderstands the test set out by Theis J in <span style="font-style:italic">LBX v K</span>, which requires <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> that the relevant information that the person should be able to understand, use and weigh in the case of residence includes what sort of care he or she would receive in each placement in broad terms.

Dr Camden-Smith accepted that, if the test required LM to be able to understand, use and weigh information about the suitability of placements to meet her care needs, then she would not meet this test.  I agree with counsel that, having regard to the test outlined by Theis J in <span style="font-style:italic">LBX v K </span>the sort of care that LM would receive in each proposed placement forms part of the relevant information that LM would need to be able to understand, use and weigh in order to have capacity on this issue, and that in the light of Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s concession in her oral evidence, I have concluded that LM lacks capacity to make decisions about her residence.</p>

She has previously been supervised in her use of this through a mirroring app, but this was discontinued in May of this year and she is not now directly supervised in her use of the computer, although she has a five hour daily limit imposed on that use.  She has not hitherto had access to a mobile phone.  However, yesterday, with both counsel in agreement, I approved as being in LM&#8217;s best interests the provision to her of a smartphone, subject to the internet and social media protocol that has been devised by the local authority, pending my decision on the issue of her capacity on this issue.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">It is clear that social media is a fundamentally important part of LM&#8217;s life.  Given the restrictions that are imposed on her placement, it is her principal means of communicating with the world and finding friendships.  Nonetheless, there have been a number of historic concerns regarding LM&#8217;s social media use.  As her support plan states:</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.97in">&#8220;LM has many social media acquaintances mostly formed via Facebook.  LM's social media relationships can be formed very quickly and intensely and end in the same way.  LM will often identify herself as being in a relationship with someone very quickly even after only exchanging a few messages.&#8221;</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">LM also has a history of engaging in &#8220;snowball&#8221; searches - seeking out friends of friends, and has, in the past, been rude or abusive to individuals online or acted in a way that is likely to be considered to be harassment.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s first report followed a three hour meeting with LM.  Following that interview, Dr Camden-Smith concluded that LM understood that someone on the internet might pretend to be someone other than who they really are.  LM identified that there may be things online which are inappropriate to access and explained to Dr Camden-Smith that photos shared online could then be made more widely available.  She also understood that things posted online could upset other people, although Dr Camden-Smith did not think that LM really understood that her previous actions in contacting others had upset them and could have got her into trouble with the police.  Nonetheless, overall, Dr Camden-Smith concluded that LM had capacity to use the internet and social media.</p>

This is detailed in the witness statement of the placement manager, Michelle Tait, of 17 August 2023 and in the fifteenth witness statement of Asheley Heir of the same date.  Ms Tait describes what occurred as follows:</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.97in">&#8220;On Wednesday, 9 August, I received a call from a member of the care team to inform me that LM had asked her not to go into the living room as she was going to get changed into her pyjamas.  The member of the care team overheard LM asking if &#8216;they liked it.&#8217;  &#8216;Does it look the same as the last time you saw it?&#8217;  &#8216;Is it looking more tanned now?&#8217;  &#8216;Don&#8217;t get too excited.&#8217;  &#8216;Oh, wait, you can take a screenshot of that.&#8217;  &#8216;Now it&#8217;s you, show me something.&#8217;  LM used a seductive voice and giggled whilst saying these words.  This has all been recorded in an incident form on Mobizio.  It is believed that LM was still online to her boyfriend while having this conversation.  However, the member of the care team did not witness this.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The obvious concern raised by this report was that LM was acting in a manner in which intimate pictures of her could be placed online.  This incident was discussed with LM the following day with Ms Heir.  LM told Ms Heir that it had not happened and, even if it had, she would not tell her.  LM also stated &#8220;So what if I was naked anyway.&#8221;  Ms Heir&#8217;s evidence continued:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.97in">&#8220;I explained it is not appropriate to be naked in the communal areas of the house, discussed the possible consequences of sharing video images of her naked body, the fact that these can be recorded or screenshots taken and circulated or held without her knowledge or consent and these could potentially not be recovered.  LM said this could not be done.  I explained to her that I was not accusing her she denied this occurring but if she did expose her body on social media there would be risks associated to it.  LM told me that this would not be her problem it would be their problem (meaning those taking images).  I advised yes the other party should not be doing this but that this would be LM&#8217;s problem if she did not know about the images, did not consent to this or was coerced or pressured into doing this and that the staff team and I would like to offer support around this.  LM shouted that it was none of my business, that it is not her problem and is &#8216;their problem, there&#8217;s nothing I can do about that.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.97in">&#8220;I acknowledge the difficulty in assessing decision-making in the abstract, rather than the real world, and agree that LM has almost certainly learned what the &#8216;right answer&#8217; is to questions on internet safety.  It is clear from the updated evidence provided to me that she is not capable of using and weighing the relevant information at the material time and, therefore, it is now my opinion that LM lacks capacity to make decisions about the use of the internet and social media.&#8221;</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Dr Camden-Smith and Ms Heir were both cross-examined about their views by Mr Davies and Mr Gray.  Dr Camden-Smith explained that she considered that the incident showed that LM&#8217;s actions went beyond making an unwise decision.  She considered that LM&#8217;s developmental disorder made her unboundaried, leading her to obsessively seek romantic relationships with men and that she would, in the moment, do acts, such as the sharing of pictures, to maintain a relationship.  She was concerned that LM, although aware that support was available, would not, because of her condition, use that support and was not learning from her mistakes.  Ms Heir too reported that LM can become intensely involved in a relationship after just a few messages, for example, describing herself to Dr Camden-Smith as being engaged to somebody whom she had met online only recently.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I am satisfied that the incident of 9 August 2023 took place as Ms Tait describes it.  She was not challenged on her statement and I did not consider that there is any real likelihood that the member of the care team was mistaken about what they heard taking place that evening.  I am, therefore, satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, on this occasion, LM placed herself in a position of having private or intimate images of herself being made available to whoever she was in a conversation with and that this posed the risk that those images could be used further.  I note also from LM&#8217;s discussion with Ms Heir that LM was not able to properly understand the risk to her of sharing such images.  She was able to identify that the third party who received those images could themselves be in trouble if they shared those images more widely, but she did not, in the course of that conversation, appear to be able to understand the risks to her of those images being shared.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I accept that this is the only occasion where such sharing has been identified recently, although I note that, since mirroring ceased, it is difficult to monitor LM&#8217;s online interactions in any event.  I also accept there have been occasions where LM has asked the staff for support in relation to online interactions, and Ms Tait gives an example in her witness statement.  Nonetheless, I am concerned that LM&#8217;s conversation with Ms Heir following the 9 August incident demonstrates that she is not able to understand, use or weigh information about the first of the points identified by Cobb&#8217;s J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">There are other concerns too regarding LM&#8217;s actions in the past, both in relation to the terms in which she has expressed herself and the intensity and frequency of her responses to others, that means she may not fully understand that her posts may be considered offensive by others or may upset other people.  For LM, Mr Davies described the issue of LM&#8217;s capacity on this issue as finely balanced, and indeed the Official Solicitor does not go so far as to assert a positive case that LM has capacity on this issue, but Mr Davies questions whether the presumption of capacity has been discharged in this case.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I agree with him that the issue is not straightforward.  Since she has been in the placement, there has been a significant improvement in LM&#8217;s presentation and it is clear that her ability to understand information in relation to use of the internet and social media is improving.  Nonetheless, overall and taking all of the evidence into account, I have concluded that LM currently lacks capacity in relation to internet and social media use.  Whilst I recognise that the event of 9 August is the only significant incident that has been identified since mirroring ceased nearly six months ago, I do consider it to be of importance; both the fact that it happened and LM&#8217;s reaction to it raise doubts as to her capacity in this regard.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I accept Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s evidence that LM&#8217;s response went beyond impetuousness on her behalf and was, in these circumstances, a facet of her underlying conditions.  The other concerns about LM&#8217;s past online interactions lend further support to my conclusion that LM is not currently able to understand, use and weigh aspects of the relevant information in this field, specifically the risk that pictures shared by her could be shared more widely and also that placing offensive material online could upset or offend others.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I fully recognise that my decision on this issue will be particularly disappointing for LM who feels that she is being held to a different standard to her capacitous peers.  However, as I will explain in a moment, I am satisfied that it is nonetheless in her best interests to be given access to a smartphone in accordance with the protocol devised by the local authority, and this will, I consider, assist her in her use of social media and enable her to continue to learn and build her skills in this regard.  Moreover, it was clear from Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s evidence that she considers that this is an area where LM&#8217;s capacity may well improve in the future and, although I have found today that LM currently lacks capacity in this regard, this is clearly an issue which needs to be kept under careful review.</p>

This should be read alongside an updated protocol for LM&#8217;s contact with others, also dated June 2023, and an internet, social media and mobile phone support plan dated November 2023.  The Official Solicitor agrees that these plans and protocols are in LM&#8217;s best interests.  I too agree.  They have clearly been carefully considered and I will approve them as being in LM&#8217;s best interests.  I will, therefore, make the declarations and orders sought by the local authority.  These will be for a period of 12 months.  However, these are final orders and will conclude the current proceedings.  Any application for further orders will require a fresh application before an appropriate court.</p>

These consist solely of benefit payments and are managed on LM&#8217;s behalf by the local authority as her appointee.  I am told that LM now has a balance of around &#163;12,000 in savings.  This seems to me to be quite a large sum to be held under an appointeeship and I have considered whether a deputyship would now be more appropriate.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">However, there are two factors which have meant that I have decided not to make such an order today.  Firstly, I am told that the local authority is considering whether there should be an increase in LM&#8217;s contribution to care fees and, if this is implemented, there may be a corresponding reduction in her savings.  Secondly, I am conscious that the likely effect of my making a final order is that LM may soon become habitually resident in Scotland.  If she does so, although the English Court of Protection will have concurrent jurisdiction with the Scottish courts over any property of LM&#8217;s that is situated in England and Wales (as LM&#8217;s savings are), it may be more appropriate that future orders in relation to these matters are dealt with by the Scottish court alongside issues of LM&#8217;s welfare.  I will, therefore, simply deal with these matters today by recording in my order that the local authority should keep these issues under review.  My order will also record that it is in LM&#8217;s best interests to be supported to take steps to develop an understanding of managing her own benefits, regular payments and other aspects of her finances when she feels able to do so.</p>

She was present in court throughout the hearing yesterday and it is clear that she has made great progress in her current placement.  That she has done so is a credit to everyone involved in this case; to the local authority and its social work team; to the dedicated staff at LM&#8217;s placement; to those who represent her and, of course, to LM herself.  As a result of my judgment, she will now have access to a phone (subject to the support plan that I have approved) and it is clear from Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s evidence that LM&#8217;s capacity to make decisions in relation to this and indeed other matters may improve in the future.  The declarations and orders that I have made today will clearly need to be reviewed by the appropriate court in due course.  LM has my best wishes for the future.  That is my judgment.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify">Following the delivery of this judgment, the parties held further discussions regarding LM&#8217;s property and financial affairs.  The local authority indicated that, contrary to its understanding at the hearing, LM did not owe a debt in relation to her assessed contribution to care costs.  I was therefore invited by consent to make an order appointing the authorised officer for property and affairs deputyships of Newcastle City Council as LM&#8217;s deputy for property and affairs.  Given this change in the local authority&#8217;s position and the amount of funds that it held for LM, I was satisfied that it was in her best interests to make this appointment forthwith whilst LM remained habitually resident in England and Wales rather than leave the matter to the Scottish courts in due course.  I therefore made the deputyship order sought.</p>
