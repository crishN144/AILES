He suffers from Type 2 diabetes mellitus, is partially blind (due to diabetic retinopathy) and has limited mobility. He has a serious kidney disease for which he requires regular dialysis, and suffers from anaemia.  He has chronic leg ulcers, cellulitis, and neuropathy in his feet as a result of his diabetes; he is constantly at risk of severe infection.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In June 2007, he was the subject of a violent criminal assault, being repeatedly kicked to the head; he sustained a serious head injury, involving skull fractures, brain haemorrhage and contusions to the right frontal area of the brain.  As a result he suffered a degree of cognitive impairment for which he was treated at a specialist rehabilitation centre.  The injury was said to have left IA with problems of memory, inflexibility of thought, impulsivity, and mood control.  He has exhibited deficits in executive functioning with reduced capacity to organise, judge and show control over decision-making.</p>

He was admitted as an emergency following an episode of diabetes-related hypoglycaemia.  IA is now ready for discharge from hospital, and decisions are required as to his future care. Critically, the court needs to determine whether IA has capacity to make or contribute to the relevant decisions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These issues arise within long-standing proceedings commenced in 2012 by the London Borough of Wandsworth. At the time of the inception of proceedings, the authority was concerned about IA&#8217;s interim accommodation and care needs; consideration was then being given to placing him in residential care.  Directions for the final hearing of the application were given as long ago as 15 July 2013.  Unfortunately, the final hearing was delayed and complicated by the sudden deterioration of IA&#8217;s health in November 2013 (see &#167;3 above).  In December 2013, Wandsworth Clinical Commissioning Group (&#8216;WCCG&#8217;) took over as Applicant in these proceedings following an assessment that IA is eligible for continuing Healthcare Funding.  </p>

In 2007 (prior to the acquired brain injury) the property was subject of a Compulsory Purchase Order, as a consequence of its dilapidated and unhygienic state and general disrepair, a course which IA opposed, and an outcome against which he has subsequently appealed.  This has almost certainly soured his relationship with the London Borough of Wandsworth (no longer in fact directly involved in the provision of his care), and I believe continues adversely to affect his ability to work co-operatively with social workers allocated to provide adult care services to him.</span></p>

Social services received complaints that IA&#8217;s room were dirty and smelly (to the extent that this permeated other areas of the hotels); there was, it was said, evidence of urine and faeces on the carpets and the beds, blood splatters were found around the rooms.  IA himself disputes much of this evidence (by his letter of 12 July 2013 he made some minor admissions - &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11.5pt">being blind just means that I can&#8217;t see the mess I make to get it cleaned up</span><span style="font-size:11.5pt">&#8221; &#8211; but his letter 10 March 2014 makes clear that he does not accept the worst allegations).  I have not heard direct evidence about this, and make no findings.  Whatever the reason for his many moves, it appears that prior to his current admission to hospital, IA had a somewhat itinerant year.  This cannot have assisted in achieving continuity of medical or other care (a view expressly confirmed by his GP) &#8211; a problem compounded by the fact that he would accept only a small fraction (15 hours) of the 56 hours of care to which he was entitled.</span></p>

I do not interpret his strongly worded pronouncements against this outcome from his hospital bed as reflecting an inability to weigh up the implications of his decision, rather it reflects frustration, underscored with a hefty degree of suspicion of authority.
