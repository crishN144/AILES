Second, the child and her mother should not be put at risk of harm as a result of seeking to engage the father in the proceedings.

This in turn will have a deleterious impact on Child 2 and the other subject children in her care&#8221;.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The Guardian also relies upon Child 2&#8217;s expressed wishes in respect of Father 2, which I have already referred to, and the fact that notwithstanding redaction of the bundle to remove references to the other children and to Child 2&#8217;s whereabouts, information in a very lengthy bundle, in this case over 2,500 pages, may slip through the net.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Having set that out at some length, I need only really draw the strands together briefly by way of analysis.  It is clear to me that even as far back as 2012 Father 2 presented a risk of harm to Child 2 and to the mother for the reasons set out in Mr Baker&#8217;s report; that is made even clearer, in respect of Child 2 certainly, by his recent conviction.  As I understand it the child victim was a female under 13 and I note Child 2 is a girl under that age [].</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I am also troubled by his motivation initially to care for Child 2 and by his current motivation to adopt a position of contact initially, as it was presented in his position statement, by telephone and only because that is likely to be impractical does he say that should be by letters.  That in the circumstances of his historical offending behaviour and his most recent conviction.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">When I add in the absence of any actual relationship as a matter of fact with Child 2 over a significant number of years, [], I am drawn to the following conclusions.  Firstly, that he does not have an Article 8 right established on the evidence before me, the only right he has derives from a biological right as a father and parental responsibility coming from being named on Child 2&#8217;s birth certificate.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Secondly, in those circumstances I am not satisfied that the Article 6 right to a fair trial is engaged.  However, even if I were wrong about that and in any event because it seems to me I have to adopt the same test, namely a balancing act between the risks on the one hand and the advantages on the other, thirdly I come to the conclusion that the risks cannot be managed adequately by any case management directions that I could give, removing the risk or attempting to remove the risk of Father 2, identifying where it is the mother and Child 2 live.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I have considered whether it would more proportionate and meet the risks of the case for Father 2 to remain a party, but for me to restrict or continue to restrict his access to documents.  Firstly, him remaining a party presents a risk of emotional harm to Mother and by analogy to Child 2, but in addition I accept what is said on behalf of the Guardian that the bundle is so significant that there is a risk that matters which he should not be aware of would slip through the net.</span></p>
