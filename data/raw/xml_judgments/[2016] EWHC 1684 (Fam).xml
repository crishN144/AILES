	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Over the course of four days, I have heard evidence from the applicant.  There is a wealth of written evidence before me, including several statements from both parties.  Whilst he has been represented throughout the hearing by his very experienced legal team, the respondent has played no active part in these proceedings.  He is suffering from terminal cancer and is currently receiving palliative care at a clinic in Zurich.  Whilst the position has been kept under review, I had evidence from his treating physician at the start of this hearing that he was too ill to participate in these proceedings even via a video link with the court.  Because of the need to finalise these proceedings without further delay, it was agreed that we should proceed in his absence.  I am satisfied that he has not been prejudiced as a result because the focus of this case is on the applicant&#8217;s financial needs. Whilst there has been some debate about the full extent of the respondent&#8217;s very significant wealth, this is not a case, as the applicant accepts, where she seeks a share in that fortune by way of a percentage division.  Whilst the respondent&#8217;s assets may have increased to some extent over the course of this 12 year marriage, he was an extremely wealthy individual when they married.  The issue which lies at the heart of this case is the extent to which the exorbitant standard of living which they enjoyed throughout the course of the marriage should now be reflected in the assessment which I have to undertake in respect of the applicant&#8217;s future needs as she moves into an independent life outside her marriage.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The positions of the parties in this litigation are very significantly polarised.  The applicant has some assets in her own name including a London flat and a property which she owns in  Hills, California.  (That property was bought for her by the respondent at a time when the marriage was in difficulties in the early part of 2012.)  In total, she has assets worth some &#163;15 million.  Mr Warshaw contends that the figure is closer to &#163;20 million when the value of her chattels and jewellery is taken into account.  The respondent has disclosed personal assets worth &#163;22.8 million net and an entitlement to, or interest in, trust assets worth a further &#163;95.3 million.  His wealth was significantly greater prior to 2013.  During that year, in June, he entered into a contract by which he purported to sell the bulk of his Saudi assets to his three daughters from his first and second marriages (including S) for just over &#163;512 million.  Under the terms of that contract, he is entitled to continue to receive the income arising during his lifetime (and it is a very considerable income).  The money remains outstanding and due to him as a debt although he accepts that he does not expect repayment from his daughters. On his case, this was part and parcel of a careful estate planning exercise undertaken at a time when there were no known concerns about his health. The contract, which is governed by Sharia law, is revocable at his election and Mr Howard invites me to treat these assets as still available to him and thus part of his resources for the purposes of the present claims.  On this basis, the applicant&#8217;s case is that he has resources of some &#163;650 million although, anecdotally, she believes he is worth far more and the figure of &#163;8 billion has been referred to during the course of the hearing.  Mr Howard and Mr Nagpal invite me, in due course, to draw adverse inferences in relation to what they contend is a failure on the respondent&#8217;s part to disclose in these proceedings the full extent of his assets.  The significance for the parties&#8217; daughter is that, for so long as the contract remains unchallenged, she has assets in her own name of more than &#163;150 million.  This step, says the respondent, was part and parcel of his wish to ensure her future financial security.</span></p>

The major component elements of that sum comprise a central London housing fund of &#163;62.8 million together with a capitalised maintenance fund of just over &#163;127 million.  That figure has been calculated on the basis of an annual budget of c.&#163;6 million net.  In addition, she wishes to keep her home in California and acquire a second home in this jurisdiction which she will pay for by selling her London flat and using part of the capital award she seeks from the respondent.  Until payment of that award, she seeks the continuation of the current interim arrangements whereby the respondent pays the outgoings on their former matrimonial home, a substantial property situated on the edge of Windsor Great Park which she currently occupies with S, together with the other costs of maintaining that household, and a sum of $1,631,280 per annum which is the interim level of maintenance which was put in place by this court in April 2016. </span></p>

Those costs will continue to be discharged in future and at that level.  Whilst he claims that an objective analysis of her current position would meet her future needs without any additional financial assistance from him, he nevertheless offers to pay to the applicant a further &#163;17 million over a five- year period.  Once she leaves the family home, he has offered to provide her with the use of a home in central London worth up to &#163;6.5 million on the basis that the property will be held in their daughter&#8217;s name.  The applicant will be entitled to share that home with S for the next five years until she completes her secondary education.  On this basis, the applicant will leave the marriage with assets of some &#163;37 million and will have the use of the London property during S&#8217;s minority. </span></p>

She is said to have received a total award of c. $60 million (&#163;40 million) at the conclusion of contested English divorce proceedings.  The applicant suspects that her award was significantly higher.  Because his first wife has not consented to the disclosure of the relevant court order in these proceedings, I have no way of knowing who is right but in any event it makes little difference to my approach to this case.  It is the applicant&#8217;s and S&#8217;s needs which I am considering in the context of this application and those needs fall to be assessed in the context of a number of factors, including their marital standard of living and the resources which are now available to the respondent.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The respondent is a Saudi national who was born in Lebanon in 1955.  He is now 61 years old and, as I have said, his health is now in terminal decline.  He grew up in the family home in Jeddah before studying for a first degree in the United States.  Following his graduation, he returned to Jeddah where he was employed within the family business, EA Al-Juffali and Brothers.  That business had been founded by his father and brothers in 1946.  It was a successful family enterprise which was involved in the supply of electricity and telecommunications throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  When his father died in 1994, the respondent, with his brothers, inherited his father&#8217;s interest in the family business.  Until the recent decline in his health, he was actively involved in the business which is, by and large, the provenance of the wealth in this case.  That wealth enabled the respondent to become involved in a number of charitable and philanthropic causes.  Notably, he was the founder of the Brain Forum, a non-profit making organisation based in Switzerland which promotes brain research.  He is Chair of a foundation for intellectually disadvantaged children and his work has been recognised by Saudi Arabia, Denmark, Lebanon and the Vatican.  His first marriage, celebrated in 1980, endured for some 21 years.  In 2012, his only son died at the age of 23 years.  In 2014, he became the permanent representative of the International Maritime Organisation at the invitation of the Prime Minister of St Lucia.  That appointment has a resonance in the litigation chronology since he subsequently used that position to advance a defence of diplomatic immunity to suit in these proceedings.  That defence was rejected by Hayden J who was upheld, in part, by the Court of Appeal on the basis of a finding that the respondent was permanently resident in this jurisdiction at the time these proceedings were launched.  His subsequent application for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court was unsuccessful.  Despite that finding, it is common ground that he is non-domiciled in this jurisdiction.  The majority of his current wealth is held offshore and in part through trust structures based in Bermuda and the Bahamas.</span></p>

It remains home to the applicant and S to this day.  The property has been described in these proceedings as &#8220;a vast and prestigious property surrounded by about 33 acres of its own land immediately adjacent to Windsor Great Park&#8221;.  The property is owned by a Jersey company which is, in turn, owned by one of the trusts of which the respondent is a beneficiary.  It was formerly a home occupied by the respondent&#8217;s mother.  The applicant&#8217;s evidence is that it had been acquired by his parents as their family residence in England.  His mother had continued to use the property as her summer home after her husband&#8217;s death.  When she moved to alternative accommodation in Eaton Square (and a sum of &#163;13 million was apparently made available from family resources to fund this move), the parties embarked upon a two-year renovation project which involved the gutting and complete rebuilding of the house.  It appears to have been a monumental undertaking which involved as many as fifty contractors working on the property from New York, Boston, Paris, Jeddah and England.  During this period the parties travelled extensively (and internationally) in their quest to find works of art and antiques which they used to furnish the property.  With the assistance of architects, they built tennis courts and stabling for four horses.  A helipad was constructed to enable the respondent to travel easily to London.  A summer cottage and tree house were built in the grounds for S.  The gardens were re-established and fountains were built.  A gazebo was added to the maze garden.  The applicant maintains that she was told by the respondent that the cost of the work was $50 million.  Whether or not that was the actual cost, it was on any view a very substantial project and one in which the applicant was fully involved.  They moved in during 2005 with a full retinue of staff, including groundsmen, gardeners and a 24-hour security team.</span></p>

Several floors were constructed underground to house a swimming pool and parking for up to sixteen vehicles.  It now occupies six to seven floors and the photographs which I have seen speak to the sumptuous opulence of its interior specification.   Materials were imported from all over the world to fulfil the design brief which the parties had stipulated.  The respondent says that she shopped in Paris for the fabrics and curtains.  A quantity of quartz was imported from Afghanistan to create one particular wall in the chalet.   Other walls in the underground spa were fashioned in amethyst, which is the applicant&#8217;s birthstone.  According to the applicant&#8217;s evidence, nearly sixty truckloads of wood were delivered to the construction site whilst the building was being erected and all the leather and velvet wall coverings were made and imported from Paris.</span></p>

He had removed the blue diamond ring from the property.  The applicant&#8217;s case is that he did so because of these security concerns but promised that it would be returned to her whenever she wished to wear it.  Since the breakdown of the marriage, she has repeatedly asked for the return of the ring but those requests have fallen on deaf ears.  During the early stages of this litigation and at a time when the value of this ring was thought to be between US$15 million and US$18 million, I made directions requiring the respondent to disclose the current whereabouts of the ring.  He is in breach of those disclosure orders.  Initially he said that the ring had not been a gift but was part of his precious stones collection. By the conclusion of the case, he had given instructions that the ring was no longer in his possession and had been gifted to a third party.  He continues to refuse to identify that third party although he has now offered to pay to the applicant an additional $2 million in lieu.  That sum is based upon 50% of its value.  In support of that figure he has produced the original bill of sale which shows that the cost to him in January 2005 was $4 million.  The applicant believes it is now worth very considerably more and she seeks within these proceedings a declaration that she is the beneficial owner of the ring.  She wants the ring to be returned to her.</span></p>

There are two, interrelated, duties of the court before making an order under Part III.  The first is to consider whether England and Wales is the appropriate venue for the application: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(1)</ref>.  The second is to consider whether an order should be made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> having regard to the matters in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref>.  There are two reasons why the duties are interrelated.  First, neither <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref> nor <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/18/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18(2)</ref>(3) refers to an exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 16(1)</ref> directs the court to have regard to &#8220;all the circumstances of the case&#8221; and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref> refers the court to certain matters &#8220;in particular&#8221;.  Second, some of the matters to be considered under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16</ref> may be relevant under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref>, and vice versa.

There is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16</ref>, but it will not usually be a case for an order under Part III where the wife had a right to apply for financial relief under the foreign law, and an award was made in the foreign country.  In such cases, mere disparity between that award and what would be awarded on an English divorce will certainly be insufficient to trigger the application of Part III.  Nor is hardship or injustice (much less serious injustice) a condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction, but if either factor is present, it may make it appropriate, in the light of all the circumstances, for an order to be made, and may affect the nature of the provision ordered.  Of course, the court will not lightly characterise foreign law, or the order of a foreign court, as unjust.</span></p>

The following general principles should be applied.  First, primary consideration must be given to the welfare of any children of the marriage.  This can cut both ways as the children may be being supported by the foreign spouse.  Second, it will never be appropriate to make an order which gives the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction.  Third, where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse.  Subject to these principles, the court has a broad discretion. The reasons why it was appropriate for an order to be made in England are among the circumstances to be taken into account in deciding what order should be made.  Where the English connections of the case are very strong there may be no reason why the application should not be treated as if it were made in purely English proceedings.  The full procedure for granting ancillary relief after an English divorce does not apply in Part III cases.  The conditions which can be attached to leave, together with the court&#8217;s case management powers, can be used to define the issues and to limit the evidence to be filed, as was done by Munby J in this case.  This enables the jurisdiction to be tailored to the needs of the individual case, so that the grant of leave does not inevitably trigger a full blown claim for all forms of ancillary relief.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In terms of her income needs, she has produced a number of detailed and lengthy schedules which have been prepared at a cost of some &#163;50,000 by PriceWaterhouseCooper (PWC).  Because the applicant has throughout her marriage been insulated from financial issues, she has no independent means of ascertaining what it will cost to maintain her lifestyle going forward at an equivalent level.  I do not say this to criticise the respondent; it is simply a fact that all of their living expenses were channelled through a Family Office which administered the smooth running of their domestic economy. What appears to have happened is that PWC has been provided with a narrative account of how life was lived in the various Juffali households.  They have then attempted to cost on an item by item basis the likely component elements, or heads, of expenditure which a lifestyle in those rarefied &#233;chelons would involve.  In some cases, their sources are uncontroversial (such as the cost of basic utility services).  In others, they are questionable as reliable evidence of actual costs.  For example, they appear to have consulted a website called &#8220;luxury Christmas tree stylist&#8221; in order to come up with an annual figure of &#163;12,000 for the cost of &#8216;seasonal decorations&#8217;.  In terms of the cost of employing a second and third cleaner or housekeeper (in addition to her principal live-in housekeeper) and a gardener, they have gone not to employment agency websites but to an article in the Evening Standard newspaper about the cost of running a millionaire&#8217;s home in central London.  In relation to the cost of security for her new home (said to be &#163;50,000 per annum), they have identified their source of information as an article which appeared in the Daily Mail entitled &#8220;Inside Multi-Million pound Luxury Homes&#8221;.</p>

That much is agreed. I have been provided with a separate calculation which shows that, depending on prevailing exchange rates and based upon actuarial life expectancies, the capitalised cost of providing support for her 73 year old mother based on the applicant&#8217;s figures would be between c.&#163;1.188 million and c.&#163;1.289 million.  A similar exercise for her 82 year old father&#8217;s lifetime expenses produces a figure of between c. &#163;570,000 and c. &#163;618,000.  Because of her grandmother&#8217;s age (92), it has not been possible to undertake a similar exercise in respect of her expenses.  </p>

She recovered from an episode of breast cancer and was in recovery when she first met the respondent.  The applicant says that the respondent promised to maintain her mother for the rest of her life.  He was, until the onset of this litigation, meeting the cost of her rent in Washington State and paying her US$5,000 per month towards her living expenses.  Her 82-year old father has no money of his own.  He is disabled as a result of a heart attack.  He has other health problems.  The respondent has been paying his rent in Carmel, California and providing an allowance of US$6,000 per month.  Her 92-year old grandmother had a stroke in her late seventies.  She has been a widow since about 2004.  She is presently living in an assisted care facility in Washington State.    The applicant has been meeting her costs since the summer of 2015.

She, it is said, received a total of award of US$60 million (c.&#163;40 million) in the context of an English divorce.  It seems to me that this is of little assistance here.  First, there is no evidence before the court in relation to that award.  I have not seen a copy of the court order.  All I have is the evidence of the respondent which is disputed by the applicant in any event on the basis of what she knows (or believes she knows) about that lady&#8217;s current financial circumstances.  Secondly, this is not a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; jurisdiction.  An award made by a court in financial proceedings must be fair and principled.  It must be one which has been made after a rigorous application of all the relevant <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> factors.  The guidance to be collected from the significant body of case law which has developed in the last few years provides valuable assistance and clear guidelines.   However, the broad discretion which is invested in the court allows for a carefully crafted and bespoke solution to each and every case which passes in front of a judge.  I know nothing about the circumstances of the respondent&#8217;s first marriage save that it was underpinned by much of the wealth which is currently available to him.

Thus, it is not difficult to see how these parties were able to indulge in the levels of spending about which I have heard.

In other words, a case where the resources of the parties will not stretch to a clean break and ongoing financial support is required to meet the future income needs of an applicant spouse.  That much is reinforced by what his Lordship says in sub-paragraphs (v), (vii), (viii), (x) and (xi).  To the extent that he highlights the need for an approach which focuses upon the impact on an assessment of future needs by reference to choices made during the marriage (including the standard of living), the length of the marriage, the presence of a child or children, and an eye to an eventual transition to financial independence, I wholeheartedly agree with him.  Those principles, in my judgment, apply equally to a so-called &#8220;big money&#8221; case where a clean break on the basis of capitalised maintenance is the likely outcome.</p>

He says to me in terms, &#8220;We reject the proposition that, after a 10 year marriage, the standard of living enjoyed by the parties can create hard future need&#8221;.   In this context, on his case, the standard of living during the marriage is relevant but of limited importance.  He submits that the element of her claims which relate to financial provision for her parents cannot be said to be causally connected to the marriage.  He argues that I must factor into my approach consideration of the point at which it would be appropriate to terminate any ongoing provision in terms of maintenance.  Why, he submits, should the award of capitalised maintenance not be made on the basis of a much lower multiplier as happened in <span style="font-style:italic">Fournier v Fournier </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1988] 2 FLR 990" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1988">[1988] 2 FLR 990</ref> ?  In that case the Court of Appeal endorsed provision of maintenance only for a further eight or nine years during the minority of the child of the family.  He invites me to frame my award for the applicant with a view to setting her on the road to independent living at the earliest opportunity.  In this context, he submits that I must include within my assessment any prospects of remarriage or cohabitation which she may have in future.</p>

Whilst Hayden J found his client to be permanently resident in this jurisdiction, the reality is that he spends the majority of his time outside the jurisdiction and has substantial assets in and connections with his country of birth, Saudi Arabia.  He points to the fact that the marriage was celebrated in Saudi Arabia and their only child holds dual Saudi and American citizenship.  Until 2013, the vast majority of his asset base, including his business interests, was in Saudi Arabia.  The applicant is an American citizen who has never applied for a British passport.  She owns property in California which is where her immediate and extend family lives.

Prior to moving in, the parties virtually gutted the property and developed it to their particular taste as a family home.  That is precisely what it became.  It was, and remains, S&#8217;s primary home, and she shares that home with her mother.  The applicant has not lived in the United States since her late teens; she has made England her principal home for the best part of 20 years.  She has indefinite leave to remain in this country.  S was born here and the parties&#8217; joint intentions are that she should be educated here throughout her minority.  For whatever time he has spent in this jurisdiction, the court has already determined him to be permanently resident here.  He has recently established a very substantial home for himself and his third wife and their two children in central London.  It is the applicant&#8217;s intention to remain here for the foreseeable future, a plan which the respondent has tacitly endorsed by his offer to make a good London home available for her and S for the next five years.</span></p>

I accept that she was telling me the truth about this.  I further accept that he promised her financial security in the event that she would agree to remain married to him.  I am further prepared to accept that her evidence in relation to her discussions with Mr J about the purchase of the Californian property was true.  I find as a fact that the applicant believed the assurances she was given that she would be provided with a home in California and a home in central London once the time came for her to move out of BGH.  She went ahead with the purchase of the Beverly Hills property relying on those assurances.  She carried out the extensive programme of work which she undertook at the property believing this to be her second, holiday home.  She had, as I find, every expectation that negotiations would continue in relation to what should happen about the purchase of a home in London where she and S would make their main base.  I believe her account of these events.  I reject any suggestion that, when the Californian property was purchased, either party intended it  to be her main home or that she would relocate to live there permanently with S.  That simply does not make any sense in the context of the evidence and the respondent&#8217;s current proposals.  When she discovered that the respondent&#8217;s relationship with L, his third wife, was ongoing despite their attempted reconciliation, she immediately issued English divorce proceedings.  They were not served and within a month the respondent had pronounced a bare talaq without giving the applicant any advance warning of his intentions.  She is now in a position where she has had no choice but to recognise that talaq as having effectively dissolved their marriage in circumstances where there is not even a possibility of her seeking a financial award in the Saudi courts.  This is not a situation where the provision made for a wife after foreign divorce proceedings has been inadequate; it is a situation where there has been no court-approved  provision at all.</span></p>

I may need to consider further directions in terms of the case management of those applications in due course.

In the event of his client&#8217;s early death, the assets which are the subject of the 2013 contract will fall to be distributed in accordance with Sharia law.  Any attempt by the applicant to enforce her English order would have to be undertaken in Saudi, against Saudi nationals, and in relation to Saudi assets.  As Mr Warshaw puts it, &#8220;Realistically, with the best will in the world, the most positive outlook for enforcement would be &#163;19.1 million&#8221; (i.e. the aggregate value of the chattels, the two mews houses in Pont Street, the cash held in English bank accounts, and the Devon property).</span></p>

Without such intervention, there is no jurisdiction anywhere in the world where the applicant can pursue her legitimate financial claims against the respondent.  S&#8217;s interests are at the forefront of my consideration throughout.  Whilst she may in due course be a wealthy young woman in her own right (and subject to rescission of the contract of sale, she is already in that position), that fact does not in any sense diminish the claims which her mother has as a result of the contributions which she has made to this marriage.  The fact that she prosecutes her current claims on the basis of her future needs does not detract from the value of those contributions, past, present or future.</span></p>

He has employed a first class legal team to appear on his behalf to make submissions as to the extent to which I should exercise my jurisdiction.  I shall come to the case which Mr Howard seeks to run in relation to adverse inferences shortly, but I am proceeding on the basis that the respondent is not intending to disobey any order which I make at the conclusion of these proceedings.  I accept that I have not yet been provided with the name of the person to whom he gave the blue diamond ring but that is a separate issue.  If my confidence in his willingness to obey my order is misplaced, so be it and the applicant will have to proceed as she is advised may be appropriate.   I suspect that a more significant obstacle to enforcement may be the death of the respondent before payment is due and/or made.  I sincerely hope that this will not be the case and I intend to do what I can to ensure that a tight timetable is put in place for compliance with the terms of my order.  This case has already been case managed with these difficulties in mind.  However, on balance, I do not regard the issues which might potentially flow from non-performance for whatever reason to be an obstacle to making financial provision in this case.  Nonetheless, I bear in mind that the path to enforcement during the life of the respondent is likely to be easier if he understands the basis and rationale of my assessment of need in this case. </span></p>

First, I consider it entirely appropriate in all the circumstances for this court to make an order for financial relief in favour of the applicant.  Secondly, in terms of those facts and matters which I have set out above, I regard the connections of this case with England to be strong.  This was, and is, an international family.  They have had the ability throughout the marriage to criss-cross the globe almost at will.  They have maintained a number of homes throughout their marriage but their home in this jurisdiction was, I am satisfied, their main base and the centre of family operations whilst S attended her English school during term times.  Weekends were sometimes spent at the Devon property. Holiday periods may well have been spent elsewhere in the world whether cruising in the Mediterranean, skiing in Gstaad, or spending time in Venice and Jeddah.  The impression I had from the totality of the evidence was that the Al-Juffali extended family members were close.  The applicant appears to have had a good relationship with her two step-daughters.  The family appears to have taken every opportunity to get together in one location or another.  These were clearly very happy occasions and I have no doubt that the respondent derived considerable pleasure from having all his daughters together under one roof whenever the opportunity presented itself.  To this extent, regardless of legal ownership, it appears that they looked upon several of the properties as &#8216;family homes&#8217; where they had the opportunity to spend time with each other and where, on occasions, they visited alone.   </span></p>

It is on that basis that I am asked to consider the reasonableness of the costs which she advances in respect of maintaining that home.

The document which sets out her case in this regard was prepared by accountants over what was no doubt days of work at a cost of &#163;50,000 or thereabouts.  It is agreed that this case requires a more holistic approach in terms of that assessment.  There are categories of expenditure which fall to be considered individually.  For example, is it appropriate in the context of a needs case for the cost of chartering private jets to continue just because this was a feature of their married life together ?  Is it appropriate for her to include in her future budget the cost of running her Californian home (some &#163;420,000 per annum) when she could down-size to a cheaper property, if not sell up completely so as to add a further &#163;11 million to her capitalised maintenance fund ?  In either event, does she need a third country home in this jurisdiction with all the attendant expense ?  There are other categories of expenditure where it is said that, whilst legitimate needs, the scale of the applicant&#8217;s budget in respect of these items falls for significant judicial censure and pruning.  Where, Mr Warshaw asks rhetorically, is she keeping all the skiing outfits and helmets which are to be replaced regularly each year ?  Why does she need to spend such significant sums on jewellery and watches when she already has a collection which is worth getting on for &#163;5 million ?  These and others are all issues which I shall need to consider and I do so in the context of the relevant <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> factors which are engaged in this case.</span></p>

Whilst there were no outgoings listed in respect of BGH, her interim budget (produced in April 2016) demonstrated a requirement for just under &#163;1.78 million net spendable in each year.  The figures were given on the basis of an annual requirement and were not restricted to, or intended to be representative of expenditure to be incurred during, the months leading up to this final hearing.  How is it possible, asks Mr Warshaw, that this budget has now increased to c.&#163;6 million per annum.  He submits that the likelihood is that the accountants&#8217; brief was to maximise every possible aspect of the budget so as to produce the highest figure they could reach.  I do not know what instructions were given to PWC.  I do know that the applicant produced the figures in her interim budget without assistance from the accountants although, no doubt, with some assistance from her solicitors.  To a certain extent, I accept the difficulties which confronted her in this task.  She was under significant pressure of time given the need to accelerate this hearing for obvious reasons.  She did not have access to the computerised records at the Family Office which might have enabled her to track expenditure over the last couple of years of the marriage.  However, she must have had a reasonable idea as to her spending on her own personal expenses, and particularly on clothes, shoes, handbags and the like.  I am assuming that, apart from gifts made to her by the respondent, she has been responsible for choosing and assembling her own wardrobe, even if she has had assistance from personal shoppers.  My clear impression is that the sums which she now seeks to claim in respect of these expenses are inflated and unnecessary in the context of adequate provision for her reasonable needs.  I can well understand how she would wish to have the sort of budget for which she now contends but, even against the background of the standard of living during this marriage, I regard her figures for several heads of expenditure (and particularly her personal expenses) as unreasonable in terms of her future needs.</span></p>

There is no reason why, after an 11 or 12 year marriage with the resources available in this case, the applicant should be beholden to her daughter for her main family home.  She has earned an entitlement to a secure home which she will own independently of any parallel wealth into which S will come in future.</span></p>

I accept that the current family home is not worth anything approaching the figure of &#163;100 million for which the applicant was originally contending.  Nevertheless, whilst a home worth &#163;6.5 million might to many seem over-indulgent, I am not dealing with the &#8220;many&#8221;; I am dealing with this particular applicant in the circumstances of her marriage to this particular respondent.  Having carefully considered all the evidence which I heard in relation to housing and the nature of the accommodation available in the various property particulars about which the applicant was asked, I have come to the clear conclusion that a property such as that which we looked at in Belgrave Mews South in SW1 or Cheyne Walk in SW3 would be perfectly adequate as a home for this mother and daughter.  Some might consider them magnificent properties (to coin Mr Warshaw&#8217;s description).  The former is being offered for sale at just under &#163;16 million; the latter for &#163;15 million.  I do not regard either as an inappropriate London home for S and I can see no reason why she should feel disadvantaged in any way as she moves between that sort of home and one of her elder sister&#8217;s London homes.  These are worth less than the home she will be living in.  As to her contact with her younger half-siblings, time will tell what arrangements are made in that respect.  L may not keep the property at St Saviour&#8217;s House as her permanent London home in the months or years ahead.  Even if she does, I have seen internal photographs of the property as it was before the respondent acquired it.  I know its dimensions and its facilities.  I simply do not believe that S will feel herself disadvantaged in any way if she is living with her mother in a home similar to the property on Cheyne Walk.</span></p>

She has always invested a great deal in her homes and it will be important to ensure that she feels she has made her new home her own.  For these purposes I am proposing to allow a sum of up to &#163;1 million to enable her to carry out that work on top of the costs of acquisition.  She will have a substantial bill in respect of stamp duty as well as other moving costs.  Rounding up rather than down, I have reached the conclusion that a sum of &#163;18 million is an appropriate housing fund for the applicant and their daughter.  I am aware that this is not a significant departure from the value of the family home which they currently occupy.  However, we are not comparing like with like here.  The cost of an appropriate home in a prime residential area in central London is going to be greater than the cost of an equivalent property outside the immediate environs of the city.  In the light of the number of properties which were available to this family over the course of the marriage, and given the portfolio which the respondent, or his estate, will retain at its conclusion, I do not regard a housing fund for her principal residence of &#163;18 million as an unreasonable figure.  </span></p>

It will not be on the same scale as the entertaining she has done before but a claim anchored to needs cannot, in my judgment, ever justify unbridled spending, whatever the marital standard of living.</span></p>

There is no need for her to maintain three cars at a home she uses for only part of the year, nor for such high levels of staffing costs.  The same observations apply to the budgeted costs of staffing her principal home in London.  In this context, I have well in mind the observations of Baroness Hale about the need to structure a financial award so as to reflect a &#8220;gentle transition from the marital standard of living to that which [she] could expect as a self-sufficient woman&#8221;.  Whilst I am prepared to structure my award on the basis of a full life </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Duxbury</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> calculation, there is no question of the applicant having any realistic entitlement to an annual income which replicates that which she claims to have been her standard of living during the marriage over that period.  To be fair to her, that is not what she seeks.  She accepts that there should be step-downs at appropriate points over the life of the fund.  However, in my judgment, her base line is pitched at far too high a level.  For example, she accepted when pressed by Mr Warshaw in cross-examination that she probably could run her London property for about &#163;100,000 per annum.   Similarly, in the context of a gentle transition towards independence (which, in this case, means a transition to a standard of living which is disengaged over time from the marital standard of living), I do not consider it reasonable for her to expect the respondent to fund spending well over &#163;1 million per annum on clothes and beauty treatments.  As the coming years unfold she will be creating a life of her own.  She will not be able to replicate her life with respondent.  She is no longer his wife.  In my judgment, and echoing the words of Mostyn J, there has to come a point at which the connection between her former marital standard of living and her future needs becomes sufficiently tenuous to contemplate breaking that link.  My function in the context of this application is to determine a fair outcome as between these spouses and to carve out of the available resources a bespoke financial award which properly meets her future needs as the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">former</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> wife of a wealthy man.</span></p>

It seems to me that such an assessment has no place or relevance in my approach to this case.  The applicant is an independent woman.  She will make her own choices in future as to whether or not she chooses to remarry.  It would be impertinent of me to suggest that this court had any function in pre-determining such a choice on the basis of the likelihood of such an event materialising.  In any event, on what basis am I supposed to carry out that assessment ?  It is a non-issue as far as I am concerned.  I might have taken a different view on the facts if she was already in an established and committed relationship.  But she is not, and there the matter must lie.</span></p>

The applicant told me much about S&#8217;s love of country life and her wish to have somewhere to which they could go, close to her new boarding school, where they could enjoy time away from the city.  It is highly likely that the next few years will see significant changes in terms of S&#8217;s own views about how she spends her leisure time.  Any award which I make will include generous provision for holidays and weekends away.  The applicant advances the Henley property as one which meets her needs but she has not yet seen the property and the estate agents&#8217; particulars are in the bundle, so it seems to me, as no more than evidence of what that sum of money will secure in terms of properties in that area.  I am not persuaded that she has made out a case for the acquisition of a second English property with all the attendant running costs and I propose to make no allowance in my award for a Henley property or its equivalent.  The applicant will have adequate means at her disposal to spend as many weekends out of London as she chooses.

The first is when S completes her first degree in tertiary education after allowing for a gap year between school and university.  That will occur in January 2026 when she is 23 years old and the applicant will shortly be turning 64.

I have considered carefully whether the first step down should occur at a point sooner than 2026 in order to accelerate the curve of the &#8220;gentle transition&#8221; to independent living.  On balance, I am persuaded that such an adjustment should be deferred until the natural breakpoint of the completion of S&#8217;s tertiary education.  Whilst I accept that the applicant will still wish to provide her daughter with a home at that stage, the reality is that, as a young woman of independent means, it is highly likely that S will wish to move into a flat or apartment of her own.  I am equally persuaded that a further step down is justified when the applicant reaches the age of 75.  I hope and expect that she will still enjoy robust good health at that point in her life but inevitably she is likely to be leading a somewhat quieter social life to that which she presently enjoys.  That, in turn, will have a significant impact on her expenditure needs although I readily accept that these expenses may to a lesser extent be replaced by other expenses, such as the cost of additional help in her home.</span></p>

Of course it is reasonable that she should expect to employ for the foreseeable future a nanny (or some form of assistance with child care as the years roll by), a housekeeper and a live-out cleaner.  She probably also needs help with organising her social diary and co-ordinating the running of her home.  That does not require more than assistance from a live-out (and possibly part-time) personal assistant.

I am persuaded by Mr Warshaw&#8217;s suggestion and by the evidence which has been produced that she can purchase a smaller property in Beverly Hills at a saving of at least US$8 million.  That is approximately &#163;6 million on the basis of current </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">fx </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">rates which I accept may fluctuate significantly over the coming months.  Together with the value of the Roland Gardens apartment which she accepts can be sold that produces an overall contribution from her own resources of &#163;8.97 million.</span></p>

I am satisfied that the retention by her of her jewellery collection at the end of this marriage is an entirely appropriate reflection not only of the respondent&#8217;s generosity during their marriage but also of the common expectation which each had that her collection was intended for the purposes of personal adornment (to adopt a phrase once used by Thorpe LJ) and not for its intrinsic investment value.</span></p>

There is apparently a list in circulation of those items which she wishes to retain.  I would hope and expect that this aspect of her claims might be agreed.  As canvassed with leading counsel during the concluding minutes of the hearing, I will adjourn further consideration of what, if any, further provision needs to be made in this respect until there has been further consideration of the chattels issue between the two legal teams.  It would seem sensible to allow the applicant to retain a fair share of those contents.  Not only do they provide part of the fabric of S&#8217;s home; it seems unlikely that the respondent will be in a position to enjoy his chattels even if they are transported to one of his many residences around the world.</span></p>

It would be entirely inappropriate to seek to capitalise those costs even if it were possible.  To the extent that the applicant feels it incumbent on her to contribute to, or even subsidise entirely, the ongoing costs of her parents, I am satisfied that she will have sufficient resources to make that choice.</span></p>

If and insofar as there has to be some restructuring to extract funds from assets which passed under the 2013 contract of sale, then so be it.  That contract is entirely revocable at his election.  In these circumstances, there is no need for me to embark upon a process of drawing adverse inferences against the respondent in respect of the likely extent of his wealth, including any wealth which has not been disclosed in these proceedings.  The extent of the &#8220;visible&#8221; resources is more than adequate to dispose fairly of this application.  Given that I have not heard any evidence from the respondent, I am not prepared to make any further findings in relation to non-disclosure.  In my judgment, it would not be fair to conclude that he was in breach of his obligations to this court without having heard oral evidence and cross-examination.  Whilst I bear in mind the document which Mr Howard and Mr Nagpal produced for me as a summary, or vignette, of his trappings of wealth, I do not necessarily find that summary to be inconsistent with the capital and (very substantial eight figure) income which he has disclosed in these proceedings.</span></p>

The applicant, as her mother, is her primary carer.  She will make decisions about what S needs and what she spends.  On the basis of the provision which has been made for their child, I am satisfied that her needs are in the region of &#163;225,000 per annum, including the future cost of boarding school fees at her new school from September this year.  That figure is based on the figure of US$287,578 which the respondent says he has been contributing to her expenses and substituting the current  day school fees for the more expensive boarding school fees at the beginning of the next academic year.  Depending on the exchange rate which is applied, this sum capitalised is between &#163;1,711,436 and &#163;1,835,995.  The mid-point between those two figures is &#163;1,773,715.  Given the current volatility in exchange rates in the wake of the European referendum, I am no better placed than any of the financial pundits to anticipate where </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">fx </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">exchange rates may be by September this year or a year hence.

I do not intend to leave the applicant in a position where she has to negotiate with her step-daughters in relation to S&#8217;s ongoing needs and expenses.  The respondent identifies no assets in respect of which an ongoing child support obligation could be secured.  Unless its terms were very specific, it is doubtful whether such an order for secured provision would survive his death.  Accordingly, what I propose to do is to order a lump sum in respect of S&#8217;s future maintenance.  It will be paid by the respondent into an agreed designated account which is earmarked for these purposes.  The applicant has indicated through Mr Howard that she will give an undertaking to draw down against that account in the annual amount specified.  It is not entirely clear to me whether the capitalised sums on the agreed schedule include provision for indexation.  If they do not, I would ask junior counsel to provide me with figures which do include an uplift for inflation over the life of the child support order and I will deal with the figures once I have a draft order.  Any further issues can be dealt with at next Friday&#8217;s hearing but in principle I accept that S&#8217;s future needs will be dealt with by means of a capitalised lump sum notwithstanding the very generous provision which the respondent has already made for her under the provisions of Saudi law. </span></p>

It is of significance, in my judgment, that, having allowed her to keep the ring in her personal safe at BGH for a number of years, he removed it at a time when there were pressures on the marriage and during a period when it is highly likely that his relationship with his (soon to be) third wife, L, had begun.  Her repeated requests for its return were ignored.  I am satisfied that he knows exactly where the ring is and the identity of the donee (if he has indeed gifted it to a third party).  It will be a matter for the applicant whether or not she chooses to accept his offer of a further US$2 million in satisfaction of any claims she may have in respect of the ring.  If that offer (or an improved offer) is rejected, I shall make a declaration pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> of the Married Women&#8217;s Property Act 1882 that she is the legal and beneficial owner of this particular chattel.</span></p>
