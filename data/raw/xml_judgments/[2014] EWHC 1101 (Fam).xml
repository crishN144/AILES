	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 15 August 2011 DDJ Cornwell (deceased), conducted a financial remedy hearing at the conclusion of which he gave a judgment indicating that <span style="font-style:italic">the appropriate terms of the resolution of the financial applications would be for there to be an equal division of the assets</span>.   An order for costs was made against the husband.  Due to difficulties in locating the marriage certificate, <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi</span> had not been pronounced at the date of the hearing; the learned Deputy District Judge therefore ordered the wife forthwith to complete her application for <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi</span> and that, upon pronouncement of the <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi,</span> the matter was to be listed for mention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Eventually, 11 months later, the order was made and shortly afterwards the husband paid &#163;21,000 to the wife.  In circumstances which will be set out in a little more detail, thereafter on the 6 August 2013 the husband issued an application to set aside DDJ Cornwall&#8217;s financial remedy order for want of jurisdiction.  On 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2013 DDJ Crowther heard and allowed that application and set aside DDJ Cornwell&#8217;s order. The application to set aside was allowed on the basis that DDJ Cornwell had, by giving judgment prior to the granting of <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi</span> made an order in breach of <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s23</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref></span> which prohibits the making of an order in financial remedy proceedings prior to <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi.</span>  DDJ Crowther granted permission to appeal her decision.</p>

The answer was given by Counsel that<span style="font-style:italic"> we are where we are </span>and that by this stage the costs consequences resulting from the litigation render the case quite impossible to settle.  The wife&#8217;s costs are now over &#163;16,000.</p>

The parties had been married in India and had no copy of the marriage certificate. The wife&#8217;s solicitors accordingly undertook to the court to provide either the marriage certificate or appropriate evidence of marriage.  It was this evidential difficulty that caused the subsequent delay in obtaining the <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi</span> which in turn was responsible for the difficulties now faced.  </p>

This money was the sum that the husband had been awarded following TOLATA proceedings against his son in relation to the former matrimonial home.  When the final hearing of the ancillary relief came on in front of DDJ Cornwall on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2011 the <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi</span> had still not been obtained.  </p>

The learned Deputy District Judge noted the length of the marriage, the poor health of the parties and the absence of pensions; he found that the only assets were the proceeds of the litigation already mentioned, together with several plots of land in India worth little or nothing.  DDJ Cornwall unhesitatingly concluded that there should be an equal division of the assets and went on <span style="font-style:italic">I will assume that the husband has made an application for ancillary relief and dismiss them both save for the payment of the lump sum.  </span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">I have been very impressed by the arguments put forward by counsel but I have come to the decision that is essential to distinguish between orders obtained by consent and orders obtained after evidence and when the judge had to make a determination of contested issues.  In for example, Pounds the court found that it was perfectly in order for a district judge to give advance approval to the terms of a consent order on the basis that nothing would be put in a perfected and enforceable order of the court until after decree nisi, and I think circumstances of that kind, which are very common in this court, can be sharply distinguished from what happened before district judge Cornwall.  I think what is fatal to the wife&#8217;s claim in the court order is the words that district judge Cornwell &#8220;delivered a judgment&#8221; as to the appropriate terms of the resolution.  I do not think the wife can escape the fact that the word judgment was used and that was intended to be a formal determination of the parties&#8217; claims.  I am told that the note of hearing is an unreliable document.  I think it is a little late for that point to be raised.  It is amongst the papers given to me and I see correspondence referring to it.  Nobody appears to have disputed it until now, but in it he does dismiss the parties claim with the exception of the lump sum issue, and that is something which is done at the conclusion, where appropriate, of an ancillary relief judgment.  </span></p>

It will not have much impact on the financial case because, as I have said, he has acted in the spirit of what DDJ Cornwell said by sharing the sum with the wife.  The only current issue therefore that follows from this judgment today is the issue of costs.  I will have to hear what counsel has to say on that matter.</span></p>

It is upon the decree, or thereafter.  To make such determination before that point in time is clearly not authorised by the language of the act.  The court has to consider the resources of the parties at that time and not earlier.  That remains so where the parties have consented.  Even in the case of consent order there must be some enquiry by the court into the resources of the party on or after the decree.  The registrar made an order on 23 May 1983, which was to take effect on an ascertainable date in the future.  When that date ultimately materialised, the resources could well have materially changed.  The short answer to the appellants in this case is that, if the true intention of the registrar was to make an order that was to take effect in the future, he had no jurisdiction to form such an intent.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Anthony Lincoln J referred to the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">even in consent orders there must be some enquiry by the court into the resources of the party on or after the decree.</span> That, with respect to Mr Bryden, does not help him as, not only is that <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> observation inconsistent with the later<span style="font-style:italic"> ratio</span> in <span style="font-style:italic">Pounds, </span>but <span style="font-style:italic"/>if that were the case, consent orders approved prior to the making of <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi </span>would be as vulnerable as orders made after a contested hearing. Mr Bryden submits that consent orders are saved by <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s33</ref>A MCA. </span> I cannot agree, the issue with which we are concerned is an issue of timing and not of depth of enquiry and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s33</ref>A in my judgment deals with the latter not the former.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Pounds</span> the Court of Appeal held that: <span style="font-style:italic">There was neither the scope nor the necessity for any fresh appraisal, after decree nisi, on the merits of the proposed consent order [1549d]</span>. In my judgment precisely the same principle applies to indications of outcome contained in a judgment; the only difference being that in a consent order, policy has limited the depth of enquiry necessary where parties have reached a concluded agreement, whereas in a case where there is a dispute requiring resolution by the court, a more detailed consideration of the evidence is needed through the calling of witnesses and the hearing of argument resulting in the giving of a judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment in both cases FPR 29.15 gives the court discretion as to the date of implementation and in neither case is there a necessity or requirement <span style="font-style:italic">for any fresh appraisal after decree nisi</span>. I should emphasise that it remains the case that FPR 29.15 has no impact on the basic jurisdictional principle encapsulated in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s23</ref> N<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> and regardless of whether the court is dealing with a consent order on the one hand or an disputed issue on the other, if the court purports to make an order or provides for a judgment to take effect prior to <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi, </span>the resulting order will be a nullity and cannot be saved by FPR 29.15.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment it is apparent from the wording used by DDJ Cornwell that he was giving an indication of outcome by way of a judgment with the order to be made at a later date pursuant to FPR 29.15 the date being the granting of <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi</span>. In accordance with that indication, an order was made after and not before <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi. </span>It follows that I allow the wife&#8217;s appeal as I find that the Deputy District Judge did not err in law having had at all times the jurisdiction to hear the case, give a judgment and provide for the consequential order to be made after <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Costs must follow the event in this case and I make an order that the husband pays the wife&#8217;s costs of the appeal here and below to be assessed if not agreed. It is most unfortunate that the husband did not maintain the pragmatic view he took earlier in the proceedings that  is to say that whilst he did not accept that the court should have made the financial remedy order, the outcome was one which he did not seek to disturb. In deciding to pursue the application to set aside the substantive order, having succeeded in setting aside the costs order, the husband unfortunately seemed, as he danced on a jurisdictional pin head, to lose sight of the fact that the outcome was still right. The jurisdictional argument has been a luxury which this family, of all families, simply could not afford even if, as was indicated to me at the start of the hearing, the litigation was by then driven entirely by considerations of costs.</p>
