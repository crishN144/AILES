	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment concerns two test cases brought by the Public Guardian, by applications made under s.23 and Schedule 1 paragraph 11 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, regarding the validity of words in lasting powers of attorney (&#8220;LPAs&#8221;). The first concerns words relating to euthanasia or assisted suicide, whereas the second concerns words as to the appointment of multiple attorneys. Although the substance of the issues to which the words are directed is very different in the two cases, there is considerable overlap in the legal argument, the active parties were the same in the two sets of proceedings (the Public Guardian and the Official Solicitor) represented by the same counsel, and it is convenient to consider both cases in one judgment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;A power of attorney is simply a formal arrangement, undertaken by deed, whereby one person (&#8216;the donor&#8217;) entrusts to another person (&#8216;the attorney&#8217; or &#8216;the donee&#8217;) authority to act in his or her name and on his or her behalf. A power of attorney is a form of agency which has been recognised at common law and used for centuries to enable the affairs of the donor (the principal) to be conducted on his or her behalf by an attorney (the agent) while the donor is away on business, overseas or physically unwell&#8221; (Court of Protection Practice 2018, Lexis Nexis paragraph 3.1). At common law, a power of attorney is revoked by the supervening incapacity of the donor. Following an investigation report by the Law Commission, Parliament enacted the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/29" uk:canonical="1985 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985</ref> creating the &#8220;enduring power of attorney&#8221; which provided that a power of attorney that complied with certain statutory requirements as to format and registration would &#8220;endure&#8221; beyond the onset of incapacity. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> replaced enduring powers of attorney with new &#8220;Lasting Powers of Attorney&#8221;, although all existing enduring powers of attorney continue in effect. The rationale for the change in the law, arising out of perceived problems with Enduring Powers of Attorney, is summarised at paragraph 3.56 of the Court of Protection Practice 2018. The principal statutory provisions are set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 9</ref> to 14 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, and are supplemented by rules set out in the Lasting Powers of Attorney, Enduring Powers of Attorney and Public Guardian Regulations 2007, SI 2007/1253 (&#8220;the 2007 Regulations&#8221;). </p>

Amongst those functions under s.58(1) are establishing and maintaining a register of lasting powers of attorney, receiving reports from donees of lasting powers of attorney, and dealing with representations about the way in which a donee of a lasting power of attorney is exercising his powers. The statutory provisions are supplemented by Part 4 of the 2007 Regulations and various Practice Notes. Under regulation 43, the Public Guardian &#8220;has the function of making applications to the [Court of Protection] in connection with his functions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> in such circumstances as he considers it necessary or appropriate to do so&#8221;.</p>

XZ executed an LPA which stipulated a number of restrictions and conditions designed to ensure that his attorneys did not act until his incapacity had been unequivocally confirmed by two psychiatrists, whose opinion was subject to review by a &#8220;protector&#8221;, and had endured for a minimum period of 60 days. The Public Guardian refused to register the LPA because he considered that the conditions imposed an unreasonable fetter on the attorneys&#8217; power to act and were, therefore, ineffective as part of an LPA. The court, (Senior Judge Lush), granted a declaration that the LPA did not contain any provisions which would render it ineffective and made an order that the Public Guardian register the instrument. The court held that the Public Guardian&#8217;s function under paragraph 11 of Schedule 1 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> was limited to considering whether the conditions and restrictions in an LPA were ineffective as part of an LPA or would prevent the instrument from operating as a valid LPA. If he concluded that they could not be given legal effect, then he was under a duty to apply to the court for determination of the point under s.23(1). Otherwise, he had a duty to register the power. Neither the court nor the Public Guardian was concerned with whether a restriction that does not contravene the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> might pose practical difficulties in its operation. In this case, the Public Guardian had failed to identify any specific provision of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> or the 2007 Regulations or the common law of agency that had been infringed by the provisions in XZ&#8217;s LPA.</p>

I also granted the Public Guardian permission to withdraw two of the applications in respect of which agreement had been reached.  At a further hearing on 1 March, I gave similar directions in the second series of applications, including giving permission to the Public Guardian to withdraw five of the applications in that series.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the first series of cases, all the applications concerned provisions in LPAs for personal welfare which contemplate euthanasia or assisted suicide by the attorneys. In some cases, the provisions are expressed in mandatory terms which appear to render them &#8220;instructions&#8221;, whereas in other cases they are expressed as wishes rendering them non-binding &#8220;preferences&#8221;. I was informed by Mr Entwistle on behalf of the Public Guardian that about 120 cases of this sort arise every year and at present there is a substantial backlog. Mr Entwistle submitted that it is desirable to avoid having to refer every such LPA to the Court. The aim of the Public Guardian in bringing these applications is to be put in a position to provide guidance as to whether provisions of this sort are lawful and likely to be severed by the court. While it would be open to donors to take their own legal advice, or require an application to be made to the Court, it is anticipated that most cases would be resolved by agreement. This seems to me to be eminently sensible. I was told that until recently it had been the practice of the Public Guardian to write to donors of LPAs containing provisions of this nature inviting them to agree that they should be severed, but that this practice had been discontinued in the light of observations of District Judge Eldergill in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">The Public Guardian&#8217;s Severance Applications</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2017/10" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCOP 10" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCOP 10</ref>.

All of the individual LPAs under consideration in this case included a provision giving the attorneys the authority to give or refuse consent to such treatment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a substantial measure of agreement between the Public Guardian and the Official Solicitor as to the approach to be adopted by the court in determining that question. On behalf of the Official Solicitor, Mr Rees put forward a series of propositions, the majority of which were accepted by Mr Entwistle on behalf of the Public Guardian. Unless the instrument contains a provision which would be ineffective as part of a LPA, or would prevent it from operating as a valid LPA, the Public Guardian is under a statutory duty to register it. There is no residual discretion which permits him to decline to register an instrument merely because he considers that it would not be in P&#8217;s best interest to do so: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re XZ</span>, supra. If an LPA contains an instruction requiring the attorney to act in a manner that is inconsistent with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/9-10/60" uk:canonical="1961 (9 &amp; 10 Eliz. 2) c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> or the general law, it will generally be ineffective as part of the LPA. If the words used in a &#8220;preference&#8221; are purely precatory, then this expression of a wish cannot prevent the instrument from operating as a valid LPA, even if the wish is not capable of being given effect within the confines of the attorneys&#8217; current powers. Equally, words in &#8220;preferences&#8221; should not be considered to be &#8220;ineffective as part of an LPA&#8221; if they are capable of providing assistance to the attorneys as to how they should seek to exercise their powers, notwithstanding that the expressed wishes go beyond what the attorneys are permitted to do under the LPA. In oral submissions, Mr Rees warned against too prescriptive an interpretation of the statutory provisions, stressing that the court should not be striving to set aside or sever powers under an LPA unless it is clear that they meet the conditions for doing so under Schedule 1 paragraph 11. In this context, he reminded me of the observation of Nugee J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miles v The Public Guardian; Beattie v The Public Guardian</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2015/2960" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2960 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2960 (Ch)</ref> at paragraph 19:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the other hand, an attorney cannot use an LPA as a basis for carrying out an illegal act. As such, the Public Guardian and the Official Solicitor agree that a &#8220;preference&#8221; that the attorneys carry out an act which would on its face be a criminal offence should generally be treated as &#8220;ineffective as part of an LPA&#8221;. Thus both an instruction to end a donor&#8217;s life, or to assist in that process, and a preference that the attorney should do something amounting to ending the donor&#8217;s life, or assisting in that process, are both ineffective. Such an instruction or preference, if complied with, would lead the attorney to act unlawfully, rather than act in a way which merely exceeds his powers. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Public Guardian and the Official Solicitor part company on two points. First, Mr Rees on behalf of the Official Solicitor submits that the interpretation of an instruction or preference in an instrument is a matter of construction to be considered by reference to the words used by the donor. If the words used are expressed in mandatory terms, they should usually be seen as instructions, even if contained in the box on the form specified for preferences. Conversely, words used by the donor to indicate merely an expression of a preference should be regarded as such, even if contained in the box specified for instructions. On this point, Mr Entwistle demurs. He submits that the starting point should be the printed words on the form which stipulate, in respect of preferences, that &#8220;your attorneys don&#8217;t have to follow your preferences but they should keep them in mind&#8221; and, in respect of instructions, &#8220;your attorneys will have to follow your instructions exactly&#8221;.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_26">
	  <num>26.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Rees argued that a distinction should be drawn between those cases where a wish for the attorneys to carry out an illegal act is expressed in general terms, and those where the carrying out of the wish is contingent upon there being a change in the law. He submitted that, in the latter case, the provision is not &#8220;ineffective&#8221; but can rather be viewed as a valid expression of wishes intended to govern a contingency that may arise in the future if circumstances, and the law, change. Mr Rees submitted that there was no good reason why a donor should not express a wish that his life be ended if circumstances and the law so permitted and that such an interpretation was consistent with the flexible approach advocated by Nugee J in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miles</span> case as necessary to protect the personal autonomy of donors. On behalf of the Public Guardian, however, Mr Entwistle submitted that such provisions should nevertheless be severed. Although he acknowledged that questions about euthanasia and assisted suicide are matters of widespread public debate and the subject of serious proposals for reform, Mr Entwistle submitted that any relevant change in the law would have to provide, not merely that assisted suicide was no longer unlawful, but would have to permit an attorney to comply with an instruction or expressed preference in an LPA to bring about the donor&#8217;s death. He argued that there is no prospect of the law being changed so as to allow an attorney to sanction the termination of the donor&#8217;s life in this way. As a result, an interpretation that permitted all provisions made in contemplation of a change in the law would present the Public Guardian with difficult questions of construction and significant practical problems in seeking to identify those provisions in LPAs that were or were not ineffective. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the first issue between the parties, I prefer Mr Rees&#8217; argument. Applying Nugee J&#8217;s approach requiring flexibility to ensure that the donor&#8217;s autonomy is fully respected, I agree that an instruction is a direction in mandatory terms wherever it appears on the form. Thus, a stipulation in the &#8220;preferences&#8221; box that is clearly mandatory should be interpreted as an instruction. Equally, a provision in the &#8220;instructions&#8221; box may be couched in terms that make it clear that it is intended to be a preference.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the second point, however, I accept Mr Entwistle&#8217;s submission that instructions and preferences predicated on a change in the law are ineffective. It seems to me that the ways in which the law could be changed in this field are so many and varied that permitting an LPA to be registered when containing an instruction or preference as to the attorney&#8217;s actions should the law change would lead to uncertainty and confusion. Towards the end of oral submissions, Mr Rees suggested that a clause which stipulated that &#8220;if at any point it becomes permitted as a matter of English law for my attorney to make a decision that my life should be terminated in certain circumstances and those circumstances arise, then I express a wish for my attorney to make a decision that terminates my life&#8221; would meet the objections raised on behalf of the Public Guardian. But in the event that Parliament at some future point permits an attorney to take steps to terminate the donor&#8217;s life, any change in the law is likely to be subject to detailed statutory provisions and guidance in a Code of Practice, the terms of which cannot at this stage be predicted. In those circumstances, for this court to give the green light to the inclusion in LPAs of any such provision at this stage would be likely to cause uncertainty and confusion. In those circumstances, the right course is to declare all such provisions, whether they be instructions or preferences, ineffective.</p>

It was taken into account when decision was made to place her mother on palliative care. LB commented: &#8220;I thoroughly reject the comments made by the Office of the Public Guardian regarding this wording. It does not entice illegal behaviour. Rather it placed on me the responsibility to share the document with family members and with her medical team. My role was one of making the document, and her wishes, known so that the appropriate action could be considered.&#8221;</p>

It should be noted that LB has elsewhere in the LPA authorised her attorneys to give or refuse consent to the carrying out or continuation of life-sustaining treatment.

It follows, as Mr Rees submits on behalf of the Official Solicitor, that, where the appointment of the attorneys is, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/10/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(4)</ref>(c), to act jointly in respect of some matters and jointly and severally in respect of others, it is essential that the donor identifies the decisions that are to be taken jointly. Under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/10/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(5)</ref>, a failure to do so would lead to an assumption that the attorneys are appointed act jointly. At the same time, the Public Guardian, and the Court, must, as Nugee J emphasised in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miles</span> case (supra), construe <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/9-10/60" uk:canonical="1961 (9 &amp; 10 Eliz. 2) c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> in a way which gives as much flexibility as possible to donors to set out how they wish their affairs to be dealt with, in order to give proper respect to a donor&#8217;s autonomy. Just as I consider the wording of the instrument to be more important than the boxes in which the wording appears, so I consider that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, where there is an internal inconsistency in an LPA between the way in which the donor has ticked the box in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of the form and the detailed instructions contained in section 7, it is the latter which should take precedence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his comprehensive written submissions, Mr Rees also considered cases in which the instruments contain &#8220;preferences&#8221; (or, under the early regulations, &#8220;guidance&#8221;) or &#8220;instructions&#8221; (or, under the earlier regulations, &#8220;restrictions and/or conditions&#8221;) which are inconsistent with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/10/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(4)</ref>. So far as &#8220;preferences&#8221; (or &#8220;guidance&#8221;) are concerned, Mr Rees submits that such provisions are merely precatory in effect, do not impose any formal restriction on the attorney&#8217;s powers, and cannot therefore cause the instrument to fail to comply with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/10/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(4)</ref>. In contrast, &#8220;instructions&#8221; which are inconsistent with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/10/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(4)</ref> cause difficulties as the three bases upon which attorneys can be appointed under that subsection are exhaustive. Mr Rees submits that, notwithstanding that the donor could have achieved his or her purpose by the execution of two separate LPAs, this cannot be achieved by the execution of a single instrument. In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">The Public Guardian&#8217;s Severance Application</span> (supra), District Judge Eldergill suggested that there was nothing objectionable in an arrangement which provided that two of the attorneys must always agree on any decision jointly whereas the third could act independently and that it should not be necessary to create two instruments in order to achieve such an objective. Mr Rees acknowledges that the District Judge&#8217;s view is consistent with the principle of flexibility but submits that it is contrary to the clear wording of the statute. Although I have not heard a full-contested argument on that point, it seems to me that Mr Rees&#8217; submission is well-founded.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, Mr Rees addresses the situation where an LPA requires the attorney to obtain the consent of a third party before acting. Mr Rees contends that there is nothing inherently objectionable in such a provision. As set out above, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/9/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.9(4)</ref> provides that the authority conferred by an LPA is subject not only to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/9-10/60" uk:canonical="1961 (9 &amp; 10 Eliz. 2) c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, in particular the general principles and the provisions as to best interests but also to any conditions or restrictions stipulated in the instrument. Mr Rees submits that there is nothing in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/9-10/60" uk:canonical="1961 (9 &amp; 10 Eliz. 2) c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> to prevent the donor imposing all kinds of restrictions upon the exercise of the attorney&#8217;s powers including a requirement to obtain the consent of a third party before the powers are exercised. Although such a restriction potentially limits the attorney&#8217;s powers to act, it does not turn the third party into an attorney or alter the attorney&#8217;s status as the person who ultimately makes the decision on behalf of the donor. I agree with Mr Rees&#8217; submissions on this issue. Restrictions of this kind are consistent with the underlying principle that respect must be given wherever possible to the donor&#8217;s autonomy. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be seen that this clause is drafted in a way that requires the attorney to obtain his children&#8217;s consent before taking certain steps. It does not turn the children into attorneys or alter the attorney&#8217;s status as the person who ultimately makes the decision on behalf of the donor. On behalf of the Public Guardian, Mr Entwistle submits that this provision should be construed as a condition or restriction specified in the instrument within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/9/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.9(4)</ref>(b) and therefore does not require severance and should be allowed to stand. On behalf of the Official Solicitor, Mr Rees agrees with the general proposition. Both counsel point out, however, that the second matter mentioned in the instruction &#8211; the choice of a nursing home for the donor if it becomes necessary for her welfare &#8211; relates to a personal welfare decision as opposed to a property and affairs decision is therefore ineffective as part of a property and affairs LPA, and should therefore be severed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with both advocates that the provision requiring the attorney to obtain the children&#8217;s consent before taking certain steps should be construed as a condition or restriction specified in the instrument within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/9/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.9(4)</ref>(b) and therefore does not require severance. But I agree with Mr Rees&#8217;s submission that the words relating to the nursing home must be severed but in every other respect the instruction is valid and the instrument may be registered as an LPA.</p>
