CC&#8217;s poor compliance has caused problems with his eyes, but more recently has resulted in renal failure requiring dialysis, and ultimately it is hoped a kidney transplant. It is clear that there is a complex interaction between CC&#8217;s mental disorder and his physical condition and thus physical health needs.  </p>

He has also had persecutory beliefs that people are trying to kill him or his family. When he is depressed he very significantly neglects his own wellbeing including by refusing treatment for his physical health problems. </span></p>

This can lead to him becoming very easily agitated and very aggressive or abusive when he is agitated. He has significant difficulties in thinking through his actions and in particular accepting short term discomfort in order to achieve his long term goals. His personality disorder makes it exceptionally difficult for him to make any decision considering information other than the here and now. [CC]&#8217;s personality disorder leads to him depending very significantly on others to contain his distress and manage his problems for him. Historically this has been a dependence on his mother to do these things for him, and currently he projects this onto staff working with him as well as his family. [CC]&#8217;s personality disorder leads him to refuse treatment of his physical health problems as he is not able to weigh up the short term impact of having treatment that he does not immediately want, against his long term goal of staying alive&#8217;.</span> 17.<span style="font-family:Arial"/>Dr H further states that:</p>

On 26 January 2020 CC sustained hyperkaleamic paralysis from very high potassium levels, which was a result of refusal to attend some dialysis sessions.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In my view this is a clear case of the treatment proposed, the dialysis, treating a manifestation of the mental disorder, namely personality disorder. The need for dialysis stems from CC&#8217;s self-neglect, including in regard to diet, which has led in whole or in part to his kidney failure. The reason his diabetes has resulted in kidney failure is to a </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">large extent because of that self-neglect, which is itself a consequence of his mental disorder. Mr Lock argued that the primary cause of the condition which required the treatment must be the mental disorder. As with any mental disorder or mental illness and its link to physical ill-health, causation and the link between the mental and physical condition is intensely complex and not really amenable to a primary cause analysis. However, it seems to me clear that the physical condition CC is now in, by which dialysis is critical to keep him alive, is properly described as a manifestation of his mental disorder. There is a very real prospect that if he was not mentally ill he would self care in a way that would have not led to the need for dialysis. Further, that CC is refusing dialysis is very obviously a manifestation of his mental disorder. When he is mentally well he agrees to dialysis. His situation is therefore highly analogous with that of the force feeding cases. </p>

It is in my view sufficient that a purpose of the proposed treatment is to alleviate a manifestation of the mental disorder. There is no suggestion in any of the caselaw that I have referred to above that the Court (or a clinician) has to go through the type of exercise Mr Lock proposes.

Part IV of the MHA now deals expressly with the power compulsorily to treat where that is the object of the detention. A distinction is drawn between the most invasive treatment, which can only be administered with the capacitated consent of the patient (section 57), medical treatment for mental disorder, which requires capacitated consent or the opinions of two medical officers that the treatment should be given having regard to the likelihood that it will alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the patient's condition (section 58) and other medical treatment for the patient's mental condition, which can be administered without consent (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>). </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Further she argues that Mr Lock accepts that the dialysis itself does not fall within section 58 because it does not involve the giving of medicine. To the degree that Mr Lock is relying on the sedative (midazolam) as being medicine that is not being used to treat the mental disorder but rather to facilitate the treatment plan. The Trust would be in an unworkable situation by which part of the proposed treatment plan (the dialysis), would go by way of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref> and another part (the sedation) would be under section 58. I note that this would also be the case with force feeding cases, which is the subject matter of much of the caselaw, because the feeding itself would not fall under section 58 but any sedation given would. It will often if not always be the case that any force feeding treatment plan will include the prospect of sedation. Therefore, Ms Sutton argues that in practice, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref> would become largely if not wholly unworkable.  </p>

It requires every individual element of the treatment being given to the patient to be directed to his mental condition. But in my view this test applies only to the treatment as a whole. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/145/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 145(1)</ref> gives a wide definition to the term "medical treatment." It includes "nursing, and also includes care, habilitation and rehabilitation under medical supervision." So a range of acts ancillary to the core treatment fall within the definition. I accept that by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(2)</ref>(b) a patient with a psychopathic disorder cannot be detained unless the proposed treatment, taken as a whole, is "likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of his condition." In my view, contrary to the submission of Mr. Francis, "condition" in this paragraph means the mental disorder on grounds of which the application for his admission and detention has been made. It follows that if there was no proposed treatment for Ms. B.'s psychopathic disorder, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref> could not have been invoked to justify feeding her by nasogastric tube. Indeed, it would not be lawful to detain her at all. </span></p>

I emphasise that this is not a case of CC simply making a poor decision with which the Court and the health professionals do not agree. Mr Maguire&#8217;s Attendance Note and Dr H&#8217;s evidence are both clear, that when well CC does not wish to die and wishes to have dialysis. His change of position is a function of his mental state worsening, and that in turn is a function at least in part of him refusing dialysis. I therefore find that when CC refuses dialysis he does lack capacity.  </p>

In particular, he pointed out that women did quite frequently change their view on what obstetric interventions they wished for once labour began. But because the woman here would not have that opportunity, because she was likely to lose capacity, the judge needed to ensure that her range of obstetric options were not closed down when she went into labour. It was in those circumstances that he was prepared to make the contingent declaration under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>.  </p>

CC currently has capacity and is clear that he wants to have dialysis; that he does not want to die; and that he wishes to continue to have dialysis if he loses capacity. This is therefore in practice akin to an advance decision under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, albeit that he has not gone through the formal processes of an advance decision contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> and it is an advance decision to accept treatment not refuse it. It is in those circumstances relatively easy to declare that if CC loses capacity in respect of a decision about dialysis, then it is in his best interests to have dialysis in accordance with the care and treatment plan proposed. Such a declaration undoubtedly accords with CC&#8217;s wishes and feelings, both because he has said so when he has capacity, but also because he is clear that he wants to live, and if he does not have dialysis then at some point he will die very prematurely. </p>
