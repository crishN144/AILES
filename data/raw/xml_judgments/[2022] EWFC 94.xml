CAFCASS have undertaken safeguarding checks and in a section 7 report dated 10.02.02 they made various recommendations; however it became apparent that there was a complete breakdown and accordingly a Child&#8217;s Guardian was appointed under Section 16(4) Children Act.

The inherent probability or improbability of an event remains a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. Within this context, there is no room for a finding by the court that something might have happened. The court may decide that it did or that it did not &#8211; see Re B [2008] UKHL 35 where at [2], Lord Hoffman said &#8220;In our legal system, if a judge finds it more likely than not that something did take place, then it is treated as having taken place. If he finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place. He is not allowed to sit on the fence. He has to find for one side or the other. Sometimes the burden of proof will come to his rescue: the party with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied him that it did. But generally speaking a judge is able to make up his mind where the truth lies without needing to rely upon the burden of proof." </span></p>

The role of the court is to consider the evidence in its totality and to make findings on the balance of probabilities accordingly.

The court must be careful to bear in mind that a witness may lie for many reasons, such as shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear and distress, and the fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything (see R v Lucas [1981] QB 720).

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt">&#8216;One highly important aspect of the Lucas decision, and indeed the approach to lies generally in the criminal jurisdiction, needs to be borne fully in mind by family judges. It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the 'lie' is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is 'capable of amounting to a corroboration.' In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Middleton [2001] Crim.L.R. 251. 'In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should, therefore, take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt'.&#8217;</span></p>

I found her to be an impressive witness and there were no occasions where she was shown to have either lied or contradicted her evidence. Her oral evidence was consistent with her written evidence and the undisputed evidence of the text messages. It was clear from her evidence and her demeanour that she has been distressed as a result of the behaviour of the father in sending the text messages and making the phone calls and that she found them to be abusive, offensive and harassing. She stated that had asked him to stop on several occasions but he persisted. It was constant and abusive for days at a time, up to 50 messages a day, relentless and it made her very anxious. For one message trail she counted 353 messages. Father disputed that precise number but offered no alternative. In reality whether there was 300/350 makes no difference. The mother was worried the father was going to turn up at her house or nursery. It was, she said, a very difficult time with days of constant abuse whilst trying to look after her daughter; it took its toll upon her. It was, she said, daily abuse, every time she looked at her phone and eventually she contacted the police.</span></p>

His oral evidence and presentation was strikingly different from that of the mother. He showed considerable frustration during his evidence and was very emotional at times, cold and laughing at other times. His evidence was also inconsistent and often changed during the time he was giving evidence, when questioned or challenged. He was not a very credible witness. I do not believe that he has actually told lies, but he has a high and self-justified perception of himself and his behaviour which suggests a lack of understanding and empathy. He was frequently evasive in his answers, deflecting blame, answering his own questions rather than those asked and minimising his behaviour. Throughout all of his evidence he repeatedly placed the blame for the way he behaved upon the mother&#8217;s refusal to meet him/agree to contact, even when accepting that he had behaved badly. It is important that I address some examples of this.</span></p>

He was wholly inconsistent. At times he showed remorse and apologised, but then almost immediately accused the mother of lying, exaggerating and acting. He stated in one breath that he would do the same again, next time he would not and in his closing statement he said again he would still send a lot of messages but not insults. It is very clear to me that the father does not accept that his behaviour has caused the mother the level of abuse which she is clear that she feels she has suffered at his hands. He stated that he understood the meaning of &#8220;Domestic Abuse&#8221; but then denied, on many occasions, that his behaviour had been abusive at all. Whether this was simply him not being entirely honest, or is a lack of understanding of the true meaning of abuse, or a complete lack of understanding of the effect of his behaviour upon the mother, &#8220;A&#8221; and her family, or indeed deliberate or thoughtless minimisation of his behaviour I do not know. I suspect neither does the father as he was simply unable to decide whether to accept the allegations that the behaviour was abusive and impactful or even to maintain any acceptance/denial of his behaviour in his evidence.</span></p>

The repeated insistence that all of this could have been avoided if the mother had met with him and that she had caused it all (&#8220;brought it on herself&#8221;) shows to me that he does not understand the true meaning and extent of domestic abuse and its effect despite his protestations to the contrary. On several occasions he insisted that he had not been physically violent &#8211; that is not disputed. Abuse, however, takes many forms and here it has been a sustained course of action against the mother.  I remind myself of the definition: &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt">incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt">In my judgment the father has committed domestic abuse against the mother with a pattern of coercive, abusive, offensive and threatening behaviour comprising of both psychological and emotional abuse. What is of considerable concern to the court is that having accepted that he behaved badly on occasions, the father then stated that he would do so again. He has no understanding of how his actions have affected both the mother and &#8220;A&#8221; to date and how they would continue to be affected in the future and until he truly accepts and understands how his behaviour has affected the mother, she will remain at risk of further abuse, as will &#8220;A&#8221; in her care. The father appears to accept only that some of the insults and words he used were wrong but not the frequency of calls/texts which were made. He needs to cease blaming the mother to justify his own actions and fully take responsibility. He needs to provide evidence of change and understanding, not merely half-hearted apologies, half admissions / part acceptances and deflection.</span></p>
