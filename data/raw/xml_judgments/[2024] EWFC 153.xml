Given that Q&#8217;s maternal aunt and uncle had looked after Q and P for a few hours the evening before presentation at hospital and in light of the inability to pinpoint exactly when the injury was likely to have occurred, the LA intervened, removed into extended family placements both P and Q but also the children of the aunt and uncle.  Part IV proceedings were issued in relation to the children of both families, which were, for obvious reasons, consolidated.</span></p>

[Q] sustained a skull fracture and this was deemed to be non-accidental either from a direct blow to [Q]&#8217;s head or due to lack of supervision.  Professionals are no closer to understanding the cause of injury, therefore a finding of fact was initially considered.  However, the Local Authority has been informed by a high court judgment from Mrs Justice Leiven </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">[sic]</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond"> dated 5</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond"> December 2022, which informed of a similar single-issue case where a child sustained a significant injury and parents had a positive parenting assessment.  The judgment outlined that a finding of fact was not proportionate as it is unlikely that parents would accept the findings or that a 9 day finding of fact hearing would be proportionate so the children can know the &#8216;truth&#8217;.  Therefore, The Local Authority did not deem this plan to be appropriate as it would simply delay care planning for the children. </span></p>

It has been recognised that this is a single issue case meaning that aside from the significant injury, there have been no other concerns.  However, while this may be true the risk cannot be disregarded.  Therefore, during the assessment process conversations were had with parents regarding appropriate supervision as Dr Elias Jones had noted that the injury may have been sustained through a &#8216;blow to the head&#8217; or &#8216;through lack of supervision&#8217;. </span></p>

However, there have been conversations undertaken with both [F] and [M] to ensure proper supervision takes place following the proceedings.  They have both shared that supervision of [P] and [Q] following the proceedings will be prioritised and shared that it is likely that they will not leave their children anywhere due to the injury [Q] has sustained. </span></p>

Both [F] and [M] have evidenced throughout these proceedings that they will willingly engage in any support and advice offered.  In addition to this, there has also been a positive assessment of parents. </span></p>

At a hearing before HHJ Hillier on 27 April 2023, the learned judge noted the LA&#8217;s intention to begin to transition both sets of children from their extended family placements back to their parents&#8217; care, and that this was within the LA&#8217;s discretion pursuant to its holding parental responsibility.  However, in relation to the application to withdraw the underlying proceedings, a matter over which the court does hold jurisdiction, HHJ Hillier noted the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;very serious circumstances&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> in which the proceedings were brought, clearly had in mind that a CIN plan&#8217;s success entirely relies on the voluntary compliance with it by the parents of the children involved, and listed the application before her on 7 June 2023.  </span></p>

The learned judge pointed, in particular, to two further aspects of the respective couples&#8217; current circumstances which had not featured adequately in the assessment process.  While I do not have a transcript of that hearing, it seems very likely to me that the judge was concerned about the speed with which the LA had so fundamentally changed its stance and absence of any real reasoning or intelligible assessment of risk.  It seems from the order from that hearing that, on indicating her concerns, the judge stood the matter for advice to be given and instructions taken.  The LA changed its stance again, returning to its position that there should be a fact-finding hearing.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian (&#8220;the CG&#8221;), who had initially supported the LA&#8217;s withdrawal application, also changed her mind.  Clearly HHJ Hillier also considered that there should be adjudication of the relevant contested facts as she listed the case before me for a pre-hearing review on 21 June 2023 and a composite final hearing for five days beginning on 7 August 2023.</span></p>

I would have expected the starting point of the analysis to be the confluence of two hugely important factors, first, that, by my finding, M inflicted an extremely serious injury, which could easily have been fatal, to her own nine-month-old baby, and second, that she continues absolutely to deny doing so.  The combination of these two factors must equate to the ongoing existence of a real risk to the children of serious physical harm, a risk which is substantive but not exactly quantifiable as the denial prevents exploration of the triggers to the assault.  Rather, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">[SW-AP]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">&#8217;s reasoning seemed to move immediately from identification of the injury and denial to exposition of the various positive factors which, in her opinion, all but eliminate any ongoing risk.</span></p>

Meaningful consideration of the actual risk would lead to an explicit acknowledgement that the danger against which the children must be protected is the repeated infliction on one or both of them by their mother of very serious physical injury.  Only once the possible harm is identified, can thought be given to possible triggers, what appropriate monitoring or supervision might look like, which positive factors could properly be said to lessen the likelihood of repetition, etcetera.  However, the non-identification of the index risk led </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">[SW-AP]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> to spend what seems to have been a significant part of the assessment indulging M in propounding alternative non-culpable mechanisms for the injury.

It is difficult, though, to reconcile this with the prominence given in the assessment to exploring supposed protective factors or other issues which flow from M&#8217;s account rather than from the findings.  For example, the fact that both parents are said to be hypervigilant to prevent any further accident arising from poor supervision of the children seemed to be relied on by </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">[SW-AP]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> as a future protective factor.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">A further deficit in the assessment process flows from the assessors&#8217; treatment of an extremely sensitive issue which arose during the process.  During one of the assessment sessions, M told </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">[SW-AP]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> and SW for the first time that she had been the victim of sexual abuse as a child.  No doubt it was extremely difficult for M to raise and discuss this, as it was for her to hear the issue discussed during the hearing.  The relevance of the issue to the assessment derives from the fact that M described her abuser as having been a male person within her family and that, as she grew older and recognised that her experiences constituted sexual abuse, she informed a cousin, who raised it within the family, but that no protective steps were taken by the family, rather she was told by family members not to tell anyone the information </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;due to the impact that this would have on the family&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.

Perhaps because of the sensitivity of the issue, which M understandably did not want disseminating more widely than absolutely necessary, or perhaps due to oversight, it seems that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">[SW-AP]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> did not appreciate until it was put to her in cross-examination that it is highly relevant to the assessment of risk in this case that there is evidence to suggest that some of the family members whose absolute commitment to putting the children&#8217;s interests first in the event of any future concerns have previously done exactly the opposite when confronted with a choice between child protection and preservation of reputation.  From the scant information available to me, I am not in a position to say more than </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;there is evidence to suggest&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> that this is the case.

By the point of the decision of Lieven J, a significant period of time had passed, without issue.  Lieven J declined to direct a fact-finding hearing, which would have taken some nine days, as, the judge concluded, the factual conclusions of such a hearing would be unlikely to have any impact on placement or welfare decisions.  Recognising that no hearing meant that the s.31 CA 1989 threshold criteria would not be satisfied, Lieven J considered that it was disproportionate to hold an expensive nine-day hearing simply to enable the making of a Supervision Order when the evidence suggested that the family would voluntarily comply with the CIN plan which was the alternative.

I cannot say for sure, but it may well have been by a fairly narrow margin, that HHJ Hillier sanctioned the return of the children at that point in the process. [&#8230;]  On any view, this was a risky rehabilitation, the Local Authority being entirely ignorant, at that point, of the true cause of potentially life-threatening injuries to a child.  It is shocking then that the Local Authority did not deliver on its promised visiting of the children until the Children&#8217;s Guardian flagged up their failure.&#8217;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In my judgment, the process of assessment has been very significantly flawed, for all the reasons set out above.  At times it has felt as though a reverse process has been underway, reasoning backwards from an assumed conclusion.  I have been particularly struck by the absence of anything resembling robust risk analysis.  Parts of the assessment read almost as though there had been no definitive conclusion to the fact-finding process.  The perpetrator of a serious injury seems to have been indulged in putting forward further non-culpable explanations, entirely contrary to my findings, and then time has been spent considering what measures could protect against repetition of those fictional explanations.</span></p>

However, the fact of denial, and in particular the fact of denial not only by the perpetrator but also by all members of a supposed protective network, makes the need for robust, coherent and focussed risk-assessment the greater.  In this case, such risk assessment as has taken place has not fulfilled any of these criteria.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I have anxiously considered whether, notwithstanding the obvious deficits in the assessment process, I could proceed effectively to assess the risk myself and to use my conclusions to put in place whatever order I thought necessary and require the imposition of any protective measures required.  I have come to the reluctant conclusion that I am not in a position to do so &#8211; that is not my function.  In order to decide what risk these children face, and how it can safely be protected against, there needs to be the sort of assessment which I had hoped would emanate from my directions after the fact-finding hearing.  Without such assessment, I am not in a position to decide whether the LA is correct to assert that the children can appropriately be protected without a Part IV order (although I currently struggle to see how this could be so), or, if a public law order is required, whether this case falls into the exceptional category contemplated by Sir Andrew McFarlane P in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">Re JW (A Child)</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> [2023] EWCA Civ 944, [2024] Fam. 25 as justifying the making of a Care Order while children continue to live at home.</span></p>

The ISW proposed has expertise in Resolutions-type assessment.  This will include robust work not only with the parents, but also with the extended family.  There will have to be careful and sensitive consideration given to how to handle the information recently given by M of childhood sexual abuse and its reporting having been closed down by the family, but it is not for me to dictate how that should take place.</span></p>

It will be evident from the foregoing that an understanding of M&#8217;s psychological make-up, her ability to regulate her emotions and likely triggers to dysregulated behaviour are important.  In light of her recent reports of childhood abuse, the need for that assessment and consideration of appropriate therapeutic intervention is heightened.  Given the centrality to my ultimate decision-making of the parental relationship and F&#8217;s ability to protect, in light of not only his denial but also his current marked lack of curiosity, it is necessary that he too forms part of the assessment.</span></p>

That cost is &#163;2,700 plus travel.  While I bear very much in mind the huge financial pressures on local authorities, I consider that it should pay for the assessment.  The need arises solely because of the deficits in its own assessment, and I note both that there has been plenty of encouragement from the Bench in this case to consider with appropriate rigour the clearly relevant issues and that, I am told, the assessments, statements and approach in general adopted by the LA has been the subject of full and high-level approval within the service.  The cost of the psychologist will be split between the parties in the usual way.</span></p>

I very much hope that the case will conclude with the children remaining in their parents&#8217; care.  It stands to reason from all I have said above that risks can far more accurately be assessed and so more safely be protected against if M finds herself able to tell the court what actually happened to Q and why.  Equally, if F &#8211; albeit belatedly &#8211; is able to adopt an appropriately questioning stance, he is likely to be better able to protect his children from future harm.</span></p>
