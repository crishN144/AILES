There are arguments about whether the accrued surplus of income should still be treated as income, with submissions that MJL could not himself have gifted it after losing capacity and FL as his deputy would have needed the permission of this court to do so. However, that is something I am not asked to decide and it is mere background to this application and not material to my decision. What is material is that, in respect of the proposed gifts to the siblings, there will be a reduction in the tax payable on MJL&#8217;s death if HMRC accepts that the payments are being made from surplus income or, even if they do not, there may still be potential advantages if MJL survives at least 3 years from the gift. The Applicant accepts that a reason for making the proposed gifts is that they will reduce the IHT payable on MJL&#8217;s death [paragraph 23, position statement]. </p>

The Applicant submits that such difficulty can easily be avoided by  &#8216;imposing certain limitations on the general authority to make future gifts given to the deputy.  </p>

MJL had said he wished to decline further assets from family trust(s), but this was not in favour of his family, but in favour of charitable causes. It does not appear to be in his best interests to add significantly to the wealth of his siblings. </p>

It would not have prevented him from some tax planning co-incidental to what he perceived as his family and charitable commitments. </p>

It leads me to conclude that he would have put his financial affairs on a better footing, but not that he would have done so to maximise gifting or to embark on substantial tax planning. </p>

Contrary to the Applicant&#8217;s submissions, I do not accept that the Official Solicitor&#8217;s proposals represent only a different quantum where they differ from the Applicant&#8217;s proposal. They represent a point of principle as to whether it is in MJL&#8217;s best interests for that degree of gifting and tax saving to be achieved before death from capital. I am not satisfied that it is in MJL&#8217;s best interests for the reasons given. </p>

It is worth noting that the even-handed way in which they express their suppositions is a credit to MJL&#8217;s siblings. It is also worth noting that FL, as MJL&#8217;s deputy, expresses views which are considered under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> but which, as a matter of common submission, have no greater weight than others by reason of FL&#8217;s deputyship.

I do not agree that gifting in different proportions between the will beneficiaries is in MJL&#8217;s best interests.  The gifting proposed at paragraph 6 of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s position statement is authorised. Gifting as proposed in part 1 of the application is approved. The family gifts fall within the deputy&#8217;s authority. The gifts to political organisations continue what MJL set up when he had capacity and are in his best interests.
