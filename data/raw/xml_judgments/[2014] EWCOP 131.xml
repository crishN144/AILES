	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">CC is a young adult who, it is common ground, lacks capacity. She was adopted as a very young child. For many years her birth mother, RC, had indirect &#8216;letter-box&#8217; contact with her. It stopped a few years ago. Precisely when and why is not altogether clear, though nothing turns on this for present purposes. CC lives in the area of X Local Authority. RC does not know where CC lives or the identity of X Local Authority. RC has issued an application in the Court of Protection seeking contact with CC. To make that application she needed permission: see Court of Protection Rules 2007, rule 50. Permission was given by a District Judge in accordance with rule 55(a).</p>

His order included a provision enabling RC's legal representatives to see the three statements &#8220;on the basis that the material contained therein is not divulged to RC without further leave of the court.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The three exceptions which are acknowledged to the application of the rule prescribing the publicity of Courts of justice are, first, in suits affecting wards; secondly, in lunacy proceedings; and, thirdly, in those cases where secrecy, as, for instance, the secrecy of a process of manufacture or discovery or invention &#8211; trade secrets &#8211; is of the essence of the cause. The first two of these cases, my Lords, depend upon the familiar principle that the jurisdiction over wards and lunatics is exercised by the judges as representing His Majesty as parens patriae. The affairs are truly private affairs; the transactions are transactions truly intra familiam; and it has long been recognized that an appeal for the protection of the Court in the case of such persons does not involve the consequence of placing in the light of publicity their truly domestic affairs.&#8221;</p>

The later decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">In re D (Minors) (Adoption Reports: Confidentiality) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] AC 593</ref> is to the same effect.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Although, as I have acknowledged, the class of cases in which it may be appropriate to restrict a litigant&#8217;s access to documents is somewhat wider than has hitherto been recognised, it remains the fact, in my judgment, that such cases will remain very much the exception and not the rule. It remains the fact that all such cases require the most anxious, rigorous and vigilant scrutiny. It is for those who seek to restrain the disclosure of papers to a litigant to make good their claim and to demonstrate with precision exactly which documents or classes of documents require to be withheld. The burden on them is a heavy one. Only if the case for non-disclosure is convincingly and compellingly demonstrated will an order be made. No such order should be made unless the situation imperatively demands it. No such order should extend any further than is necessary. The test, at the end of the day, is one of strict necessity. In most cases the needs of a fair trial will demand that there be no restrictions on disclosure. Even if a case for restrictions is made out, the restrictions must go no further than is strictly necessary.&#8221;</p>

But the degree to which that is of importance will vary from case to case. No lawyers should consent to such a ring unless they are satisfied they can do so without harming their client&#8217;s case. But provided the legal advisers are satisfied they can safely continue to act under a restriction, the inability to communicate fully with the client will not in such circumstances undermine the fundamental principles on which a fair application for judicial review depends.&#8221;</p>

A parent&#8217;s address and full circumstances may be kept confidential as is a foster placement in most instances. Information revealing addresses is appropriately redacted. Moreover in a family dispute by contrast the information about family life is often the very information that all parties need to see in addressing the issues at stake. It is the domestic circumstances of a party that give rise to an argument for or against residence or contact. Here the issue is different &#8211; is it in CC&#8217;s interest to recommence a family relationship with a Mother from whom the family relationship has been legally severed?

As Baroness Hale of Richmond JSC pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A (A Child) (Family Proceedings: Disclosure of Information) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2012/60" uk:canonical="[2012] UKSC 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] UKSC 60</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 3 WLR 1484" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 3 WLR 1484</ref>, para 21, in the passage I have already quoted, the court must &#8220;prevent the proceedings which are there to protect the child being used as an instrument of doing harm to that child.&#8221; I do not in fact understand Mr Fullwood to be seriously challenging Judge Cardinal&#8217;s decision on this part of the case. Be that as it may, there is in my judgment no proper ground of challenge.</p>

The second does so all the more: it gives a very detailed breakdown of the social worker&#8217;s relationship and work with CC and reveals much of her family circumstances, and the work done with her as an incapacitous client; the third is short but does not take the matter any further save that again it describes work with CC.&#8221;</p>

I do not think the duty to promote equality of arms necessitates her to seeing these documents personally. She has access to the redacted psychological report and that evidence can be challenged as needs be. The social work evidence can be challenged in the manner I set out below. But she is not entitled to examine the private life of this vulnerable young woman; I am satisfied that it would be disturbing for CC for her rights to be invaded &#8211; her family is under strain. I do not consider it right for her to have to be told that private information had been divulged to a party whom in reality she does not know. It is right for the Official Solicitor in my judgment to seek to avoid any distress the knowledge of disclosure might cause CC. </p>

It is right that her counsel <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">only</span> sees the social work evidence but is under direction from me not to disclose it or discuss it with his client &#8211; so at least the social worker&#8217;s evidence can be properly tested. I take the view that Mr Chisholm is right &#8211; by limiting disclosure in this way I am denying only that which it is strictly necessary to deny. I do not consider that the social work evidence could in any feasible way be redacted.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, Mr Fullwood submits that Judge Cardinal misdirected himself, failing in fact to apply the law as he had summarised it. He points to the passages I have set out in paragraph 34 above where Judge Cardinal says &#8220;I do not consider that RC needs to see the social work evidence&#8221; and, again, &#8220;I do not take the view at this stage that it is necessary for the &#8230; social worker&#8217;s evidence &#8230; to be disclosed&#8221;, submitting that this is to put the point the wrong way round. The question, he submits, and I agree, is not, is it necessary for RC to see the documents? The question is whether it is necessary (in CC&#8217;s interests) that RC does <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>see the documents. Now particular phrases in a judgment are not to be torn out of context. The judgment must be read as a whole, giving it a fair and sensible reading, not a pedantic or nit-picking reading. Are these particular passages on which Mr Fullwood fastens, passages which taken on their own are wrong, saved by the rest of the judgment and, in particular, by Judge Cardinal&#8217;s concluding summary quoted in paragraph 25 above? I cannot be confident.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, Mr Fullwood submits that in any event Judge Cardinal has given inadequate and unsustainable reasons to justify his conclusion. There are a number of points here. There is no differentiation between the obvious necessity to prevent the disclosure of anything that might lead to CC being identified or traced by RC and the far less obvious necessity to restrict RC&#8217;s access to other personal information about CC. It is surprising, even allowing for what Judge Cardinal says are the difficulties in redacting the material, that it is necessary that <span style="font-style:italic">nothing </span>in the three witness statements should be disclosed. After all, a large amount of sensitive personal information about CC <span style="font-style:italic">was </span>disclosed to RC in the redacted psychologist&#8217;s report. What is it about <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>the information that makes it necessary not to disclose it? And how does this square with the fact that Judge Cardinal thought that RC&#8217;s counsel <span style="font-style:italic">should </span>be able to see it? It may be that, with fuller explanation, Judge Cardinal&#8217;s decision could be sustained, but as it stands it provides inadequate justification for such a drastic restriction of what RC can see. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Fullwood&#8217;s third complaint is that Judge Cardinal has in effect introduced a closed material procedure, which, he says, was inappropriate in this particular case and is in any event, as a matter of general principle, inappropriate in the Court of Protection. I am not sure that it is helpful to categorise what Judge Cardinal did here as a closed material procedure as that expression is more generally understood. I take him to have been doing no more than has been hallowed by long practice in these cases and now has the weighty imprimatur of Baroness Hale. Whether, on the other hand, it was appropriate in <span style="font-style:italic">this </span>case is another matter. I have already alluded to the deficiencies in Judge Cardinal&#8217;s reasoning. But there is another point. As Moses LJ made clear, this is a process dependent upon counsel&#8217;s agreement &#8211; an agreement which counsel for the reasons given by Moses LJ may feel unable to give and which in any event the instructions from his lay client may prevent him giving. Judge Cardinal does not seem to have explored these aspects of the matter. Nor, for that matter, does he consider other possible solutions: allowing RC to read, but not to borrow or copy, suitably redacted copies of the documents, or directing that there be disclosure to her of a document setting out the gist of what is being said by the social workers.</p>
