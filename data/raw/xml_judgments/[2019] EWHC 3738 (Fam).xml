However, the issue of whether an advocate would be necessary to enable their understanding at Court hearings would depend on whether the Court could accommodate sufficient breaks in proceedings when issues arose that either of the parties failed to understand. This measure would enable their Solicitors to explain such matters. Should this be possible, and as long as the recommended measures for imparting information to, and communicating with both parties, which were detailed within Dr Gillett's report, were employed, the respective Solicitors should be able to manage such issues. However, should this not be possible, I am of the opinion that both parties would require the support of an advocate. </p>
