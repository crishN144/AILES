Mr Morris promised to repay. In March he was asked round for a drink to discuss repayment. He came with the wife, who, according to Mr Innes Gibson, were &#8220;very much an item&#8221; and according to Mrs Innes Gibson &#8220;very much a couple&#8221;.</span></p>

They were very open about their relationship and their plans for their future life together. Nick Morris said that he had put Mrs Rose in touch with his lawyers and that Mrs Rose could expect to receive millions of pounds by way of a divorce settlement by next summer at the latest. They said that they intended to use some of the money to buy a house together in Tuscany with a vineyard, so that they could spend part of the year in Italy growing vines and making wine. Nick Morris said that once the divorce settlement came through he intended to go back to university and do a PhD. Mrs Rose said that the house behind Marks and Spencer that she was living in was cheap compared to what she was used to and that the accommodation was not great. They said that they had to smuggle Mr Morris into the property at night so that no one knew they were living together. If this was known, she would not get as much by way of a settlement from Mr Rose.</span></p>

In other words one of the reasons why it was said that the husband &#8220;withdrew&#8221; on 16 August 2001 from the agreement he had made on 3 August 2001 was his &#8220;discovery&#8221; that by reason of the wife&#8217;s behaviour with Mr Morris after 3 August 2001 the information to the court on 3 August 2001 that her relationship with Mr Morris had &#8220;cooled&#8221; was untrue and that he and the court had been misled.</span></p>

The wife did not disclose her true intentions to the court in January 2001. In the middle of December 2000 Mr and Mrs Innes Gibson said that the wife and Mr Morris were talking about their future life together and how they would have a house in Tuscany. By early August 2001 the statement that their relationship had &#8220;cooled&#8221; could not have been true as the wife then went on holiday with Mr Morris and spent her birthday with him. If what Mr and Mrs Innes Gibson have said had been known on 3 August 2001 the husband would have been in a position to strengthen his argument that the fund for the wife&#8217;s housing should be put into trust and thus that the court might well have expressed a different view. Further, had the matter proceeded to a full hearing fixed for November 2001 then the matter could have been explored in depth, the husband would have been in a much stronger position on the &#8220;trust&#8221; issue, and thus a different order to that made on 3 August 2001 might have been made.</span></p>

It is not every failure of frank and full disclosure which would justify a court in setting aside a order of the kind concerned in this appeal. On the contrary, it will only be in cases when the absence of full and frank disclosure has led to the court making, either in contested proceedings or by consent, an order which is substantially different from the order which it would have made if such disclosure had taken place that a case for setting aside can possibly be made good. Parties who apply to set aside orders on the ground of failure to disclose some relatively minor matter or matters, the disclosure of which would not have made any substantial difference to the order which the court would have made or approved, are likely to find their applications being summarily dismissed, with costs against them, or, if they are legally aided, against the legal aid fund.&#8221;</span></p>

The reason why the question is difficult is that it involves the conflict between two important legal principles and a decision as to which is to prevail over the other. The first principle is that it is in the public interest that there should be finality in litigation The second principle is that justice requires cases to be decided, so far as practicable, on the true facts relating to them, and not on assumptions or estimates with regard to those facts which are conclusively shown by later events to have been erroneous.&#8221;</span></p>

The court may properly exercise its discretion to grant leave to appeal out of time for an order for financial provision or property transfer made after a divorce on the ground of new events, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that new events have occurred since the making of the order which invalidate the basis, or fundamental assumption upon which the order was made, so that, if leave to appeal out of time were to be given, the appeal would be certain, or very likely, to succeed.&#8221;</span></p>

For a policy of closure to be compatible with justice, it must be attended with safeguards: so the law allows appeals: so the law, exceptionally, allows appeals out of time: so the law still more exceptionally allows judgments to be attacked on the ground of fraud....

For the small percentage that remain ,the judge&#8217;s conclusion after the contested trial should be final. Of course there is a right of appeal, which in some cases may not be exercised without prior permission. An appeal, albeit perhaps necessary to correct error or to address an unfair result, is nevertheless a misfortune for the family in that it increases costs and extends the duration of conflict. Thus there is added requirement for finality at the conclusion of the appellate proceedings. The residual right to reopen litigation is clearly established by the decisions in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Livesey v Jenkins </span><span style="font-size:10pt">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Barder v Caluori</span><span style="font-size:10pt">.

It seems to me to be quite unrealistic to say that a family court, when acting under Order 18 rule 19 (1) (a)-(d) and/or under the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction, cannot apply the authorities to which Miss Baron referred in order to achieve a just result. If, strictly speaking, Order 18 rule 19 (1) sits uneasily with the authorities I have referred to, then I see no reason why the authorities cannot, and every reason why they should, be applied when the court is exercising its inherent jurisdiction. In my judgment it is absolutely essential in ancillary relief cases that the court should be able to put a stop to applications seeking to reopen matters already decided by a court, whether by consent or after a contested hearing, if the court is satisfied that no useful purpose will be served by reopening the matter. I therefore propose to apply them.</span></p>

On 3 August 2001 the wife, through her counsel, told the court that the relationship was continuing, but that it was of a lesser intensity than formerly. The husband was deeply suspicious of the wife&#8217;s assertion that the relationship had &#8220;cooled&#8221;. Nevertheless that feeling of mistrust found no expression at all at the FDR hearing on 3 August 2001. Indeed in the light of his deep mistrust the husband nevertheless went ahead and settled the case and consented to the order which involved him in paying an outright lump sum, ie none of which was in trust. The husband was at liberty to have refused to settle, to go forward to the final hearing in November 2001 and there to cross-examine the wife on her relationship with Mr Morris. He chose not to do so.</span></p>

I agree. He did not. It is further submitted that I must take the conversations that Mr and Mrs Innes Gibson had with the wife and Mr Morris at face value. In fairness to the wife it should be said that she accepted that she and Mr Morris met Mr and Mrs Innes Gibson as they describe, but the thrust of their evidence is denied. For the purposes of this hearing I agree that I must take the evidence of Mr and Mrs Innes Gibson at face value. Nevertheless, the expressions of intent by Mr Morris and the wife were just that, expressions of intent, and were made at the very least some eight or nine months before 3 August 2001. Further, it is said that the wife&#8217;s association with Mr Morris after 3 August 2001 is prima facie evidence that the relationship had not &#8220;cooled&#8221;, and that the wife was lying when she said on 3 August 2001 that it had. It must be remembered it was the wife who told the court on that day that her relationship with Mr Morris was continuing, albeit at a lesser intensity. Her going on holiday in August was confirmation, if such were needed, that their relationship was indeed continuing but it could hardly be said to be evidence that she was lying when she said it had &#8220;cooled&#8221;. Indeed by March 2002 the evidence is that the wife&#8217;s relationship with Mr Morris was over, the husband has no evidence to controvert that. In my judgment there is no evidence that is likely to persuade a court that the wife is guilty of non-disclosure as at 3 August 2001. Furthermore, I think it most unlikely that the court would have made an order different to that made on 3 August 2001 even if it had had in front of it the evidence of Mr and Mrs Innes Gibson.</span></p>

But that is a hazard which is present, to a greater or lesser extent, when a spouse receives a substantial settlement of cash and/or property after divorce. It hardly lies in the husband&#8217;s mouth to assert that the wife&#8217;s housing fund now should be put into trust, given that at a time when the wife was in a relationship with a conman, ie August 2001, he nevertheless agreed to pay her an outright lump sum free of any trust restrictions. Further, the Court of Appeal were not impressed with the husband&#8217;s seeking to resile from his agreement on the 3 August 2001 on any basis referable to Mr Morris. In my judgment the court would be utterly unlikely to make the order the husband seeks. In my judgment such an outcome is a non-starter.</span></p>

Yet he did not then seek to set aside the order on the ground of the wife&#8217;s non-disclosure. It is true that on 2 October 2001 the husband had to undergo emergency, major heart surgery. He left hospital two weeks later. Some period of time can thus justifiably be accounted for on that score.

That, after all, must be the husband&#8217;s position on his own evidence.
