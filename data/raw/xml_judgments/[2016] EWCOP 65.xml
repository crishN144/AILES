I do not propose to repeat what was said in that judgment but will refer to it from time to time in this judgment.  I will use the same anonymisation apart from the person who this case is about who I shall call PP. The hearing on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2016 was in public.

Instead I ordered that the sum of &#163;164,000 be repaid to PP.  I further ordered that the amount of &#163;160,000, which had been used by BB and JB to purchase a property in November 2014, should be brought into account by the making of a hotchpot clause in a codicil to PP&#8217;s will, so that JB would not obtain a greater share of her estate than PP had intended.</p>

Of this sum, &#163;370,000 represents the estimated value of the property purchased in her name in November 2013 which is now rented to students (&#8220;the Rental Property&#8221;).  Her investments made through St James Place are valued at &#163;568,656, of which &#163;350,000 (or a greater sum because of capital growth since February 2015) is invested in schemes to provide relief from inheritance tax (&#8220;IHT&#8221;).  Her annual income has reduced slightly to &#163;37,176 and her expenditure has increased to &#163;38,250.  To date PP has paid very little tax on her rental income.  When the start up expenses are no longer offset against income, her tax bill may be higher.</p>

She said that she is fully aware of her responsibilities under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> and fully appraised of the Code of Practice to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.</p>

She said that as a result she arranged to receive the bank statements for PP&#8217;s accounts thereafter (apart from a short period in 2016).  She was aware that the PET was a contravention of the authority given to BB by the Lasting Power of Attorney for Property and Affairs (&#8220;LPA PA&#8221;).  She did not advise BB that he had contravened his powers because he had already made the PET and other gifts and the matter was being investigated by the Public Guardian.  She told him that the money might have to be repaid and therefore should be ringfenced (D617).  She did not tell him to repay it immediately.</p>

She was told by BB that PP&#8217;s own IFA had given her advice in a letter about tax planning.  She formed the view that it was a reasonable decision and in PP&#8217;s best interests to make a gift to avoid the incidence of IHT.  In arriving at that conclusion she did not consider the possibility that PP&#8217;s care costs might increase substantially over her expected life span.  CD confirmed that she had a copy of PP&#8217;s will but did not consider that the PET might interfere with the devolution of her estate.</p>

BB did not seek authorisation of the court for this nor did he consult CD. Her monitoring of the bank statements would not have revealed it because the sum of &#163;324,000 was held by BB and JB in their own accounts.  CD could not recall when she became aware of this, whether before or after completion of the purchase.  She did not put any other safeguards in place when she found out.</p>

No order for costs has been made in the application under Rule 156 of the Court of Protection Rules 2007 which would give authority for such a payment.  CD said that she knew nothing about this, but only that her own professional costs of acting as attorney were paid out of PP&#8217;s funds.  She did not query the amounts which totalled &#163;19,597.  I was later informed by counsel for BB and CD that the transfers to meet BB&#8217;s costs were the responsibility of the partner acting for BB in this application.</p>

She did not explore whether PP had capacity to make the decision herself at that time or subsequently.  She did not try and establish PP&#8217;s wishes and feelings, beliefs and values in January 2013 or subsequently.  She visited PP on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2015 at the request of the care home to consider whether PP should be given Do not Resuscitate status.  She formed her view that PP should not be given such status on the basis of her general health and well being, her ability to react well with staff and CD and her feeling that she would want her own mother to be resuscitated if she were in PP&#8217;s situation.

She went to see PP and spent about an hour discussing the move with her.  She found PP very repetitive.

However he said that, in conversation with the general practitioner for the signing of the Part B certificate for the LPA HW, PP told the GP that she wanted to stay alive for the sake of her dogs, which was the reason for giving authority to her attorneys to make decisions about life sustaining treatment.  PP had chosen to have a professional as her attorney for personal welfare decisions because she had a very good relationship with LR who acted as her solicitor.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">It was common ground that statute and case law set a high bar for a decision to revoke a Lasting Power of Attorney.  The court must approach the position of each attorney independently and make a decision on the basis of the evidence relating to that attorney alone.  The court has a discretion; if the ground or grounds are made out under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/22/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22(3)</ref>(b) the court <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">may</span>, not must, revoke the Lasting Power of Attorney. </p>

He gifted a substantial sum, which represented over 20% of PP&#8217;s estate, to his own wife and therefore stood to benefit personally.  He did not take PP&#8217;s wishes and feelings into account.  He did not seek any legal advice although his co attorney was a solicitor.  His subsequent actions do not support his assertion that he has rectified his lack of awareness of the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> and Code of Practice and learned from his mistakes.</p>

It is accepted that St James is a reputable firm and that the advice of an IFA was sought.  It is the purpose of the investment that is of concern.  The benefits will accrue to BB and his family, not to PP.  BB is in a position of conflict in reviewing the continuation of these investments.  A fresh look is needed as to whether those investments are in PP&#8217;s best interests.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">In relation to CD, counsel for the Public Guardian accepted that she had no knowledge of the PET.  The payment of BB&#8217;s costs out of PP&#8217;s funds contravened CD&#8217;s authority.  As to whether CD had acted in PP&#8217;s best interests, counsel argued that she had failed to exercise proper oversight over the actions of BB.  She showed a worrying lack of familiarity with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  She formed the view that the PET was in the best interests of PP without taking into account her likely future care needs, nor, despite her oral evidence, was it clear that she recognised the impact on the devolution of PP&#8217;s estate.  BB was able to use half of the PET to purchase a property in the name of himself and his wife without CD&#8217;s knowledge, so her safeguarding procedures were inadequate.  She was unclear as to when she first learned of this which demonstrates a laissez faire attitude.</p>

In my judgment I ratified half of the PET.  By going through the process of the court case BB has learned of his obligations.  He should not be held to too high a standard of perfection; many attorneys show the same failings.  It is not wrong for attorneys to consider  IHT planning.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">As to the costs of a professional deputyship, management of the Rental Property is not straight forward.  BB has done a lot of work on the house and garden and is very involved in day to day decisions.  A professional deputy would employ a letting agent and gardener at considerably greater expense on top of his own fees which would impact on PP&#8217;s net income.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.25in">There has been no allegation that the investments in the Octopus IHT schemes constitute a breach of duty.  The attorneys took advice from a reputable IFA at a reputable firm; there is nothing wrong with that even if another attorney would have made a different decision.  While there were high start up costs the investments have now increased in value.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.25in">As to PP&#8217;s wishes and feelings, counsel accepted that some weight could be attached to the views PP expressed to the Court Special Visitor in February 2014.  Her only objection to BB being attorney is her fear that he would be influenced by JB, who would take her money.  Going forward either JB will not be able to influence BB or the court will prevent it.  PP chose to appoint a solicitor to act with BB so that this would not arise. Given the deterioration in PP&#8217;s mental state, I cannot attach any weight to what she said to the social worker in February 2016.</p>

She sought advice from LR.    It was then perfectly reasonable to await the outcome of the Public Guardian&#8217;s investigation and their recommendation rather than embarking on a costly application to the Court of Protection. In the event, the Public Guardian required an application for ratification of gifts, not immediate repayment to PP or seizing of the amount of the gifting by CD.  </p>

CD has visited and now got to know PP over a period when PP&#8217;s awareness was higher.  A new deputy will not be able to replicate the insight she has gained into PP.  She also knows the family.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">As to the future management of PP&#8217;s property and affairs, counsel urged me either to leave the LPAs in place or appoint CD and BB as deputies.  CD does not want to act alone without BB&#8217;s involvement.  She could be sole attorney or deputy and allow BB to manage the Rental Property.  If the court has concerns, it could give directions for the obtaining of advice from another IFA.  It is in PP&#8217;s best interests that BB as the family member chosen by PP should be kept in place.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Counsel then turned to the LPA HW. PP chose BB and CD to be her attorneys and there is no reason to go behind that decision. There was no evidence that either attorney had contravened their authority.  Their decisions (on purchase of property, moving PP to the care home and on contact) could not be criticised.  CD might not have arrived at her decisions in the best way but they were the right decisions.  If I revoke the LPA HW it will cause difficulty for the care home particularly on obtaining consent to medical and dental treatment.  BB knows PP&#8217;s views on resuscitation.  </p>

It depends on the circumstances of each case.  In this case it is clear from the letter from St James that the sole motivation for the investment was to save IHT (E55-61).

I obtained the clear impression when preparing my previous judgment that PP wanted to ensure that she had sufficient funds so that she would be well cared for in her old age (see paragraph 62 of my previous judgment).  Further I am aware that she had a long and trusting relationship with PS, her previous IFA, and conclude that she is happy to rely on professional advice and have professional involvement in the management of her finances.  Indeed she told the Court Special Visitor that her accountants were managing her financial affairs (D173).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">First I must consider the degree of PP&#8217;s incapacity over the relevant period.  PP has since July 2013 been expressing worry and anger that JB has, by BB&#8217;s actions, taken her money and she has said numerous times that she does not want BB to manage her affairs because of this.  PP had capacity to make the LPAs in October 2012.  BB considered that she had capacity to manage her property and affairs until about February 2013 (paragraph 103 of my previous judgment).   IN July 2013, her IFA was still dealing directly with her (albeit that BB criticises him for doing so).  PP was able clearly to express her views in July 2013 and may be thought to be relatively close to the borderline at that time.  Since then her capacity has declined over time but it is acknowledged by BB&#8217;s counsel that she was able to express wishes and feelings of which I should take account to the Court Special Visitor in February 2014.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Second I must consider the strength and consistency of the views being expressed by PP.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">As to the impact of the knowledge that her views are not being heeded, PP&#8217;s memory is worsening and she may not recall her concerns unless reminded of them. However when asked (as for example by her social worker in February 2016) her worries about her financial security surfaced again and she repeated that she did not want her family to manage her money.  It seems to me that it remains a source of worry and concern to her.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Fourthly I must consider the extent to which PP&#8217;s wishes and feelings are, or are not, rational, sensible, responsible and pragmatically capable of sensible implementation in the particular circumstances.  Given that she did not want JB to have access to her money, that she appointed BB together with a professional as attorneys in order to avoid JB gaining access to her money, and that her fears were realised by the actions of BB in gifting a significant proportion of her estate to JB, her wishes and feelings appear rational sensible and prescient.  Her wish to have professional management of her estate rather than management by her family is certainly capable of sensible implementation.</p>

He appeared to have no compunction in doing so despite the fact that CD had advised him to retain the money and that the matter was subject to the jurisdiction of the court with the trial date fast approaching.  By using the sum of &#163;160,000 for the purchase he potentially put it beyond recovery without expensive legal proceedings to force sale of the W House, if he was unable to raise that sum by way of mortgage.  I consider that BB has failed to act in PP&#8217;s best interests in making the PET. There is no evidence that this accorded with PP&#8217;s past or present wishes or feelings, beliefs or values.  It undermined her wishes as to the devolution of her estate under her will.  </p>

I consider that BB has a conflict of interest in carrying out a review of the IHT saving Octopus investments and deciding whether they are in PP&#8217;s best interests and in making future decisions about investments solely in PP&#8217;s best interests without regard to whether JB, he and their family will benefit.  </p>

I am not satisfied that supervision by CD or directions given by the court would be sufficient to ensure that BB acts at all times solely in PP&#8217;s best interests.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">However I consider that CD has not acted in PP&#8217;s best interests.

She has been uncritical of BB&#8217;s management of PP&#8217;s affairs.  She instituted safeguarding measures but they failed to reveal either that BB had used &#163;160,000 of PP&#8217;s money in the purchase of the W House (when the PET had not been ratified) or that almost &#163;20,000 of PP&#8217;s money had been used to pay BB&#8217;s costs in the application for ratification.  In my judgment she has failed in her role as professional attorney to provide sufficient oversight of BB and ensure that he was acting in the best interests of PP.  I am not confident that she would provide adequate oversight of BB in the future.  She does not want to have sole responsibility for PP&#8217;s financial affairs.  I have therefore decided that CD&#8217;s appointment under the LPA PA should be revoked.</p>

I therefore direct that a deputy from the Public Guardian&#8217;s panel of deputies should be appointed to act as deputy for property and affairs for PP and that he or she should undertake a review of PP&#8217;s investments.   The choice of deputy should take into account that the deputy will have to be able to manage the Rental Property, which is a task undertaken by many professional deputies.  PP may prefer a female deputy, although she had no difficulty in her relationship with PS, previously her IFA.</p>

Capacity is time and issue specific.  Capacity to make decisions about accommodation or care are completely separate issues from capacity to manage property and affairs.  Neither attorney appears to have sought advice as to whether PP had relevant capacity at any stage.  Nor was I convinced that CD had taken the necessary steps on each occasion to elicit and weigh in the balance PP&#8217;s wishes and feelings in relation to health and welfare decisions but had simply formed her own view, albeit in consultation with BB.  However I accept that BB, having very regular contact with PP, was aware of her wishes and feelings.  He had gone through a lengthy process of trying to find a home for PP and she had been unable to make a decision about any of the options he proposed.  He consulted CD and JB although there was no consultation of any other family members or friends.  I recognise that BB and CD are PP&#8217;s choice as her attorneys for personal welfare decisions.  I do not consider that the decisions they have taken on her behalf have been in contravention of their authority under the LPA PW or have not been in her best interests.  In those circumstances I have decided not to revoke the LPA HW.</p>

He contends that BB has been partially successful in his application in that I did not order that the full amount be repaid.  If BB delayed in disclosure so that the first trial date was lost, nonetheless the time estimate was insufficient and the Official Solicitor sought extra disclosure so that the first trial date would have been lost in any event.  I should make an order for BB&#8217;s costs and the OS&#8217;s costs to be paid out of PP&#8217;s estate or failing that for the OS&#8217;s costs to be paid by PP and BB to pay his own costs.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The OS seeks an order for BB to pay PP&#8217;s costs and to be responsible for his own costs.  In reply to BB&#8217;s arguments, counsel contended that when an attorney makes an application for gifts it is inappropriate for the incapacitated person to have to pay the costs of that application.  BB cannot argue that he has succeeded in the application.  He has had to repay part of the money and the balance has been brought into hotchpot.  He has acted outside his authority.   Without the investigation by the Public Guardian there would have been no repayment or hotchpot clause.  This merits departure from Rule 156.  The hearing in December 2014 had to be vacated not only because BB failed to disclose documents until 7 days before the hearing, giving the Official Solicitor insufficient time to consider them, but also because he had failed to serve the application on the identified Respondents as required by PD 9F9 of the Court of Protection Rules 2007.  The disclosure opened up new lines of enquiry for the Official Solicitor for which follow up disclosure was required.  Obtaining the files of PP&#8217;s IFA was highly probative of PP&#8217;s views.   He contends that I should make an order for BB to bear the costs of the ratification application himself.</p>

His conduct prior to the application was in contravention of his authority and not in the best interests of PP as I have determined.  He acted for the benefit of JB, himself and his own family rather than for the benefit of PP in relation to the PET.  His conduct during the proceedings extended to the use of PP&#8217;s money to purchase the W House without seeking permission of the court.  In making the PET which altered the devolution of PP&#8217;s estate he did not take into account her testamentary wishes, which included the wish to bequeath 50% of her estate to be shared between all her grandchildren (including CH&#8217;s children).  None of this would have come to light had it not been for the Public Guardian&#8217;s investigation.    </p>

It was only because of the benefit to PP of having BB and his family living very close by that I did not order the repayment of the balance of the PET either in full or in substantial part.

Those costs were increased by the manner in which BB conducted the litigation.  I therefore consider that there are grounds to depart from the general rule as to costs.  In my judgment, the justice of this case requires that PP should not have to bear the costs of BB and the Official Solicitor incurred in relation to an application which did not accord with her wishes and feelings, was not in her best interests and which was necessitated because BB had acted in contravention of his authority under the LPA PA.</p>

As to the costs of the Official Solicitor as litigation friend for PP, the first &#163;4,000 plus VAT should be paid out of the estate of PP.  This is in recognition that a prospective application for approval of gifts may have been appropriate.  I have arrived at the figure of &#163;4,000 by taking a broad brush approach and weighing in the balance all I have said about BB&#8217;s conduct in my judgment.  The balance of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s costs shall be paid by BB.</p>

Having regard to all the arguments as to the conduct of BB and CD set out above which have resulted in an order for revocation of the LPA PA, I am minded to make an order that BB and CD be responsible for their own legal costs.  In my judgment the justice of the case requires that PP should not have to pay for her own costs incurred by the Official Solicitor as her litigation friend in the revocation application.  This is not a neutral application to the court for a decision to be made which PP lacks capacity to make in which all parties are acting in the best interests of the incapacitated party.  The application has been necessitated by the conduct of BB and CD as attorneys; there are ample grounds for departing from the general rule having regard to Rule 159 and the decision in Re Cathcart.
