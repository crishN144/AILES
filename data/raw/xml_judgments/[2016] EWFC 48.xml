		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">The threshold for intervention to protect K and J has been comprehensively crossed, regardless of any findings about the death of A.  There is no doubt that Ms H and Mr C cared about the children, and that with the help of other family members they tried to give them a normal, orderly home life.  Each of the children shows signs of having received some reasonable parenting.  However, due to adults&#8217; own personal weaknesses they were completely unable to put the children&#8217;s needs first on a consistent basis.  Relationship instability, binge drinking, drug abuse and violence were a regular feature of their lives.  In particular, when he had been drinking, Mr C assaulted Ms H on a number of occasions, causing what were fortunately relatively minor injuries.  I find that the local authority has proved its case in respect of all the general allegations that it makes.  In particular, I accept the allegations in respect of Mr C&#8217;s repeated violence towards Ms H.</span></p>

The main responsibility for the children fell upon Ms H.  When he was in a fit state, Mr C was able to support her, taking on all of the childcare tasks to some extent.  But all too often, his behaviour added to Ms H&#8217;s own difficulties, leading to repeated breakdowns in the children&#8217;s family life.</span></p>

The mother is now in a very fragile state.  I believe that she was trying to help the court but that the passage of time and the enormity of what has happened has taken its toll.  As for Mr C, he was, I am afraid, a pitifully poor witness.  He appeared to be overwhelmed by his situation.  The continuously tearful way in which he gave evidence raise the question of whether he was doing his best to help the court or not.  He frequently resorted to saying that he could not remember events, particularly when they related to assaults on Ms H.</span></p>

Social services gave them the opportunity to strengthen their family life, but neither parent welcomed this, and nor were they truly motivated to change.  They did what they needed to do to keep social services onside, hoping to be left alone as soon as possible.  In the early months of 2014, they did not give the social worker or other members of the family a true account of how much they were seeing of each other and what their intentions were.  As for Mr C, he reduced his drinking for a time, but did not level with his substance misuse worker about his street drug intake.</span></p>

However, as Mr Feehan and Ms Korol note, the situation is complicated by these features: (a) the bruises are all capable of being accidental or self-inflicted given A&#8217;s age and developmental stage; (b) many of them are relatively insignificant and may not have been visible to a reasonable carer; (c) some possible explanations are given for the larger and visible bruises; and (d) what was seen after death was more than would have been visible in life, because of the effect of post-mortem pallor.  Furthermore, although the bruises are recent, it is not possible to discriminate on the basis of their appearance between the periods before and after the children came into the care of Mr C.</span></p>

I find that it is possible that this bruising was caused by Mr C after A came into his care, for example by rough handling during nappy changing, or in some other way.  However, I cannot be satisfied that this is probable.  It is at least as likely that the bruises occurred at an earlier time, but were not detected.  Nor has it been established that they were inflicted as opposed to being accidentally caused by one of the other children.  Moreover, A is accepted by the local authority to have been a lively, boisterous child.  It is conceivable that at least some of these marks were accidentally caused by A himself in the course of crawling and starting to walk.  </span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.11in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">In relation to the bruising to the head and face, I accept the unanimous professional opinion that their number and distribution is concerning, though far from diagnostic of inflicted injury.  The medical evidence certainly allows for the possibility that these are injuries inflicted by adults and that they could have been inflicted by Mr C after A came into his care.  However, this has not in my view been proved.  Although no marks were seen on A by others before he went to Mr C (and in particular none were noted by Ms H&#8217;s aunt or sister C that afternoon), I cannot discount the description given by Ms H and Mr C that A had two or perhaps three bruises on his forehead before that time.  He was a child who was seen to head-bang by a number of family members, although this cannot have caused anything like all of the bruises seen after death.  I am nonetheless struck by the fact that Dr O noticed far fewer bruises on first examination and that they seemed to her to be possibly accidental.  The greater number of bruises identified on post-mortem cannot be confidently assigned to the period when A was in Mr C&#8217;s sole care, and no allegation has been made, still less proved, against Ms H.  The distribution of the bruising has rightly attracted attention, but none of the marks is convincingly associated with inflicted injury, nor are any of them suggestive of the delivery of heavy blows.  On a narrow balance, I therefore cannot find this allegation proved against Mr C.  Even if I am wrong about that, it is not suggested by the local authority that these marks can be found to have been caused in the course of deliberate smothering, although of course any proven assault would alter the calculus when considering how A died.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.11in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">That point is all the more applicable to the allegations in relation to marking on the penis, because if this was bruising, it could only be the result of abuse.  As was said by a number of witnesses, an adverse finding on this point would alter the complexion of the case.  The issue of what these post-mortem findings represent occupied more time at this hearing than any other.  In particular, an enormous amount of attention has been paid to the interpretation of the photographs named above and the biopsy from site 23.  This site and its neighbours was considered by everyone to be bruising on the basis of naked eye examination, with some further support coming from the appearance of some blood on incision.  However, the results of the histopathology were surprising and led all the experts apart from Dr Armour to revise their opinion.  In the end, no party to the proceedings argues that the appearances at this site or site 24 have been proved to be bruising, as opposed to vascular congestion arising from an unidentified inflammatory process, with or without the additional effects of any hypostasis.  I accept that is a proper conclusion.  I understand Dr Armour&#8217;s reasoning, but I markedly prefer the views of the other experts on the point.  I accept that a tiny amount of extravasated blood can be seen microscopically, but find that it is highly unlikely that this could explain the naked eye appearances mimicking a bruise.  </span></p>

In my view, there is no longer any good foundation for a submission that sites 25 and 26 represent bruising.  Site 23 was generally considered to be a bruise until it was examined microscopically and it would be illogical to consider that sites 25 and 26 are bruising when site 23 (which was biopsied because it appeared to be the most obvious bruise) has not been shown to be a bruise.  I also consider that particular caution is needed when assessing marks to the penis: despite the exceptional amount of professional experience within the body of experts, none of them had previously engaged in a similar exercise of interpretation of penile findings.  Finally on this topic, no DNA from Mr C was recovered from the swab taken from A's penis.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.11in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">In reaching my conclusions about the allegations of non-fatal and fatal injury, I do not overlook the evidence from the neighbours.  This is one of the perplexing features of the case.  Taken at face value, Mr H and Ms P separately describe hearing sounds coming from the flat above that would be consistent with Mr C having lost his temper during the night and early morning and with a child crying.  However, there are a number of features that have to be taken into account.  The first is that both Mr H and Ms P (as they now accept) lied on oath about their dysfunctional relationship at their own family court hearing last year.  As part of that lie, they told Newton J in July 2015 in these proceedings that they had not discussed their evidence: in fact, they had spoken about this case for about an hour in June 2015 when the news of Mr C being charged with murder became public.  These lies were, I accept, motivated by considerations relating to their own family; accordingly I do not find that their untruthfulness destroys their credibility in relation to the issues before me.  Of more relevance is the fact that what happened to A is an emotionally charged subject for them, bearing in mind the removal of their own child.  There are also other matters to consider.  The first is that it was not until a week after the event that they gave their first accounts, even though the police had, as Mr H put it, been going up and down stairs all week &#8211; something he said he regarded as none of his business.  Next, the layout of the building in relation to the outside world gives rise to the possibility that any sounds heard by Mr H in the middle of the night were coming from elsewhere than the upper flat, and that his certainty on that question is misplaced.  This is particularly worth considering as Mr H&#8217;s description is of hearing raised voices that he interpreted as being a domestic argument between a couple, while the evidence establishes that Mr C was the only adult in the flat and that he did not make any phone calls at the relevant times.  Also, the occupant of the other upstairs flat (who did not attend to give evidence) has a lengthy criminal record for drug dealing: he or others may have been on the move that night.  As to Ms P&#8217;s account, there is in my view nothing to overcome the likelihood that what she was hearing at dawn was the aftermath of Mr C discovering A to be moribund.  That is something which undoubtedly will have caused a deal of noise, followed by the arrival of the emergency services, something that surprisingly neither Ms P nor Mr H say they heard.  The words Ms P describes hearing &#8211; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">&#8220;I fucking hate you. Get out now.&#8221; &#8211; </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">are not easy to reconcile with an assault by an adult on a toddler.  It is also hard to escape the feeling that the account given of Ms P saying </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">&#8220;It sounds like a baby&#8217;s being battered upstairs&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">owes something hindsight.  Taking all these matters together, I cannot find Mr H and Ms P to be witnesses upon whom I can rely when trying to reconstruct what took place in the upstairs flat.</span></p>

It is said (1) that she should have drawn attention in her post-mortem report to the lack of support for penile bruising in the original histopathology conducted by Dr Bitetti; (2) that she was unwilling to properly consider possible accidental explanations for the facial bruising; (3) that she was unduly dogmatic about the presence of penile bruising in the face of the strong contrary opinions of her colleagues; and (4) that she amalgamated five soft or neutral signs (pressure marks, abrasions, intra-alveolar haemorrhage, pattern marks, perioral pallor) into an inappropriate expression of certainty about smothering as the cause of death.  </span></p>

This was on any view an unusually complex case for a pathologist and the constellation of findings at post-mortem was very concerning.  In relation to the bruising, Dr Armour&#8217;s views commanded widespread support.  In relation to the issue of penile bruising and cause of death, it cannot be said with any certainty that her conclusions are wrong.  However, I do consider that there is some substance in the specific criticisms of her reasoning in two respects.  The first is that I would have expected an expert of Dr Armour&#8217;s calibre to have referred to Dr Bitetti&#8217;s investigation in her original report and to have given greater weight to the views of distinguished colleagues about the difficulties in diagnosing penile bruising, particularly when the relative absence of convincing histopathology was so exhaustively investigated.  The second is that the five weak signs listed in the footnote could not in my view sustain the weight of certainty of Dr Armour&#8217;s conclusion about the cause of death: in this respect, the cross examination by Mr Rowley QC was telling.  I therefore felt unable to accept her opinion on those issues in preference to those of her colleagues.  In this case, her adherence to her views was, I regret, unduly tenacious.  It should nevertheless be recorded that her conduct of the post-mortem was not subject to any criticism and that her mastery of the detail of the pathology was typically formidable.  </span></p>

The proper administration of justice depends upon experts being frank and, where necessary, fearless.  Where there is a difference of professional opinion, the court must choose, and the fact that an opinion is not accepted in a particular case, even when accompanied by strictures of the kind expressed above, need have no consequences for that expert&#8217;s professional standing.  My observations should be seen in this light.</span></p>
