	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Firstly, once again, this case highlights the difficulties that may be encountered when embarking on surrogacy arrangements abroad. This surrogacy arrangement took place in Nepal. At the time of the arrangement it was not unlawful; that subsequently changed. In addition, two months prior to X's birth Nepal suffered an earthquake, which caused enormous loss and damage in that country. This inevitably caused further complications in securing X's return to this jurisdiction. The result was CH and X were in Nepal for over 3 &#189; months while the British and Nepalese exit arrangements were completed. NM had to come back to the UK two weeks after X&#8217;s birth in order to return to work and Y, the applicant&#8217;s older child, returned back here soon afterwards, in order to start school. The family were separated for over 2 months. Whilst these delays were within the time estimates identified by the Home Office and Passport Office for citizen registration and passport issue for overseas surrogate born children; the reality of the separation of this family was considerable, in particular for CH having to manage the care of a new born child in such difficult circumstances.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>Anyone who embarks on a surrogacy arrangement abroad should seek specialist advice in both jurisdictions, as to the legal implications of any such arrangement. In this case the applicants are articulate professionals, who had previously had a child through a surrogacy arrangement abroad. Despite their preparation and experience they endured significant delays and separation in their family whilst the immigration procedures were undertaken. The prompt issue of their application for a parental order (within 8 weeks of X&#8217;s birth) before he had come to this country was vital. It enabled the Court to be appraised of the situation at an early stage, to fix an early hearing date and assist in any way that it could, as well as direct that X became a party to the application and be represented by a Children&#8217;s Guardian. All of those steps in this case undoubtedly helped.</p>

The applicants have been assiduous in their efforts to ensure that all the necessary procedures both in Nepal and here have been complied with. The evidence demonstrates the applicants entered into this arrangement in good faith, they had previous experience with SCI and as they set out in their statement they visited and satisfied themselves regarding the hospital and residential facilities provided to SM and her family during her pregnancy.
