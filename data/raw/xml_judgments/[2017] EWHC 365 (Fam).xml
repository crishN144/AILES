I had anticipated that the order would be finalised on that day, notwithstanding that it had been listed for a 4 day final hearing to commence on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> April 2017.  The parties had, on the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2016 substantially settled the case and a document entitled Heads of Agreement (HoA) was signed by them and their very experienced solicitors.  </p>

Within these proceedings he put forward what has become known as a &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">millionaire&#8217;s defence</span>&#8217;, i.e. he accepts that he can meet any order that the court might make.

No disclosure has been provided, or requested, concerning the trusts&#8217; assets or their total income.  The Trustees have provided two letters, filed within these proceedings.  They are described, by Mr Harrison, as &#8216;carefully written&#8217;.  The effect of them is to indicate that no distribution of principle are contemplated at present.  M asserts that F and his siblings also received a substantial inheritance from their late father.  M considers this to be in the region of &#163;350 million.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The private law proceedings are plainly rancorous.  I am aware that a s47 report was requested of and prepared by London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.  I have been told that in accordance with its recommendations L lives with M and spends holiday time with F in Switzerland and term time weekends, occasionally, in both England and Switzerland.  Notwithstanding these established arrangements, a hearing has been listed in July 2017 to consider the time which L should spend with F on a longer term basis and an application to change her surname.  Within the s8 proceedings F indicated he was contemplating a change of residence and an application for leave to remove the child to Switzerland.  On the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July, within these proceedings, F apparently indicated that he no longer intended to pursue those applications.  This was not confirmed at this hearing, although it arguably had relevance to the Legal Services Order made by District Judge Gibbons on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016, to which I will return.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Bangay agrees that this summary accurately reflects the agreement, so do I.  However, notwithstanding that these matters had been substantially and sensibly agreed, there have been a raft of issues for me to determine at this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first issue is whether the Respondent has provided the Applicant with sufficient assurances as to security for his maintenance obligations in the event of his death.  To this end I have seen a letter from Schulte, Roth and Zable, the New York lawyers with responsibility for the Trust.  The most significant sentence of this provides: &#8220;in the event of [F]&#8217;s death, his daughter L will become the income beneficiary of the Trust&#8221;.  I consider these assurances are adequate and need not detain me further.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second issue is whether M intends to continue living in London.  The draft order restricts the possibility of a move by incorporating a clause into the Schedule 1 order which prevents M from obtaining a replacement property outside England and Wales, in any circumstances, before L completes her primary education.  The original aspiration on behalf of F was to prevent such a move for the duration of L&#8217;s childhood, extending to the completion of full time tertiary education.  His changed position came about only as a response to my suggestion, hoping to facilitate compromise, during the course of exchanges with counsel on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The correct approach, Ms Bangay contends is to concentrate on what had actually been agreed in the HoA.  Whilst the terms are not to be construed by analogy to contractual principles, nor the Court&#8217;s role reduced to that of a rubber stamp, there was, she submitted, an obvious interest in curbing excessive adversariality.  The general principle ought not to be lost sight of i.e. HoA signed by the parties, represented by competent and experienced solicitors should usually establish a consensus to which they should be bound.  F&#8217;s willingness to compromise, Ms Bangay submitted, did not weaken this &#8216;constructive&#8217; approach, it merely signalled F&#8217;s preparedness to compromise.  By way of support, she referred me to the well known judgment of Thorpe LJ in Xydhias (supra), particularly emphasising the following passage: </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;There are perhaps two lessons for specialist practitioners. The first is to distinguish clearly between the two stages of negotiation. The first stage is to establish what the applicant is to receive. That should be expressed in simple terms in heads of agreement signed by both counsel and their clients. All who appeared with or against the late Mr Jackson QC will remember that was for him a cardinal rule. The formality marks the conclusion of that part of the negotiating process which the parties dominate. The subsequent task of expressing the heads of agreement in the language of an order of the court is one to which they ordinarily make little contribution and, although it generally precedes the presentation of the agreement to the judge for his consideration, it can as well be done after the judge has determined the issue. The signature of the parties to a draft consent order hardly seems apt.&#8221;</span></p>

He contemplates a variety of scenarios in which M may need to transfer both her job and her home to a different jurisdiction.  As a Swedish national, separated from a US national (of Swedish origin), F living in Switzerland, M employed as a pilot, it would be particularly absurd, he contends, to restrict M&#8217;s home base in this way.</p>

I say that because the purpose of the statutory exercise is to ensure for the child of parents who have never married and who have become alienated and combative, support and also protection against adult irresponsibility and selfishness, at least insofar as money and property can achieve those ends.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The objective of the parties in constructing their agreement in the way that they did, was plainly to provide both materially and emotionally for L.  Central to this was the provision of a secure home.  I do not consider that they truly intended to chain L to a country to which she has no family connection.  What they intended to achieve was stability for their daughter in her early years and hopefully beyond.  Ms Bangay tells me that F presses for the restriction because he believes that to do so will guarantee L&#8217;s stability until she is 11 years old.  If this is his reasoning, it is flawed.  He has conflated &#8216;stability and security&#8217; with a settled address, the two are very different.  It is distinctly possible, for the reasons I have referred to above, that M will need to relocate.  To erect an obstacle to M would be entirely counter productive for her and it is easy to see how this would resonate into L&#8217;s life in a way that is inimical to her own welfare interests.  If the parties are unable to agree on relocation the Court will be asked to resolve it, thus L&#8217;s best interests are safeguarded.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;It is well recognised by all experienced practitioners, whether solicitors or counsel, that contested ancillary relief proceedings are expensive and by far the most expensive stage of the process is the trial, preceded by delivery of briefs. There have been innumerable examples over more than the last decade of cases in which the legal costs incurred have been quite disproportionate to the assets available for division. This perception has engendered the Calderbank procedure and more recently the interdisciplinary development of modern procedures designed to excise much of the elaboration and waste that have become the hallmarks of the old procedure. Litigants in ancillary relief proceedings are subjected to great emotional and psychological stresses, particularly as the date of trial approaches. In my opinion there are sound policy reasons supporting the conclusion that the judge is entitled to exercise a broad discretion to determine whether the parties have agreed to settle. The pilot scheme depends on judicial control of the process from start to finish. The court has a clear interest in curbing excessive adversariality and in excluding from trial lists unnecessary litigation. A more legalistic approach, as this case illustrates, only allows the inconsistent or manipulative litigant to repudiate an agreement on the ground that some point of drafting, detail, or implementation had not been clearly resolved. Ordinarily heads of agreement signed by the parties or a clear exchange of solicitors letters will establish the consensus. Hopefully a case such as this requiring the exercise of the judge's discretion will be a rarity.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Had I come to the conclusion that the HoA, strictly construed in the way that Ms Bangay invited me to, truly represented both its philosophy and objectives then, I confess, I would have come to the conclusion, as Mr Harrison invited to me to do, that this aspect of the agreement was &#8216;wrong in principle&#8217;.  Where a Court, at this &#8216;second stage&#8217; of the process, to use Thorpe LJ&#8217;s words, determines that an agreement between the parties is irreconcilable with the best interests of a subject child it is likely, in my view, that Xydhias principles will be disapplied.   Thus, paragraph 11 of the order should simply record that: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">M may not move to another jurisdiction with L without F&#8217;s agreement or the permission of the court.  In the event of a move the court shall have jurisdiction to review the terms of housing and maintenance provisions in this order</span>.&#8217;</p>

In addition, as Ms Bangay recognises, the Schedule 1 housing is here addressed by undertaking rather than an order, accordingly there requires to be clear provision within the body of the order confirming that this Court retains the jurisdiction to vary.</p>

If those undertakings are not freely given, as I am told is the position here, that must be the end of the matter.  It is trite law that breach of an undertaking has exactly the same consequence as breach of a Court Order i.e. potentially imprisonment.  I could only make orders of the type contemplated in the HoA if satisfied that they were supported by cogent evidence and reflected the correct balance of the competing Article 8 and 10 rights, in which neither had precedence.  I am simply not in a position to undertake this exercise.  In addition, the provisions, whether expressed as orders or undertakings, are far too ambitious in their reach.  They contemplate retrieval of information from third parties; deletion of emails; a general duty to take reasonable steps to prevent various Court Orders entering into the public domain.  Also I am asked to make restrictive orders relating to documents in the private law proceedings which I have not seen and which, properly, have not been filed in these proceedings.  I have no hesitation in concluding that the restrictive orders should be confined to those set out in the guidelines.</p>

For properties of the value being considered here in central London, these costs are very significant.  Were they to be discharged from the sale proceeds they would have a significant and disadvantageous impact on the available funds to provide alternative accommodation.  The dominant feature here is the scale of the father&#8217;s assets and his lifestyle generally.  In my judgement, where the &#8216;millionaire&#8217;s defence&#8217; is relied upon, this feature inevitably becomes the lode star in such disputes.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the strength of Xydhias agreements that they are not constrained by the language of the statutes by which they are framed.  The insertion of innocuous, anodyne or ultimately meaningless phrases can hold significance for the parties themselves which to the observer adds nothing at all.  Every counsel who has ever constructed an agreement will immediately appreciate this.  However, it is often precisely these phrases that enable parties, at the end of a relationship, to yield, accommodate and to compromise.  Into this agreement was inserted this phrase: &#8216;the Applicant agrees and confirms that she has no intention of seeking a further lump sum from the Respondent&#8217;.  Mr Harrison makes the obvious point that such claims can not be dismissed, notwithstanding that M has, in effect, received the lump sum she is entitled to.  Ms Bangay attempted to stiffen the recording by amending &#8216;intention&#8217; to read &#8216;present intention&#8217;.   None of this contributes anything to the impact or effect of the order but nor does it detract from it.  It serves only to record the mother&#8217;s litigation intentions at this point.  It presumably means something to F as he has fought for its inclusion.  If it helps him to accommodate his responsibilities and diminish the potential for further conflict then it serves a purpose which is everything to do with human emotions and nothing to do with the law.  Accordingly, I consider it should be included thus: &#8216;the mother agrees that she has no present intention of seeking a further lump sum&#8217;.</p>
