Upon me asking questions, I was told by H&#8217;s counsel that after separation he paid the mortgage on the FMH and a rental property. The parties could not agree how much that was; W thought he paid a total of about &#163;50,000 towards the mortgage(s) over the years since separation whereas H asserted nearer &#163;150,000. I had no evidence on this, but it seems to me that even on H&#8217;s case, he extracted getting on for &#163;400,000 over 52 months which was used for his own purposes. </span></p>

The court is entitled, in the absence of full and frank disclosure, to draw adverse conclusions where appropriate, and to the degree of specificity or generality deemed fit. A non-disclosing party cannot complain if the lack of disclosure leads the court to make an order which by necessity is based on less secure foundations than the court would wish; that is the fault of the miscreant party.

Thereafter, as the judge expressly concluded, any alleged downturn (which in itself was not accepted by the judge) was for forensic presentational purposes. It was clearly open to the judge to adopt what he found to be a real figure rather than a deliberately depressed one. Net profits justified the valuation as at December 2022. The judge found that H engineered a depressed financial presentation by the time of trial in 2023. Inferentially, he concluded that once the proceedings are over the status quo ante will be restored. The judge was in my view clearly entitled to take a value, in the light of all the evidence which he saw and heard, of what his business interests (not necessarily in SLL Ltd but in their entirety) are or will shortly be. It is artificial to take, as H urges upon me, the moment of least value chosen on a self-serving basis by H. It seems to me that the judge, although making a specific finding as to company value on a snapshot basis, was essentially making a finding as to </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">resources</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> available to H either now or in the foreseeable future. Even if SLL Ltd was by the date of trial not trading, the judge clearly found that through that or some other medium, H would essentially pick up where he left off. There is no justification for interfering with his conclusions. In the end, it is a matter for the court to determine value, and resources, and the judge did so.</span></p>

I do not accept the submission. Essentially, I am being asked to dismantle the finding made by the judge. I do not consider that there is a solid basis upon which to do so. An assessment of earning capacity is straightforward in many cases. Often, the court will simply assume the continuation of existing, secure employment with a fixed income. At the other end of the scale, the court may need to undertake a less precise exercise which is a mixture of fact finding and evaluation, within the context of the overall circumstances, and underpinned by judicial experience and a sense of that which is realistic and achievable. Where strongly adverse findings are made against a party which are directly relevant to the issue, the court will be astute to detect a deliberately understated case. That is what has happened here. The judge concluded that H had been deceitful throughout, and downplayed his resources and prospects in order to diminish W&#8217;s case. The judge alighted upon a figure which was consistent with the past history of earnings, which is frequently the best guide for the court. It cannot in those circumstances be surprising to H if the court, looking at this case with realism, concluded that his prospects are far better than claimed.</span></p>

I understand the point that such repayment does not necessarily mean that the business has generated profits at that level, but I am confident this experienced judge was alert to the difference.  The wider point being made by the judge was that H felt willing and able to make such substantial withdrawals despite his protestations of deteriorating income. The picture, as the judge found it, was of H minimising his resources, whereas his actions and lifestyle pointed the other way. In any event, the bulk of the withdrawals were made at a time when the business had a healthy turnover and operating profit.</span></p>

It is important to view this specific ground within the entirety of the s25 exercise. In a sense, regardless of who is formally responsible for the loan, or how it is accounted for, the real question for me is whether the division of assets alighted upon by the judge was so unfair to H as to justify appellate reversal.

He reached the conclusion that W needs the liquid capital to rehouse in purchased accommodation with the benefit of a mortgage. H, by contrast, will need time to rebuild his resources so as to buy a property, but the judge found that with his earning potential he will be able to do so. In the meantime he and his partner can rent, and have ample income to pay for reasonable rented accommodation. I would only add that although it is generally desirable in financial remedy cases for each party to be able to own a property, with the attendant benefits of security and potential investment upside, it is not an iron rule. It will all depend on the facts. In this case it is not possible to do so at this stage.

Ultimately, so it seems to me, the question for this appellate court is whether the split of 62/38 in favour of W, on the basis that H&#8217;s share is much less readily realisable, is sustainable. In looking at the case in the round, I take the view that H has only himself to blame for the findings made against him. His deficient disclosure, and manipulative litigation conduct, inevitably exposed him to the sort of findings and evaluation undertaken by the judge. All the relevant circumstances fell to be seen through that prism. To that I would add that H&#8217;s extraction of perhaps &#163;400,000 of funds from about the time of separation onwards does not entitle him complain now that his share of the assets is less, and less liquid, than W&#8217;s. Some of that may well have been applied toward basic living expenses. For example, I was told that he paid &#163;2,500pm towards the rent of &#163;3,500pm he shares with his partner. But looked at in the round, in my judgment H had the sole benefit of sums measured in hundreds of thousands of pounds, which easily match or exceed the difference on the judges&#8217; findings between W&#8217;s net outcome of &#163;211,000 and H&#8217;s of &#163;128,000. </span></p>
