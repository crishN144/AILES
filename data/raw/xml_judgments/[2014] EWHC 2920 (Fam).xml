It is made in the context of a long marriage in respect of which Decree nisi was pronounced in May 2013, some 22 years after its celebration.  The parties married in June 1991, having by then lived together for two years.  Three children were born during the course of the marriage.  Two of the children are now in their early twenties and one is 15 years old.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">There have been significant difficulties within the marriage for  a number of years.  The wife issued her original petition seeking dissolution of the marriage as long ago as October 2007. Despite the fact that there were ongoing attempts to repair the relationship, their marriage appears to have finally broke down at the beginning of 2013. The parties continue to live (albeit separately) under the same roof at the family home in central London.  Their physical separation will happen imminently, however, since the husband has recently completed the purchase of a property a short distance from the family home in West London. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The parties are both French nationals.  The husband is 50 and the wife, 49.  They began their relationship at the beginning of 1989.  Within 6 months they had moved in together and were sharing a flat in Paris.  (That was a flat which the husband had purchased in 1989 at about the same time as their relationship commenced and about which I shall say more later in this judgment.)  Having married in June 1991 (when the wife was in the early stages of pregnancy), they spent a further four months in Paris before the husband moved to London in connection with his employment as a banker.  Their son was born some three months later and, when he was just weeks old, the wife left France to join the husband in London.  Initially, they rented a property in West London as they settled into life in England.  Their current family home in West London was purchased at the end of 1998.  </span></p>

Each of the children have had a French education.  The parties remain domiciled in France; H has a significant number of property investments in France and continues to submit tax returns to the French IRS; their family connections in France remain strong, and they retain an extended network of social ties within that jurisdiction.</span></p>

It was a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">contrat </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">which contained a specific election by this couple of a property regime known as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">s&#233;paration de biens</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">, a concept well known and recognised within this jurisdiction as one of the European default regimes. In essence, French law makes provision for a set of legal rules which will determine the spouses&#8217; respective interests in their assets both as between themselves and vis-&#224;-vis third parties.  Under French law, a marriage contract, once notarised, is absolutely binding on the spouses once the marriage is celebrated, save in very limited respects (none of which applies here).  Its terms follow the spouses both during the subsistence of their marriage and in the event of its </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">d&#233;nouement</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  In the absence of a specific election, spouses are deemed to have chosen the default regime of community property.  If they do not wish to adopt that regime, they are obliged to enter into a marriage contract in order to adopt one of the alternatives defined in the French Civil Code.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">That is what the husband and wife did in this case.  Under the French separation of assets regime, assets are distinguished as either &#8216;own assets&#8217; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">(biens propres) </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">or &#8216;common assets&#8217; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">(biens communs)</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  Whilst it is possible under French law for a couple to extend or restrict the scope of this regime, there was no such provision in the marriage contract entered into by these parties.   Under its terms, the legal presumption under French law was that each would keep his or her own assets, whether in existence at the time or subsequently acquired, separate and free from any claim by the other unless jointly acquired and specifically held in joint (or common) ownership.  Whilst the marriage contract itself did not contain any specific reference to the dissolution of the marriage (other than by death), its terms would continue to apply in the event of a divorce were that divorce to fall under the jurisdiction of the French courts.  In these circumstances, the wife&#8217;s only remedy would be to make an application for an award of maintenance </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">(prestation compensatoire)</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.</span></p>

Following recent developments in English law, and particularly the enhanced status given to marital agreements in the aftermath of the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Radmacher v Granatino </span><span style="font-family:Garamond"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2010/42" uk:canonical="[2010] UKSC 42" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] UKSC 42</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 2 FLR 1900" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 2 FLR 1900</ref>, the husband says that this marriage contract should be given a central and magnetic prominence in terms of its pull towards a financial outcome for this couple.

(There are a few issues of computation remaining which I shall have to resolve in due course.  If Mr Leech succeeds on his arguments in respect of &#8216;washing out&#8217; a significant part of the potential tax liabilities in this case, the value of the assets may be in the region of &#163;13.7 million.)  In terms, the husband&#8217;s proposal is that the wife should receive no more than about a third of the family&#8217;s wealth whilst he retains almost twice as much as she.  He relies, centrally, on the exclusion - reflected in the marriage contract &#8211; of any entitlement to share that which has been built up during the years of the marriage.  He contends, in terms, that the election of the specific marital regime chosen by these parties should be considered in the same legal context as a decision to enter a pre-nuptial agreement which had the same effect of excluding an entitlement to share.  In contrast, the wife, by her proposals, seeks a full share of the assets subject only to the exclusion of any which are agreed to be non-marital property (worth about &#163;1.3 million in this case).</span></p>

The wife described to me in clear (and still vibrant) detail her joy at driving across Paris to collect the husband from work in the evenings.  She described the manner in which they led a carefree and happy existence, enjoying each other&#8217;s company and a busy social life centred around the apartment they shared in Paris.  The wife is an individual who has run her life in a highly organised manner.  She is meticulously detailed in her approach to the framework of her day to day domestic and business life, a fact which the husband acknowledges as having been a feature of their married lives together.  </span></p>

He accepts that there is truth in the wife&#8217;s description of him as being somewhat secretive and introverted with those whom he does not know well.  He told me that when they began their relationship in the early part of 1989, he could not believe his good fortune in having secured the affections of the girl who was the object of much attention from their fellow undergraduates.  He told me that he felt the wife was more ready than he to make the commitment to marriage.  He says that they had discussions about their future together during which they spoke about the possibility of their relationship breaking down at some point in the future.  Uppermost in their minds, according to him, was the overriding principle that they were entering marriage as entirely independent young adults; that they had agreed to respect each other&#8217;s personal and financial autonomy; and that the fundamental principle which was to underpin their personal relationship was an acceptance that, whatever the future might bring, that personal independence would remain sacrosanct.</span></p>

The longest relationship she had experienced (although I had the impression that it was not exclusive or, at least, an &#8216;on and off&#8217; arrangement) was with a childhood friend.  They had been together in a relationship of sorts from the age of 16 to 23 years.  But the gravamen of the wife&#8217;s evidence was that her relationship with the husband was her first serious adult relationship and it was one to which she was deeply committed.</span></p>

He told me that there had been several occasions when the subject had come up as a topic of conversation both as between themselves and as a result of conversations which had involved the wife&#8217;s father who had been firmly opposed to a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">s&#233;paration de biens </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">regime</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">  The husband told me about conversations which he remembered having with the wife&#8217;s father on other occasions when she had not been present.

He agreed during the course of cross-examination that there had been a significant amount of resistance from her father at the outset but that the principle of having a marriage contract had been agreed by the time of the formal engagement lunch in April 1991.  As to the reasons why everything had been left until the last minute, he told me that he had not been party to the arrangements which were put in place to see the notary.  That appointment was arranged for 13 June 1991, two days before the celebration of the marriage.  He told me that it had not been a significant concern because the timing of the execution of the marriage contract remained well within their control and it was, in any event, not a top priority because of all the other tasks which needed to be completed in advance of the wedding day.</span></p>

It was not a topic of discussion and there was no financial planning around the issue of marriage, save for the inevitable expense which came with a great deal of organisation and preparation for the wedding itself.  She told me that the husband was working very long hours in the period immediately prior to the wedding and the practical aspects of the ceremony and reception (such as the location, flowers, catering and all that went with it) were left to her to arrange.  In addition to her involvement in the wedding plans, she was also looking for a suitable cr&#232;che for the new baby they were expecting.  When she was asked how she thought the forthcoming marriage might impact upon her own career, she agreed that there was never a question at that stage of her giving up her job.

She recalled one specific occasion when the husband and wife were at their home for either lunch or dinner.  The wife had accompanied the husband&#8217;s sister to a separate room where the baby&#8217;s nappy was changed.  Whilst that was being done and the child was settled, they had &#8216;a friendly talk&#8217; during which the wife had told the sister that she felt &#8216;uncomfortable&#8217; because the husband wanted to marry under the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">s&#233;paration de biens </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">regime, whereas her father took a contrary view.

Memories can also be conditioned by emotional responses to situations, including stress.  Some, all, or none of these factors may be present here.  Mr Scott has asked me to consider the wife&#8217;s evidence in relation to these events as flowing from a deeply embedded feeling that she has over the years of this marriage been &#8216;hard done by&#8217; a husband who has not always been open and honest with her about their finances (as he himself admits).  Mr Leech points to occasions when the same use of language has cropped up in the descriptions given to me by both the husband and his sister (for example, the use of the word &#8216;taboo&#8217; whilst referring to the absence of any inhibitions felt by the parties in discussing the issues arising from the marriage contract). </span></p>

By the time of the marriage in June 1991, the husband&#8217;s family had an established track record of inheritance tax planning and he and his siblings had already seen and/or were likely in the future to see financial benefit in terms of property acquisition and/or assistance with funding the acquisition of property.  Conscious of the fact that his own parents and his siblings had entered into similar arrangements, the husband would in all probability have regarded it as a normal incident of his own decision to marry.</span></p>

I find that in the weeks and months leading up to the wedding, she was far more absorbed by the planning and arrangements for the day itself and by the impact of her discovery, in May 1991, that she was pregnant with their first child.  This finding does not detract in any way from her evidence (which I accept) that she shared the husband&#8217;s fundamental philosophy as to the importance of retaining a sense of individuality and self-worth within the partnership of marriage.  I find that each of these parties was equally proud of the personal, academic and professional success which the other had achieved by the time of the marriage.</span></p>

However, on the basis of the answer which he gave to Mr Scott when he was asked whether he was clear that her father was in agreement with his own view that a regime of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">s&#233;paration de biens </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">was the right regime for this couple, I am unable to find as an established fact in this case that the issue had by then been discussed and agreed </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">as between the husband, the wife and their respective parents</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> as a concluded arrangement.

I have little doubt that it was an exceptionally happy day for both families and the couple&#8217;s friends.  I can easily see that the two fathers might have taken the opportunity to retire somewhere quiet at some point during those celebrations to discuss some of the formalities flowing from their children&#8217;s decision to marry.  Whether or not those discussions included a specific conversation about the election of the property regime, the marriage contract or the concerns which I find the wife&#8217;s father had expressed earlier to the husband during personal conversations with him, I know not, and it is not necessary for me to make a specific finding.  I am concerned here primarily with findings as to the wife&#8217;s understanding and knowledge.  </span></p>

On the whole, I found the wife to be a reliable witness as to the truth, but in this respect I believe that she has forgotten some of the detail of what occurred in those very busy weeks leading up to her marriage to the husband.  I suspect that in her understandable wish to be as helpful to the court as she can be, she has returned to the more solid foundation of her diaries and the contemporaneous documents which she has been able to obtain in order to try and piece together an accurate timeline.  In so doing, she has in all probability forgotten some of the detail of the discussions she had with the husband.  It may very well be that subsequent unhappy events and tensions which were to emerge later about the marriage contract have coloured what she now remembers.</span></p>

By that, I do not intend to imply that he was deliberately misleading the wife or applying undue pressure; simply that he approached the subject from a much better informed position.  I am prepared to accept her evidence that, far from being steeped in the culture of these types of arrangements, it was not a concept with which this wife was familiar when she agreed to live with and, subsequently, marry, the husband.  I accept, too, that she was being truthful when she told me that she did not regard the issue of the marriage contract as something about which she needed to be anxious or in relation to which she had cause to be worried.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I find it likely that there was some conversation between the husband and wife about his wish to enter a marriage contract in advance of the wedding.  By that stage, they had been used to living with one another for almost two years.  Their domestic and financial arrangements at that stage were not complex.  Each had some independent property interests (although the husband&#8217;s were more valuable), each was working in a well-paid career and the wife was clear to me that her pregnancy made no difference at all to her intention to continue working.  Her written evidence suggests that there was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;one brief discussion&#8217; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">about the marriage contract at most a few weeks before the wedding </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[1/E:75]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  I accept that at some stage during that or another discussion, the husband did indeed seek to justify the need for keeping their affairs separate on the basis of the protection it would afford her from any future creditors.  I can see no reason why she would otherwise have made such a statement to her own solicitors many years later when she was seeking legal advice about the implications of the marriage contract in circumstances which she understood to be privileged.  On the one hand, it may be seen as a self-serving statement but, on the other, it was a statement which she would not reasonably have expected to have been produced in evidence.  She could not possibly be expected to have anticipated that it might be used to rebut a suggestion put to her at some stage further down the road that she was, consciously or otherwise, seeking to adopt an explanation given by another wife to a different judge in a case wholly unconnected with this litigation.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In terms of the time line, I find it likely that there was at least one direct conversation between the wife and her future sister-in-law about the husband&#8217;s wish that there should be a marriage contract involving the election of a regime of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">s&#233;paration de biens</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  The husband&#8217;s sister cannot help me with precisely when that conversation took place.  It seems to me that, given the &#8216;anchor&#8217; of early summer and the baby sitting in the swimming pool, it is more likely to have occurred in late rather than early spring 1991.  I reject the suggestion that this would have been some six months before the wedding because that would take us back to December 1990 or January 1991.  It is far more likely, in my view, that the husband&#8217;s sister had the conversation which she remembers with the wife much closer to May of that year.  I find it is highly probable that, during the course of that conversation, she referred to the fact that she herself had entered into such a contract and that it was simple to understand and operate.  If and insofar as a future breakdown of the marriage was mentioned on that or any other occasion, I find as a fact that, in terms of the information she had been given by her future sister-in-law, the wife had neither then, nor at the time she signed the contract, a full understanding of the legal implications which would flow from a divorce, nor the rights which she might be giving up in that event.</span></p>

The husband was working long hours at his job in Paris during the week, as was the wife.  They had a relatively short time to make all the arrangements for the wedding festivities and plan for the impending arrival of a new (and first) baby.  Most, if not all, of the practical arrangements were left to her.  He accepts that he has been wrong in his recollection of some of the minor details (such as his mistake about her parents having collected the wedding dossier from the Town Hall).  On the more substantial issue, I am satisfied that the husband is wrong in his recollection that he had secured the wife&#8217;s unequivocal agreement to the terms of the marriage contract he was proposing by the time of the engagement lunch on 2 April 1991.  I consider that it is far more likely that there were further conversations between them and that those conversations led to the particular discussion which the wife&#8217;s sister-in-law remembers and which I have found is likely to have occurred in about May 1991 when the weather was warm enough for swimming pools and sun hats. I am prepared to accept that when the wife delivered the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Projet de Mariage </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">document to the Mairie on 26 May 1991, there was still no clear decision as to whether there would be such a contract and, if so, in what form.  </span></p>

The wife saw the formal contract for the first time when she attended the notary&#8217;s office some 48 hours before the wedding.  Her evidence about that was not the subject of any challenge.  The husband accepted that at no point did he say to her that she ought to seek independent legal advice and she took no steps to do so.  That lacuna cannot be said to have been made good by anything which her future sister-in-law said to her in the context of divorce since she herself accepts that nobody&#8217;s thoughts were then focussed on the possibility of &#8216;the beautiful love story&#8217; coming to an end.  The wife did not have access to the material (or anything similar) which the husband produced as part of his case in these proceedings (the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Guide des Futurs &#274;poux</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">) </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[2/G:10]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.

I have no evidence from the husband&#8217;s sister&#8217;s husband nor anything from the notaire himself.  Even if I did have evidence from either of those two gentlemen, it would doubtless be susceptible to the same weaknesses and defects which the passage of time has brought to the recollections of others in this case.  All I have is the husband telling me in his written evidence that the notary did all that was expected of him, and the wife telling me that she had no understanding of the position on death or divorce.</span></p>

Each has loved and respected the other in the past and each is committed to the future welfare of their three children.  Each now comes to court committed to securing what he/she regards as a fair and proper distribution of the wealth they have accumulated together during this long marriage.  To the extent that the husband seeks to frame his case within the clear parameters of an agreement he believed he had made with the wife when their journey into married life began, I can both respect and understand his principles.  But on the basis of everything which I have heard and read in this case, I do not accept the fundamental premise in his argument that she went into this marriage with her eyes fully open to the implications of what might happen were the strict terms of the marriage contract to be applied to its eventual demise.  I am not prepared to accept that, when she signed the marriage contract on 13 June 1991, the wife had any proper or informed understanding of the fact that, were the marriage to founder many years down the road and regardless of what their circumstances might be at the time, she would be confined to a financial outcome which resulted in a significant divergence of equality between the parties.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr Scott on behalf of the husband reminds me quite properly that I should be alive to the underlying cultural distinction between a marriage contract which records the election of a particular marital property regime as they operate within many European jurisdictions (here, France), and a nuptial agreement made before or during the continuance of a marriage.  The former anticipates a contract which is intended to govern financial arrangements between parties and which is binding as between the parties on marriage, death or divorce.  There is no automatic expectation, under French law, that divorce will create or give rise to any change in underlying property rights as between the parties save and except to the extent that the marriage contract makes specific provision for this event.  The latter generally comes into being with the specific purpose of excluding, restricting or specifying the rights which might otherwise arise in the event of divorce.  Frequently, nuptial agreements may be the vehicles through which a couple will elect not only a marital property regime but also the applicable law which shall apply to the division of the financial claims arising on divorce.</span></p>

The third and fifth of the six safeguards proposed in the consultation document (see para [5] above) were designed to ensure this.  Baron J applied these safeguards, found that they were not satisfied, and accorded the agreement reduced weight for this reason.  The Court of Appeal did not consider that the circumstances in which the agreement was reached diminished the weight to be attached to it.  Insofar as the safeguards were not strictly satisfied, this was not material on the particular facts of this case.</span></p>

It is necessary to have black and white rules of this kind if agreements are otherwise to be binding.  There is no need for them, however, in the current state of the law.  The safeguards in the consultation document are likely to be highly relevant, but we consider that the Court of Appeal was correct in principle to ask whether there was any </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">material </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">lack of disclosure, information or advice.  Sound legal advice is obviously desirable, for this will ensure that a party understands the implications of the agreement, and full disclosure of any assets owned by the other party may be necessary to ensure this.  But if it is clear that a party is fully aware of the implications of an ante-nuptial agreement and indifferent to detailed particulars of the other party&#8217;s assets, there is no need to accord the agreement reduced weight because he or she was unaware of those particulars.  </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">What is important is that each party should have all the information that is material to his or her decision, and that each party should intend that the agreement should govern the financial consequences of the marriage coming to an end</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.&#8217;  [my emphasis]</span></p>

The problem arises where the agreement makes provisions which conflict with what the court would otherwise consider to be the requirements of fairness.  The fact of the agreement is capable of altering what is fair.  It is an important factor to be weighed in the balance.

The first step is to decide whether the agreement was entered into with a full appreciation of its implications.  If it was, he says, the court can then go on to decide as a matter of fairness whether to hold that party to the agreement in whole or in part.  If, however, the agreement falls at the first hurdle because the court reaches the conclusion that the party did not have a full appreciation of its implications, that should be an end to it.

She made it plain to me that she would have been prepared to follow the husband wherever the demands of his employment took him.

The wife accepts that the marriage contract was the &#8216;blueprint&#8217; for managing their financial affairs during the subsistence of the marriage.  Apart from their jointly owned family home in West London, they continued to keep their financial affairs entirely separate.  It is one of the wife&#8217;s main complaints about the husband that he was secretive with money to the extent that, until his disclosure in these proceedings, she had been unaware of the size of the bonus awards he had been receiving over the years.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In this context of materiality, Mr Scott raises an interesting argument which, as far as I am aware, has not been considered in any reported decision.  He submits on behalf of the husband that the (acknowledged) lack of legal advice and the wife&#8217;s failure to appreciate in full the legal implications of the agreement she was entering cannot be said to have any bearing on her decision to sign the marriage contract because, in so doing, she was not giving up anything to which she might otherwise be entitled.  The husband concedes that her needs will be met at the end of this case, whatever conclusions I may reach as to the exclusion of sharing the marital acquest which has been accumulated during the marriage.  Thus, argues Mr Scott, had the wife secured appropriate legal advice in 1991 in advance of the marriage, she would have been told that her claims on divorce would be limited to her &#8216;reasonable requirements&#8217; assessed against the list of factors set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>.  </span></p>

She had always intended to pursue a career and have children.   In 1991, there was no guarantee that the husband&#8217;s career would prove to be as successful as it was in terms of the significant sums he has since been able to accumulate through bonus payments and awards.  It was just as probable at that time that the wife might have had an equally &#8216;stellar&#8217; career.  Mr Scott submits that I should not now seek to look back down the road with the benefit of hindsight and factor in the supervening issues of the collapse in the wife&#8217;s health, its effect on her future earning capacity and the marked disparity in their individual resources (a disparity of some &#163;7 million) so as to say that the agreement embodied in the marriage contract was unfair at the time.  She is, he submits, in exactly the position she would be in if the marriage had broken down before the House of Lords&#8217; decision in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">White </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">in 2000.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">First, I look to the scope of the legal advice she is likely to have sought or received.  At the very least, it seems to me that she would have been advised as to the legal implications of the marriage contract under French law and its full reach into the future in the event of a subsequent divorce in France.  Secondly, given what I have already said about the likelihood of a future move for this couple, she may well have sought advice about its implications in a different jurisdiction whose domestic law operated on the basis of a wider application of judicial discretion.  In this event, it seems to me to be artificial to assume that the independent legal advice which she might have received at the time of the marriage would have been confined to a simple statement of the likely bracket of an award on divorce or even a statement of the principle that, under English law as it then stood, she would be entitled to have her needs met, but no more.  The court&#8217;s discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> has always been much wider than simply meeting needs.  &#8216;Needs&#8217;, in any event, is a concept which is both elastic and adaptive in its application.   Had this wife sought independent legal advice, she might well have been advised in the context of a range of different options and outcomes.  In 1991, no one knew how long the marriage would last.  It could have endured for two years, twenty years, or a lifetime.   It might have produced a single child or many more children.  Her expectation as to her ability to survive independently from the husband within the financial structure of her own career might or might not have been realistic, depending upon circumstances as they unfolded through the years.  </span></p>

In 1991, this couple had some limited experience of sharing a home and life together.  They had no experience whatsoever of the potential impact which a family might make upon the way in which they might be obliged to share a division of responsibilities in the future.   Had the true objective been to preserve assets which each brought into the marriage or which each might subsequently acquire during its subsistence outside the marital partnership, the wife could have been advised that there were other means of achieving this end without the strict rigours of a regime of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">s&#233;paration de biens.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">To my mind, it is not without relevance that significant tensions would subsequently emerge between these parties precisely because of the apparent unfairness which this financial blueprint produced.

These spreadsheets prepared in May 2003, December 2006 and October 2007, as she told me, were her attempt to spell out to the husband the fundamental unfairness of the limited contribution he was making to the family&#8217;s discretionary spending on an annual basis.

Some years into the marriage, the parties entered into an express agreement incorporating that default regime.  Mostyn J rejected the husband&#8217;s case which rested upon a full recognition of the agreement.  He did so on two principal grounds.  First, the Catalan default matrimonial property regime enabled a court to depart from its terms if upholding these would produce a serious economic imbalance between the two spouses at the end of the marriage.  Thus, this &#8216;agreement&#8217; failed the &#8216;fairness&#8217; test.

They intended their marriage to be lived in London.  The notary drawing the agreement specifically advised that English advice be taken about it.  The agreement was a bespoke agreement for that marriage which went much further than a mere prescription of a particular property regime.  It declared that the statutory default matrimonial regime was to be excluded, and that each party was to manage his or her assets entirely independently.  It excluded the equalisation of pension rights. Each party irrevocably waived a claim for maintenance even if they should face a situation of direst want.  It contained a waiver of the statutory right to a portion of the estate of the first one of them to die.  Mr Granatino did not take the opportunity in the 4-month period following the formation of the agreement of taking legal advice about it anywhere.&#8217;</span></p>

In that case, a Swedish wife had received no independent legal advice prior to entering a prenuptial agreement with her Italian husband.  The agreement provided that she was to have no rights over the property owned by the husband prior to the marriage, but it was silent as to what would happen in the event of a subsequent divorce.  When the marriage broke down after three years, the family was living in London where the husband was employed as an investment banker.  The wife had no income and was a full-time mother to two children.     The judge at first instance placed little weight on the agreement because of the absence of any terms specific to a divorce and because the wife had not received independent legal advice before signing.

Prior to the marriage, the parties entered into a marriage settlement which provided for a partial separation of property.  Moor J found that the wife should not be held to the strict terms of the settlement because she did not have a full appreciation of the implications of those terms.

Mr Balcombe submits, and I accept, that to enable a party to be fully aware of the implications of a nuptial agreement, he or she should have all the information that is material to his or her decision whether or not to enter into it.  He further submits, and again I accept his submission, that where a party is not fully aware of the implications of the agreement because he or she lacks all the information that is material to his or her decision, it will invariably be unfair to hold the parties to the agreement.  Where I part company with his submissions is that he adds that, in such circumstances, the court, in the exercise of its discretion, should not afford the agreement any weight.  My conclusion is that this last point will depend upon all the circumstances of the case.  It may be unfair to afford it any weight but this will not invariably be the case.

I find no inconsistency in the fact that these parties did indeed operate upon the basis of self-contained financial arrangements within their marriage.  That was exactly what the wife had agreed they would do when she signed the marriage contract.

That does not mean that parties will need to seek advice on all possible permutations; such a result would be plainly absurd.  But, to the extent that the intention is that sharing or community of property is to be excluded both during the subsistence of the marriage and at its dissolution, I respectfully share the view expressed by Mostyn J (and adopted by Moor J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">AH v PH</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">).

Mr Scott very fairly concedes that there is no issue but that the marital acquest in this case (some &#163;12 million) should be shared more or less equally if I find, as I have, that the husband has not made out his case in relation to the enforceability of the marriage contract in its strict terms.

With that potential saving factored into the equation, the available assets increased to c. &#163;13.85m of which just over &#163;1.3 million was non-matrimonial.  The marital acquest in this case is just under &#163;12 million.  The wife sought an overall share (including the retention by each party of their non-matrimonial assets) of 49% which would have left her with c. &#163;6.85 million and the husband with &#163;6.995 million.  His proposal, in broad terms, is that each party should retain his/her own assets, that the wife should retain in her sole name the former matrimonial home (worth &#163;2.231 million net) and that he should pay to her a further sum of &#163;200,000 to meet her short term needs until she is able to become self-sufficient in income terms.   This would leave her with capital of some &#163;4.27 million, depending on the value to be attributed to her pensions (or 32% overall, subject to the tax treatment of the husband&#8217;s offshore funds).</span></p>

Whilst she has had help within the home, I accept that these domestic duties have, by and large, fallen on her shoulders as the husband pursued his own career in the banking world.

It records a specific provision to enable her to work one day a week from home at her discretion (reviewable after a period of one year) and records her request for extended holiday of up to 6 weeks leave in a year. Her initial salary was &#163;50,000 and she was paid commission of some &#163;15,000 per annum. The 2002 email speaks of an improved package of &#163;75,000 per annum as a base salary plus a discretionary bonus of 40% paid annually and based upon a combination of individual and company objectives.  Whilst equity participation was mentioned at that stage, I am entirely satisfied that the wife&#8217;s move to this start-up company and her later negotiations with them around an improved package (but reduced working week) was driven primarily by her wish to devote more of her time to the home and children whilst maintaining her position as one of the senior &#8216;players&#8217; in the developing telecoms world. In cross-examination, the husband accepted that she had, at one point, spoken about giving up work altogether.  He was asked about his response to that suggestion in terms of his offer, in that event, to pay her &#8216;a nanny&#8217;s wage&#8217;.  Whilst he sought to brush that remark off as something of a joke it seems to me that, whatever aspirations this young couple may have had about preserving their personal and financial autonomy when they first contemplated a shared life together, the natural evolution of family life as it developed over the years would inevitably have required some concessions and accommodation from both.  Thus it proved, and I am satisfied that the wife was attempting to define for herself a role which would both enable her to devote time and energy to the children as well as perform at work under demanding conditions.   </span></p>

From that report and from the wife&#8217;s own evidence, I collect the facts that, by 2007, she was struggling both with the difficulties in the marriage and with the stress of holding down her job and running the home.  She had some counselling and had been diagnosed as suffering from depression by her GP who later signed her off work for two weeks.  Throughout this time, she was suffering from panic attacks and exhaustion for which she was prescribed anti-depressant medication.</span></p>

She was assessed to be underperforming at work.    Having returned from a two week holiday with the children, she felt that she could no longer cope with her employment and the additional stress of the ongoing divorce proceedings.  With assistance from her human resources department, she negotiated a severance package which included 7 months&#8217; pay and the retention of her shares in the company.  She told me that this particular package was not generally available to leaving directors but, in circumstances where the company was trying to reduce its &#8216;head count&#8217;, she was able to take advantage of it.

She told me that she did not want to feel a burden to her employer and, at a time when her ability to cope with developing life events was at its lowest, she decided to negotiate the best package she could and leave.  She sought legal advice in relation to the severance package and was told that she would have been likely to get less if she launched a claim for unfair dismissal than the sums (then) on offer as part of the &#8216;paid leavers&#8217; package&#8217;.</span></p>

In my view, this was not a calculated response to the ongoing divorce and financial remedy proceedings. If I am to be fair to each of these parties, I have to look at what was unfolding in this couple&#8217;s life over a period of months, if not years, prior to the breakdown in the wife&#8217;s health.  The husband himself has told me how he found it quite impossible for many months to contemplate a house move in circumstances where he was trying to hold down a full-time job and deal with these proceedings.  I have no doubt that he, too, has found the entire process deeply distressing, but his health has not been as fragile as this wife&#8217;s throughout this period.  In my view, she is not a lady who would have voluntarily walked away from the career she had established over many years had she not genuinely felt that she was unable to cope any longer.  That view is reflected to a degree in Dr Hopley&#8217;s report.  I was able to observe her closely throughout a sustained period of time whilst she was giving her evidence.  She is a lady who is still struggling to cope with these proceedings and I am not prepared to impugn her motives or attribute to her an </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">animus </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">in these proceedings which I do not believe she has.</span></p>

She plans to retrain as a teacher, an aspiration which she told me she has long held and which accords with her wish to find less stressful employment which will nevertheless bring her job satisfaction. She has completed a course of cognitive behavioural therapy which may be supplemented by further anti-depressant medication.  Dr Hopley&#8217;s report concludes that the prognosis for the wife&#8217;s depression is good and that she is likely to move forward and stabilise her life.  In his view she was (at the end of September 2013) unfit for work but should be fit enough to start the process of returning to some form of work within six months of the completion of these proceedings.  He questions her ability to return to working at director level in a large corporate organisation since, as he says in his report, the demands of her employment at her former place of work were a significant factor in the development of her depression </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[2/F:80]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.

He submits that, even if the wife does not return to work at a comparable level of seniority to her last management position, she is quite able to earn an income from which she can support herself in comfort.  In view of my findings about the fairness of sharing the marital acquest in this case (and Mr Scott&#8217;s concession on behalf of the husband that this is the inevitable consequence if the marriage contract does not bite so as to exclude sharing), the wife&#8217;s future employment options will be very much a matter for her, just as they will be for the husband.  Each of these parties will have sufficient resources to live comfortably (but carefully) from capital if that is what they choose to do.  I suspect that the reality is that each will wish to pursue some form of remunerative employment or consultancy work, but the precise level of income which may be available in future from either of these sources is not something about which I need to make specific findings.  With some adjustment as necessary, needs will be met even if the husband decides to resign from his current position with the Bank, although I suspect that he will not take that course immediately.</span></p>

Notwithstanding the fact that his report was prepared as long ago as October 2013 (some nine months before this hearing), it has proved to be something of a work in progress.  By the third day of the hearing, it transpired from a series of overnight email exchanges that Mr Lane had been unaware from his original instructions that the husband&#8217;s case was that several of his accounts which had been assumed to contain &#8216;clean&#8217; capital were in fact funded by unremitted foreign income as opposed to capital gifts.  A revised schedule of tax liabilities was produced by Mr Lane which suggested an increased liability in the sum of &#163;1.896 million (in excess of &#163;500,000 over and above the figures on which we had been working when the case was opened from the foot of a largely agreed schedule).</span></p>

In his Form E sworn on 29 May 2013, the husband had set out details of his cash savings (&#163;2.654 million) and investments (&#163;2.686 million).  A very significant element of his investment portfolio is comprised of "B Bank" bonds and securities.  In addition he referred to two investments with "A Bank" and "C Bank", then, together, worth some &#163;213,330.  In his Form E, he explained that these investments were transferred into his name by his parents who continued to manage the investments on his behalf.  He had received no benefit from them and had always considered them to be earmarked for the future benefit of his parents, should they require financial assistance at some point in the future.  He was to accept in cross-examination that this description was not entirely accurate since there had never been a &#8216;transfer&#8217; of these assets, as such.  They were, he says, purchased by his parents using funds which they themselves had gifted to him.  In these circumstances, it is difficult to see how the A Bank and C Bank investments could be treated as unremitted foreign income, and the husband accepted this was unlikely to be the case.  He was later to explain during re-examination that the A Bank fund had been built up by his parents over many years and that he would struggle to provide a history of accretions to or withdrawals from the funds.  He said that his father had started tax planning and making distributions to each of his children from their births.  His best estimate of the provenance of funds in A Bank and C Bank was (i) gifts from his parents over the years; (ii) the earnings generated on those gifts; and (iii) rental incomes from the French property portfolio.  There had apparently been no attempt to segregate those accounts into income and/or capital deposits.  His parents had from time to time withdrawn funds which were properly incurred in relation to expenditure on the French property portfolios but they had never in the life of the funds had a direct financial benefit from the underlying investments.</span></p>

However, the funds which were invested at that point in time represented unremitted income, (ie. his surplus earnings from his years of employment with a previous bank).  There is nothing in the financial disclosure produced by the husband to date to demonstrate the provenance of these funds despite the fact that he had been asked a number of questions during the course of his financial disclosure as it developed in these proceedings.  Given the sums involved (in excess of &#163;2 million which is alleged to have been paid offshore over and above that paid by his previous employer into his offshore pension fund), I gave permission for the husband to speak to his legal team overnight in order that we might have some clarity in relation to the position.</span></p>

He believed that there may have been a significant element of &#8216;mixing&#8217; of funds with the result that even &#8216;clean&#8217; funds may have become &#8216;tainted&#8217; as a result of having been mixed with unremitted foreign income.  When re-examined by Mr Scott as to the sources of unremitted income which might have fed into his foreign investment accounts the husband told me that, as far as he could recollect, it was a mix of employment income and revenue from the accretion of capital value in the underlying assets.  He was able to identify three "N Bank" accounts and a "K Bank" 1 account (four accounts in total) which had been set up and segregated as &#8216;clean&#8217; capital accounts.  In relation to all the others, he had never kept records as he had not intended to remit the underlying funds to this jurisdiction since they had never been taxed as UK earnings, although earned in this jurisdiction.  In the context of these proceedings and the enquiries which had been made, he told me that he had never turned his mind to the tax treatment of these funds in the event that he might need to bring them onshore as part of the d&#233;nouement of these proceedings.  For the tax year 2013/2014, because of the distribution he had received from the EFURB, he had elected to pay tax on the remittance basis and thereby achieved a saving of some &#163;200,000.</span></p>

It is quite clear from Mr Lane&#8217;s original report produced in October 2013 that the impact of tax on the offshore funds held by both parties and the extent to which such funds could be remitted without incurring tax penalties were issues which were always going to be an important element of extraction in this case.  As long ago as the First Appointment (June 2013), directions were made which included consideration of the tax consequences of remitting offshore assets (including pensions) to the UK and the manner in which such tax might be avoided.  Those directions informed the entire scope of Mr Lane&#8217;s report (para 2.3.1).  He had sought from each of the parties further information about overseas income and gains accumulated since each became resident in the UK.  On the basis of the information he received, he had consulted with the French member of his firm&#8217;s international network, Ms Delphine Parigi.  In para 5.4 of his report, Mr Lane has dealt specifically with unremitted offshore income and gains in non-UK bank accounts and the restrictions in the manner in which the underlying funds might be dealt with in future without incurring additional tax penalties.  He even states :</span></p>

He identified three specific accounts and stated, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;I infer from this that his other non-UK savings accounts and investments may include unremitted and untaxed offshore income and gains.

Due to insufficient information, I am unable to quantify this potential liability at the present time&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  In para 7.7.1, he says of the B Bank investment portfolio (as distinct from the French life insurance policies), </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;I do not have full details of the base cost of these assets &#8230; and I have therefore relied on [H&#8217;s] own estimated calculation of the gain inherent on these policies (section 2.10 of his Form E) which he states does not take into account the effect of foreign exchange movements.  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">The actual taxable gain in respect of the other B Bank investments may therefore be materially higher or lower than that indicated in Appendix 3</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8217; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">(my emphasis).

On 17 October 2013, the husband&#8217;s solicitors wrote to clarify that Mr Lane&#8217;s assumption was correct and that his other non-UK savings accounts and investments included unremitted and untaxed offshore income and gains.  They asked for an estimate of the parameters of any additional income or capital gains tax liability which might arise in the event of a remittance of these funds to the UK.  They also corrected his previous assumption that the husband had not retained beneficial ownership of the A Bank and C Bank investments and pointed out that his French life insurance polcies (the Assu-Vie bonds) were financed from untaxed, unremitted foreign income.  By his response to that letter (also dated 17 October 2013), Mr Lane was able to make some adjustment to his original figures, reflected in an updated computation schedule, but he made it clear he would need a detailed breakdown of the historic unremitted income and gains in order to provide detail of all the inherent tax liabilities.  Whilst there was some further correspondence in the latter part of December 2013 between the solicitors and Mr Lane, it related in the main to the potential mitigation scheme referred to in the original report whereby assets might be transferred from the husband to the wife offshore and prior to Decree absolute.  </span></p>

During the period with which I am dealing, he has been employed in London by three separate banks.  He received remuneration for the work he did onshore and was paid in London.  Unless there was some other arrangement with his employers whereby part or all of his bonus entitlement was paid offshore (and there is no evidence before me to that effect), his income would have been taxed at source in the UK.  He has produced nothing to assist me with a history of his earnings over the relevant years other than the figures set out in paragraph 118 above.  Whilst they were not in the bundle, I am told that his French tax returns demonstrate that he has been paying tax on all income generated and declared in France.  Had these funds represented the product of one or a number of years bonus payments which H subsequently transferred (or which he asked his employers to pay) offshore, that would not have obviated a requirement for UK tax to have been paid on those earnings.  I am in some difficulty in accepting the husband&#8217;s explanation that he has nothing whatsoever which he can put before this court in order to assist with the answer to what his own leading counsel has described as a &#8216;conundrum&#8217;.  He is a sophisticated financial operator (and I say that with no disrespect to him); it is the inevitable consequence of the many successful years he has spent building the career he has enjoyed throughout the marriage.  I do not believe that he has deliberately concealed facts from this court, but I have to bear in mind that, as recently as 2008, he was engaged in an overall tax planning strategy which he hoped and anticipated would mitigate the fiscal consequences of the pending rule changes as they would affect him as a non-domiciled UK resident.</span></p>

The initial funds were provided by his parents many years ago as part of their own tax planning strategy.  He accepts he is entitled to the entire beneficial interest in those funds.  They may have been augmented over the years by payments in of rental income from the French property portfolio but that rent is fully taxable in France.  Whilst I have set out above the history of the disclosure of these matters to Mr Lane, I do not believe that the husband can be wholly absolved in relation to the consequent state of uncertainty with which I am left in reaching conclusions about the tax issues.  They are his liabilities and it is for him to establish on the balance of probabilities that the tax in the sums quantified by Mr Lane are likely to be paid in due course in the event that funds are remitted.</span></p>

Much will turn, I suspect, on the decisions which he makes in relation to remaining in employment over the course of the next four or five years.  However, I have to bear in mind that he has recently had to fund the purchase of his new home in West London and, unless there have been put in hand more tax efficient arrangements as to the ownership of this property about which I have not been told, that will inevitably have involved the transmission of funds to this jurisdiction.  It seems to me that, over and above that major expenditure, it is not possible for me at this stage to quantify with any degree of precision how the husband intends to manage his affairs once he has settled the wife&#8217;s outstanding claims.  I have no difficulty in finding that he will, in all likelihood, elect to leave funds offshore for so long as he can sustain his own domestic economy out of UK earnings.  I am also prepared to accept that the inevitable result of my finding that the marital acquest should be shared will leave him with less room to manoeuvre financially than would have been his position had he only had to find a sum of &#163;200,000.  I also bear in mind that the basis upon which the mainframe asset schedule has been presented assumes that, aside from the &#8216;new&#8217; liability of some &#163;500,000, tax has already been allowed for in relation to the non-pension assets.  These can be remitted without any further or additional tax penalty to him.  Further, the wife&#8217;s own non-domiciliary status as a UK resident will enable these parties to mitigate a significant element of the tax which would otherwise be payable.</span></p>

There may well be significant scope for negotiation with the Revenue in any event.  In this event, I suspect that the husband may well have greater incentive to construct a much more detailed trace of his income and the manner in which funds have been built up in the various offshore accounts.  For these reasons, I do not consider it would be unfair to either party to adopt the approach commended to me by Mr Leech in his closing submissions.   In computing the assets which fall to be divided in this case, I propose to work on the basis that the &#8216;new&#8217; liabilities calculated by Mr Lane in his latest figures can and should be discounted by 50%.  The tax which is not the subject of dispute has already been factored into the schedule on the basis of 100% of that liability.   </span></p>

The wife went with him to view the property because he did not wish to purchase the property without her first seeing it.  Almost immediately, she moved in and they began to live together as a couple.  She took up employment with  a telecommunications company at the beginning of September 1989.  She was aware that he had taken on a substantial mortgage to fund the purchase of the flat, although she was not a party to that transaction and was unaware of the precise details.  In her turn, she bought some furniture to enable them to move in.  She told me that she felt it was natural for her to wish to make a financial contribution towards their shared living expenses.  There were other items for which she paid during that two year period, including curtains, a new car, and holidays : all without contribution from the husband.</span></p>

He submits that the husband paid the deposit using non-matrimonial funds and he paid the mortgage throughout the life of its term until it was discharged in full.  Such financial contributions as the wife might have made do not entitle her to any share in the underlying equity of this property.    On her behalf, Mr Leech invites me to focus upon the position once they had moved to London after a little more than two years.  The mortgage funding represented 52.5% of the purchase price.  There is no live issue between the parties but that they were effectively cohabiting (or about to cohabit) at the time of purchase. Whilst it may have been a good investment for the husband at the time, I am satisfied that the primary purpose of its acquisition was to provide the parties with their first home in Paris.  During the time they lived there together, they became engaged and the wife became pregnant.  By the time they left the apartment, they were married.  In the years which followed, the mortgage was paid off.  Regardless of the fact that those payments might have come from a bank account in the husband&#8217;s name, they were being paid from earnings which represented part of the financial partnership to which each was contributing in his/her own way.  Whether or not the husband then, or now, would be prepared to characterise it as such, that is the consequence of my finding that the marital acquest in this case should be shared.  On this basis, I have discounted the value to be retained by the husband by 52.5% with the effect that only 47.5% will be excluded as non-matrimonial property.    </span></p>

She had been contributing to this fund for five years before the marriage.  It is conceded that 11/16 of the pension should be treated as matrimonial.   There is within the bundle a report from Smith &amp; Williamson which has been prepared by Miss Daniela Glover.  The husband contends for a value of &#163;400,000 on the basis of the cost to him (or any other third party) of purchasing an inflation linked annuity in the UK (1.6% per annum).  In other words, Mr Scott invites me to look at what it would be likely to cost in order to acquire a similar benefit were he to go out into the market tomorrow to purchase an annuity product.  His approach makes no allowance for any value &#8216;banked&#8217; in the fund by the wife in the years prior to the marriage.  Mr Leech advances a number of criticisms about the underlying assumptions adopted by Ms Glover in reaching her figures (para 50 of his skeleton argument) and, in terms of methodology, submits that the appropriate way to value this pension is to look at the actual value to the wife in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Duxbury </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">terms</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">.  </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">That produces, as I accept, a lower figure of &#163;215,000.</span></p>

Over and above the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Duxbury </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">computation, there is already an in-built benefit to the husband in the element of dependant&#8217;s pension which will be paid to him in the event of the wife&#8217;s death if he has not by then remarried.  Whilst I can see the intellectual basis of the argument advanced on behalf of the husband, it makes no provision for allowing credit to the wife for her pre-marital contributions of almost a third the value of the fund nor the potential benefit to him in the event she should predecease him.  If the husband is to be given credit for his pre-marital contribution to the Paris flat, it is in my view only fair to proceed on a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Duxbury </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">basis and allow her credit for her own unmatched contributions to this asset.  </span></p>

The wife relies on a lower figure of &#163;240,652 on the basis that they will be paid out over time against future income receipts and thus a discount of some 15% is appropriate.  These two schemes have respectively 8 and 9 years left to run.  The husband is unlikely, in my view, to be earning at the level he has been over the three years prior to this hearing whether or not he continues to be employed by the bank for the next three or four years.  He may or may not thereafter secure some consultancy work.  Nevertheless, I take the view that it is more likely than not that he will continue to earn throughout most of the period over which this liability will be discharged.  Against that, I weigh the possibility (and it is no more than that) that HMRC may decide to begin enquiries into either of these two schemes.  The husband has confirmed that there are presently no open enquires.  I also take account of the fact that income tax rates may rise to more than 45% in the future, but equally, they may fall.  In these circumstances, I take the view that a small discount is not only conventional but appropriate.  I have therefore worked upon the basis of the lower figure of &#163;240,652 as that which should be deducted from the available assets. </span></p>

The wife has a minimal entitlement of just over &#163;1,400 in terms of her own shares.

I do not set them out here because to do so would be to overburden an already lengthy judgment.  Looking at the chronology of these proceedings, it seems to me tolerably clear that by February 2011 at the latest, when the wife issued her supplemental Petition, this marriage had all but irretrievably broken down.  Despite the parties&#8217; continuing attempts over the next few months to explore the possibility of repairing their relationship, those attempts came to naught.  Whilst they did continue to occupy separate bedrooms under the same roof for the next three years, there is nothing in the evidence which suggests to me that there was any community in their joint living arrangements and certainly not one which would suggest any ongoing contribution </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">qua spouse</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> on the wife&#8217;s part.  This is no criticism whatsoever of her; she was continuing to play a significant role in terms of the children&#8217;s care, but, had the husband acceded to her wishes, he would have moved out long before the hearing with which I was dealing.  Mr Leech referred in his submission to the fact that she continued to do some cooking for the family.  In my view, the most that can be said is that the deferred awards which might have vested in March 2014 might be susceptible to some form of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Wells </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">sharing arrangement.  Since there were none, there is nothing to share.  Those which will fall in in Mar 2015 to 2017 represent, in my view, an unmatched contribution by the husband.</span></p>

To an extent, the husband&#8217;s retention of their value without further claim by the wife goes some way to mitigate my approach in relation to the tax issues.  It represents a fair way to deal with sums of up to &#163;200,000 (maybe more or less) which will represent fully taxed income in his hands onshore at the point of receipt. It takes due and proper account of the lengthy demise of this marriage within the context of several years of continuing (non-marital) cohabitation.

As to the cost of her university fees for the coming academic year, I heard a great deal of evidence about the wife&#8217;s plans for the future and her commitment to this next stage of her life.  I have already made a number of findings in terms of her reasons for leaving her previous employment and she told me in the course of her oral evidence about the remaining hurdles she has to overcome before she can embark upon her course.  I am confident that these are procedural only and that she will be in a position to take up her place.  In these circumstances, I propose to allow a sum of &#163;9,000 as an existing liability on her side of the balance sheet. </span></p>

She accepts, candidly, that she adopted a similar figure to that advanced by the husband in respect of his own expenditure on moving into and kitting out his new property.  She told me about a particular problem involving fumes entering the building from an underground car park.  This appears to be a long-standing issue and she was not challenged on the need (if not the cost) for some remedial work to rectify the problem.  In addition, I have had the opportunity to look at several photographs depicting the internal state of the property which does not appear to have had much spent on it since its acquisition some 16 years ago.</span></p>

The extraction schedule was amended to reflect his submission (which I have accepted) that the appropriate way to resolve the tax &#8216;conundrum&#8217; with which we were left after the evidence had closed was to discount Mr Lane&#8217;s figures by 50% to reflect the uncertainty.  When Mr Leech had concluded his final submissions late in the day on Friday (Day 5), Mr Scott sought to make various points in relation to the figures.  I ruled that this was, in effect, an attempt to reopen evidence on matters of fact after common agreement that the evidence had closed.  It will be recalled that I gave the husband permission to consult with his legal team notwithstanding that he was in the middle of his evidence in an attempt to secure some further clarity in relation to the tax treatment of the offshore assets and, in particular, their provenance.  He was unable to take matters any further in terms of the clarification I had sought when he returned to the witness box the following day, and that was where matters stood when counsel began their closing submissions to me.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The following week, I received from Mr Scott a further copy of the extraction schedule which contained a number of comments which related to tax and which appeared in blue.  These had been added by the husband and appeared to be an attempt by him to revisit issues concerning the provenance of the offshore funds and the likely impact on tax.  The matters he raises are not, in essence, new evidence but a repetition and/or expansion of matters on which he had already given evidence.  He provided no further corroboration or documents.  Had he done so, I might have been receptive to an application for permission to adduce further evidence in advance of handing down my judgment.   The commentary which the husband makes raises no error in terms of Mr Leech&#8217;s mathematics or formulae.  As Mr Scott concedes in his covering email to me, the husband&#8217;s main concern is the fact that full allowance is made for all latent tax on the wife&#8217;s investments whilst leaving the husband with substantial potential tax liabilities.  In fact, this is </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">not</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> what Mr Leech&#8217;s extraction schedule does.  It provides for the vast majority of the potential tax which relates to the &#8216;new&#8217; liabilities (assessed on the basis of a 50% discount) to be &#8216;washed out&#8217; by a payment to the wife of a balancing sum / transfer of assets offshore.  It goes on to demonstrate, in terms of the net effect of the proposed redistribution of assets, that the husband would retain &#8216;clean&#8217; assets of &#163;1.642 million which remain available onshore without any further tax liability, such liability having been accepted and incorporated into the first schedule produced on Day 1 of the hearing.  It assumes that the Assu-Vie policies will not be remitted (and therefore no tax will be payable), but that assumption flows in no small part from the husband&#8217;s own evidence during the course of the hearing.  I have dealt at some length with the taxation issues earlier in this judgment and my findings in relation to the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence which was before the court.  I have also dealt with where the burden of responsibility for that state of affairs must lie and, whilst I do not hold the husband entirely responsible for the situation, he must clearly shoulder part of the responsibility for the fact that I was left with the tax &#8216;conundrum&#8217;.  There was at no stage any application by him to adjourn the hearing in order that further enquiries could be put in hand, and I doubt whether such an application would have been productive of further information in any event.</span></p>

His submissions on the penultimate day of the hearing went primarily to the issue of the quantification of the tax issues in the light of the eleventh hour revised calculations from Mr Lane.  He did not join issue with Mr Leech in terms of the &#8216;mitigation&#8217; issue :  in other words, the ability which lies in the hands of these parties to &#8216;wash out&#8217; the &#8216;new&#8217; tax liabilities by a payment offshore to the wife.  On the basis of the net effect of the wife&#8217;s proposals after tax mitigation, she will be receiving a lump sum payment from the husband of &#163;1,661,139 (&#163;454,671 from N Bank and &#163;1,206,468 from B Bank/K Bank 2).  It seems to me that, on this basis, (i) the tax of &#163;204,602 on the N Bank funds (as assessed by Mr Lane) can be properly neutralised, and (ii) given the extent of the balancing payment required from the B Bank investments, the maximum tax exposure of &#163;563,703 is entirely absorbed.  To that extent, whether one discounts the tax by 50% or by some lesser percentage, it may matter not.</span></p>

I accept that there is an underlying precision in the figures which flow from paragraph 12 into the illustrative breakdown which is presented in terms of net effect in paragraphs 13 and 14.  However, the only amendments which flow, thus far, from my judgment in terms of the analysis at paragraphs 13 and 14 of the extraction schedule (which I propose to incorporate by reference as part of this judgment) is the deletion from paragraph 13 of entry (d) being the wife&#8217;s receipt in due course of notional funds from the deferred awards in the sum of &#163;99,932.

The wife will be just less than &#163;100,000 short of her target extraction figure but, in my judgment, a very small departure from a position of overall equality properly reflects the fact that (i) her onshore cash reserves will be greater than those of the husband, and (ii) he will have some improved flexibility to deal with the tax which might in future arise should he elect (contrary to his current intentions) to transfer part of the Assurance Vie funds to this jurisdiction.  I am also conscious of the fact that the likelihood is that over the course of the next three to four years, this husband is likely to be in a position to make further capital provision from his income, should he choose to do so.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In terms of sharing the offshore pensions, the husband has said that it will be necessary to obtain the approval of the Jersey Court to any pension sharing order before the order can be implemented in relation to his offshore pension.  The trustees have already indicated that they would probably comply with an order of this court.  That is encouraging news and steps should now be taken to ascertain whether or not the trustees&#8217; approval is likely to be forthcoming.  No doubt mirror orders can be secured in the Jersey court prior to any final sealing of orders in the English court.</span></p>

In essence, the wife seeks &#163;25,000 per annum in terms of child support for their youngest child until she commences tertiary education, reducing to one-third of that sum (&#163;8,333 per annum) as a &#8216;roofing allowance&#8217; once she is in university.  She seeks similar provision for each of the two elder children in terms of a roofing allowance.  It appears to be accepted that the husband will meet the costs of the children&#8217;s secondary and tertiary education.  </span></p>

Notwithstanding the proximity of their new homes, the reality is that it is the wife who will be providing the day to day infrastructure of their younger daughter&#8217;s life with all the consequent expense which comes with that responsibility.  I hope and expect that she will continue to spend time in each of her parents&#8217; homes, but the preponderance of the burden of arranging her school and social routine is likely to fall upon the wife&#8217;s shoulders.  I take into account the fact that the wife will have independent wealth of her own as a result of the order which will flow from this judgment.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond"/><span style="font-family:Garamond">My view is that an appropriate figure for the husband to be contributing in terms of child support whilst their youngest child in in secondary education is &#163;20,000 per annum.  That is a sum which I am satisfied can be afforded from his current income.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond"/><span style="font-family:Garamond">It is a fair reflection of the broad division of responsibilities which these parents have agreed.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">As to the contribution which the wife seeks towards the &#8216;roofing&#8217; element of the two elder children, I heard very little about the manner in which these young adults propose to divide their time between their parents&#8217; homes in future.  They will inevitably have their own friends and social lives.  The husband&#8217;s position is that he would wish to be left in a position whereby he can deal with the children directly as to their financial arrangements in tertiary education.  The wife&#8217;s open offer refers to previous difficulties in agreeing a regular contribution to their support.  My provisional view is that the husband&#8217;s relationship with each of his children is such that he can, and will, make financial arrangements directly with each of them once they are in tertiary education, as the two elder children already are.  There should be some residual provision towards the costs of the home which the wife will continue to provide for them, notwithstanding the proximity of their father who will open his doors to them, as I have no doubt, in the new home he has just acquired.  The &#8216;roofing element&#8217; payable to the wife should, in my view, not exceed &#163;5,000 per annum for each of the children in tertiary education.  Over and above this provision which should be paid directly to the wife for their benefit, I am entirely satisfied that this husband (and father) will make appropriate financial provision for each of his children in tertiary education.  Those arrangements can, and should be, the subject of direct discussions between the parents and their children. </span></p>

I am entirely satisfied that the order which I shall make (from the foot of my findings and my acceptance of the underlying structure of the extraction schedule which was before the court) is entirely fair to both parties and meets the requirements of the statutory considerations which I must address as they flow from <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.  Because of the basis on which I have resolved this application, it has not been necessary for me to move to an assessment of the wife&#8217;s needs </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">simpliciter</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  I have found that this is a sharing case and, as such, the sums which will be made available to each of these parties at the conclusion of these proceedings will provide more than adequately for the future needs of each of them.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond"/><span style="font-family:Garamond">I conclude this judgment by saying only that, even if I had been persuaded that this wife should be held to the strict terms of the marriage contract (and I make it quite clear that, on the basis of the evidence before me and my findings of fact, that would not have been the result in this litigation), I would nevertheless have found the husband&#8217;s offer to be deficient in terms of this wife&#8217;s needs.  The analysis of those deficiencies is not something which I need to explore any further.</span></p>

I am also grateful to the parties.  It was very clear to me that, at times, the hearing presented each with a significant emotional challenge.   That they were able to assist me in the consistently courteous way they did is testament to the very particular attributes which each of these two individuals possess, both as parties and as parents to three delightful and much loved children. </span></p>
