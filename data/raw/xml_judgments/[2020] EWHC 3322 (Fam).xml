I have no doubt that Miss Atabo has been served with the relevant documents and notice of today&#8217;s hearing. In the Order dated 2 November 2020 Miss Atabo&#8217;s attendance at today&#8217;s hearing was expressly required. The order provided for service by email given that personal service is extremely difficult to effect in Lagos. The relevant email address is one that has been used by her on a number of occasions and on which she has had no difficulty receiving emails. The Order of 2 November 2020 was sent to that email address by the court on 3 November 2020 and all relevant documents were sent to that email address. In light of that history I have no doubt she has been properly served with documents including the notice of today&#8217;s hearing. </p>

The person or persons affected must know with complete precision what it is that they are required to do or abstain from doing. It is not possible to imply terms into an injunction. The first task for the judge hearing an application for committal for alleged breach of a mandatory (positive) order is to identify, by reference to the express language of the order, precisely what it is that the order required the defendant to do.

However, before this hearing he swore an affidavit dated 17 November 2020 which exhibited the earlier witness statements and confirmed their truth. So that earlier evidence has now been made on oath and that plainly meets the requirement of r.37.4(1).

By an Order dated 13 May 2020, Mr Justice MacDonald forbade her from applying for a new UK passport, and the Nigerian High Commission was requested not to issue a Nigerian passport, but despite those provisions, and despite both Mr Justice MacDonald and then I, refusing to allow her to return to Nigeria, she left the UK in late July 2020 to return to Nigeria by means unknown. </p>

I engaged with the Respondent, hoping she would confirm that she would obey the Court Order. During the call, the Respondent made it clear that the passports would not be handed over and that she would take her chances at the committal hearing in September. She tried to discourage me from going ahead with the committal application. I made it clear she was the reason for the court proceedings, and she must instruct her lawyer to hand over Nizana&#8217;s passports. The Respondent suggested mediation. I made it clear that I was willing to engage with mediation when Nizana is back to the UK as ordered by the Court&#8221;. </span></p>

Although the evidence is absolutely overwhelming in respect of breach of the order of 21 July 2020, it is also beyond reasonable doubt that she is in breach of the Order 10 June 2020. </p>

She is a lawyer herself and, if she had seriously intended to comply, I have no doubt she would have given written instructions to her lawyers and no such written instructions have been produced. Furthermore, as is clear from the chronology, although she has not attended today, she has produced evidence since the orders were made and yet she has not produced evidence of any such written instructions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is also the case that Mr Emoni went to Nigeria in August in an attempt to bring Nizana back and if there had been the slightest intention on the part of the Respondent to comply with the Orders 10 June and 21 July it could easily have been done. In fact, Mr Emoni says in his affidavit dated 17 November 2020 that when he attended the maternal grandmother&#8217;s house in Lagos to meet his daughter in August 2020, he was told that the Respondent had taken possession of their daughter and was no longer in the house. I am satisfied he was unable to return to the UK with his daughter because he did not have her passports and did not know where in Lagos she had been taken. </p>

I therefore find breach of those Orders. </p>
