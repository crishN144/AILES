	    <p style="text-align:justify">This judgment was delivered in private on 10 September 2021 and was then subject to a total embargo on its publication pending the resolution of anticipated criminal proceedings against the First Respondent and the Intervener. On 21 April 2022 the First Respondent was charged with causing or allowing the death of Lola James, and the Intervener was charged with her murder. </p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">Their trial began at the Crown Court at Swansea on 7 March 2023 before Mr Justice Griffiths and a jury. This court has been provided with a list of witnesses who gave evidence to the Crown Court either orally or by having their witness statement read to the jury.  The criminal trial lasted for 4 weeks.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">On 4 April 2023 they were each found guilty as charged. On 25 April 2023 the First Respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years, half of which period must be served before she can be considered for release on parole. The Intervener was sentenced to imprisonment for life with a minimum period to be served of 28 years before release on licence can be considered.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The proceedings which are the subject of this judgment have the protection of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref>. Mr Justice Mostyn  has decided, having weighed the competing rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, that if a person named in this judgment, other than an expert witness, did not give evidence in public in the criminal trial (either orally or by having their witness statement read to the jury), then such a person is entitled to anonymity. This includes the Fifth Respondents, the sisters of Lola James.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The judge therefore gives leave for this version of the judgment to be published subject to a strict condition that where a person is identified by initials, his or her identity must not be revealed in any report of the proceedings before this Court. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with.   Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">Nothing in this direction affects the right of the media to report the criminal proceedings, subject to any reporting restrictions made in them.</p>

There was no dispute as to the welfare outcome. It is agreed that the court should be invited to make final care orders under which IY and VH should be cared for and brought up by the mother&#8217;s own mother Nicola James, and that they should have supervised contact with the mother and with their respective fathers.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

In contrast, the mother does not accept that she knew, or ought to have known, that Mr Bevan posed a risk of significant physical harm to the children.

Something happened which triggered a frenzied attack by him on her. What it was we will never know, because the only person who does know is Mr Bevan and he is not saying. The attack was swift, furious and extremely violent. The initial blows rendered Lola instantly unconscious so that she did not cry out.

Both are likely to have been the result of a single event which occurred at some point in Lola&#8217;s life before 3 July 2020.

Ms Williams, counsel for IY and VH, has focussed on five injuries which clearly could not have been caused by a fall down the stairs. They are: injury No. 7 (three puncture wounds to bruise on central forehead); injury No. 28 (bruising to the neck); injury No. 30 (bruising to the inner helix of the left ear); and injuries Nos. 58 and 61 (two parallel linear bruises on the right thigh). These injuries just cannot by any stretch of the imagination be explained by a fall down the stairs.

She was an excellent witness answering each question whenever she could either yes or no and not being afraid to make concessions. Her description of the hair-trigger volatility of Mr Bevan, of his drug dependency, of his abuse, threats and violence, all ring very true. The picture that she painted of her own son treating her with such contempt and malevolence was truly disturbing.</p>

It is clear that the relationship was extremely volatile, involving much misuse of drugs (to which Mr Bevan introduced HM) which in turn led to repeated arguments and altercations. HM described to me how Mr Bevan was controlling and violent, and seemed to become ever more abusive to her as the pregnancy progressed. She recounted an incident when she went for a shower, left a bottle for E in the room for Mr Bevan to feed her with, and returned to find he had turned their room upside down. She described how the sound of E crying flicked a switch in him: in response he would punch walls and kick doors. On two occasions the police were called. She described how the arguments were incessant. </p>

I was frightened to go into his company. I had seen him be violent on a couple of occasions. The main incident I saw of Kyle being violent was one Christmas, I can&#8217;t remember what year, about 5 years ago. I was down the bus stop with IY funnily enough and Kyle was off his head on something, I don&#8217;t know what it was, and he approached 5 different people in the public bus stop and was violently trying to fight with them, throwing punches, punching the bus stop, so I rung the police and he was arrested, the police officers had to restrain him because he was very aggressive. I don&#8217;t know what he was on.</p>

I felt he wasn&#8217;t safe to be around her and the children, she chose to ignore that and he threatened me when I warned her. &#8230; The way he turned on adults, if you can do that to an adult you can do it to children.

I told her to hurry up, leave the house and get to mine. Sinead then tried calling me 3 times to let me know Kyle was walking up to mine with her.

He came in to the house, went through the living room into the kitchen, grabbed the fags and walked out. VH was still outside in the pram on her own. Kyle got outside, I could see he was off his face on drugs. He shouted "fuck it" and pushed VH in the pram into the road. He didn't care, he just pushed it. I had no clue what was going on then I saw Sinead coming round the corner with Lola. Sinead jumped onto the road and grabbed the pram, she walked up to mine and came inside the house. At this point Kyle was at the bottom of the road. I watched him, he was sweating, foaming round the mouth. I grabbed my fags from the living room. Sinead walked through the house and sat in the living room. Within seconds Kyle walked in through the living room and into the kitchen. He was loud, pacing. I shut the living room door and told Sinead "get him out of my house now". There was awkward tension between Kyle and Sinead but no arguments. </p>

She sat on the floor and watched me, she would not move or leave my side. Normally she's pulling my curtains down or grabs a yoghurt from the fridge but not on that occasion. Kyle was still going on saying Sinead didn't want sex with him that morning. He said "before it gets blown out of proportion, yes I did go to grab Sinead around the throat.

Indeed, in an inadvertent slip in the course of the furious exchanges Mr Bevan admitted that he had posed as the mother. In the course of the exchanges the mother made it abundantly clear to Mr Bevan that the relationship was over and that he should get out of the lives of her and the children and leave the house. The argument continued until 7 July 2020, its iteration on that day immediately preceding the events described in para 65 above. At 09:20 Mr Bevan messaged the mother saying:</p>

I reject his story that the dog knocked Lola off the sofa onto the coffee table. He admitted that the event took place in the middle of the night and that he had been taking drugs. In a message to the mother on 11 July 2020 at 16:20 Mr Bevan stated &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t watching her on sofa I was getting her a yoghurt&#8221;. The configuration of the dwelling is such that there is no view of the living room from the kitchen. They are separated by a corridor. Under cross-examination he admitted that he did not see the dog push Lola off the sofa. He stated &#8220;but you can hear the footprints really easily.&#8221;</p>

Once inside Mr Bevan was exceedingly hostile and obstructive to, and truculent and non-cooperative with, the officers. He would not even give his name. He claimed not to live at the property. PC RM describes him in a call to the police station as &#8220;very obstructive&#8221;. Mr Tillyard QC fairly points out that within about 20 minutes Mr Bevan is laughing and joking with the officers.

She also repeatedly said that she did not like confrontation and would avoid this whenever possible, stating that confrontation had made her feel frightened and scared. She would therefore merely accept the demands, needs, or unreasonable behaviour of other people around her, reportedly submitting to what they wished  her to do (e.g. taking amphetamine despite this repeatedly making her feel ill and vomit;  drinking alcohol when she reportedly did not really want to; passively accepting Mr Bevan&#8217;s  refusal to provide his personal details for her domestic violence advocate to be able to complete background checks upon him, etc). These personality characteristics of submissiveness and avoidance of confrontation are not what are needed when one has to stand up to a potentially violent, aggressive, or manipulative new or existing partner. However, in my opinion, Ms James most probably did not fully understand this and had instead formed short-term decisions and had acted upon whatever was happening at the material time, taking the route of least resistance. </p>

His prison sentences had included one of 42 months for grievous bodily harm committed on 4 June 2015.

By July 2019 the mother was claiming to the health visitor that her relationship with SH was over and that he had returned to his hometown of Swansea. However, the relationship was soon rekindled. Reports indicated that it was blighted by violence and abuse. There were suspicions that drugs were being supplied from the family home. Things reached a head on 4 January 2020. On that occasion the mother, SH and the three children went to Nicola James&#8217;s home to celebrate Nicola&#8217;s birthday. Other than SH the participants were all women. SH drank heavily all day and became extremely violent and abusive; it would not be an exaggeration to say that he went berserk. He smashed up the house, assaulted at least one of the women, made threats to kill and, once the police had arrived, resisted arrest and had to be handcuffed and bodily removed from the premises. </p>

On 21 July 2020 the mother spoke to a social worker, CM, about this injury. I am satisfied that the mother suspected at the time that the injury was non-accidental.</p>

He alleged that the mother also took amphetamine although he accepted that he did not actually see her doing so.</p>

IY and Lola were downstairs with Mr Bevan. The children changed into pink fairy dresses. Lola put sticky transfers on her arms. Between 22:24 and 23:02 Mr Bevan took 13 photographs of the children. Some of these he then photoshopped. The photographs show the children colouring-in or otherwise playing. In none of them do they appear to have any fear of Mr Bevan.

The evidence shows quite clearly that this was a new search by Mr Bevan. However, his case is that this was not a new search but was an old search which had not been closed but which he revisited in passing when attempting to Google what he should do when a baby was unconscious. His evidence was that by 06:18 Lola had already fallen down the stairs and was unconscious and that he was attempting to find out what to do on Google. The problem with this story is that a full 14 minutes elapses between the tattoo search at 06:18 and 06:32 when Mr Bevan found and clicked on <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Loss of Consciousness</span> within HealthyChildren.org.

I am myself satisfied that a fall by Lola down the short flight of 13 carpeted steps, the momentum of which would have been broken, and to some extent cushioned, by her clattering into the buggy, could not conceivably have resulted in those injuries to her. I have detailed the appalling extent of the external injuries in Appendix 4, to which must be added the injuries to the brain and the full extent of the injuries to the eyes. Whilst I do not have specialist knowledge in biomechanics it is obvious to me that the injuries taken as a whole simply could not have happened as a result of a domestic accident of that nature. I accept that it would be unusual, to say the least, for a judge to reach such a conclusion independently of assistance from skilled experts. However, the view which I have reached is unanimously and categorically supported by the expert evidence, to which I turn in the next section of this judgment.</p>

In the first interview IY says she heard &#8220;tumbling&#8221; which sounded like music. She signified that the sound had a rhythmic quality. However, there are many aspects to IY&#8217;s account which are obviously wrong. For example she says that her mother found Lola lying on the floor and that the event took place when it was dark. In the second interview she repeated that she heard Lola tumbling down the stairs. She also stated that she had seen Mr Bevan &#8220;slam&#8221; Lola in bed and bump her head on the top bunk. In both interviews she repeated things that her mother had told her.</p>

It&#8217;s the pattern of the injuries and their extent. The pattern of the injuries to the brain and the eyes in the medical professionals experience requires a transmission to the body of very high energy. So lots of energy to be transmitted. And if we are dealing with differentiating accidents for example in a domestic environment, e.g. falling down the stairs in the context of having some interaction with the dog, you need to take into account the laws of physics. A body falling down will receive from an impact the energy which is in line with the height from where it fell and the mass of the body. The two bodies combine when they fall together down. This amount of energy would not have been sufficient to the injuries we see to the brain and to the eyes in particular. So those in the optic nerve sheath, the muscles around the eye, the fat around the eye, this type of injuries we get them when there is very high amount of energy transmitted to the body, and we compare it to a fall from a significant height, when we say we are talking about falling from a first or second floor balcony to the ground, or a road traffic collision: that&#8217;s the amount of energy you need to get these types of injuries to the brain and the eyes.&#8221;</p>

A CT scan   performed approximately 4 hours later revealed extensive subdural haemorrhage on   the left side of the brain, ischaemia in multiple locations, worse on the left than the right, and midline shift due. Lola also had bilateral retinal haemorrhages and   extensive bruising and skin marks over her head, neck, torso, arms, hands, legs, feet, back and buttocks. Lola&#8217;s intracranial injuries progressed over the next few days. Lola died of her brain injuries on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2020.  </p>

It may be because the process of the fall, the falling from a certain height and then hitting a step and falling again, that process is cushioning the fall. So you may get lots of injuries, but they might not be too severe. Our experience would suggest they are not. That&#8217;s not to suggest you can&#8217;t die falling down the stairs, we know you can.

In his opinion the acute neuropathological findings, particularly the acute subdural haematoma/haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhage, may be explained by head impacts with or without movement trauma. In Dr Herron&#8217;s experience, in a child of Lola&#8217;s age, with no history of abnormal coagulation, abnormal brain development or relevant medical condition, this is the most accepted cause. The findings are all recent and consistent with having occurred around the time of Lola&#8217;s admission to hospital. There is no older brain injury.</p>

In his opinion the appearances on the scans can only be explained by impact injury to the head, resulting in scalp haematoma at the site of impact.  The impact injury was forceful enough to provoke extensive subdural bleeding and some subarachnoid bleeding.  There was a significant amount of cerebral swelling as a result of the head injury. The swelling progressed over the course of the scan series reaching a point where the normal cerebrospinal fluid spaces around the midbrain had been lost due to compression from the surrounding structures.   </p>

Most cases of such a fall do not result in significant injury and do not require hospitalisation. On the balance of probabilities, Dr Hogarth is of the opinion that a fall down a flight of stairs would be unlikely to result in the head injuries Lola sustained which were so severe as to prove fatal.</p>

As to timing the relevant experts agreed (Dr McPartland deferring) that she is likely to have collapsed immediately after the last severe traumatic event.  In relation to mechanism, they agreed that impact was the more likely and predominant cause but there may have been shaking as well. </p>

When looking at the photographs at K149-163 Dr Solman stated that they would be consistent with a fall onto the edge of a table.  On the basis of the photographs in the phone records she did not appear to have any other visible bruising prior to midnight on 16 July 2020.</p>

On the balance of probabilities, in their opinion the injuries are inflicted injuries caused by severe trauma.</p>

The conclusions are unanimous. Each expert concludes, from her or his own specialised knowledge base, that on the balance of probability the injuries suffered by Lola were non-accidental. The probabilistic assessment by each expert varies. Some are more sure than others. But each is satisfied that it is more likely than not that Lola&#8217;s injuries were abusively inflicted. It is a formidable body of opinion. In my judgment it would be perverse of the court not to follow it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">DR</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">A former friend of Sinead James, although they had fallen out by July 2020. Gave evidence about her interactions with Kyle Bevan, who had supplied cannabis to her. Said she could not &#8216;work him out&#8217;, and that she thought he had taken an instant dislike to her. Explained he had sent her a text calling her a cunt on the day Lola went into hospital and said she had fallen out with him because he was nasty to her when he asked her for cigarette butts and she didn&#8217;t have any to give him. Said that she missed Sinead James and the children, with whom she had spent a lot of time before they fell out. She had noticed circular marks on Lola after Christmas 2020, which Sinead James had shown her. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">GH</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">A neighbour of Sinead James. 50% deaf in one ear and 25% deaf in the other. Heard knocking on the party wall between his house and Sinead James&#8217; house on the evening of 15 July 2020 and also on the evening of 16 July 2020. On both evenings also heard music playing at Sinead James&#8217; house. On 16 July 2020 he also heard muffled shouting through the wall. However, on both evenings he had headphones on and was listening to music. Woke up naturally on the morning of 17 July 2020 just before 06.00 and did not hear anything from Sinead James&#8217; house early that morning (and was not wearing headphones that morning). </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">Casey-Leigh Morgan</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">A former friend of Sinead James who also lived on Princess Royal Way. They lost contact after Lola&#8217;s death. Did not like Kyle Bevan and noted his drug use and controlling behaviour. Felt Sinead James was with Kyle Bevan because she felt she needed protection after her relationship with SH. Noted that by April 2020, Sinead James was drunk quite often, and that before that she used to drink alcopops, but by that point was drinking spirits. On 10 May 2020, she had held a birthday party for VH, who had a black eye, and on 9 July 2020 she saw the injury to Lola&#8217;s nose. In June 2020, Sinead James phoned her at 22:00 one night screaming at that that she had to get the children after her and Kyle Bevan had had an argument, but once Sinead James had seen she had taken the children in she returned to Kyle Bevan. She and her partner, Mark John, offered to get Kyle Bevan out of Sinead James&#8217; house. Several times Kyle Bevan would not let Lola have a sleepover at her house although IY and VH would do so, and Lola was clearly his favourite. Said that Sinead James&#8217; choice of men was not good and that she was easily led. Often the children were dirty. Often there were soiled nappies in Sinead James&#8217; home. Kyle Bevan once pushed VH in her pram into the road. On the morning of 17 July 2020 she went to Sinead James&#8217; home and was told by Sinead she did not know what had happened and that she had just got out of bed when she arrived and was in a state of shock. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">Shaun Lyndest James</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">Sinead James&#8217; cousin. Gave evidence about the fact the door on the fridge-freezer at Sinead James&#8217; home had been pulled off its hinges, which Sinead James said IY had done. Said Kyle Bevan had continued to try to put teething gel inside VH&#8217;s mouth even when she did not want it. Said Sinead James&#8217; house was filthy. Drove Sinead James to from Withybush General Hospital to the University Hospital of Wales on 17 July 2020 and could overhear conversations Sinead James had on the phone with Kyle Bevan. Said Sinead James said she didn&#8217;t want people to see the house in the state it was in and asked Kyle Bevan to clean up dog mess on the upstairs landing. Did not hear Sinead James ask Kyle Bevan what happened or any questions to that effect. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">SD</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">Sinead James&#8217; maternal aunt and mother to Shaun James. Gave evidence about having to pick Sinead James up from SH&#8217; father&#8217;s flat in Swansea on 3 February 2020 at 01:00 when Sinead James asked her to come and get her. Explained that Sinead James got a taxi to Carmarthen and that she picked her up from there. Went to Sinead James&#8217; house on the morning of 17 July 2020 and drove her from her home to Withybush General Hospital. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">Lynda Patricia Hughes</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">Sinead James&#8217; maternal aunt. Did not like the way Sinead James was living in terms of the mess in her home and her boyfriends. Gave evidence about arranging a taxi to pick Sinead James up from SH&#8217; father&#8217;s flat on 3 February 2020 at 01:00 when Sinead James asked SD to come and get her. Saw Lola in the park on 16 July 2020. Did not notice any bruising on Lola. Noticed that Sinead James had chipped a tooth and had said she dropped her phone on her face and chipped it. Said Sinead James&#8217; house was untidy. Explained Kyle Bevan had been very aggressive towards her on the morning of 17 July 2020. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">BH</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">Friend of Sinead James and former partner of Casey-Leigh Morgan. Said Kyle Bevan in around June 2020 had come to Casey-Leigh Morgan&#8217;s house and ranted that Sinead James would not have sex with him. Said on the same day, Kyle Bevan had picked VH up and had hit the tumble dryer, which looked like an accident. Used to take cannabis with Kyle Bevan. Saw Kyle Bevan take amphetamines out of Sinead James&#8217; fridge-freezer. Felt Kyle Bevan was controlling Sinead James. Noted a bruise to Lola&#8217;s nose in July 2020. Said Sinead James had told him that she did not mind Kyle Bevan dealing cannabis. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">CM</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">Sinead James&#8217; social worker. Allocated to Sinead James as a result of a referral from the Head of Service who had supported Sinead James to take her to see Lola in hospital. Her first intervention in the case was on 22 July 2020 when she went to the hospital and saw Sinead James and Nicola James. Sinead James repeatedly said she had done nothing wrong and said she wanted to take Kyle Bevan to see Lola to show him what he had done. Said Sinead James said she had been prescribed sleeping tablets but that she had never taken them and instead Kyle Bevan took them. Gave evidence that when Sinead James was told Lola had died she did not cry and that often Sinead James did not react physically in a way she would expect. Also gave evidence about Lola&#8217;s funeral and the fact Sinead James did not attend it, but had a separate service the night before the funeral. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">HM</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">Gave evidence about her relationship with Kyle Bevan, with whom she has a daughter, Evie. The relationship was abusive. Kyle Bevan introduced her to drugs, which she started taking. Said Kyle Bevan was never sober and was always on drugs. Described living with Kyle Bevan at a hostel, during which time the police were called twice. Recounted an incident when she went for a shower, left a bottle for Evie in the room for Kyle Bevan to feed her with, and returned to find Kyle Bevan had turned their room upside down. Explained the sound of Evie crying turned a switch on in Kyle Bevan and he would punch walls and kick doors. Also said Kyle Bevan would hound his mother for money and spoke to his mother in a &#8216;disgusting&#8217; way. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">ME</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">Father of Sinead James. Did not like Kyle Bevan as a result of his drug-taking and behaviour towards his mother. Said he had seen Kyle Bevan taking amphetamines in front of Sinead James but never in front of the children, and that Kyle Bevan would take a quarter of an ounce of amphetamine a day. Warned Sinead James about having a relationship with Kyle Bevan. Explained the dog at Sinead James&#8217; home had been his dog, Jess, an American bulldog, which he had given IY. Said Jess was brilliant with children and had been trained. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">EM</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">Grandmother of Casey-Leigh Morgan. Attended Casey-Leigh Morgan&#8217;s house on 9 July 2020 and saw Lola with an injury to her nose (which she was told the dog caused) and bruises to the side of her neck. Advised Sinead James to take Lola to the doctor to have her nose looked at, but said Kyle Bevan said that was not necessary and Sinead James said they had already done that. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">Tracey Taylor</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">Next door neighbour of Sinead James along with her husband and 18 year old daughter. Slept downstairs on her sofa, in her living room (which attaches to the hallway of Sinead James&#8217; house), on the night of 16-17 July 2020. Suffers from mental health problems and takes a variety of drugs, which cause her to fall into deep sleep. On the night of 16-17 July 2020 only took half the usual dose of her drugs, between 20:00 and 22:00. Something woke her up at about 06:00 or 07:00 in the morning but she did not take any notice of it, as she didn&#8217;t know what it was and it was not an alarming noise, and went back to sleep until 09:00. Her husband also takes strong medication for his mental health and sleeps very deeply but neither he nor her daughter said they heard anything on the morning of the incident. Said the walls of the properties were paper thin and that normally she would hear the children getting ready for school through the walls. Said Sinead James was a loving mother and that everything was normal in the home as far as she was aware. Saw Lola the day before the incident smiling and looking happy, although she saw the bruise on Lola&#8217;s nose and was told by Sinead James Lola had fallen. Explained Kyle Bevan had come to her house on the morning of 17 July 2020 and had said the dog had pushed Lola down the stairs while he was in the kitchen making breakfast for Lola. </p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-weight:bold">Mark John</span></p>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1">Boyfriend of Casey-Leigh Morgan. Said Kyle Bevan had &#8216;flared up&#8217; at Withybush General Hospital, and that he was hot-headed and you had to be careful what you said to him. Knew Kyle Bevan took cannabis and drank alcohol. Offered to remove Kyle Bevan from Sinead James&#8217; home after they had had an argument. Said Sinead James was a good mother as far as he was concerned.
