The mother is aged 42 and has a number of older children.  One of them now lives in Newcastle, as does the mother's own father.  The mother herself moved to Denmark from Slovakia in 2002, meeting the father soon afterwards.  They did not marry.  K, their only child, was born in January 2008.  In the following month, the parents signed a declaration as a result of which they share joint custody and parental responsibility.</span></p>

In the father&#8217;s case scarcely a year has passed without him serving some short sentence of imprisonment, usually for driving while disqualified.  Indeed, it is a peculiarity of the present application that the father is currently serving a sentence of 60 days imprisonment imposed upon him on 20 January 2014 for driving without a licence.  His Hague Convention application was issued the following day and he has participated in the proceedings by video link while on day release.  His sentence ends on 20 March.  </span></p>

She also claims that it would be intolerable for K to return to Denmark.

For the last two years of their time together it is clear that the relationship between the parents was unhappy, with frequent arguments and the police being called a number of times by the mother or by neighbours.  On two or three occasions, the mother took herself and K to a refuge for short periods before returning to the father.  Not surprisingly, K was affected and his school expressed concern about aggressive behaviour.  Social services were also involved but after a home visit they took no further action.</span></p>

He and his brother and another man dropped them at the bus station and carried their two suitcases, one for the mother and one for K.  The mother says that the father had agreed to her plan to go on to England afterwards.  The father says that he was agreeing to the mother having a holiday of about a week in Slovakia to see her older children living there and that nothing was discussed about a move to England.  The mother travelled on a single ticket but in the circumstances of this family nothing turns on this.</span></p>

The mother denies that she had begun a relationship with Mr C at that stage.  She says that a relationship only began in England in June.  </span></p>

Ms Renton also argues that this departure lacks any of the hallmarks of an agreed move (pre-bought tickets, relocation of 10 years&#8217; worth of belongings, any plans for life in England, any discussion of such plans, any tying up of loose ends in Denmark).  On the contrary, it has all the hallmarks of a unilateral decision to flee, with the mother arriving in England with no accommodation or school arrangements having been made and no plan for the child's contact with his father.</span></p>

I base this on two matters: first, that the probabilities are strongly against it and secondly that I prefer the evidence of the father to the mother on this issue.  The mother's evidence scarcely suggested that consent was ever given, while the father's robust denials were convincing.  He was a poor witness in relation to dates but that does not undermine his clear account of being placed in a situation after the mother's departure that he could do little about.</span></p>

She further points to the absence of any documentary evidence of a complaint to the police by the father, to his financial payments and to his evidence that he planned to come over to England to see his son during the summer but cancelled due to lack of travel documents.</span></p>

Having heard the parents' evidence in the light of my findings on the lack of consent, I find that the defence is not made out either.  The father did not at any stage acquiesce in K&#8217;s retention.  His actions should be seen in the light of his limited room for manoeuvre.  Financial payments and plans to visit might in some cases denote acquiescence, but not here.  I find that the father was doing his best to keep on terms with the mother for the sake of his contact with K, which was very limited.  Moreover, there is no basis in the evidence for finding that this non-consenting parent changed his mind about his son being here.  On the contrary, his action in starting these proceedings and the evidence of some foulmouthed and threatening text messages that he recently sent to the mother are more consistent with anger at being deprived of contact than with a man who has changed his mind for no apparent reason.</span></p>

I accept that the mother was surprised to receive these proceedings, but that is because she believed that her unilateral move to England had been successfully achieved.</span></p>

The particulars are set out in paragraph 12 of Ms Guha&#8217;s skeleton argument.  She refers to the length of time the child has been here, describing him as integrated in England.  Since K has only been in his present home for a few weeks and his present school for a few days, this overstates matters.  She also refers to the father's abusive behaviour, continuing up to the recent text messages, to his criminality and to the mother's relative lack of family support in Denmark and her need for accommodation and an income.  I have been referred to the authorities on Art 13(b): </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">Re E (Children)(Abduction: Custody Appeal)</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/27" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 27" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 27</ref> and </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">Re S (A Child)(Abduction: Rights of Custody)</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2012/10" uk:canonical="[2012] UKSC 10" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] UKSC 10</ref>.  I take the mother's allegations at face value.  I ask whether a return to Denmark would be likely to expose K to grave harm or place him in a situation that he should not be expected to tolerate.</span></p>

In this context, I take account of the situation as it was before the mother removed K.  I assess her as a reasonably robust and determined person with some wider family support, albeit not in Denmark.  I take account of the nature of the undertakings that the father offers and the fact that these will be enforceable in Denmark.  Looking at matters overall, a return order will certainly bring significant disadvantages to K in disrupting his current arrangements, but these are not of a kind that engage Art. 13(b) and they should be weighed alongside the advantage to him in his seeing his father again and in having his long-term future determined in the jurisdiction of his habitual residence.  </span></p>
