I would like to start by saying that I am extremely sorry that it has taken until Friday afternoon, 11 August, to deal with this matter when the respondent, Mr Martin, was arrested on Wednesday and detained in custody on Wednesday.  The history of that is that &#8211; well starting on 31 July I suppose, or even the order of District Judge Jenkins, which was made on 21 June - that order flagged up there would be a hearing on 7 August to determine committal application, and that is in the order of the District Judge made on that day, which is to be found at B146-150.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It is right that there was another hearing in the court list, which was oral hearing on 31 July.  In addition, on 28 July, administratively through this court, because I was unable to sit on 31 July, there is an order which was made adjourning that case until 7 August.  That is at B164 of the bundle.  However, the father says he was not told that the hearing was not going ahead on 31 July, seemingly the mother was told and only the father turned up.  However, he was then told that the case was not in the list on the day, and of course he had already been at court with District Judge Jenkins on 21 July, the 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> August had been mentioned.  The order that adjourned the committal was dated 28 July and that was sent in, he said he got it three days later.  He did not turn up at this court on 7 August.  </span></p>

However, it was my view that he should have been there, he should have sent a message to the court if he was ill.  There was no direct message from him, no suggestion he could come at any other time, and the time had come, and so I issued the Tipstaff Warrant on 7 August.  That was served on Wednesday, the father was arrested and he was brought before the court yesterday, 10 August.  It is most regrettable and a matter that I intend to investigate that there was no-one who could represent him yesterday.</span></p>

It seemed that the problem was in the court the father had explained that he had no longer had benefits, and solicitors avoided the case because if he did not have benefits he did not have an automatic passport to legal aid, and in those circumstances they were unwilling to represent him.</span></p>

I am extremely grateful to her, not only for representing Mr Martin but for the effort she put into it, and eventually at lunchtime she was able to find a solicitor, to whom I am also very grateful, because that solicitor has attended court, is willing to do it, as Ms&#160;Townend is, on a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">pro bono </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">basis, and I am really extremely grateful to them both and ashamed to be part of a system that it has taken so long for any legal representation for someone facing committal to have.  </span></p>

Ms Townend, on behalf of the father, makes a number of preliminary points.  The first point she makes is that there is a requirement for penal notice on judgment and orders.  They may not be enforced unless there is prominently displayed on the front of the copy of the judgment or order a warning to the person required to do or not to do the act in question.</span></p>

The requirement for a penal notice to be found at page 1988 of the Family Court Practice 2017.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">However, I am afraid I take the view that this case is different, because this is a case where the father has attended the court on all occasions except 7 August; he has been warned about his conduct.  The penal notice is so clearly put on the documents.  Whilst it may not be on page one, it is certainly in some cases on page two.  Ms Townend may take this matter wherever else she wants, but I am afraid I override that because this is not a case where the father was unaware of what is required, and it seems to me I can continue to deal with the matter.  </span></p>

I did say yesterday it must go on the list; it was put on the list, an open court matter.  It is not as I would have liked it to be put on the list, but on yesterday&#8217;s list and today&#8217;s list, when the matter is heard, it does say in open court, and a tannoy was sent out yesterday informing the court that this was an open court matter.  I do not think that was done today and I fully accept the media were not notified.  I have read the Lord Chief Justice&#8217;s directions and of course this was a case where the respondent was brought to court at short notice, and he does cover that position in his directions, and I agree it does say, &#8216;The media should be notified&#8217;.  However, I am not holding up this case because the media have not been notified.  I am not adjourning the case, I am going to deal with the case, and if I am wrong on any of these preliminary points no doubt the Court of Appeal will step in and say I should not have acted in the way that I did.</span></p>

That is not correct insofar as it relates to me.  What happened, at an earlier stage in the proceedings, was that the application was brought for the father to do unpaid work for breach of the order, and by the time that came in front of me I realised that he was looking after three children, but indeed these were persistent breaches and it seemed to me that that was not the way that court order should be enforced in circumstances of this nature.</span></p>

From his stance on previous occasions and his stance today I know that it is not true that the children do not want to come, I know it is not true that he deprives the children of treats.  The fact is this father is very angry with this mother.  It goes back a long way.  He said twice or three times the mother disappeared for years, &#8216;I still let her see the children&#8217;, and that is right in the earlier stages.  </span></p>

The father is very anxious to see the eldest child who has made it equally clear she will not see him, and the father&#8217;s response to that is to deprive the mother of the other children.  The hint of how that I come to the conclusion that I have with regard to that is that the father said &#8216;District Judge Jenkins said if the three younger children went to see the mother it may be possible for me to see the eldest child.  Therefore, on 11 June, despite what he says are the children&#8217;s express wishes, he was able to get the children to the library and they had a lovely time with the mother, and I accept her evidence about that.</span></p>

However, I am afraid it has resulted in the father, in my judgement, for no good reason, refusing to allow these three younger children to have contact.  </span></p>

The order requires the father once a fortnight to take the children to take the children to Leytonstone Library, where they would meet the uncle and then, five hours later, they would meet the uncle again and the father would retrieve them.  That, in my judgement, is not an onerous order.  Has the father done it?  On the one occasion in June, which is not the subject of this committal application, yes he did.  However, on the other occasions he has not.  Was it in his power?  Ms Townend says no.  He could not get these children aged 11, 10, and 9 to go.  I am sorry, he got them to go on 11 June, he could have got them to go on any of the other occasions had he wanted to do so.  However, I am afraid that it is not this father&#8217;s wish that the children see their mother, because the mother has the eldest one, and while he is not seeing her why should they see the mother.  </span></p>

There are no good reasons.  He has given several reasons.  In fact, the order of District Judge Jenkins set out very clearly that he said to District Judge Jenkins &#8216;he has not made the children available for contact and he is in breach of the orders because the children would be at risk of sexual abuse during contact, and the children refuse to go.  In addition, he said then he had some text messages, telephone messages, which showed evidence of sexual abuse&#8217;, and when the District Judge showed interest in that, and asked him to bring the telephone to court, it turned out there were no such messages.  Therefore, District Judge Jenkins said and upon it therefore, appearing to the court, there is no evidence whatsoever of the alleged sexual abuse.  That is how that allegation stands.  In addition, it is absolutely right for me to say that in addition to that evidence, which has been recorded in the order, there is a report from the Local Authority which says they have investigated sexual abuse and there is no evidence of sexual abuse at all.</span></p>

That indicates to me that actually there are no problems between the children and the mother, and actually it shows that he has just simply blocked the contact.  His decision to purge his contempt, or his request to purge his contempt, was made today that if I release him and leave the children with the mother I can wait for the Section 7 from the court which has been ordered and I can then consider the issues of residence and contact at that stage.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I am afraid that these breaches are too serious; they have gone on for too long a time.  The father has been given chance after chance after chance, and I myself have given him several opportunities to comply with the Orders.  I said I will adjourn this, I will give you one more chance, I will give you seven days, let us see if it works next weekend.  He has just not adhered to the court decision and the court orders at all, and I am now going to sentence him to a term of imprisonment of 28 days.</span></p>
