The proceedings have a relatively long background and I need not set that out.  The applicant is the London Borough of Hackney: they are the applicant because they exercise safeguarding responsibility to A and A  lives in the area of Hackney.  Hackney is represented through counsel, Ms Handcock.  A is the first respondent to the underlying application in the Court of Protection and it has been assessed and determined that he lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings.   At a much earlier stage the Official Solicitor was invited to act as his litigation friend, and she accepted.  A is represented by Ms Miles of counsel and Mr Whitaker of Bindmans is also in attendance.  The second respondent is B.  B is A&#8217;s mother.  The third respondent is C and he is I believe B&#8217;s partner.  </span></p>

What I am not clear on is whether he is also a British citizen but importantly for questions of jurisdiction it is my understanding from my brief reading that he has been residing in London for some considerable time. It seems clear he is habitually resident in England and Wales.  Hackney will take steps following the hearing today to identify whether he is or is not a British citizen and will take steps to identify what travel documentation he may have and where they are.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The proceedings began some time ago because of serious safeguarding concerns raised by the applicant social work team.  I note in the bundle the COP24 witness statement of A&#8217;s social worker which sets out a number of concerns.  These are concerns of a significant nature regarding the quality of care provided to when A  in his mother&#8217;s care.    There was significant concern raised regarding overall how she engaged with professionals, the fact that A appears to have gone missing; concerns were raised regarding drug use and the written evidence states that police officers were called to B&#8217;s home in August 2021 to exercise a section 23 </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">Misuse of Drugs Act</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> warrant.  A number of adult males were present with B and A.  Written evidence suggests police intelligence indicated drugs were sold from property. It is important to note no drugs were found but drug paraphernalia was found, indicating drug use.  The social work team also set out concerns regarding administration of A&#8217;s risperidone &#8211; a psychotropic medication.  There were also broader concerns regarding B&#8217;s working together with professionals and compliance with the package of support including education provision for A.  </span></p>

This is an updating psychiatric review from 28 February 2024.   It has been helpful to understand the extent of A&#8217;s vulnerability as this makes clear he has diagnoses of severe learning disability, autism, microcephaly, and global developmental delay,  He has been provided with Risperidone to deal with anxiety and agitation caused by his autism.  The report from the psychiatrist makes clear whilst in February 2024, A was doing well, when his usual routine is not followed or when he is with unfamiliar staff, he can become agitated.  He also has some other physical conditions that I need not deal with but it is clear from the psychiatric evidence and social work evidence that he is extremely vulnerable and that is added to because he is non-verbal.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">At some stage in summer 2023, after careful case management by District Judge Mullins at First Avenue House sitting in the Court of Protection, best interests decisions were made and A was moved from B&#8217;s home to care to reside at Placement X, an independent supported living accommodation.  Within the proceedings, after having the benefit of significant written evidence, DJ Mullins concluded pursuant to s15 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 that A lacked capacity to make decisions about residence, care and support, and contact with others.  As I say, best interests decisions were made that he reside at Placement X and orders were made restricting his contact with his mother and her partner &#8211; the second and third respondents.  Certain provisions were put in place that those arrangements regarding residence, care, and contact could only be altered with authority of Hackney or by agreement of Hackney.  My understanding is that DJ Mullins arrived at those conclusions on a best interests analysis and that it was not necessary for there to be any fact finding and he made no findings regarding drug use or otherwise by the second and third respondents.  It is important I emphasise that.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">A has therefore been residing at Placement X supported by a professional care team for some several months.  For reasons not clear to me at this urgent hearing, the  situation became more challenging and I am told on 16 April without permission A was removed from his supported living placement for some considerable hours which caused anxiety and concern.  Thereafter on 25 April 2024 he was removed from Placement X and did not return until 30 April 2024.  Concerns were raised about where he had been, what his living arrangements had been and the applicant formed a view he had had insufficient medication during that time.  Shortly thereafter, on 4 May, A was removed again without authority, by his mother B.  He has as I understand it not been seen by social services&#8217; team since 4 May 2024.  Entirely rightly Hackney issued an application seeking injunctive relief for the return of A As I understand it, that application supported by a witness statement, was considered by DJ Mullins who, on the papers, made a raft of injunctive orders requiring B and C to return A to his supported living home, discharged previous contact orders and required others to cooperate and asked police for assistance.</span></p>

A copy of the order was given to B, who I am told ripped up the order.  I understand a copy was given to C as well.  It appears from what I have read and been told, that the requirement to return A following DJ Mullins&#8217; order has been made clear to them.  I am told B says she has removed A because she is concerned about unexplained bruises on A&#8217;s body.  Notwithstanding those orders made by DJ Mullins, by 13 May 2024, A had still not been found and had not been returned to his supported living home.  DJ Mullins therefore directed a hearing to take place and directed parties to attend and required the second and third respondents to attend that hearing. </span></p>

He made injunctive orders on 13 May 2024 requiring the second and third respondents to return A immediately, cooperate with the applicant, permit the social worker and police to enter B&#8217;s home.  The orders were backed up by penal notices.  Permission was given to vary or discharge the order.  It is not clear whether that order has been served on B or C, largely driven by the fact that the local authority do not know where they are. </span></p>

I am told that at the hearing on 13 May, by Ms Handcock, District Judge Mullins was very concerned for A&#8217;s safety.  This morning on 20 May 2024, the Vice President of the Court of Protection, Mrs Justice Theis  made a series of directions seeking updating evidence and a short notice hearing to be listed at 2pm before me and ordered service of the order on Hackney and the Official Solicitor on behalf of A.  That order has not been provided to B and C&#8211; again because their whereabouts are not known.  The hearing before me then was without notice and I am mindful that is a serious step to make orders without notice to parties to proceedings.  But the hearing must proceed without notice being given, as the respondents have wholly failed to engage in recent proceedings and the court must proceed to hear the application for further relief to protect A notwithstanding the second and third respondents have had no notice.  It is important I add that I am sitting in public, and an order restricting reporting of this matter been made as set out in the transparency order of 28 June 2023 in these proceedings.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The application before me as against that background is Hackney&#8217;s application for a collection order and for an order against two telephone companies to provide for disclosure of information which will assist in identifying the whereabouts of the second respondent, B.  The local authority&#8217;s position is that they are extremely concerned for A&#8217;s welfare and safety and that these orders are necessary and in A&#8217;s best interests.  Initially the jurisdictional base for the orders was s16(5) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.  Initially I was invited make orders under s16(5) but I am now also invited to make orders under the court&#8217;s Inherent Jurisdiction.  It is important to pause to note that the applicant has not filed an application for relief under the Inherent Jurisidction but the urgency of the proceedings required them to seek a hearing before a Tier 3 judge and I will come onto my conclusions in a moment but I will require - and I received an undertaking from Ms Handcock &#8211; that Hackney will issue an application for relief under the Inherent Jurisdiction by no later than 2pm tomorrow.  </span></p>

Thus orders can be made against public authorities (for example, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the Benefits Agency, the DVLA, local authorities or local education authorities, etc, etc) requiring them to search their records with a view to informing the court whether they have any record of the child or the child's parent or other carer. Similar orders can be directed to telephone and other IT service providers, to banks and other financial institutions, to airline and other travel service providers &#8211; the latter with a view to finding out whether the missing child has in fact left the jurisdiction and, if so, for what destination &#8211; and to relatives, friends and associates of the abducting parent. In appropriate cases, though this is usually confined to relatives, friends and associates, the court can require the attendance at court to give oral evidence of anyone who there is reason to believe may be able to provide relevant information. Compliance with such orders can, where appropriate, be enforced by endorsing the order with a penal notice and then, in the event of non-compliance, issuing a bench warrant for the arrest and compulsory production in court of the defaulter.</span></p>

Moreover, and for the same reason, the orders themselves typically provide that they are not to be served on the abducting parent, just as they typically forbid those to whom the order is directed from informing the abducting parent of the existence of the order. Accordingly, and for reasons which in the nature of things are compelling, this small, discrete and necessarily discreet part of the Family Division's jurisdiction is, in distinction to the vast bulk of the Division's work, carried on not merely in private but typically in secret. The justification is that explained by Sir John Donaldson MR in</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;color:#000000">R v Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies ex p New Cross Building Society</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;color:#000000">&#160;</span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">[1984] QB 227 at 235, namely that unless it adopts this particular procedure in this particular type of case the court will be unable to achieve its paramount object of doing justice according to law; for abjuring secrecy in such circumstances is likely to lead, directly or indirectly, to a denial of justice and, not least, justice for the innocent child.</span></p>

Thus there is no need to establish that the person against whom disclosure is sought has, albeit innocently, been involved in the abducting parent's wrongdoing.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">We can summarise our conclusions on this aspect of the appeal as follows. The Court of Protection does have power to grant injunctions under s.16(5) of the 2005 Act, bothin the case where a deputy has been appointed under s.16(2)(b) and in the case where the Court has made an order taking a decision for P under s.16(2)(a). In doing so, it is exercising the power conferred on it by s.47(1) and such an injunction can therefore only be granted when it is just and convenient to do so. This requirement is now to be understood in line with the majority judgment in Broad Idea as being satisfied where there is an interest which merits protection and a legal or equitable principle which justifies exercising the power to order the defendant to do or not do something. In the present case, as is likely to be the case wherever an injunction is granted to prevent the Court&#8217;s decision under s.16(2)(a) from being frustrated or undermined, those requirements are satisfied because G&#8217;s interest in the December order being given effect to is an interest that merits protection, and the principle that the Court may make ancillary orders to prevent its orders being frustrated is ample justification for the grant of injunctive relief if the facts merit it.&#8221;</span></p>

I paraphrase. Whilst I observed that in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">HM</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> the court relied on the Inherent Jurisdiction, that is because proceedings were issued prior to the Mental Capacity Act coming into force and related jurisdictional issues.  As is known the Inherent Jurisdiction continues notwithstanding the coming into force of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.</span></p>

As I have indicated at the outset, he is an extremely vulnerable, autistic young man in respect of whom a change of routine and people can cause significant degrees of anxiety.  He was removed without planning or consent on 16 April, 25 April and again on 4 May.  He may be bewildered, anxious and upset.  Those are very serious matters and there are clear reasons why the best interests decisions made by DJ Mullins requires him to reside in a supported living placement and have carefully calibrated contact.  In their actions the second and third respondents set aside that carefully calibrated series of living and contact arrangements which were ordered as in his best interests and to his protect wellbeing.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">There is added significant concern that he needs risperidone, it is not at all clear that A has that medication and when he was removed in April, there was insufficient medication and that is likely to have a significant impact on his mental health.  Also on that occasion he was without sufficient pads to assist with his personal hygiene.  A number of personal items including his iPad were not returned to the placement after they removed him.  If that situation was not of concern enough, the third respondent may well have an infectious and serious disease for which he must take medication.  I am saying a limited amount about it as I am sitting in open court but this adds to the risks to A&#8217;s safety and wellbeing. There is also the background concern of allegations of drugs use by the second and third respondents.  When the court considers all matters in the round, this is a highly vulnerable young man whose living and care arrangements, access to medication, and education have all been fundamentally disrupted by the second and third respondents, and on a repeated basis over the last month.  </span></p>

I am aware that I am making this on without notice. I am aware it is a draconian order and authorises the Tipstaff and Police to enter into third party properties to seek and remove A, but such are my concerns for his safety, it is in his best interests for that to take place.  </span></p>

Therefore the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Re G</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> test set out by Lord Justice Baker is  met in these circumstances.  A&#8217;s interests require protection, for his own safety and wellbeing, and the fact that he has been removed from his own home it is right that the court should make ancillary orders to prevent frustration of the orders made by DJ Mullins previously.  It is necessary for an order to be made for enforcement of those orders to be made by Tipstaff under the direction of a Tier 3 judge (I leave aside the potential debate as to whether a Tier 1 or Tier 2 judge could make these order in reliance on s. 47 MCA).  Without this further order, DJ Mullins earlier orders would be ineffective in the face of the actions of the second and third respondents.</span></p>

Although I repeat my initial view &#8211; A lacks capacity, an order has been made as to his best interests, that order has been frustrated by the second and third respondents, and so this order can be made under the Mental Capacity Act. To avoid uncertainty I am also invoking the Inherent Jurisdiction to provide further and wider jurisdiction should it be necessary.</span></p>

Whilst of course these are not decisions A could make, I am satisfied they are orders made in connection with the Court of Protection&#8217;s jurisdiction and DJ Mullins&#8217; earlier best interests order in respect of A&#8217;s residence. There is an interest in identifying the location of B to locate A to end his state of abduction and for him to be returned to his home in accordance with DJ Mullins earlier best interest analysis and order. This order is made to end the frustration of the earlier orders carried out by the actions of the second and third respondents.</span></p>
