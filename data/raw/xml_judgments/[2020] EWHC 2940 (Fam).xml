E informed the Judge that: the mother had beaten the children, they were a bit afraid of her, he had been beaten by her, she beat him with her hand several months ago, she beat I, she destroyed A&#8217;s phone by hitting it against the floor, she did the same with I&#8217;s, she got angry and threw everything and shouted a lot, she threw I&#8217;s phone and she beat someone everyday. I stated that: the mother hit her a long time ago, the mother beat A very much, the mother beat each of them but mostly A, she was afraid of her mother, she beat A and E more than her, sometimes she was angry without reason and shouted and she destroyed A&#8217;s  phone and her phone. A stated that her mother mistreated and beat them, beat her the most, sometimes with her hand, she beat her when she said she wanted to live with the father, the beatings became more frequent at the maternal grandmother&#8217;s home, in April she was very angry and beat her with a hangar, causing bruises on her hand and leg, she beat E from time to time, she rarely beat I. The record of the hearing states that the mother said she may have used physical punishment several times against A, that she slapped her with her hand after she had run away the second time, but that she did not use physical punishment against I and E. The mother asserted that the father had been turning the children against her and spoke of the various pressures on her. The court reserved its judgment.  </p>

It held that the father had not proved that an interim variation of the order was in the children&#8217;s best interests and that there were no grounds to the mother was at serious risk of causing physical or mental damage to the children or putting them in an unbearable situation. The children&#8217;s wishes were taken into account but the court held that giving precedence to their wish to live with the father would be an oversimplification at the current stage of proceedings before full evidence had been obtained.  The court noted: some of the difficulties faced by the mother were a direct result of the father&#8217;s conduct such as his failure to pay maintenance and his influence of the children; the father had exaggerated some allegations against the mother, for example, that she had neglected the children&#8217;s care; the inconsistency in the children&#8217;s allegations; the father did not suggest physical chastisement of the younger two children; the father&#8217;s actions in bringing the Polish proceedings were pre-planned and tactical to bolster his position in any Hague case; and the father&#8217;s actions were designed to present the mother with a &#8216;fait accompli.&#8217;  </p>

This, as I have endeavoured to explain, is, in my view, clear from what he said in In re B itself.  However, it can also be seen from what Lady Hale said in In re LC: &#8220;[63] The quality of a child's stay in a new environment, in which he has only recently arrived, cannot be assessed without reference to the past.  Some habitual residences may be harder to lose than others and others may be harder to gain.  If a person leaves his home country with the intention of emigrating and having made all the necessary plans to do so, he may lose one habitual residence immediately and acquire a new one very quickly.  If a person leaves his home country for a temporary purpose or in ambiguous circumstances, he may not lose his habitual residence there for some time, if at all, and correspondingly he will not acquire a new habitual residence until then or even later.  Of course, there are many permutations in between, where a person may lose one habitual residence without gaining another.&#8221;</span></p>

In so doing, Lord Wilson stated as follows:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <num style="font-style:italic">37.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-style:italic">Where a child of any age goes lawfully to reside with a parent in a state in which that parent is habitually resident, it will no doubt be highly unusual for that child not to acquire habitual residence there too. The same may be said of a situation in which, perhaps after living with a member of the wider family, a child goes to reside there with both parents. But in highly unusual cases there must be room for a different conclusion; and the requirement of some integration creates room for it perfectly. No different conclusion will be reached in the case of a young child. But, where the child is older, in particular one who is an adolescent or who should be treated as an adolescent because she (or he) has the maturity of an adolescent, and perhaps also where (to take the facts of this case) the older child's residence with the parent proves to be of short duration, the inquiry into her integration in the new environment must encompass more than the surface features of her life there. I see no justification for a refusal even to consider evidence of her own state of mind during the period of her residence there. Her mind may&#8212;possibly&#8212;have been in a state of rebellious turmoil about the home chosen for her which would be inconsistent with any significant degree of integration on her part. In the debate in this court about the occasional relevance of this dimension, references have been made to the &#8220;wishes&#8221;, &#8220;views&#8221;, &#8220;intentions&#8221; and &#8220;decisions&#8221; of the child. But, in my opinion, none of those words is apt. What can occasionally be relevant to whether an older child shares her parent's habitual residence is her state of mind during the period of her residence with that parent. In Ex p Nilish Shah <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1983] 2 AC 309" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1983">[1983] 2 AC 309</ref> , in which he propounded the test recently abandoned, Lord Scarman observed, at p 344, that proof of ordinary (or habitual) residence was &#8220;ultimately a question of fact, depending more on the evidence of matters susceptible of objective proof than on evidence as to state of mind&#8221;. Nowadays some might not accept that evidence of state of mind was not susceptible of objective proof; but, in so far as Lord Scarman's observation might be taken to exclude the relevance of a person's state of mind to her habitual residence, I suggest that this court should consign it to legal history, along with the test which he propounded.&#8221; </span></p>

The judgment then returned to the approach the court should take to factual disputes. "36. There is obviously a tension between the inability of the court to resolve factual disputes between the parties and the risks that the child will face if the allegations are in fact true. Mr Turner submits that there is a sensible and pragmatic solution. Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk. The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country. This is where arrangements for international co-operation between liaison judges are so helpful.  Without such protective measures, the court may have no option but to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues. </span></p>

In summary, the argument was that she should have adopted the "sensible and pragmatic solution" referred to in &#167;36 of Re E and asked herself whether, if the allegations were true, there would be a grave risk within Article 13b and then, whether appropriate protective measures could be put in place to obviate this risk.

That is what the judge did here. It was for the mother, who opposed the return, to substantiate the Article 13b exception (see Re E supra &#167;32) and for the court to evaluate the evidence within the confines of the summary process. Hogg J found the mother's evidence about what had happened to be inconsistent with her actions in that she had continued her relationship with the father and allowed him to have the care of E, see for example what she said in &#167;37 about the mother not having done anything to corroborate her evidence. She also put the allegations in context, bearing in mind what Mr Power had said about something good having happened in E's parenting, which she took as a demonstration that E would not be at risk if returned to Lithuania (&#167;36). The Article 13b argument had therefore not got off the ground in the judge's view. The judgment about the level of risk was a judgment which fell to be made by Hogg J and we should not overturn her judgment on it unless it was not open to her (see the important observations of the Supreme Court on this subject  at  &#167;35  of  Re  S ,  supra).  Nothing has  been  said  in argument to demonstrate that the view Hogg J took was not open to her; in the light of it, it was unnecessary for her to look further at the question of protective measures. She would have taken the same view even if the child had been going back to the father's care, but the Article 13b case was weakened further by the fact that the mother had ultimately agreed to return with E. </span></p>

This appraisal is, itself, general in that it has to take into account all relevant matters which can include measures available in the home state which might ameliorate or obviate the matters relied on in support of the defence. As referred to in Re D, at [52], the English courts have sought to address the alleged risk by "extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting state to protect him once he is there.  In many cases this will be sufficient" (my emphasis). </span></p>

I accept Ms Huntington&#8217;s opinion and analysis on this issue. I accept that A is mature for her age and so it is appropriate to take into account her views. I conclude that her objections are grounded in her unhappy experience of living with her mother in Poland and her happiness at living with her father in England and that they are strong, consistent, reasonable, objective, rational, her own and genuine. The mother accepts that A objects and Ms Huntington records that the mother said she would not force a return of A.

I accept that the children&#8217;s allegations of consistent and ongoing physical punishment, taken as a whole, cross the threshold under Article 13b; the mother&#8217;s behaviour towards them placing them in a situation which no child should have to tolerate. Whilst the greatest risk of physical harm is for A, there remains a risk to I and E. Moreover, A&#8217;s siblings were and would be aware of her treatment by the mother and would have suffered psychological harm as a consequence.  As would A, who was also aware of the treatment of her sister and brother. The abusive physical treatment of each child is also likely to have caused each of them psychological harm.</p>

Given the facts of this case, it is difficult to see how the children could be protected from the psychological and emotional harm that would be caused by a move of two of them. </p>
