	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SK, from the age of 13, was absenting herself form the family home. It was discovered that she was keeping the company of much older men. She was beyond the control of her parents. Her case came to the attention of the local authority and of the police. Hence the care proceedings were issued and an application for an injunction was made against an individual, LG, who it was believed was sexually exploiting SK. </p>

I granted the same but required a detailed explanation from the local authority and from the police as to how such a serious mistake had been made. I was promptly provided with an explanation which I accept. I do not propose to lengthen this judgment by reciting the same save that I accept it was a genuine and unintended error borne of lax and less than rigorous procedures. </p>

[37] Whilst sympathetic to the objectives of this local authority and indeed to those of Keehan J in the Riaz case&#8230;I think Ms Johnson is correct when she says to extend the scope of the inherent jurisdiction to children who are neither known nor subject to any proceedings, is to go beyond the parameters of its reach.  However well intentioned the ambition to prevent child sexual exploitation generally, this is ultimately to make a utilitarian calculation of social policy.  The framework within which such children should be safeguarded and protected is for Parliament to create and for the Courts to enforce.

The arguments addressed on behalf of Mr Wellesly included the following <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Granting that the Court has authority to control, under certain circumstances, the legal rights of the father, it must be admitted that the jurisdiction is of the most delicate nature, to be administered with the utmost caution, both on account of the sacred character of the ties which it severs, and of the mischief and danger which must flow from exerting it improperly.  The origin and principle of the jurisdiction is involved in obscurity.  Some have supposed that it belongs to the King, as parens patriae, and that from him it devolves upon the Chancellor as representing the Crown in this branch of the royal prerogative.  If this theory were true, the Court would interfere in the case of the children of the poorest subjects as well as the highest; but in point of fact, it has never interfered, except where there is property with which it could deal.  At other times, the jurisdiction has been represented as having descended from the Court of Wards, when that court ceased to exist, upon the Court of Chancery.  It may be doubted whether, in point of fact, there is any ground for such a supposition; but at all events, such powers as could be derived from the Court of Wards, could not have any application to a case like the present; for the object of the Court of Wards was to protect the interest of the lord and not to control the legal rights of the father on moral or religious grounds.  The jurisdiction, whatever be its origin, is, in its practical application founded merely on precedents; and, by the same precedents are the limits defined which it ought not to exceed.  Where, then, is a case to be found at all similar to the present? The Court has never interfered under circumstances similar to those which are alleged to exist here; and what it has never done heretofore it ought not to do now.  If the jurisdiction is to be extended to new classes of circumstances, care, at least must be taken not to interfere, except in very clear cases&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>

With respect to the doctrine that this authority belongs to the King as parens patriae, exercising a jurisdiction by this court, it has been observed at the Bar, that the Court has not exercised that jurisdiction, unless there was property belonging to the infant to be taken care of in this Court,  Now, whether that be an accurate view of the law or not; whether it is founded on what Lord Hardwicke says in the case of Butler &#8211;v- Freeman (Ambler 303), &#8220;that there must be a suit depending relevant to the infant or his estate&#8221; (applying, however, the latter words rather to what the Court is to do with respect to the maintenance of infants); or whether it arises out of a necessity of another kind namely, that [21] the Court must have property in order to exercise this jurisdiction; - that is a question to which, perhaps, sufficient consideration has not been given.  If anyone will turn his mind attentively to the subject, he must see that this Court, has not the means of acting, except where it has property for the use and maintenance of the infants.  </span></p>

Undertakings were given by the respondent. On further reflection, however, Hayden J concluded it had been inappropriate to have invited such undertakings there being, in his judgment, no jurisdictional basis to make orders in similar terms. Thus he discharged the same. Those paragraphs may be misunderstood to read that there is a lacuna in the legislative provisions in respect of sexual risk orders, in that, there is no provision to make interim orders. As I have set out above, in paragraphs 40 and 41, it is clear that the legislative provisions, read with the guidance, make it clear that a magistrates court has the power to make an interim SRO prior to the making or not making of a final order.   </p>
