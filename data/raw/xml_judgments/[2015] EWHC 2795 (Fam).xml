I propose to refer to the parties to those proceedings as &#8216;the husband&#8217; (H) and &#8216;the wife&#8217; (W).  Their younger son, N, has become a party to his parents&#8217; divorce litigation because of the injunction proceedings.  I intend no disrespect to any of them in adopting this shorthand which is intended to preserve anonymity for their personal affairs.</span></p>

It had then endured for some 34 years during the course of which two sons were born to this couple.  N, the younger, is now 31 years old.  His brother, A, is 34.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.67in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">H is a Cypriot national; W is, by birth, Lebanese.  They are now in their early sixties.  Throughout the marriage, H has been the driving force behind the establishment and operation of a successful property investment group which operated in both the commercial and residential sectors of the market.  The onshore trading activities of the group were conducted through a London based trading company called C Ltd.  Whilst the main family business was based in central London, there were corporate offshoots registered in various offshore locations around the world.   H has non-domiciled status and is non-resident in the United Kingdom.  He claims now to spend the majority of his time in Cyprus.  Whilst she has made a full contribution as a wife and mother, W&#8217;s involvement in the family business appears to have peripheral although she is both a director and shareholder of two of the underlying corporate entities with which I am concerned.  It is clear that H has also taken advantage of her own non-domiciled status to issue various shares in the group entities in W&#8217;s sole name and to conduct transactions in her name or on her behalf.  That, he says, was his </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">modus operandi</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> throughout the course of the marriage although it seems that, until recently, W herself may not have been aware of these dealings.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.67in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Until recently, N was actively involved with his father in the family business.  He started working for his father in October 2006 when he was in his early twenties.  He was appointed a director of C Ltd in 2009 and appears to have become increasingly involved in daily decision-making within the business, especially during periods when his father was abroad.  It is N&#8217;s case in these proceedings that, prior to the institution of the divorce proceedings, his father had trusted him for many years to manage substantial assets worth tens of millions of pounds through his directorships of three of the main family companies which are the subject of the present dispute.  Before this litigation commenced, there appears to have been a succession plan of sorts in H&#8217;s contemplation.  In anticipation of his 65</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> birthday in May 2015, H is said to have given instructions to his accountants to transfer to N 50% of the shares in C Ltd.  Whilst an annual return was filed at Companies House recording the proposed change, no stock transfer form was executed.  Whatever may have been the intention (and I am not in a position to make any findings about that issue), the breakdown of the marriage has since intervened and, whether or not such a transfer of shares to N was intended to be a gift, the transaction was never perfected.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.67in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The underlying portfolio held within the over-arching business structure accounts for a significant proportion of the family wealth which now falls to be divided at the end of this long marriage.  In total, the assets are worth in the region of &#163;60 million, and possibly more.  In broad terms, H accepts that this is a sharing case where W will be entitled to leave the marriage with 50% of those assets which do not fall to be excluded as non-matrimonial in their character or provenance.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.67in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In February 2015, and in circumstances to which I shall come, H secured on a without notice basis a freezing order which operated in its effect to restrain W and N (on their case) from carrying out their duties as directors of two companies called D Ltd and R Ltd.  On 11 March 2015, that order was continued in a slightly modified form following a hearing at which H, W and N were represented.  Because there were several matters before the court on that occasion, including the First Appointment in respect of W&#8217;s application for financial remedy orders, there was insufficient time for the district judge to hear full argument in relation to the continuation, or alternatively, discharge of the freezing order. The matter was put off for a further full day before a judge of the Family Division.  Because most of that day was spent in negotiation, when the matter came before Moor J on 19 April 2015, he was not able to resolve the continuing dispute.  Instead, he made an order which reflected an interim holding agreement.  It is that agreement which has regulated the commercial operation of D Ltd and R Ltd in the intervening months since April.  Whilst negotiations continued, compromise proved impossible and the matter was listed before me on 19 June 2015.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.67in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">On that occasion, W was represented by Mr Martin Pointer QC; H by Mr Tim Amos QC; and N by Mr Daniel Lightman.  I had lengthy skeleton arguments from all three counsel and a substantial bundle of authorities.  The written evidence occupied two full bundles, and there was a dispute between the parties as to whether or not I should receive as evidence an additional statement which H had prepared but only recently served on the other parties.  The case did not conclude on that day and I indicated that I was prepared to list it for a further short hearing early the following week.  On 24 June 2015, the parties and their representatives were in court with Mr Michael Bradley holding the baton for Mr Pointer on behalf of W.  At the conclusion of final submissions, Mr Lightman complained that the legal basis for the continuation of the injunction sought by H appeared to have changed as Mr Amos developed his argument.  Since I was by then in the middle of a ten day case, I gave Mr Lightman permission to file a short written addendum to his skeleton which I would consider before handing down a reserved judgment.  A further skeleton argument together with a bundle of authorities and transcripts of the two previous hearings were delivered whilst I was away from the Royal Courts of Justice on circuit at the end of last term.  Although the parties have a Financial Dispute Resolution hearing on 9 October 2015, and despite some attempt at continuing negotiation, they have been unable to resolve these issues.   On 20 August 2015, during the vacation, I dealt with a further hearing which concerned the production by N of a copy document sought by H in the context of parallel proceedings ongoing between H and N in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division.  </span></p>

		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><span style="font-family:Garamond">I am aware that there has been subsequent correspondence between the parties&#8217; solicitors in which further proposals have been made in an attempt to settle the case.  On 14 July 2015 I received a letter from N&#8217;s solicitors which informed me that those negotiations had broken down and it would be necessary for me to rule on the applications which I heard on 19 and 24 June 2015.  Whilst I have read the correspondence, I do not propose to comment upon the development of the negotiations since their failure means that the court is effectively dealing with the position as it was when the matter was before the court.</span></p>

In the alternative he makes an open offer to maintain a moratorium in relation to all ongoing proceedings but only until 10 October 2015 which is the day after the FDR hearing.

He is now working in a new business (Z CO) and contends that the terms of the freezing order currently sought by H not only inhibit the exercise of his fiduciary obligations as director of D Ltd and R Ltd; their reach is such that his new business is being adversely affected.  He rejects the offer of a moratorium until 10 October 2015 not only because of these matters but because he has already incurred a very substantial liability in respect of legal costs and, if the issue cannot be resolved as between H and W now, he does not wish to incur a further round of costs.</span></p>

What has developed, as the parties acknowledge, is a deeply entrenched internecine war between H on the one side and W and N on the other.  It appears that N&#8217;s younger brother is also involved in the ongoing proceedings in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division and it is against that unhappy background that I must now turn to deal with the competing submissions which I heard from the parties&#8217; advocates.  </span></p>

He says that the Power of Attorney which she holds gives her limited and restricted powers pertaining to his affairs in Cyprus.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.67in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Shortly before serving the petition on H, W gave instructions for the transfer of a sum of &#163;12 million from a Swiss bank account held in her sole name.  It is accepted that the overwhelming majority of those funds represented the proceeds of sale from a major property deal which had recently been completed by H in this jurisdiction.  W was the sole shareholder of the company which had owned the property in question.  H had placed those funds in her Swiss bank account in ignorance of the fact that she had issued divorce proceedings.  The funds were transferred on W&#8217;s instructions to another account which she maintained with Bank Audi in Beirut.  She has since stated in her written evidence that her decision to transfer these funds was motivated only by a wish to protect her position temporarily and prevent H from hiding the money.  She was about to serve him with the divorce proceedings and feared that the funds might be transferred by H to his mistress or otherwise invested offshore in a manner which would make tracing the funds difficult.  She says that she never had any intention of using the funds for her own purposes and readily agreed to transfer them back to a joint account once he had been served and appropriate arrangements had been made by the lawyers in relation to their preservation </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[A:141]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.   However, when H became of the movement of these funds, there was an exchange of correspondence between his solicitors and W&#8217;s (then) solicitors, Vardags, in which W sought to justify her removal of those funds on the basis that the monies belonged to her sister.  That statement is relied on by H as a demonstration of her bad faith in relation to this transaction.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.67in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">On 13 October 2014, a matter of days before H became aware of the divorce proceedings, W executed a Declaration of Trust whereby her beneficial interest in a number of offshore entities which formed part of the family business structure was passed to N.  The document appears to have been counter-signed by H and witnessed by an employee of C Ltd, Ms W (who is H&#8217;s secretary of many years&#8217; standing).  The circumstances in which that document came into existence are highly contentious and have yet to be determined by findings of fact.  It is W&#8217;s case, supported by N, that she signed the document as one of several which were put before her by H who had asked her to attend the company&#8217;s offices for this specific purpose.  She did not prepare the document, knew nothing of its purpose and did not read its contents at the time.  It was H&#8217;s document and not hers.  She signed the document during a window of a few days which pre-dated the argument which was to precipitate the formal separation and service of the divorce proceedings on 19 October 2014.  She says she was in no state to challenge H about its contents.  N&#8217;s belief is that his father prepared, or gave instructions for the preparation of, the Declaration of Trust which was designed to remove from the &#8216;matrimonial pot&#8217; some &#163;15 million of assets in the belief that his son would side with his father against his mother in the event of a divorce, &#8220;particularly with the temptation of the beneficial interest &#8230; being transferred over to my name&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[A:328]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  N has stated in his written evidence that, two days later after his father was served with the divorce petition, he had an hour long telephone conversation with his father during which N told him he wished to ensure a fair settlement without taking any &#8220;sides&#8221;.  At that point he says that H once again brought up the existence of the Declaration of Trust pursuant to which the beneficial interest in the offshore companies was (then) held for his benefit.  H, on the other hand, asserts that his signature was forged.  W has since provided letters to say that she was asked by N (and not by H) to sign the document and not on 13 October 2014 but on the following day.  This issue has since been the subject of a direction for the appointment of an expert graphologist who will no doubt add his or her input to the conundrum of who is telling the truth about the circumstances in which this document came into existence.  It is further demonstration, if more was required, of the depth and extent of the mutual mistrust which presently exists between the two sides of the family.</span></p>

However, on 5 December 2014, some six weeks later, H sought against his two sons interim injunctive relief in proceedings which he had initiated in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division of the High Court.  These were founded on allegations of harassment.  A consent order was approved by HHJ Seymour QC exercising his jurisdiction as a deputy judge of the High Court on 12 December 2014. Under the terms of that agreement, previous allegations and counter-allegations of assault, harassment, malicious communication and interference with email as between H and his two sons were left unexplored on the basis of mutual undertakings offered to the court </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[A:37-42]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  Those proceedings continue and are highly relevant in the matrimonial context because one of the issues which has prevented settlement of these satellite issues as between H and W in the matrimonial proceedings is H&#8217;s wish to be free to continue to litigate against his sons in the Queen&#8217;s Bench proceedings.  W, for her part, sought a moratorium in respect of all further steps in those proceedings whilst she and H attempted to reach a financial settlement.</span></p>

As to the threat of an early application for injunctive relief, W&#8217;s solicitors stated that there was no immediate urgency for any application given that the proposed changes were not being introduced until the expiry of the four month notice period (in the case of the companies) and the one month notice period (in relation to H&#8217;s occupation of the flat owned by D Ltd).  That shortened notice period was given on the basis that H had alternative accommodation available to him.

The first is that although the company is of course a separate legal entity, it is not an entity in which any other individual or non-family member has had any interest.  All the shareholders are related either by blood or marriage.  Secondly, this story seems to demonstrate the lack of wisdom with which human beings can react when they are going through the emotional turmoil of marital breakdown and contested financial proceedings.  I am in no doubt at all that it is possible to detect a clear thread of strategic manoeuvring in the various steps that have been taken by the wife and in their timing.  On the other hand it seems to me equally clear that there is a manifest connection, unconscious if not conscious, between the wife&#8217;s endeavour to take charge and the summary dismissal of Mr Michael Lee.</span></p>

Whilst that letter contained a passing reference to the steps which H himself had taken in the immediate aftermath of the separation to displace the pre-existing status quo, it does not refer to his removal of W a director of C Ltd.  With the removal of N from the board on 15 December 2014, H was left in a position where he had unilaterally secured control of the business for himself without any check or balance from other family members whom he now perceived to be acting in concert against him against the backdrop of divorce proceedings instigated by W.</span></p>

In that respect, I made clear at the end of my note that my client is prepared to give an undertaking, if you think it appropriate and necessary, that he will take no steps to affect the status quo of any of these companies within this case without a further order of the court, so that you can be satisfied that you are not restraining one half of the parties to the litigation and giving the other free hand.  Our case, of course, is that the undertaking is unnecessary because my client has not done anything that would warrant him giving it, but it but it is right to say that the wife would not agree with that.

Another example is in the Married Women&#8217;s Property Act 1882 proceedings, where an interest is claimed in a house or chattels.  It is common form to apply to the court for an order to preserve chattels or preserve the matrimonial home pending the hearing of proceedings.  With respect to the learned judge, I think he was wrong in thinking that this was an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref>.  It seems to me that it was an application under the general powers of the court to preserve specific assets which are the subject matter of proceedings pending the determination of those proceedings.  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Smith v Smith </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">(1973) SJ 525 was also such a case.  This is clearly a case where no hardship will be caused whatever to the husband by restraining him from disposing of part of the sum of damages, when he recovers them, provided the proceedings for ancillary relief are dealt with quickly.  This court will take steps to see that that is done.  I can see no reason why the court should not make such an order and the more the husband protests and refuses to give any assurance that he intends to leave some of this money in a liquid form, the more anxious the court is bound to be.  One wonders why all this fuss is being made about such an order.&#8221;</span></p>

At the time she issued her application, both he and the assets were out of the jurisdiction. The court held that there was no statutory jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 37</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> because there was no evidence in that case that the husband intended to dissipate the asset.  However, relying expressly on </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Roche</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">, the court did make a freezing order under its inherent jurisdiction.

Lincoln J declined to follow that course on the basis that &#8220;the matrimonial field calls for a different approach&#8221; (p 253).  On the basis that the husband&#8217;s intentions might change, his lordship granted the wife an injunction on the basis of the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction to freeze assets which might be put beyond the reach of an applicant.</span></p>

In that case, H and W were shareholders in a company which carried on business providing mooring facilities at a boat station.  By the time divorce proceedings had been initiated, the company was insolvent.  The local authority was also challenging the company&#8217;s right to carry on business on common land to which it had no title or licence to occupy.  In the course of that litigation, the local authority made an offer to buy the mooring business and, for these purposes, it required the husband to sign a letter of intent.  A first instance judge, exercising his jurisdiction in the family proceedings, made an order requiring the husband to sign such a letter both in his personal capacity and in his capacity as a director of the company.

The husband objected to signing the letter of intent because it contained various restrictive covenants which would have the effect of preventing him from operating a similar business within a fixed radius of the boat station which was being acquired from the company by the local authority.  In support of the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to impose such a restriction on the husband, the wife&#8217;s counsel relied upon <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 24</ref>A and 37 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>.</span></p>

In the present case Mr Crittenden does not appear at the moment to be dealing with the assets of the company, which anyhow are not, to my mind, property within this subsection, at all.

Those who control its affairs &#8211; even if the control is in a single individual &#8211; act merely as the company&#8217;s agents.  Their agency will include the authority to procure an exercise by the company of its dispositive powers in respect of its property, but those powers are still exclusively the company&#8217;s own: they are not the agents&#8217; powers.  When and if the agents act as such, and procure a corporate disposition, the property which immediately before the disposition belonged to the company will become the property of the disponee.  Until then, it remains the property of the company and belongs beneficially to no one else.  The judge&#8217;s point that the agent is automatically the owner of all the company&#8217;s assets by the mere fact of his authority to procure the company to dispose of them to himself is astonishing and does not begin to pass muster.

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">&#8220;In the Court of Appeal, the three respondent companies challenged the orders made against them on the ground that there was no jurisdiction to order their property to be conveyed to the wife in satisfaction of the husband&#8217;s judgment debt.  This contention, which has been repeated before us, raises a question of some importance.  For some years it has been the practice of the Family Division to treat the assets of companies substantially owned by one party to the marriage as available for distribution under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref> of the Matrimonial Causes Act, provided that the remaining assets of the company are sufficient to satisfy its creditors.  In the Court of Appeal, the practice was supported by Thorpe LJ, but the majority disagreed: ante, pp 421-467.  Rimer LJ, delivering the leading judgment for the majority, held that the practice developed by the Family Division was beyond the jurisdiction of the court unless (i) the corporate personality of the company was being abused for a purpose which was in some relevant respect improper, or (ii) on the particular facts of the case it could be shown that an asset legally owned by the company was held in trust for the husband.  He considered that the judge had rejected both of these possibilities on the facts, and that he ought not therefore to have made the order.  In a short concurring judgment, Patten LJ, ante, p 467, para 161, said that the Family Division had developed &#8220;an approach to company owned assets in ancillary relief applications which amounts almost to a separate system of legal rules unaffected by the relevant principles of English property and company law&#8221;.  This practice, he concluded, &#8220;must now cease&#8221;.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.67in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The principle which emerges from the decision of the Court of Appeal in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Crittenden </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">(see paragraphs 63 and 64 above), whilst a free-standing statement of the law in 1990, has been significantly buttressed by the unanimous endorsement of the Supreme Court in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Prest v Petrodel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">, some twenty-three years later.  Their lordships&#8217; remarks can now be seen as the structural underpinning for the earlier authority of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">McGladdery v McGladdery </span><span style="font-family:Garamond"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 1102" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 1102</ref>.  In that case, a wife who owned an equal share with her husband in a family company persuaded him to appoint her as chairman of the company.  As soon as he had done so, she left the family home and petitioned for divorce.  Shortly thereafter, she removed the husband as a director and terminated his employment with the company.  The court seised of the financial aspects of the divorce ordered the husband to transfer a percentage of his shares to the wife on receipt of a lump sum payable by her to him.  The wife was also ordered to discharge a raft of debt due to the husband&#8217;s family and thereafter make periodical payments to him.  She paid the lump sum; he transferred the shares.  She remained in default of her obligations to discharge the family debt and pay maintenance to the husband.  When the court confirmed those obligations, the wife set up a BVI company and transferred to it all the assets formerly held by the family company.   H sought remedies in the Family Division including an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 37</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> setting aside the transfer out of the jurisdiction of the family company&#8217;s assets.  The Court of Appeal upheld the judge at first instance who ruled there was no jurisdiction to set aside the transfer since she had not divested </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">herself</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> of any assets but had merely enhanced her own assets at the expense of the other shareholders.  In delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Thorpe LJ made it plain that the material transfers in this case had been inter-company transfers.  Since there was no suggestion that the English family company was an alter ego, the transferor was a private company.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 37</ref> only empowers the court to avoid dispositions </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">made by a party to the financial proceedings</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> :  see page 1110 C.

Those injunctions prevented W and/or N from (&#8216;d&#8217;) taking any steps to obtain the access code and passwords to allow online access to the bank accounts operated by D Ltd and R Ltd; and (&#8216;e&#8217;) obtaining any data held by C Ltd in relation to D Ltd and R Ltd.  What is now to be permitted (on H&#8217;s case) is access to those bank accounts for the limited purposes of monitoring movements on the accounts.  The intended prohibition on their ability to execute any transactions in circumvention of Mr F&#8217;s mandate remains absolute.  Thus, they can observe from the side lines but cannot participate in any of the day to day activities of running the two companies in accordance with their duties as directors.  In my judgment, this corporate emasculation of its two directors is not rescued by the words appearing in the penultimate bullet point of paragraph 75 above.  Whilst &#8216;transactions in the ordinary course of business&#8217; appear to be exempt from the prohibition, those &#8216;transactions&#8217; expressly include any and all withdrawal of funds from the companies&#8217; bank accounts.  It is difficult to see how any business could be expected to carry on transacting its daily business affairs if cash flow is effectively frozen.  Thus, the apparent concession &#8211; or &#8216;nod&#8217; towards the companies&#8217; two directors &#8211; is nothing of the kind.  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">McGladdery </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">stands firmly in the way of any attempt to prevent dealings by a company if the jurisdiction which H seeks to engage is founded upon <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 37</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>.

Whilst there was a measure of consensus between the parties as to the elements of the without notice order which should remain in place, there was disagreement about one aspect of its terms.  That provision prevented the husband from directly or indirectly engaging in any business which was, or might be, in competition with the family company.  In other words, it restrained the husband from acting in commercial competition with the company which had been the mechanism through which the husband and wife had carried on a successful business over a number of years.  The basis for the wife&#8217;s application was an allegation that the husband was deliberately setting up his rival business in competition with the family business so as to depreciate the value in one of the main matrimonial assets.  Whilst that was an allegation which the husband vigorously denied, the President proceeded on the basis that there was, or might be, a sufficient factual foundation for the wife&#8217;s concerns to justify in principle the continuation of the injunction but only on the basis that there was some appropriate legal basis for doing so.

The issue was whether or not the court should continue a freezing order over the personal assets of two directors of a company who no longer wished to maintain a business relationship with one another.  The company in question was insolvent and the administration petition was based upon the ground that the company&#8217;s assets would be realised with greater financial benefit in the context of an administration order than on a winding up.  It was accepted that there was no necessity to continue the freezing order in relation to the assets of the company but the applicant contended that the freezing order should continue in relation to the assets of the individual directors (which included their homes).  The respondent directors resisted the continuation of the freezing order on the basis that there was no relevant cause of action against either of them.  Pumfrey J agreed and discharged the freezing order.  Whilst it might well be </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">convenient</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> to grant the injunction, a freezing order was a very serious order to make and had the potential to cause grave prejudice to those who were its object.  Where jurisdiction was in issue, arguments as to convenience did not apply.  In circumstances where the claimant could point to no subsisting cause of action against either of the directors, the court had no jurisdiction to consider the merits of arguments relating to whether or not it might be &#8216;just and convenient&#8217; to make the order.</span></p>

The simple question is whether the individual is entitled to the property within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24(1)</ref>(a).

None of the judgments delivered by members of the Supreme Court followed the reasoning or approach of Thorpe LJ&#8217;s dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal.

Sub-paragraphs 17(d) and (e), which Mr Amos seeks to replicate in his new draft order, prevent W and N from using any of the online banking facilities operated by D Ltd and R Ltd in the course of the companies&#8217; day to day business affairs.  Sub-paragraph (e) precludes them from authorising or effecting </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">any</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> transactions by either company.  As the nominated directors of those separate corporate entities, they are thereby placed in a position of economic and managerial paralysis.  Neither can exercise the fiduciary duties and responsibilities which each owes to D Ltd and R Ltd.  H is a director of neither company.  He holds shares in each but this gives him no beneficial entitlement to the underlying corporate assets.  In reality, the relief which he seeks under paragraph 17(d) and (e) is the reinstatement of the control over the management of those companies which he has historically operated through C Ltd.  Whilst it is true that he does not seek any legal remedy in this application which gives him any direct control of those companies through the operation of the bank accounts, as matters presently stand it is Mr F, his long-time employee, who fills those shoes, albeit with the bank&#8217;s blessing.  Whilst Mr Amos submits that the ambit of the order he seeks extends only to the individual personalities of W and N, it seems to me that that is to ignore the dual status each has in these proceedings.  W is a party to the substantive application for financial remedy orders but she is also one of two directors of D Ltd and R Ltd.  N has been joined as a party for these limited purposes but he, too, is the only other director who has a corporate mandate and a fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of both companies. It is difficult, if not impossible, to see how those functions can be discharged if the effect of any order of this court is the partial (if not complete) corporate emasculation of the companies&#8217; two principal officers.  I am not persuaded that H would have any real prospects of success were he to seek an injunction in the Queen&#8217;s Bench or Chancery Divisions preventing them from discharging their responsibilities to D Ltd and R Ltd. Neither of the companies is a party to these proceedings.</span></p>

He points to H&#8217;s election throughout to proceed on the basis of the alternative statutory jurisdictions notwithstanding that N had made it clear from the outset that he would be contending that the court had no jurisdiction to make the without notice orders.  The oral submissions made by H&#8217;s leading counsel at the outset of the hearing before me on 19 June 2015 referred specifically to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">&#8220;two alternative sources of your ladyship&#8217;s jurisdiction in approaching this task: firstly, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 37</ref> of the Matrimonial Causes Act; secondly, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 37</ref> of the Superior Courts Act&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">.  This much is clear from the transcripts with which I have now been provided.  The submission was repeated during the course of the hearing.  Mr Lightman points to the absence from Mr Amos&#8217;s &#8220;Bullet Point Reply&#8221; document (which came to me immediately before the adjourned hearing on 24 June 2015) of any reference to the inherent jurisdiction.  That is all as may be.  However, it seems to me that it is an issue which must be addressed even if there are arguments for another day in relation to costs.  </span></p>

Insofar as Mr Stamler contends that there is inherent jurisdiction in the court to make effective the remedies that it grants, this seems to me merely another way of submitting that, where the power exists to grant the remedy, there must also be inherent in that power the power to make ancillary orders to make that remedy effective.  This I have accepted.  However, if and insofar as he contends that the courts have a general residual discretion to make any order necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties, then in my judgment that is too wide and sweeping a contention to be acceptable.

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">It is certainly true that there has always existed a power to preserve in family proceedings the subject matter of the proceedings where they relate to tangible property as opposed to the chose in action that is money.  That power is now reflected in FPR r 20.1(c)(i) which empowers the court to make an order for the detention, custody or preservation of relevant property.  Such an order preserving a thing in specie can equally be made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37(2)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.  But that power is generally used only to preserve things like chattels, it being usually unnecessary to invoke it in relation to land where the unilateral notice procedure under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/9" uk:canonical="2002 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Land Registration Act 2002</ref> is available.  For an illuminating discussion of this type of order and its differences to a freezing order: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">In re MCA: Customs and Excise Comrs v A; A v A (Long intervening) </span><span style="font-family:Garamond"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 2 FLR 274" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 2 FLR 274</ref>, paras 99-102, per Munby J.  Plainly this general power is not the subject of the principles and safeguards applicable to freezing orders.  An order preserving a picture or a car or a field does not cause the economic paralysis that is the case where an order is made which freezes unspecified assets including money up to a certain figure.  If a bank receives an order which freezes, as here, &#163;20m of assets then even if there are exceptions relating to living expenses, legal costs, and trading in the normal course of business, it will normally freeze all the accounts for the simple reason that it will not know if these exceptions are being met from another account with another bank.  Where there are a number of banks it normally takes many days dealing with the various legal departments to put the exceptions into operation by which time great damage both economically, and reputationally, may have been caused.  Problems of this kind do not arise where the order merely freezes a particular tangible asset in specie.  But it is open to the court to apply the principles and safeguards if the facts justify this.</span></p>

That case concerned the powers exercisable in connection with the grant of a freezing order.  In that case, a freezing order had been granted which prevented Mr Pugachev from removing from the jurisdiction any of his assets up to a value of &#163;1.1 billion.  The prohibition included any interest he had under any discretionary trusts, and an issue arose in relation to the court&#8217;s power to order Mr Pugachev to make full disclosure of those interests and whether they could, in any event, be treated as &#8220;his assets&#8221; for the purposes of the freezing order.    Lewison LJ gave the leading judgment.

The issue is, in my opinion, not whether Park J had jurisdiction, in the strict sense, to make the freezing order but whether it was proper, in the circumstances as they stood at the time he made the order, for him to make it.

I do not doubt that H was significantly shaken by W&#8217;s actions in serving her divorce petition and removing the very substantial funds from the account in which he had placed them (albeit an account in her sole name) to an offshore account in Beirut.  He has explained, and I accept, that these funds were the product of one of the biggest property deals he had done over many years.  The removal of those funds, in tandem with her presentation of a divorce petition, inevitably raised the stakes and caused the proceedings to start their course from a position of mutual hostility and mistrust.  Nevertheless, the parties, with assistance from their first class legal teams, were able to achieve a consensus as to the way forward.  That consensus was embodied in the October agreement.  Each has formally undertaken to the other and to the court that neither will take any steps :-</span></p>

That status quo involved both W and N holding office as directors of C Ltd and as directors of D Ltd and R Ltd.  N was fully involved in the day to day operation of the business both as a director and employee of C Ltd.  I have already referred to the evidence he has exhibited which establishes at least a prima facie case that he had his father&#8217;s authority to bind the company in terms of transactions and other arrangements during periods when his father was absent in Cyprus or elsewhere.  W and N had every expectation that their executive and non-executive roles as officers of these companies would continue under the terms of the holding arrangement embodied in the October agreement.  It gave each the status and capacity to monitor the business which was being conducted as well as any movement of funds into and out of the companies&#8217; various bank accounts.  Insofar as N had his mother&#8217;s confidence, I have no doubt that his continuing status as a director of C Ltd provided her with additional reassurance as to H&#8217;s future conduct. </span></p>

I have within the written material a letter from Mishcon de Reya, solicitors for C Ltd, addressed to W and dated 24 November 2014.  That letter records her appointment as a director on 4 September 2013 but challenges the validity of such appointment.  That was no doubt the opening salvo, but H&#8217;s position is difficult to reconcile with an email sent over a year before by his accountants to H personally.  That email appears to confirm that he had given specific instructions in 2013 to appoint W as a director of C Ltd.  As a consequence, the necessary forms had been lodged with Companies House.</span></p>

Not only were they then effectively excluded from the management of C Ltd, they were prevented from obtaining any information about the substantial rents being collected by or on behalf of the two companies of which they were the only directors.  It was in those circumstances that a formal board meeting was convened, resolutions were passed; and steps were taken to give notice to C Ltd that the management facility provided by that company in respect of the tenanted properties was to be terminated and replaced with an arm&#8217;s length independent arrangement.</span></p>

He sets out at some length the Berenberg d&#233;bacle; he refers to the Declaration of Trust which W executed (dated 13 October 2014) but fails to say anything further about the circumstances in which it came into being, save that his signature was forged; he then launches into a description of the manner in which he received the seven letters giving him notice of the resolutions made by D Ltd and R Ltd.

Yet he makes no reference whatsoever to his own actions in removing them as directors of C Ltd, nor of suspending N from his employment with the company.

There is no reference at all to the steps initiated by H at the end of 2014.  I do not in any sense seek to criticise counsel for this omission.  He was, no doubt, instructed on short notice and his Note for the court follows fairly faithfully the contents of H&#8217;s written statement.  Nevertheless, it is clear from the transcript of that hearing that he sought merely to &#8216;hold the ring&#8217; for the month which would intervene before the First Appointment of W&#8217;s claims for financial remedy orders.  He said, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8220;&#8230; all we wish to do is to stop the pretty obvious and transparent shenanigans that have been going on so that no one is seeking to outwit or undermine the other and we can just get on with what ought to be quite a simple case&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  Read with the benefit of hindsight and the evidence which is now before the court, I regard that statement as unrepresentative of the true picture, innocent though its intention may have been on counsel&#8217;s part.  To describe the company resolutions as &#8220;shenanigans&#8221; connoting secret or dishonest activity or manoeuvrings, without setting them in their proper context, does not do full justice to the true picture.   </span></p>

He sought to justify that step in his written evidence.  Yet he remained silent about the fact W and N had been removed as directors of C Ltd and sought to present the situation as one where he was the innocent victim of an attempted corporate coup.  That, in my judgment, was unacceptable.  Whether or not he would have secured the relief he sought on a without notice basis had he put the full facts before the court, I know not. But I am entirely persuaded that telling one half of the story was a dereliction of his duty of candour given the effect of the relief which he secured</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">

That, he says, is part and parcel of W&#8217;s and N&#8217;s attempts to change the status quo.  He omits to make any reference in his 12 February 2015 statement to the fact that he had taken the very same steps in relation to his elder son&#8217;s occupation over some three years of a residential property in north </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">London</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  He appears to have had a 50% interest in that property and within the written material before the court is a letter written by solicitors serving formal notice to quit on A.  That letter was written on 9 December 2014, the day before he removed W as a director of C Ltd.</span></p>

He states that his signature on that document is forged.  He portrays this document as W&#8217;s &#8220;attempt to divest herself of assets purportedly owned by her&#8221; in favour of N.  He refers to that transaction having been dealt with in the 23 October 2014 agreement.  Yet he makes no reference in his statement to the fact (since admitted) that he had forged W&#8217;s signature on a stock transfer form in April 2014.  Had that transfer been implemented, W&#8217;s 50% shareholding in D Ltd would have been lost and H would have been legally entitled to 100% of the shares in the company. (It is his case that he is beneficially entitled to W&#8217;s 50% interest in any event.)  Again, the parties have very different stories to tell about the circumstances in which this transaction came about.  H now says that W knew perfectly well that he had signed her name on the form and that his intention at the time was to transfer the shares to N.  W denies any such knowledge.  However, in circumstances where he knew this to be a live issue between them and where he had admitted the forgery in solicitors&#8217; correspondence in December 2014 (some two months or more before his without notice application), I  take the view that this fact should have been disclosed as part and parcel of the underlying narrative.  His explanation did not come until 19 March 2015, some two weeks after the first return date, and then only in response to W&#8217;s written evidence and at the court&#8217;s direction.    </span></p>

She could not have foreseen that events would conspire to deprive the parties and the court of adequate time to deal with this matter, nor that the moratorium agreement would subsequently intervene.  Thus, I am looking at the application to reinstate the order which she made in somewhat retrospective, if not slightly artificial, circumstances.  That, nevertheless, is my task in the absence of agreement between the parties as to the way forward.</span></p>

Under the terms of the notices sent to H in respect of the company resolutions, nothing was due to happen for at least a month and the proposed termination of C Ltd&#8217;s provision of services to the companies was then some four months hence.  There was adequate time for proper notice to be given and the matter listed on 19 February 2015 (i.e. one week later) or shortly thereafter even if that hearing was at risk as a fixture.  Judges dealing with an urgent applications list are often asked to hear from respondents who have been given short notice of an application and that, at least, would have presented an opportunity for the court to have heard representations from W and/or N.  I can see nothing in the letters which were sent to H which demonstrates </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8220;an appropriately strong case, supported by evidence of objective facts, rather than mere expressions of suspicion or anxiety, that the respondent(s) owned or had an interest in specified assets and that there was a real risk of dissipation&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">(per Mostyn J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">L v K</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> (above) at para 17).

Indeed, Mr Lightman tells me that the application notice which H&#8217;s solicitors issued on 12 February 2015 has never been formally served on his client in breach of H&#8217;s undertaking given to the court and recorded in paragraph 11 of the without notice order. (This breach by itself is reason, says Mr Lightman, for nor reinstating the order :  see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Bernard Gray v UVW </span><span style="font-family:Garamond"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2010/2367" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 2367 (QB)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 2367 (QB)</ref> at paras 35 to 36.)  Whether or not H was proceeding on the basis that N should be presumed to have known about the application from his mother, it was, in my view, a wholly inappropriate way to proceed.  The order made on 12 February 2015 gave N party status as well as potentially preventing him from properly discharging his functions as a director of D Ltd and R Ltd.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.67in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In my judgment, on this particular point there are arguments on both sides of the coin.  If it had been H&#8217;s genuine intention on 12 February 2015 to secure a freezing order which had the effect of preventing N from &#8220;poaching&#8221; clients from C Ltd (or even from legitimately transacting business with former clients of C Ltd), then it was incumbent upon him, in my view, to put the relevant facts and matters before the court.  His evidence should have explained that this was one of the remedies sought; why that remedy was being sought in the context of the divorce proceedings; why it was necessary; and why the issue should be dealt with as a matter of extreme urgency on a without notice basis in circumstances when N had not even been given formal notice of the application.  None of these steps was taken.  My own view is that in all likelihood H had not foreseen that this would have been the consequence and effect of the without notice order as it was drawn.  There is no reference whatsoever to this outcome in counsel&#8217;s written note or in anything which he said during that hearing.  I am therefore prepared to accept that, whatever instructions he was subsequently to give to his legal team, he was unaware of the potential impact on Z CO when he sought the order on 12 February 2015.  If I am wrong and it had indeed been H&#8217;s genuine intention to capture Z CO within the ambit of the without notice order, it was his duty to inform counsel that this was the case so that appropriate representations could have been made.</span></p>

I have no evidence as to the nature of Z CO&#8217;s current trading activities save for a narrative description of its general business.

He refers to his company&#8217;s website and exhibits to his statement copies of the relevant web pages.  I am satisfied from the correspondence I have seen that since the hearing on 11 March 2015 H, through his solicitors, has never addressed the issue of providing Z CO with an undertaking as to damages.  None is offered now.  I am not in a position to make any findings in relation to whether or not N&#8217;s conduct in operating his new business is causing actual loss to C Ltd nor, if that be the case, whether his activities are such as to justify the grant of injunctive relief in a properly constituted action against N and/or Z CO.  I bear in mind that Mr Amos&#8217;s draft order includes at paragraphs 9 and 11 undertakings to compensate N or anyone other than W and N who has been served with the order if the court finds that loss has been suffered.  However, I am not satisfied that N would be able to claim for such loss in a personal action against H since any such loss will have been suffered by Z CO.  In circumstances where a wrong is done to a company and that company suffers loss, it will impact upon the value of the shares.  If the company is unable or unwilling to claim for those losses, the individual shareholder will be prejudiced unless he can bring a claim of his own.  However, there are substantial obstacles in the path of any individual shareholder seeking to make such a claim.

There was no disclosure in his evidence about the steps which he had taken in November and December 2014 in relation to W&#8217;s and N&#8217;s status vis &#224; vis C Ltd.  Whilst he referred to the fact that he had removed W as company secretary, he said nothing about removing her and N as directors of C Ltd.  In my view, that was a fundamental omission and an unfair presentation.  Even if the circumstances surrounding her appointment were in issue, it was a misrepresentation of the position to present himself as a victim of a unilateral attempt by them to change the status quo.  Their actions in notifying him of the company resolutions take on a very different complexion when seen against the background of the evidence as a whole even in circumstances where certain factual disputes remain untested by the forensic process.  There is no challenge to the underlying fact that it was H who instigated the steps which resulted in their loss of those directorships and, with them, the check and balance which was one of the cornerstones of the October 2014 agreement.  The oblique reference in W&#8217;s solicitors&#8217; letter of 12 February 2015 to N no longer being a director does not, in my judgment, absolve H of his failure to disclose these matters.  The district judge plainly thought on that occasion that she was holding the ring on the basis that it was W and N who were seeking to disrupt the arrangements agreed in October the previous year.  She was not told that the steps which they were proposing to take were, on their case, a defensive reaction to H&#8217;s own departure from the spirit of what had been agreed.</span></p>

He remained silent.  I have already expressed my views as to whether that was his genuine intention at the time.  But even if this was the intention and not some unexpected windfall, there was even more reason to ensure that these matters were dealt with in the context of an inter partes hearing.</span></p>

Whilst I have no doubt that the district judge thought that she was directing the freezing order towards W and N in their personal capacities, there was no proper consideration of how the terms of the proposed freezing order might impact upon that operation, nor the reach of the court&#8217;s jurisdiction where the activity which was to be prevented was that of a properly constituted corporate entity of which H was not, and never had been, a director.</span></p>

W is both a party, as spouse, to the financial remedy application, and a director of two of the family companies.  N has been made a party to the injunction proceedings; he, too, is a director of both companies.  No one apart from W and N has any locus in relation to either D Ltd or R Ltd in terms of the proper management of their legitimate commercial activities.  The companies are not the alter egos of H, W or N.  No one suggests that they are, or that their underlying assets are being held on trust for either of H or W.  The supposed &#8220;shortcut&#8221; which </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Poon </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">might have offered in terms of jurisdiction must now be scrutinised quite carefully in the light of all that was said so recently by the Supreme Court in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Prest v Petrodel</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  It will certainly not be in every case that a party to matrimonial litigation will be able to raise separate corporate legal personality as a shield to an application for an injunction just because he or she happens to be involved in running a family business in one capacity or another.  It must surely all depend upon the circumstances and whether the actions or intended actions upon which the injunction is to bite relate to the actions of the individual per se or the actions of that individual in discharge of his or her corporate obligations and responsibilities.</span></p>

On one view an injunction against W, as a party to matrimonial proceedings, might well be justified as an injunction in personam if there was cogent and reliable evidence of an intention to dissipate assets to the detriment of H&#8217;s financial claims.

They are not to be permitted to authorise or effect any transactions whatsoever in relation to D Ltd and R Ltd other than in the ordinary course of business.  But who else can &#8220;authorise or effect any transactions other than in the ordinary course of business&#8221; if not the companies&#8217; executive officers or directors ?  In undertaking this function, the directors act as the company&#8217;s agents but they are nevertheless discharging their management functions as officers of the company.  As I have already said, it is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine how normal commercial activity can be carried on in a situation of economic paralysis unless every decision in relation to the company&#8217;s transactions is to be monitored by Mr F.

What she and N sought to do was to replace the very loose and informal management structure which had existed during a time when there was no family discord with a more structured approach which enabled them, as directors, to manage properly the companies&#8217; affairs.  Had the parties still been operating under the terms of the October 2014 agreement, no doubt these steps would not have been seen to be necessary.  But they were not, and the reason they were not had nothing to do with the removal of the Berenberg funds or the execution of the October 2014 Declaration of Trust:  those matters had been the catalyst for the October 2014 agreement.  In my view, W and N are justified in their assertion that H&#8217;s actions during November and December 2014 and, in particular, his removal of their status as directors of C Ltd, led to the breakdown of that agreement.  No doubt, as in all these situations when positions become polarised, there was an element of family members jockeying for position and control.  But for my part I cannot see any evidence at present which would enable me to reach a conclusion that the proposed company resolutions would be more likely than not to lead to a diminution in the underlying value of the shares in either D Ltd or R Ltd.  If what H says is true and he has never charged either company for any of the management services C Ltd provides, there would not appear to be any loss of its income stream from this source for C Ltd.  Further, there is prima facie evidence from N that an independent property management arrangement can be put in place for no more than the cost of the financial benefits which are presently being made available to Mr F for discharging that function.  </span></p>

If and insofar as he is concerned that her removal of the Berenberg funds is evidence which suggests she may be inclined to remove or spirit away funds belonging to D Ltd or R Ltd, each of W and N have offered undertakings that neither will enter into any transactions or withdraw any monies from those companies&#8217; respective bank accounts other than in the ordinary course of business.  </span></p>

That may well have been a regime which was acceptable whilst family harmony reigned but the recent breakdown in his relationship with both his wife and sons in the current circumstances of the divorce is also a relevant factor which falls to be considered.  In terms of the immediate status quo, I do not accept that his actions in removing them as directors had no effect upon the family or corporate dynamic.  I do accept that there was a significant element of reaction to his own actions in their decision as directors to put matters on a more transparent and formal footing.  In relation to Mr Amos&#8217; &#8220;collateral points&#8221; (see para 26 (iv) of his skeleton argument), these seem to me to be matters which have been largely litigated in correspondence and matters over which each side takes a very different view.  </span></p>

That latter order reflected what Mr Pointer described as &#8220;a bit of give and take on both sides&#8221;.  It seemed to me a very sensible resolution of matters, but H has rejected it as a continuing solution because he does not want to be bound by the moratorium in respect of his litigation against his sons in other proceedings ongoing in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division.  By his proposed order, Mr Amos on H&#8217;s behalf seeks to reintroduce the very injunctions about which W and N complain and which they contend will restrict their ability to discharge their duties as directors of the companies.</span></p>
