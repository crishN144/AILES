Secondly, if C remains in the foster home, what contact should she have with her mother and siblings?  Thirdly, is a further assessment necessary for the purposes of these decisions?

She complains of what she describes as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;mud-slinging</span>&#8221; and of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">hate crimes</span>&#8221; against her. The overall position is that M truly believes or has persuaded herself that her predicament arises from the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I am different</span>&#8221;. This self-pitying attitude demonstrates that she lacks the ability to meet the needs of these needy children, and taking the fullest account of Ms McMillan&#8217;s submissions, I conclude firstly that there is no possibility of M being able to parent C safely at any foreseeable point in the future, and secondly that she is highly unlikely to accept this, and that C must be protected accordingly.</p>

She needs to establish herself in her long term foster home without subtle and less subtle signals from her Mother that she should not be there.

I urge the Local Authority to be imaginative in supplying, and if necessary paying for, any help that might be acceptable to B.  She is a spirited and deserving young person, who is going to need help in the years to come and beyond.  </p>

I will consider what directions should be given in relation to resolving C&#8217;s status and I will give consideration with the parties&#8217; assistance to the issue of publication of judgments in due course.  The case obviously raises matters of genuine concern in a number of areas that deserve consideration elsewhere provided that can be done without adding to the harm to the children.  </p>

Because M has made a number of blanket complaints against professionals, I approve that initiative in principal, subject to the details. M is a potentially plausible complainer to the uninformed, or those whose only information comes from her. </p>
