	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">This is an application by AB, the mother of XY, for a declaration that she and CD (the father of XY) have the ability in law to consent on behalf of XY to the administration of hormone treatment to suppress puberty, known as puberty blockers (&#8220;PBs&#8221;). The application is made in the light of the Divisional Court decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell v The Tavistock</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and Portman NHS Foundation Trust &amp; Ors</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2020/3274" uk:canonical="[2020] EWHC 3274 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWHC 3274 (Admin)</ref> (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span>&#8221;). The issue in broad terms is whether XY&#8217;s parents can consent to the treatment or whether the decision as to whether XY should be prescribed PBs should come before the Court, either as a matter of legal requirement or as a matter of good practice.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">The background to the services provided at GIDS, the process of taking consent and the nature and effect of puberty blockers is set out in the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span>. I do not intend to repeat the analysis set out therein. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span> is currently awaiting a hearing on appeal in the Court of Appeal. Ms Butler-Cole raised the possibility that I should adjourn this case pending the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span>. None of the parties asked me to adjourn, and indeed all urged me to proceed to hear the case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">The legal issues in this case are different from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span> because, as was said at [47] in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span>, the question of whether parents could consent to the treatment was not considered in the judgment. On the basis of the submissions in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span> from the current Second and Third Respondents, it appeared that the administration of PBs would not continue on the basis of parental consent alone. It was not suggested to the Divisional Court that GPs could, and in some cases would, proceed with the administration solely on the basis of parental consent.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">However, the Second and Third Respondents say that for those patients currently receiving treatment with PBs, as opposed to new patients, given that a stay has been granted in respect of [138] of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span> and the extreme distress these children and young persons would suffer if the treatment was not continued, treatment should continue on the basis of parental consent alone as long as the patient continues to want the treatment. Therefore, the issue of the scope of parental consent and the role of the Court has become a live one.  </p>

I should be entirely clear that even if I was not in effect bound by <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell,</span> I self-evidently entirely agree with its analysis and conclusions having been one member of the Divisional Court.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">There was some suggestion that if I found that the parents could not consent, I should carry out a best interests analysis of whether or not it was in XY&#8217;s best interests to receive the PBs. I took the view that this was not an appropriate course to follow. Although I could have heard oral evidence from Professor Butler, Consultant Endocrinologist at the Second Respondent, who had interviewed XY, I had no independent evidence from Cafcass as to XY&#8217;s best interests, Cafcass not having been invited by the Court to act as Guardian for XY. I therefore did not consider that I was in a proper position to carry out a best interests assessment.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">The starting point is to consider the nature of the treatment proposed. The administration of PBs to people going through puberty is a very unusual treatment for the following reasons. Firstly, there is real uncertainty over the short and long-term consequences of the treatment with very limited evidence as to its efficacy, or indeed quite what it is seeking to achieve. This means it is, in our view, properly described as experimental treatment. Secondly, there is a lack of clarity over the purpose of the treatment: in particular, whether it provides a &#8220;pause to think&#8221; in a &#8220;hormone neutral&#8221; state or is a treatment to limit the effects of puberty, and thus the need for greater surgical and chemical intervention later, as referred to in the Health Research Authority report. Thirdly, the consequences of the treatment are highly complex and potentially lifelong and life changing in the most fundamental way imaginable. The treatment goes to the heart of an individual&#8217;s identity, and is thus, quite possibly, unique as a medical treatment.    </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.37in"><span style="font-style:italic">Furthermore, the nature and the purpose of the medical intervention must be considered. The condition being treated, GD, has no direct physical manifestation. In contrast, the treatment provided for that condition has direct physical consequences, as the medication is intended to and does prevent the physical changes that would otherwise occur within the body, in particular by stopping the biological and physical development that would otherwise take place at that age. There is also an issue as to whether GD is properly categorised as a psychological condition, as the DSM-5 appears to do, although we recognise there are those who would not wish to see the condition categorised in that way. Be that as it may, in our judgment for the reasons already identified, the clinical intervention we are concerned with here is different in kind to other treatments or clinical interventions. In other cases, medical treatment is used to remedy, or alleviate the symptoms of, a diagnosed physical or mental condition, and the effects of that treatment are direct and usually apparent.  The position in relation to puberty blockers would not seem to reflect that description.  </span></p>

Those that are a direct result of taking the PBs themselves, and those that follow on from progression to Stage 2, that is taking cross-sex hormones. The defendant and the Trusts argue that Stage 1 and 2 are entirely separate; a child can stop taking PBs at any time and that Stage 1 is fully reversible. It is said therefore the child needs only to understand the implications of taking PBs alone to be Gillick competent. In our view this does not reflect the reality. The evidence shows that the vast majority of children who take PBs move on to take cross-sex hormones, that Stages 1 and 2 are two stages of one clinical pathway and once on that pathway it is extremely rare for a child to get off it.  </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.37in"><span style="font-style:italic">The defendant argues that PBs give the child &#8220;time to think&#8221;, that is, to decide whether or not to proceed to cross-sex hormones or to revert to development in the natal sex. But the use of puberty blockers is not itself a neutral process by which time stands still for the child on PBs, whether physically or psychologically. PBs prevent the child going through puberty in the normal biological process. As a minimum it seems to us that this means that the child is not undergoing the physical and consequential psychological changes which would contribute to the understanding of a person&#8217;s identity. There is an argument that for some children at least, this may confirm the child&#8217;s chosen gender identity at the time they begin the use of puberty blockers and to that extent, confirm their GD and increase the likelihood of some children moving on to cross-sex hormones. Indeed, the statistical correlation between the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones supports the case that it is appropriate to view PBs as a stepping stone to cross-sex hormones.&#8221; </span></p>

The local authority had consented on her behalf to the treatment, but when she indicated in a &#8220;lucid moment&#8221; that she would refuse the treatment, the local authority withdrew its consent. The judge at first instance held that he could not override the decision of a competent minor, and therefore the treatment could not be given. The Official Solicitor appealed. The Court of Appeal held that the Court, in the exercise of its wardship jurisdiction, could override a minor&#8217;s decision. It can therefore be seen that Lord Donaldson&#8217;s comments about whether the parents of a <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competent child could consent to treatment on her behalf were obiter.

		    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;What Mr. Munby's argument overlooks is that Lord Scarman was discussing the parents' right "to determine whether or not their minor child below the age of 16 will have medical treatment" (my emphasis) and this is the "parental right" to which he was referring at p. 186D. A right of determination is wider than a right to consent. The parents can only have a right of determination if either the child has no right to consent, that is, is not a keyholder, or the parents hold a master key which could nullify the child's consent. I do not understand Lord Scarman to be saying that, if a child was "Gillick competent," to adopt the convenient phrase used in argument, the parents ceased to have an independent right of consent as contrasted with ceasing to have a right of determination, that is, a veto. In a case in which the "Gillick competent" child refuses treatment, but the parents consent, that consent enables treatment to be undertaken lawfully, but in no way determines that the child shall be so treated. In a case in which the positions are reversed, it is the child's consent which is the enabling factor and again the parents' refusal of consent is not determinative. If Lord Scarman intended to go further than this and to say that in the case of a "Gillick competent" child, a parent has no right either to consent or to refuse consent, his remarks were obiter, because the only question in issue was Mrs. Gillick's alleged right of veto. Furthermore I consider that they would have been wrong. [Re R 23E-H] </span></p>

The very essence of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> is, in my view, that a parent&#8217;s right to consent or &#8220;determine&#8221; treatment cannot trump or overbear the decision of the child. Therefore, the doctors could lawfully advise and treat the child without her mother&#8217;s knowledge or consent. In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span>, the parent did not have the right to know that the treatment was being given, so it makes little sense to assume that the parent could act to stop the child&#8217;s decision being operative on whether the treatment takes place or not. I cannot accept that Lord Scarman was drawing the distinction between the child making the decision and the parent being able to give legally operative consent that Lord Donaldson seems to have drawn in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R</span>. Mrs Gillick was asserting a right to &#8220;decide&#8221; whether her daughter could be given advice and treatment without her knowledge, and thus without her consent. Therefore, the distinction that Lord Donaldson seeks to draw between the parent retaining a right to consent, but not being in a position to determine the treatment, does not accord with the issue in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span>.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">However, in the present case, the parent and the child are in agreement. Therefore, the issue here is whether the parents&#8217; ability to consent disappears once the child achieves <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competence in respect of the specific decision even where both the parents and child agree. In my view it does not. The parents retain parental responsibility in law and the rights and duties that go with that. One of those duties is to make a decision as to consent in medical treatment cases where the child cannot do so. The parent cannot use that right to &#8220;trump&#8221; the child&#8217;s decision, so much follows from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span>, but if the child fails to make a decision then the parent&#8217;s ability to do so continues. At the heart of the issue is that the parents&#8217; &#8220;right&#8221; to consent is always for the purpose of ensuring the child&#8217;s best interests. If the child does not, for whatever reason, make the relevant decision then the parents continue to have the responsibility (and thus the right) to give valid consent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This might arise if the child is unable to make the decision, for example is unconscious. However, it could also arise if the child declines to make the decision, perhaps because although <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competent she finds the whole situation too overwhelming and would rather her parents make the decision on her behalf. In the present case, in the light of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span>, and the particular issues around <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competence explained in that judgment, it has not been possible to ascertain whether the child is competent. In this case, there are two options. If the child is <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competent, she has not objected to her parent giving consent on her behalf. As such, a doctor can rely on the consent given by her parents. Alternatively, the child is not <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competent. In that case, her parents can consent on her behalf. It is not necessary for me or a doctor to investigate which route applies to give the parents authority to give consent. Therefore, in my view, whether or not XY is <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competent to make the decision about PBs, her parents retain the parental right to consent to that treatment.  </p>

Firstly, the judgments concerning medical treatment decisions that should be brought to court are sometimes less than clear as to whether they are referring to a legal requirement or merely to good practice. However, it is in most cases probably a distinction without much difference. If it is good practice to apply to the Court, then if a clinician does not do so s/he is at risk of considerable criticism and possibly disciplinary action by the professional body. Therefore, a principle of good practice may have a very similar effect to a legal requirement.  </p>

A doctor performing a sterilisation operation with the consent of the parents might still be liable in criminal, civil or professional proceedings. A court exercising the wardship jurisdiction emanating from the Crown is the only authority which is empowered to authorise such a drastic step as sterilisation after a full and informed investigation. The girl will be represented by the Official Solicitor or some other appropriate guardian; the parents will be made parties if they wish to appear and where appropriate the local authority will also appear. Expert evidence will be adduced setting out the reasons for the application, the history, conditions, circumstances and foreseeable future of the girl, the risks and consequences of pregnancy, the risks and consequences of sterilisation, the practicability of alternative precautions against pregnancy and any other relevant information. The judge may order additional evidence to be obtained. In my opinion, a decision should only be made by a High Court judge. In the Family Division a judge is selected for his or her experience, ability and compassion. No one has suggested a more satisfactory tribunal or a more satisfactory method of reaching a decision which vitally concerns an individual but also involves principles of law, ethics and medical practice. Applications for sterilisation will be rare. Sometimes the judge will conclude that a sufficiently overwhelming case has not been established to justify interference with the fundamental right of a girl to bear a child; this was the case in In Re D. (A Minor) (Wardship: Sterilisation) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1976] Fam. 185" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1976">[1976] Fam. 185</ref> . But in the present case the judge was satisfied that it would be cruel to expose the girl to an unacceptable risk of pregnancy which could only be obviated by sterilisation in order to prevent child bearing and childbirth in circumstances of uncomprehending fear and pain and risk of physical injury. In such a case the judge was under a duty and had the courage to authorise sterilisation.&#8221;  </span></p>

That question is whether, in the case of an operation for the sterilisation of an adult woman of child-bearing age, who is mentally disabled from giving or refusing her consent to it, although involvement of the court is not strictly necessary as a matter of law, it is nevertheless highly desirable as a matter of good practice. In considering that question, it is necessary to have regard to the special features of such an operation. These features are: first, the operation will in most cases be irreversible; secondly, by reason of the general irreversibility of the operation, the almost certain result of it will be to deprive the woman concerned of what is widely, and as I think rightly, regarded as one of the fundamental rights of a woman, namely, the right to bear children; thirdly, the deprivation of that right gives rise to moral and emotional considerations to which many people attach great importance; fourthly, if the question whether the operation is in the best interests of the woman is left to be decided without the involvement of the court, there may be a greater risk of it being decided wrongly, or at least of it being thought to have been decided wrongly; fifthly, if there is no involvement of the court, there is a risk of the operation being carried out for improper reasons or with improper motives; and, sixthly, involvement of the court in the decision to operate, if that is the decision reached, should serve to protect the doctor or doctors who perform the operation, and any others who may be concerned in it, from subsequent adverse criticisms or claims.&#8221; </span></p>

Although this appeal does not raise that question directly, we have heard argument on the point and I would wish to state this opinion. The President&#8217;s test was necessarily expressed in broad terms. Anything so stated offers a margin to whoever interprets and applies it. In my opinion, any interpretation and application should incline towards the strict and avoid the liberal. The courts are not overburdened with applications in this field. Indeed they are rare. In view of the importance of the subject, if a particular case lies anywhere near the boundary line it should be referred to the court by way of application for a declaration of lawfulness.&#8221; </span></p>

I place limited weight on these safeguards given the risk of a unanimity of view within the clinical group in this very particular and unusual field, leading to no reference being made. I note that despite the intensely difficult issues raised neither the Second nor Third Respondents have ever felt it necessary or appropriate to apply to the Court for approval of the prescription of PBs to children, even when those children are well below the age of 16.  However, these safeguards do exist, and might in some circumstances be useful.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">The analysis of the caselaw shows that the cases supporting a special category of treatment of children which require Court approval are very limited. In fact, the only case where the Court has found a legal requirement to come to Court in respect of treatment of a child, where both parents consent, is Heilbron J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D</span>, the case of a &#8220;non-therapeutic&#8221; sterilisation of an 11 year old. In all other contexts, including where the parental decision will lead to the child&#8217;s life ending, the Court has imposed no such requirement. There are a range of cases where there does have to be Court approval, but this is where there is a clinical disagreement; possible alternative treatment of the medical condition in issue; or the decision is, in the opinion of clinicians, finely balanced. These are fact specific instances rather than examples of any special category of treatment where the Court&#8217;s role is required simply because of the nature of the treatment.  </p>

For children, their parents would normally be in a legal position to consent to treatment on their behalf. For incapacitated adults there is no such person and therefore the State has a protective function and the Court has a different legal role. The Court is not displacing some other person, namely the parents, with statutory and moral rights and duties.  </p>

I accept that I am somewhat hampered by the fact that no party was putting this argument. The factors from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span> which would be relied upon in this regard would, I assume, be the poor evidence base for PBs; the lack of full and long term testing; the fact their use is highly controversial, including within the medical community; and the lifelong and lifechanging consequences of the treatment, which in some ways are irreversible. The ratio of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span> is that a child is very unlikely to be in a position to understand and weigh up these factors. </p>

They are adults with full capacity and as the people who know their child best, and care for them the most, will be in a position to reach a fully informed decision.

The gravity of the decision to consent to PBs is very great, but it is no more enormous than consenting to a child being allowed to die. Equally, the essentially experimental nature of PBs should give any parent pause for thought, but parents can and do routinely consent on their child&#8217;s behalf to experimental treatment, sometimes with considerable, including life-changing, potential side-effects. It is apparent from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bell</span> that PBs raise unique ethical issues. However, adopting Lady Black in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">NHS v Y</span>, I am wary of the Court becoming too involved in highly complex moral and ethical issues on a generalised, rather than case specific, basis.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">I do have two points of particular concern about parents giving consent for PBs for children with Gender Dysphoria. The use of PBs for children with Gender Dysphoria raises unique and highly controversial ethical issues. The division of clinical and ethical views has become highly polarised. I have read the evidence of Professor Graham who refers to the studies supporting their use, but those studies themselves come from a very small group of institutions and it is not possible for me to assess the degree to which they have been peer reviewed or attract a consensus of support amongst the clinical and academic community. These are precisely the type of matters which are best assessed in a regulatory and academic setting and not through litigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">This context for PBs gives rise to the two concerns. The first is that within the structure of the Second and Third Respondents, it may be that clinical difference and disagreement will not necessarily be fully exposed. The taking of strong, and perhaps fixed, positions as to the appropriateness of the use of PBs may make it difficult for a parent to be given a truly independent second opinion. However, in my view this is a matter for the various regulatory bodies, NHS England and the Care Quality Commission, to address when imposing standards and good practice on the Second and Third Respondents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">It may well be that, given the particular issues involved, additional safeguards should be built into the clinical decision making, for example by a requirement for an independent second opinion. Any such requirement is a matter for the regulatory and oversight bodies and may be a matter considered by the Cass Review. My view is that this is likely to be a better safeguard for the very vulnerable children concerned rather than removing the ability in law of the parents giving consent. The clinical expert who gave the second opinion could then have a role in advising whether or not the particular case should be brought to Court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">My second particular concern is that of the pressure that may be placed by the children in issue upon their parents. Where a child has Gender Dysphoria and is convinced that s/he should be prescribed PBs, it is likely to be very hard for parents to refuse to consent. One does not have to be a child psychologist to appreciate the tensions that may arise within a family in this situation. I would describe this as &#8220;reverse pressure&#8221; and, although I have no evidence about it, it seems obvious that the problem could arise and the Second and Third Respondents are plainly alive to the issue. </p>

There is no evidence that they feel forced to give consent, somewhat reluctantly, because XY has placed undue pressure upon them. </p>

If the clinicians, or indeed any one of them, is concerned that the parents are being pressured to give consent, then I have no doubt such a case should be brought to Court.  </p>
