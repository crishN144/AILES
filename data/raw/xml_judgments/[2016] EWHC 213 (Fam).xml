	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015 W parted company with her previous solicitors and instructed those who now act on her behalf.  The new legal team took a different view as to the appropriateness of the apparent concessions in the agreed order placed before Holman J.  An application was made to reopen the Article 31 issue and to advance two new arguments. The first was that W was seeking claims and declarations within the Part III application that she argued were not directly against H and thus no immunity arose. The second was in relation to Article 39 (1) of the VCDR. H&#8217;s legal team objected to these courses.  Given the nature of H&#8217;s own arguments and their profound consequences for W if they succeeded, it struck me as essentially unfair to her to deny her the opportunity of putting any arguments that may be at her disposal.   There could be no prejudice to H because the arguments under Article 31 had been prepared (and in written form) on his side, for the hearing before Holman J.  There is no basis either for shutting out the new argument under Article 39, having regard to the quasi-inquisitorial role of the court in proceedings of this kind:  <span style="font-weight:bold">(Parra v Parra <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 942" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 942</ref>; Wyatt v Vince <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2015/14" uk:canonical="[2015] UKSC 14" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] UKSC 14</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 1 WLR 1228" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 1 WLR 1228</ref>).</span></p>

Mr Owen Q.C. (for W) and Mr Chamberlain Q.C. (for H) have argued the public international law issues surrounding the entitlement to diplomatic privileges and immunity.

I am bound to say that the artificiality of that situation struck me as unsustainable and, on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016, I made a request to the FCO for a certificate.  It arrived the following day in the format required (a Section 8 certificate), confirming H&#8217;s appointment as &#8216;a Permanent Representative of St Lucia to the International Maritime Organisation&#8217;. It also confirmed that such was notified to the FCO on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2014 and that his arrival date was notified as 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2014, from which date he has enjoyed the privileges and immunities as a member of the diplomatic staff of a mission.

However, the existence of this certificate, it is submitted, does not alter W&#8217;s submission in relation to Article 39 at all.  It remains, says Mr Owen, necessary to determine whether H has in reality taken up the post or alternatively, if he has, whether he continues in that post.  The central submission, which requires to be stated clearly, is that H sought out and obtained &#8216;the post&#8217; in order specifically to defeat W&#8217;s financial claims consequent upon the divorce.  This, it is argued, is the only sensible inference from the available facts.

So, too, if the defendant had ceased to be en poste while the plaint was still outstanding the action could then have proceeded against him.

The discharge of the functions of office is equated with the protection from suit.  Here says Mr Owen, H, on the facts of this case, was never &#8216;en poste&#8217; at any stage.  He develops this in his submission that there would be a violation of Article 6 of the ECHR if the court upholds immunity in a case where a person holds a diplomatic title and is not, in truth, performing any diplomatic functions.  Article 6 is said to be relevant because it expresses a universally recognised principle of law as a legitimate aid to interpreting legislation generally (post the introduction of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>) but particularly to interpreting an international treaty under <span style="font-weight:bold">Article </span>31 (3) (c) of the <span style="font-weight:bold">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. </span>This requires to be read in full:</p>

However, where the proceedings relate to employment in a foreign mission or embassy, international practice is divided on the question whether State immunity continues to apply and, if it does so apply, whether it covers disputes relating to the contracts of all staff or only more senior members of the mission. Certainly, it cannot be said that the United Kingdom is alone in holding that immunity attaches to suits by employees at diplomatic missions or that, in affording such immunity, the United Kingdom falls outside any currently accepted international standards. </span></p>

The Court is not aware of any trend in international law towards a relaxation of the rule of State immunity as regards issues of recruitment to foreign missions. In this respect, the Court notes that it appears clearly from the materials referred to above (see paragraph 19) that the International Law Commission did not intend to exclude the application of State immunity where the subject of proceedings was recruitment, including recruitment to a diplomatic mission.</span></p>

In my view, although there are important differences between state immunity and diplomatic immunity, these differences are immaterial to the point of principle that the court enunciated at para 36. The central point is that restrictions on the right of access to court which reflect generally recognised rules of public international law cannot in principle be regarded as disproportionate. The court added that this is so even if international practice as to the meaning or scope of an international obligation is inconsistent, provided that the interpretation applied by the state in question is reasonable and falls within currently accepted international standards.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Diplomatic immunity, as has been stressed, is functional.  This is apparent in the establishment of exceptions relating to the diplomat&#8217;s private holding of immovable property in the receiving State.   What in fact constitutes &#8216;a real action&#8217; (i.e. relating to immovable property) has been the subject of extensive submissions by Mr Howard which I will address below but I mention it here because it illustrates the progressive development of diplomatic law in recognising the need to strike a balance between that which could impede the effectiveness of the diplomat in post and the conflicting need to minimise abuse of diplomatic immunity where it is unjustified or, for example, in the context of land, might leave a Claimant with no possible forum in which to resolve a dispute.  Denza notes that this functional approach had the general effect of tightening the protection given to the diplomatic mission itself i.e. its premises, property, communication and archives.  Conversely, it circumscribed the occasions when privilege or immunity could be invoked in regard to essentially private activities of individuals.  All this, as Lord Dyson observed, resonates with the objectives set out in the preamble to VCDR:</p>

The preamble to the 1961 Convention records that "the purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions as representing States". Thus, as Mr Eicke says, even if the detailed rules of international law relating to state immunity have been altered by the 2004 Convention, it does not follow that the international law principles relating to diplomatic immunity must follow suit.&#8221;</span></p>

But it must be remembered that the outcome merely reflects policy choices already made. Policymakers&#8230;.have believed that diplomatic immunity not only ensures the efficient functioning of diplomatic missions in foreign states, but fosters good will and enhances relations among nations. Thus, they have determined that apparent inequity to a private individual is outweighed by the great injury to the public that would arise from permitting suit against the entity or its agent calling for application of immunity.

It is this balance which both underlies the policy considerations and establishes the proportionality of the restriction in ECHR terms.  If &#8216;functionality&#8217; is extracted from the equation, because no functions have been discharged or, to adopt Diplock LJ&#8217;s terms, the diplomat is not &#8216;en poste&#8217;, there can remain only unjustified privilege or immunity linked solely to the private activities of an individual.  If such is the case both the policy considerations and the proportionality of restriction can not be justified in Convention terms and cannot be said to pursue a legitimate claim sufficient to eclipse W&#8217;s right of access to a court.  </p>

During the course of submissions I was taken to a document in the correspondence section of the bundle.  The document is headed &#8216;Affidavit of Sir Ivor Roberts, KCMG, MA (Oxon) FCIL, President of Trinity College, Oxford.&#8217;  Unfortunately, this had not been drawn to Mr Pointer&#8217;s attention earlier.  He contended that the document had been insinuated into the bundle for purely prejudicial effect and that I should disregard it altogether.  With respect, I disagree.  The affidavit was prepared, as I understand it, in judicial review proceedings in the High Court of St Lucia which I have been told remain extant.  Sir Ivor&#8217;s contribution was to provide the Court with an expert opinion on certain matters of international law, practice and custom concerning the appointment of ambassadors and the waiving of diplomatic immunity.  No permission for the instruction of an expert has been sought in this case and accordingly I do not propose to have any regard to any opinions expressed in that document.  Of course in taking this course I imply absolutely no discourtesy to Sir Ivor whose distinguished career as a diplomat and an academic require no encomium from me. I am however entitled to draw on factual material from the affidavit, though I do so largely where that is replicated elsewhere.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Respect for the principles of international comity, recognition that diplomatic immunity fosters goodwill amongst nations and facilitates efficient functioning of diplomatic missions is plainly very important, but all this is predicated on the privileges afforded to the post itself and not to the individual.  Not only is this implicit in all the authorities considered above but it is a part of the principles that have shaped the evolution of diplomatic law.  The proportionality exercise reviewed by Lord Dyson in <span style="font-weight:bold">Reyes v Al- Malki</span> (supra) balances the competing interests of the cluster of factors which give definition to the principle of international comity alongside the Article 6 rights of the individual.  Here &#8216;comity&#8217; cannot be weighed into the balance at all when the post itself is a mere empty husk.  Alternatively, if it can, it falls on the opposite side of the scales.  In these circumstances it undermines the very substance of the principle itself.  It follows that I am not prepared to accede to H&#8217;s request to strike out W&#8217;s Part III claim on his spurious assertion of diplomatic immunity, as I find it to be.  </p>

Mrs Jiminez was a Philippines national. She had travelled to England for a holiday, but had been unable to return due to a natural disaster in her home country.  She took a position as a cook at the Namibian High Commission for several years, and later claimed exemption from income tax.  This was refused, primarily because there had been no formal notice of her appointment as a diplomatic agent.  Mr John Walters QC, sitting as a Special Commissioner of Income Tax, considered whether Mrs Jiminez had been &#8216;permanently resident&#8217; in the UK.  His analysis (below) was cited by the advocates for both parties in this case.  It reads as follows:</p>

I must apply &#8216;broad principles of general acceptation&#8217; in the search for the &#8216;true autonomous and international meaning&#8217; of the expression as it is used in the context of art 37(3) of the 1961 Convention.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

It seems to me that the intention of permanent or indefinite residence which falls to be considered in the context of the domicile issue is not the same (or even a similar) concept as or the concept of whether a person who is a foreign national is permanently resident in the receiving state, so as thereby to be deprived of privileges and immunities (including exemption from tax) under the 1961 Convention. I am not surprised by the conclusion that &#8216;permanently resident&#8217; for these purposes effectively means resident for a purpose unconnected with the holding of the status of membership of the mission. In this sense, it is simply the converse of impermanently resident for the purposes of the mission.&#8221;</span></p>

Whilst I entirely agree that some form of balance sheet may be of assistance to judges, its use should be no more than an aide memoire of the key factors and how they match up against each other. If a balance sheet is used it should be a route to judgment and not a substitution for the judgment itself. A key step in any welfare evaluation is the attribution of weight, or lack of it, to each of the relevant considerations; one danger that may arise from setting out all the relevant factors in tabular format, is that the attribution of weight may be lost, with all elements of the table having equal value as in a map without contours.&#8221;</span></p>

In his Skeleton Argument Mr Owen QC helpfully distil the approach taken by other jurisdictions, relying on Professors Denza&#8217;s work (referred to above).  Unsurprisingly, his survey reveals that various foreign jurisdictions interpret &#8216;permanent residence&#8217; in slightly different ways.  The FCO Note (1969) has internationally been very persuasive and predictably therefore there is emphasis on the &#8216;fact specific&#8217; nature of each enquiry.

Though that is superficially attractive, it does not withstand scrutiny.  Each of the concepts is different, perhaps sometimes subtly.  Neither do I accept the submission that a greater of degree of proof is required to establish &#8216;permanent residence&#8217; as opposed to, for example, &#8216;habitual residence&#8217;.

In my view, it is the former. It is one thing to say that a child's integration in the place where he is at present depends upon the degree of integration of his primary carer. It is another thing to say that he can be integrated in a place to which his primary carer has never taken him. It is one thing to say that a person can remain habitually resident in a country from which he is temporarily absent. It is another thing to say that a person can acquire a habitual residence without ever setting foot in a country. It is one thing to say that a child is integrated in the family environment of his primary carer and siblings. It is another thing to say that he is also integrated into the social environment of a country where he has never been.&#8221;</span></p>

As Heraclitus observed, in the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century: &#8220;There is nothing permanent except change&#8221;.  Langton J may well have had this in mind when he talked of an &#8216;unlimited period&#8217; which need not necessarily be &#8216;irrevocable&#8217;, in contrast to Evershed MR &#8216;continuing to reside there until you die&#8217;.  All this however serves to illustrate the point that, in this international law context, the intention of the propositus is highly relevant, though not determinative.   It will be necessary to survey the wider picture of H&#8217;s life, both to evaluate his degree of integration into any particular place as well as to infer his intentions from the facts.   </p>

The fact that H does not enjoy leave to remain in the UK and that he is only permitted to visit for 180 days per year seems to drag the conclusion towards Saudi Arabia.  Mr Pointer&#8217;s team have spent considerable time and effort drawing up a table setting out the number of nights H has spent in the UK on a yearly basis since 2009.  That data has been further refined to include the average duration of trips to the UK and also the unbroken sequence of days spent here.  This is helpful so far as it goes but, in my view, a qualitative rather than quantitative assessment is likely to illuminate intention more accurately.  Of all the matters identified at para 50 one is, to my mind, magnetic in its attraction.  H has been married three times.  On each occasion the marriage produced children.  For each reconstituted family unit the family home was based in the UK.  W herself is habitually resident in the UK.  The children of the first two marriages have all been educated here and, inevitably, all speak English.  The youngest child, now from the third marriage, is pre-school age.  There are three homes in the UK.  </p>

When the circumstances of his life cause him to repeat that same decision throughout three marriages, it seems to me to signal an intention which is &#8216;unlimited in period&#8217;, to adopt Langton J&#8217;s phrase and therefore to qualify as permanent.   I very much agree with Mr Pointer that both the case law and the Circular require me to give significant weight to H&#8217;s intentions but I have, on the facts of this case, come to a different conclusion from that contended by Mr Pointer.  The evidence points very strongly, in my view, to establishing that these were the arrangements before H&#8217;s appointment and, on the basis that past behaviour is often a reliable predictor of future intention, the status quo was likely to continue.  On this basis H also fails the &#8216;but for&#8217; test in <span style="font-weight:bold">Jiminez v IRC</span> (see para 48 above).

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;The Supreme Court affirmed at [35] that, as a matter of general law, a court may pierce the corporate veil if and only if that owner/controller deliberately seeks to avoid an existing legal obligation by interposing the company. The Supreme Court then confirmed at [37]-[41] that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> does not give the court any broader power to pierce the corporate veil than that already available under the general law. Allowing a broader power in ancillary relief claims would cut across the schemes of company and insolvency law, which are essential for the protection of those dealing with companies. As Lord Sumption made clear at [40], &#8220;[t]here is nothing in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> and nothing in its purpose or broader social context to indicate that the legislature intended to authorise the transfer by one party to the marriage to the other of property which was not his to transfer.&#8221; See also Lady Hale at [86], to the same effect.&#8221;</span></p>
