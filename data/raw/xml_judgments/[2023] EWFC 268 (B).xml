Although the uncle has not been subject to such an assessment, it seemed obvious to me that he too needed some support during this hearing.  The mother was supported by an intermediary, and I have allowed frequent breaks and encouraged appropriate questioning of the parties when they gave their evidence.  I am satisfied that all three adults have had every opportunity to properly present their evidence and their case.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The proceedings were issued on 25&#160;March&#160;2022 when the Local&#160;Authority issued an application for care orders in respect of not only A and B, but two older children of the mother, C now aged 16 and D now aged 13.  The issues in relation to those older children were very different from those in relation to A and B.  Therefore, I split off the case of the two older children, and it concluded earlier this year, where I made care orders in respect of those children and approved a care plan of long-term foster care.  I am happy to report that what I hear of the progress of those children is all very positive.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">What was it that led to the proceedings?  Shortly before 11 o&#8217;clock on the evening of 10&#160;March&#160;2022, a 999 call was made for an ambulance. That call was placed by the uncle.  He told the call handler that there had been an accident, that his niece, B, then 27 days old, had been knocked from her baby bouncer by his dog, and that she had banged her head.</span></p>

B could be heard screaming in the background and, at points in the conversation, the uncle was prompted by the father with details about B, such as her date of birth.</span></p>

The uncle told me that they had, first of all, attempted to take B to an out-of-hours service, which was closed.  The father had then taken the uncle back to the family home, and driven to the hospital, where B was examined.</span></p>

The first reading of that scan revealed that she had two skull fractures: one on the right of her head, and one at the front.  A subsequent reading of that scan identified a third fracture on the left side of her skull.  Of the two fractures that were initially identified, the one on the right had obvious soft tissue swelling overlaying the fracture.  The frontal fracture did not.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The uncle&#8217;s explanation for the discrepancy was that he was making things up in order to get B seen to promptly. He said the father had told him that there had been an accident, but he had not seen B, he did not know where she was injured, and did not know what had happened.  It is perhaps surprising, therefore, that he was able to identify to the ambulance caller that she was injured to the head and she and her father could be heard in the telephone call recording.</span></p>

It was two weeks later that the review was considered at a child protection meeting, and the decision taken by the Local&#160;Authority that, given there were now three fractures identified and that that did not sit easily with the explanation given by the father, that Social&#160;Services intervention was necessary to protect all the children.  That led to these proceedings in which the parents have given statements, elaborating on their account, as has the uncle.</span></p>

To that end, Dr&#160;Elhassan Magid was instructed.  As I will spell out in due course, that instruction was a mistake by the Court and Dr&#160;Elhassan Magid&#8217;s evidence was not only unhelpful but was positively misleading.</span></p>

Dr&#160;Hall&#8217;s evidence was very helpful.  It had its limits; a neonatologist assumes responsibility for a child from the time of birth for the first four or so weeks of life.  The birth process itself falls within the expertise of an obstetrician, and so Dr&#160;Hall could not give expert evidence about the process of delivery, and the use of the forceps, but could pick up the story from the time of birth.</span></p>

Both Dr&#160;Hall and Dr&#160;Elhassan Magid made the point that children who are not obviously injured are not thereafter examined, so there is no routine scanning of otherwise well children.</span></p>

Swellings caused in connection with the fracturing of a skull bone in a baby disappear within seven to 10 days.  Thus, the fact that she had those haematomas, both left and right, indicated injuries within seven to 10 days of the date of examination.</span></p>

The only explanation that was proffered was by some sort of excessive squeezing of the side of the head applying pressure to the front, which then gave way.  As Dr&#160;Williams explained, the skull bones are soft and malleable at birth, and in several pieces, so that they can deform and move to allow the head to progress through the birth canal.  In any event, if there had been a fracture of the skull at birth, there would have been bleeding from that fracture, which would have been very obvious on B&#8217;s forehead.</span></p>

Dr&#160;Williams, in the measured way in which he gave evidence, said he could not rule out anything, but, in his opinion, it was highly unlikely.  It is possible for two sides of the head to fracture with one fall, usually where a child lands on the top of their head and ends up with what is known as an Alice Band fracture, which runs from the top of the head down both sides.  That is not what was here.</span></p>

What stands out from the photographs of the living room is how clean and tidy that room is, when contrasted with the rest of the house.  Why should that be?  I was told that the most-recent puppy, not housetrained, responsible for the mess that was there when the health visitor attended, had the free run of the living room on 10&#160;March&#160;2022.  That living room bears all the hallmarks of having been cleaned up and tidied up, whilst B was at hospital.</span></p>

One explanation would be to hide any evidence about what really happened to B.  The police sought permission at the hospital to take photographs of the home at the time when the uncle was back in the house.  It would have been very easy to alert him to the need, or desirability, of tidying up.</span></p>

The Lucas direction is clear, people can lie for all sorts of reasons.  The fact that they lie about one thing does not mean they necessarily lie about everything.  People&#8217;s motives for lying can be many and various.  In addition, even if a lie is established, that does not prove the case against a witness who is lying.  It potentially provides some corroboration of other evidence.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.58in;margin-right:0.37in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">9, at 22.42 hours on 10&#160;March&#160;2022, an ambulance was called to the family home by the maternal uncle, who was staying at the family home.  B, aged 27 days, was taken to hospital, where she was found to have sustained the following injuries: A, a right-sided scalp soft tissue injury with an underlying widened displaced right parietal skull bone fracture; B, a soft tissue swelling on the left with an underlying fracture of the squamous portion of the left temple bone, which was slightly depressed; C, a linear defect on the right frontal bone with no associated soft tissue swelling.</span></p>

The fractures are not birth-related.</span></p>

They were inflicted to B by one or more of her carers using excessive force on repeated occasions.</span></p>

The perpetrator was aware on each occasion that he/she had caused injury to B&#8217;s skull and took no steps to seek medical attention for B.  In respect of the fracture to the right frontal bone, that failure to seek medical attention was for a period of at least 10 days prior to B&#8217;s admission to hospital on 10&#160;March&#160;2022&#8221;.</span></p>

I am satisfied that the Local&#160;Authority has established its case on the balance of probabilities.  Whilst it is no obligation on the parents or the maternal uncle to prove a case, when they go into the witness box, and when they proffer an explanation that explanation must be measured in the same way as any other evidence.  In addition, my assessment of the carers and those who were there at the time of injury to B is critical.</span></p>

I have gone through the process of asking myself whether I could identify whether there is one individual, or one individual in relation to each of the three injuries to whom the incident could be attributed, and I cannot.  There were three people in the house at the time of at least one of the head injuries on 10&#160;March.  It may be that there were two separate incidents or, perhaps less likely but possible, some sort of squashing injury.</span></p>

Whoever caused the injury to B to the front of her head, the other adults, who were caring for her, failed to seek any medical help.  There were three injuries, probably caused by three separate incidents, but the final one in the presence of the three individuals, and no one took action to protect B.</span></p>

The ambulance call handler was not told how serious her injury was and so did not despatch an ambulance.  That led to a delay in B being examined, and appropriate steps being put in place to treat her injuries.  Neither the parents nor the uncle could have known what damage had been done to B.</span></p>
