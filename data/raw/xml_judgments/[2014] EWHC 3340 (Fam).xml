	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Tigers are an endangered species and the Chinese Tiger <span style="font-style:italic">(panthera tigris amoyensis</span>), in particular, no longer exists in the wild at all. Li Quan (the wife), who was born in China, has, since at least 1999, been passionate about not only saving the Chinese tiger from disappearing from the planet altogether but also breeding them for reintroduction into wild reserves in China. To that end she has invested huge amounts of time and energy and some money.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife met Stuart Bray (the husband) in 1990 and he too, over time, became infected with the same passion for the cause of saving the Chinese tiger. And he too has invested even greater sums of money in the venture (loosely and frequently described as the Chinese Tiger Project) and a great deal of his time and energy. The Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China are (via their government agencies) completely behind their work and have signed an agreement (The Framework Agreement) in 2002 which forms the basis of the ongoing cooperation between the husband and wife, the fourth Respondent (Save China&#8217;s Tigers; SCT UK) and China.  The other contracting party to the Framework Agreement apart from the Chinese government is a trust established in Mauritius called Chinese Tigers South Africa Trust (CTSAT) which was executed on 18 November 2002, a week before the signing of the Framework Agreement.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband and wife lived together from 1997 (they married in 2001). In 2000 the wife established Save China&#8217;s Tigers in the UK which secured UK Charity Commission registration the following year. Between that time and July 2012 the husband and wife worked tirelessly and more or less cooperatively on this patently bold, imaginative, charitable and laudable venture. The wife&#8217;s expertise in the field of tiger conservation and her Chinese contacts and cultural background combined with the husband&#8217;s profound understanding of and experience in complicated international finance and financial structures undoubtedly produced a dynamic partnership. Over time a number of their friends and colleagues became involved and to an extent enthused by and in the project.  </p>

At the time of the breakdown of the marriage the wife&#8217;s governing preoccupation was to ensure the survival of the Chinese tiger project and the preservation for that purpose of the funds and assets which had thus far been provided for that purpose. That was the focus of her concern when she went to her first lawyers in  July 2012 .</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;It is an unusual case.  I will not pretend it is not.  We have all seen, on many occasions, trusts &#8211; sometimes in Liechtenstein, sometimes in Jersey, sometimes elsewhere &#8211; where the primary, or perhaps the only, beneficiary is ostensibly a charity.  The thing that makes this case different is that in this case there is no doubt that funds have been deployed to charitable purposes.  It is not as though we can say that this is a pool from which this family has lived with no intention of ultimately benefitting the charity.  The question is though, &#8220;Is this, as it were, a genuine philanthropic irrevocable disposition by Mr Bray or is there, in fact, a complex web through which he can [and, if he can, we say in due course he will] extract funds back for himself?&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Gradually since that time her case in this respect has solidified so that on 17 July 2013 she filed an application by way of amendment to her Form A seeking a variation of a post nuptial settlement viz &#8220;variation of the post nuptial settlement &#8211;Chinese Tigers South Africa Trust&#8221;. The core of her case from that time has been that CTSAT was established not only to advance the cause of the chinese tiger but also to provide financial benefit and support for the husband and wife personally over the long term. That assertion has been hotly disputed by the husband since it first surfaced. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the character and purpose of CTSAT had thus become the central issue in this most unusual financial relief application, the use of the <span style="font-style:italic">OS v DS</span> procedure to determine, as a preliminary issue, whether it is a post nuptial settlement (and so capable of variation under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s24</ref> by this court) and if not the extent to which it is, if at all, a &#8220;resource&#8221; in the more broad sense (under s25) available to the husband to meet the wife&#8217;s claim (apart from also paying for its charitable activities) is both an apt process and a priority for determination.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is especially important because CTSAT has assets which are worth tens of millions of dollars or pounds (the precise figure is far from agreed but on the most optimistic view not more than &#163;25m) but there are now almost no assets, relatively speaking, outside it.  Accordingly the determination of this preliminary issue necessarily has a profound impact on the wife&#8217;s claim.</p>

The husband has not been but he has received assistance both indirectly (and I suspect directly) from both SCT UK&#8217;s solicitors and counsel.

There are no less than 33 lever files of statements and documents.  At the hearing I heard oral evidence from the wife, the husband and 8 other witnesses including two Mauritian lawyers. The oral evidence has been simultaneously transcribed by &#8220;livenote&#8221; which has been helpful given the importance of the oral evidence and the gap between the two halves of the hearing.  </p>

In the case of the South China tiger this is loss of habitat due to pressure from human economic development.  The guidelines (and common sense) dictate that failure to address the underlying cause will lead to the reintroduced individuals succumbing to the same problem.  This means that sustainable economic development opportunities must replace the unsustainable practices that have destroyed the habitat that led to the loss of wild South China tigers in the first place.&#8221;</p>

Over and over again the husband&#8217;s knowledge of the detail of the transactions leading to the establishment of CTSAT and other structures supporting the Tiger Project was tested and found to be sound.  His evidence at every stage was clear, detailed and consistent (both internally and by contrast with the evidence in the Varty litigation).

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in"><span style="font-style:italic">This was a litigation that started off incredibly intensely and really never abated for most of a decade. I believe that at the time we concluded the arbitration agreement and moved the matter from the high courts to arbitration, there had been something like 18 different summonses and actions, more than a dozen different substantive motion proceedings and applications and then, in 2004, when the arbitration agreement was signed, we commenced a period where all of those disputes were consolidated in what ended up being seven or eight years' worth of fairly bitter arbitration. In all of that time, in conversations, at dinner times, social occasions, through to meetings about project affairs, through to consultations with solicitors and counsel, preparation of witness statements,&#160;preparation for cross-examination, discussions regarding contemporaneous documents, I had -- when I say "more occasions than I can count", I mean that in a literal sense -- dozens and dozens and dozens of occasions where I discussed and&#160;reviewed the facts and documents with both Li and Stuart, often together and often separately. &#160;In that entire decade or more, not a single document has ever been presented to me which contradicts in one material respect a single thing that either of them had ever told me about the project, its conception, its origins and the way in which it developed. The version that they had always given to me and which we later presented to the courts first, to the arbitrator second, was utterly consistent for more than a decade and consistent with every single underlying document&#160;that we ever produced or laid our hands on. By the time the arbitration finished, I believe that our core bundle, which I think you refer to my Lord as "elevation bundle", was something like 40 or 50 lever arch files of documents with which I am intimately familiar. So, I believe what I was trying to record in paragraph 20 was both the breadth of my involvement and the consistency of the versions on that history that were always given to me by both Li and Stuart and, for that matter, everyone else that I ever met through them that was involved in the project.&#8221; </span></p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">'The section is concerned with a settlement &#8220;made on the parties to the marriage&#8221;. So, broadly stated, the disposition must be one which makes some form of continuing provision for both or either of the parties to a marriage, with or without provision for their children. Conversely, a disposition which confers an immediate, absolute interest in an item of property does not constitute a settlement of that property. The statutory provision is concerned with an order varying the terms of a settlement. This would not be an altogether apt exercise in relation to property given out-and-out and belonging to one of the parties to the marriage as his or her own absolute property. The context does not require that outright gifts of this nature should fall within the scope of the variation provision. In such a case the appropriate order on the dissolution of the marriage, if an order is needed in respect of the property, is a property transfer or property settlement order.'</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">'Beyond this the authorities have consistently given a wide meaning to settlement in this context, and they have spelled out no precise limitations. This seems right, because this approach accords with the purpose of the statutory provision. Financial provision that is appropriate so long as the parties are married will often cease to be appropriate when the marriage ends. In order to promote the best interests of the parties and their children in the fundamentally changed situation, it is desirable that the court should have power to alter the terms of the settlement. The purpose of the section is to give the court this power. This object does not dictate that settlement should be given a narrow meaning. On the contrary, the purpose of the section would be impeded, rather than advanced, by confining its scope. The continuing use of the archaic expressions 'ante-nuptial' and 'post-nuptial' does not point in the opposite direction. These expressions are apt to embrace all settlements in respect of the particular marriage, whether made before or after the marriage. In this connection, it should be noted in passing that a settlement may be made in respect of a particular marriage even though in certain circumstances the wife or husband by a subsequent marriage might be the person to take. <span style="font-style:italic">Lort-Williams v Lort-Williams</span><span/><a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/runRemoteLink.do?langcountry=GB&amp;linkInfo=F%23GB%23P%23year%251951%25page%25395%25sel1%251951%25&amp;risb=21_T11172871342&amp;bct=A&amp;service=citation&amp;A=0.7874743716164924" style="color:#3300CC"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1951] P 395" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1951">[1951] P 395</ref></a> affords an illustration of this.'</p>

The case concerned a property which was owned, via a Bahamian company, by a Jersey based trust of which the husband was a beneficiary. It was common ground that the Jersey settlement was not per se a nuptial settlement which could be varied by the court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 24(1)</ref>(c) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>. However the Jersey Trust had made available a property to the husband and wife which they used as their family home. The wife argued, and Coleridge J agreed, that the property was subject to an ante-nuptial settlement which could accordingly be varied. Referring to <span style="font-style:italic">Brooks v Brooks</span>, he said (para [30]) that 'There is nothing in that case which shows any departure from the previous approach of the court over the previous one hundred years'.

Indeed all the evidence both oral and written points the other way. And all their actions have been consistent with the furthering of the project. The funds from the G bank donation were designated from the day of their receipt for the tiger project and only for the tiger project and that is how they have been spent. The funds are required for the ongoing work of the project (which is very far from complete) and will be so spent. The wife&#8217;s case is an invention dreamt up in response to her being ousted from the SCT UK trust in 2012. There were and are no &#8220;back doors&#8221; or &#8220;front doors&#8221; through which money could legitimately (as opposed to illegitimately) be extracted for their use.

To that end the structures were designed deliberately to be complex but ultimately capable of penetration or access. Apart from conversations which the parties had at the outset to that effect, the only and obvious inference can be drawn that this is so from the fact that the husband&#8217;s extraordinary expertise in the structured finance field meant that he would be bound to design a structure like this to enable it to be used for their benefit if needed.  The officers of the trust are in the final analysis his stooges who will do his bidding if asked.  Once the dust of this litigation has settled the tiger project (which is winding down) will in due course draw to a close and he will, by one means or another, take the value in the trust for his own use. In the final analysis look at the whole evidential picture especially the emails at [K/51].

But that is not to suggest that it does not bestow on the donor other great benefits, satisfaction and fulfilment which are capable of providing a perfectly reasonable explanation for why it takes place and so why it is a conventional feature of human life.  Huge sums of money can often be involved.</p>

The husband&#8217;s evidence (supported copiously by the documents, the other witnesses and the parties&#8217; subsequent exhaustive and exhausting work and actions) establishes this to my entire satisfaction. There were no conversations at the outset or subsequently which took place which establish an intention to benefit them or either of them and there was no ulterior /secondary purpose as the wife now seeks to suggest. That case is, in forensic parlance, a late invention by the wife. CTSAT was always, and is, only for the Chinese tigers. Accordingly it is not a PNS which can be directly invaded by court order.</p>

On a balance of probabilities the Mauritian Court would not enforce an English order varying the trust especially if an attempt was made to do it in the teeth of opposition from the trust. In my judgment the meaning of Mauritian Trusts Act 2001 s.11(5) is quite plain on its face. In those circumstances, I would not, in any event be prepared to make an order varying the trust.</p>

In my judgement, CTSAT&#8217;s assets cannot properly be regarded as a resource of the husband in the s.25 sense. The assets of CTSAT are for the tiger project via SCT UK . Accordingly it would be wrong in principle for a UK court to make a lump sum order against the husband in the hope and expectation that funds would be provided by CTSAT to fulfil it. </p>

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">In order to answer the above questions, I set out here briefly what the China Tiger is, what the Chinese Tiger Project is, and what the China Tiger trusts are. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">China Tigers </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The geographic area that is now China is regarded as the ancestral home to all tigers. The first tigers emerged two million years ago in what is now Southern China. The South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) (hereafter referred to as &#8220;South China tiger&#8221; or &#8220;Chinese tiger&#8221; or &#8220;China tiger&#8221; interchangeably) is considered to be the direct descendents of these first tigers. These South China tigers spread across Asia and split into different subspecies. Several of which are now extinct. In one sense, all tigers are Chinese tigers. Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris), for example, have only been in India for a comparatively short time - 12,000 to 15,000 years. Their history in China is two orders of magnitude longer. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">However, the South China tiger is the only tiger that occurs just in China and the South China tiger has featured prominently in Chinese culture for thousands of years.The South China Tiger is the most endangered subspecies of tiger. There are approximately 100 in captivity and no known individuals in the wild.  </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The Chinese Tiger Project </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The Chinese Tiger Project was created by the Framework Agreement signed in November 2002 by the UK charity, Save China&#8217;s Tigers (&#8220;SCT UK&#8221;), the Chinese Tigers South African Trust (&#8220;CTSAT&#8221;) and the National Wildlife Research and Development Center of the State Forestry Administration of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. The Framework Agreement sets out an ambitious plan to save the South China tiger in the wild with an ambitious program that includes restoration of habitat, building of capacity in China, breeding and rewilding South China tigers. CTSAT is obliged to carry out and finance these activities through sustainable development, primarily eco-tourism and media. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The main problem facing the South China tiger is loss of habitat due to human economic activity.  Therefore, what we need to do to save the South China tiger is the same thing we need to do save biodiversity generally, and ultimately ourselves. That is, reverse the land use change to increase biodiversity. We must restore wild, biodiverse places from agricultural land. This is exactly what the Chinese Tiger Project has done in South Africa and what it must do in China on a much larger scale if there is to be a genetically viable population of free-ranging South China tigers. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">This problem presents a number of enormous challenges. In particular the land use change that is destroying biodiversity is driven by economic incentives and economic development. Addressing the intersection of economic incentives, economic development, and the resulting environmental degradation or restoration is at the heart of the Chinese Tiger Project.  For me, the Chinese tigers are merely the symbol for this underlying problem. The tigers are a potentially powerful symbol around which to organize the activities necessary to restore biodiversity in the habitat required by wild tigers in a way that is economically sustainable.</span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">How can the economy develop without degrading the natural environment on which we depend for our long-term survival? In other words, can we find a model for economic development that is both financially and environmentally sustainable? I believe this is the most critical long-term problem the world faces today and this is the problem on which I spend most of my time.  Although this is a more general formulation of the problem, I believe it is entirely consistent with LQ&#8217;s original vision for the Chinese Tiger Project based on ecotourism. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Ecotourism as Economic Engine for Conservation </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">When LQ observed ecotourism in southern Africa that was supporting wildlife as well as local communities, she was inspired to approach the Chinese government to explore whether or not this model could be used in the effort to save tigers in China.  Broadly speaking, the economic interests of ecotourism in Southern Africa are more or less aligned with restoring and protecting biodiversity. If there is no wildlife to view, the tourist will not come.  Therefore, the ecotourism and private game reserves operators have an incentive to protect and even restore wildlife. The ecotourism also provides jobs for locals which in turn builds support for conservation. Because there is a natural economic incentive to restore and protect biodiversity and the environment, private investment has naturally been drawn to this activity. Accordingly, the land under wildlife in South Africa has increased tenfold from private investment compared to land set aside from government investment.  It was this success that LQ hoped to duplicate in China. If she could manage to promote a successful ecotourism model based on a South China tiger reserve, then others would naturally want to invest in other similar reserves. LQ hoped to solve the problem of financing the restoration of the habitat needed to save the South China tiger in this way.  However, it became clear very early on that ecotourism would never cover the costs of the needed environmental restoration in China . Often, governments will help cover these costs in public private partnerships. However, the Chinese government has repeatedly refused to provide funding for the various proposals that have been put forward. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">For these reasons the Chinese Tiger Project has cast its net more widely in search of an economic model that would pay for the habitat restoration needed to save South China Tigers in the wild. </span></p>

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">In 2002, I leased the 32,000 hectares of land in South Africa to the Chinese Tiger Project for 99 years at a peppercorn rent. The leases cannot be changed without the consent of CTSAT.</span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">In 2008, Lawrence Cole-Morgan donated CFI to the China Tiger trusts. At that time CFI already owned the Jiangxi forestry plantation and the property at 66D Royal Mint Street both of which it had purchased with its trading profits. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">In 2009, G  Bank made a donation of some &#163;20 million to SCT UK pursuant to the settlement of a claim by SCT UK.  In 2011, the Econcern debt was purchased with the cash originating from the donation. </span></p>

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">LQ and I have varying degrees of influence and control over the various trusts. I have most control over SCT UK as a result of my sole directorship. Even in this case my control does not extend to the ability to deal with the assets as if they were my own. In all cases, I have a fiduciary responsibility to use my influence for the benefit of the Chinese Tiger Project. I have always fulfilled my fiduciary responsibilities and will continue to do so in the future. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Access to the China Tiger trusts&#8217; assets </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">It was never the intention that LQ or I should be able to access funds in the China Tiger trusts to support our lifestyle. The sole purpose of the establishment of CTSAT was to sign the Framework Agreement and execute the Chinese Tiger Project on behalf of its sole beneficiary, SCT UK.  </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">CTSAT </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The Purpose of CTSAT </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">CTSAT was established in November 2002 as the alter ego of SCT UK for the sole purpose of signing the Framework Agreement and carrying out the Chinese Tiger Project established by that agreement. The Framework Agreement established the Chinese Tiger Project as a joint venture between the Chinese government and Save China&#8217;s tigers when the Varty brothers (two well-known South African eco-tourism operators, to whom I refer below) backed out just before a signing ceremony that had already been scheduled in Beijing. Accordingly, SCT UK, and the Chinese Tiger Project it is responsible for, have always been the beneficiaries of CTSAT. In the fall of 2002, the Vartys backed out of an agreement that the Vartys had reached in principle with the Chinese government to carry out the Chinese Tiger project&#8230;</span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">LQ was devastated. Rather than let the Chinese Tiger Project die, I suggested that SCT UK should step into the shoes of the Vartys and become a party to the Framework Agreement.  LQ informed me that it was not politically appropriate for SCT to sign the Framework Agreement because SCT was known to the Chinese government and they were expecting to sign an agreement with a South African counterparty, referred to as the &#8220;SA Party&#8221; in the Framework Agreement on which so much work had been done, by so many people, including LQ, over many months.. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">I then suggested that a South African trust should be set up with Save China&#8217;s Tigers as the sole beneficiary. This trust could be the politically acceptable alter ego of Save China&#8217;s Tigers to step into the shoes of the Vartys and sign the Framework Agreement. However, tight foreign exchange controls on movement of currency in and out of the country rendered South Africa unsuitable as a jurisdiction for the trust.  I called Lawrence Cole-Morgan, an old friend and former colleague, to come to South Africa to document the trust and other agreements related to the Chinese Tiger Project. Lawrence flew to South Africa and worked with Grant Weyer, who was advising the Vartys, to document the trust and the various other agreements that the Chinese Tiger Project would require. Lawrence worked long hours for no pay to get the documents ready in time. Lawrence prepared a deal diagram and a note setting out what was intended at the time. The deal diagram and notes clearly state that SCT UK would be the sole beneficiary of the trust. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">When it became clear that South Africa was not suitable as a jurisdiction for the trust, Grant Weyer (corporate finance advisor to the Vartys) suggested Mauritius. Grant had previously worked with a trust company in Mauritius, then known as Inter-Ocean management. Lawrence and Grant called Inter-Ocean to see if Mauritius would be a suitable jurisdiction. No problems were identified with Mauritius and no other jurisdictions were considered. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Lawrence then sent an email to me and LQ on 1 November 2002 with a copy of a standard trust deed (which I understood came from Inter-Ocean Management) and a brief note indicating that SCT UK would be the Settlor and sole beneficiary of the trust. Lawrence suggested that SCT UK&#8217;s lawyers should review the deed of trust.  It later emerged that under Mauritius law, the Settlor could not be the sole beneficiary so it was suggested that I would settle the required $10 so that SCT UK could be the sole beneficiary. I agreed. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Pursuant to LCM&#8217;s email to me and LQ, I gave the sample deed of trust to Richard Cassell at Bryan Cave to review, with me as the Settlor.  </span></p>

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Because I was giving up significant value in the 99 year lease of the land that I then owned, I presume that Richard assumed that I would want to get the value back and proposed amendments to the CTSAT trust deed accordingly. Richard marked up the standard deed of trust with a number of changes including a change that included me and LQ among the beneficiaries. However, that was not my intention. LQ was aware of my intention to give up the value in the land with a 99 years lease for no rent and she fully supported that decision. She also insisted that we could not have an interest in the businesses undertaken by CTSAT because of a potential conflict of interest that she felt strongly about. This was the same conflict of interest that led her to insist that I should not invest in those businesses when they were to have been run by the Vartys.  It is for this reason that LCM wrote then wrote back to Bryan Cave explaining that they had misunderstood my intentions. I quote from LCM&#8217;s email: </span></p>

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Circumstances leading to the establishment of CTSAT </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The Framework Agreement was initially conceived as simply a commercial agreement between a Varty business, Tiger Moon Ventures (&#8220;TMV&#8221;), on the one hand and the Chinese government on the other.   I reached a deal with the Vartys in December 2001 in Beijing such that they would acquire the needed land on my behalf for &#163;2.5 million and I would lease it to them at a below market rate on the condition that they used their best efforts to reach an agreement with the Chinese government to set up a similar reserve in China. The leased land was to be used only for the Chinese Tiger Project. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">I kept my end of the bargain. In January 2002, I provided &#163;2.5 million to the Vartys to acquire land, fence, and game for Tiger Moon Sanctuary. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">At first, the Vartys appeared to be keeping theirs. By September 2002, the final form of the Framework Agreement had been agreed by the Vartys and approved by the Chinese government at a ministerial level. A big media event was scheduled for the signing ceremony for November 2002.  In October 2002, the Vartys wanted to rewrite the agreement completely such that they would keep all the assets, but jettison all of the liabilities.  The Vartys new position fundamentally undermined the principle on which the entire deal was premised: the assets would only be made available in exchange for undertaking the liabilities &#8230;. the Vartys bait a switch strategy rendered the revised terms unsellable to the Chinese. The negotiations that had already been completed on better terms for the government when the Vartys tried to force the hand of the government by threatening to pull out.  </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">LQ was very emotional at this time. At first, she contemplated suicide because of the irreparable damage she feared she brought on the effort to save the South China Tiger. Such a public failure for those government officials who had risked their careers on Li&#8217;s idea would mean that no one would dare try anything again for the South China tigers. When she got over her thoughts of suicide, she became furious with the Vartys for their role in the fiasco. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">It was in these circumstances that CTSAT was set up to step into the shoes of the Vartys and take on the business of TMV. This meant that CTSAT would take on the ecotourism and media business that LQ insisted that I should not invest in because of potential conflicts of interest.  Accordingly, LQ was equally adamant that neither of us could benefit from the activities of CTSAT. CTSAT was going to be undertaking the very businesses that the Vartys had intended to undertake through Tiger Moon Ventures. LQ insisted that I could not invest in Tiger Moon Ventures because of the potential conflicts of interest with Save China&#8217;s Tigers and she applied the same reasoning to CTSAT. </span></p>

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">In early 2003, a South African company, Laohu Valley Reserve (Pty) Limited (&#8220;LVR&#8221;) (formerly called Tiger Moon Sanctuary (PTY) Ltd), issued Class B shares to CTSAT for no consideration. The Class B shares conferred no economic rights but gave CTSAT the power to ensure that LVR would always act in the best interest of the Chinese Tiger Project.  Additionally, LVR had leased 32,000 hectares of land then ultimately owned by me and the Vartys. Under the leases LVR pays a peppercorn rent for 99 years and the leases are registered on the title deeds to the land. This ensures the land cannot be sold without the leases. The leases state that the land could only be used for the Chinese Tiger Project. In 2004, 100% of the shares of Energetic Business Solutions (&#8220;EBS&#8221;) were settled into CTSAT by Lawrence Cole-Morgan (&#8220;LCM&#8221;) for no consideration. EBS only had nominal capital and its purpose was to act as paying agent in South Africa for the CFI then owned by LCM. EBS facilitated payments and issues relating to exchange control.  For the sake of completeness, I note that I loaned a total of &#163;0.3 million to EBS to pay CFI expenses in South Africa. CFI has since repaid this loan to JAS Holdings pursuant to my contribution of this loan as capital. In 2007, 100% of the shares of Asia High Yield Limited were settled into CTSAT for no consideration. Asia High Yield Limited had nominal capital and was intended to be a securitization vehicle for a forestry financing that was never completed. It is common practice in structured finance to donate the shares of securitization vehicles to charities. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Settlement of CFI into CTSAT </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">In March 2007, LCM donated to SCT HK, 100% of the shares of the ultimate holding company for CFI, Ensor Investments Limited (&#8220;Ensor&#8221;). CFI was the successor to TMV. LCM had concluded after 4 years of hard work that the liabilities arising from the Framework Agreement would very likely always exceed the revenue of CFI and therefore the prospect of realizing any profit was very low. Accordingly, he donated the business.  At the end of 2008, the Conservation Trust settled 100% of Ensor into CTSAT. The National Wildlife Research and Development Center (&#8220;NWRDC&#8221;) was the sole beneficiary of those shares on the condition that any distributions to NWRDC from CTSAT would be used for the Chinese Tiger Project.  </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">In 2013, CFI settled cash of approximately &#163;5.4 million, Econcern debt of approximately &#163;1.6 million, the Jiangxi forestry plantation worth approximately &#163;3 million, and the South African reserve into CTSAT pursuant to my undertaking to this court to use my best efforts to transfer those assets to CTSAT.  I estimate the South African reserve has a value of negative &#163;6.9 million unless the leases are modified. This is because the only purpose for which the land can be used under the leases is the Chinese Tiger Project and the associated ecotourism. We have investigated ecotourism exhaustively and determined that it is not viable on this property. That leaves direct costs of the reserve of approximately &#163;350k per year. The present value of annual costs over the life of the lease discounted at 5% is approximately &#163;6.9 million. </span></p>

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">To my mind, the only acceptable way LQ or I can legally gain access to the assets of CTSAT (or any of the China Tiger trusts) is through the Real Front Door. That is, to enter into contractual agreements to buy or sell goods or services to CTSAT on terms no worse than arm&#8217;s length for CTSAT. This is the basis on which I have always dealt with CTSAT. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">I have provided advisory services to CTSAT and its subsidiaries from time to time through JAS Financial Products LLP (&#8220;JAS&#8221;). JAS has charged fees sufficient to cover its costs and no more. Also, I work hard to keep JAS&#8217; costs down in order to minimise the fees. I do my best to negotiate the lowest possible compensation for my colleagues and still retain and motivate the people with the skills I believe are necessary to do the job. I have never paid myself anything. When I travel, I fly economy unless it is an overnight flight and I have important meetings where I must be alert soon after I land. Whenever it is practical, I stay in youth hostels and cheap hotels to keep my costs down. I take public transport, even on business trips, whenever it is practical. Companies that I own have provided financial services at well below market rates to facilitate financing transactions for the Chinese Tiger Project. JAS Financial Trading, for example, has bought and sold assets and entered into hedges with razor thin margins in order to minimize the cost of funding in financing transactions for the Chinese Tiger Project.  I sold my flat to Conservation Finance Ltd at a market rate. I have worked as a director of Save China&#8217;s Tigers for no compensation other than the market value of the rent for the room I stay in at 66D Royal Mint St. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The Front Door is also open to LQ. LQ offered to work cooperatively on the Chinese Tiger Project if she would be offered a job at &#163;150,000 per year. In the circumstances, I considered that acceptable. LQ had then worked for many years on the Chinese Tiger Project for no pay other than the value of the rent she would otherwise pay for her right to occupy part of 66D Royal Mint Street. She has valuable contacts she might be able to use to contribute to the finance resources of the Chinese Tiger Project.  Of course, the Front Door is open to anyone and it has been used at various times by many people and institutions. Indeed, I wish it were used more often. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The Alleged Front Door </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">The suggestion that Mauritius was selected because Mauritius Trust Law uniquely provided me with legal access to the assets of CTSAT through LQ&#8217;s Front Door is untrue.  The circumstances that led to the choice of Mauritius are explained above.    So, it is clear that there is no legal way &#8220;H accessing the assets&#8221; of CTSAT that &#8220;relies on H alone&#8221;. This conclusion is, I believe, consistent with LQ&#8217;s expert evidence as well. Read carefully, the Appleby advice merely says that I could be a trustee, not a sole trustee.  I would like to think that this is the end of the matter. It could not be clearer in the circumstances set out above that the only reason CTSAT was established was to sign the Framework Agreement and fulfil the obligations within that agreement.  In any event, in light of the allegations levelled at me, Maitland has irrevocably excluded both me and LQ as possible beneficiaries of CTSAT. This effectively closes any possible strategy in which I would be a beneficiary of CTSAT. </span></p>

The best that Durango can hope for is that the option is not exercised. In that case, nothing happens. Things simply stay as they are.

Therefore, Durango would be worse off by the amount the put was &#8220;in-the-money&#8221; at the time it was exercised (ie the difference between the strike price it paid and value of the 0.68% fractional share of CFIH it received).

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">As far as I am concerned, there is no permissible use of the assets of CTSAT apart from advancing the Chinese Tiger Project.  Of course, this does not mean that LQ and I were forbidden from enjoying benefits, if any, that coincidently arise from advancing the Chinese Tiger Project. Nor does it mean that any expense apart from purchasing blesbok (antelope) is forbidden. But, it does mean that those people responsible for the funds and the Chinese Tiger Project must use their best judgment with respect to how best to deploy the assets for the Chinese Tiger Project. I can say with complete confidence that I have always done that. Nonetheless, I can say with complete confidence that I have never used any of CTSAT&#8217;s resources in any way that I remotely believed was for my or LQ&#8217;s benefit at the expense of the Chinese Tiger Project. It has been clear from the very beginning that the most important part of the Chinese Tiger Project is restoring the habitat in China. CTSAT has never had enough funds to accomplish this. Accordingly, I, and many others, have worked very hard trying to find ways to finance the shortfall. I regret that I have not yet succeeded. </span></p>

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">SCT UK was established by consultants hired by LQ for the purpose of assisting China with conservation of the South China tiger primarily by liaising with conservationists around the world and raising funds for, and awareness of, the plight of the South China tiger. SCT UK has taken a leading role in organizing the Chinese Tiger Project that culminated in SCT UK signing the Framework Agreement in November 2002. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Circumstances leading to establishment of SCT UK</span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">LQ was born in Beijing during 1962. As I got to know her, I learned that since 1984, she had lived variously in Europe and the United States of America. LQ has had a life-long interest in animals, particularly cats. However, growing up in China, her only experience with animals was gained through visiting zoos. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">During the latter part of the 1980s, and whilst living and studying in Europe, LQ became familiar with the concept of wild life conservation. She heard of organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund (the WWF) and Care for the Wild. Through her deep interest in the cat family, LQ began reading about wild life conservation.  For that reason, during 1997, she and I visited a game park in Africa for the first time. We visited Zambia, and LQ was enthralled with her experience of a huge game park where wild animals existed in their natural environment, and where they could be viewed by tourists in a manner which was not inimical to their conservation.  LQ, during her trip to Zambia, was particularly keen to see a leopard. She was not successful in this regard. Consequently, on her return from Zambia, she made enquiries and read articles in order to establish where and how she could get to see a leopard in its natural  environment. In the process, LQ heard of the Londolozi and Mala Mala game parks in South Africa.  As a result, during 1998, LQ and I travelled to Londolozi. We spent some time there and were immensely impressed with our experience. Whilst at Londolozi, we became familiar with the South African conservation community's approach to the concept of eco-tourism, and the philosophy underpinning it. LQ also began contacting various specialists dealing with Tigers and in particular the conservation of Tigers. She spoke, inter alia, with Peter Jackson, Sarah Christie (the curator of the London Zoo and Stud bookkeeper for Tigers in Europe), Dr Gary Koehler, Dr Ron Thilson (the curator of the Minnesota Zoo), Endi Zhang (who is the Shanghai representative of WCS) and Josh Ginsberg (the conservation director for Asia of the WCS). The expenses incurred in the work that LQ was doing in this regard were all funded by myself. I was willing to support LQ in her endeavours (including giving her the requisite financial assistance), and LQ was willing to dedicate her time because of our passion for nature and the conservation of wildlife.  The project increasingly became a passion for LQ and she devoted herself to assisting in the conservation of the South China Tiger.  I was not only supportive of LQ, but also became independently interested in the project. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Establishing SCT UK</span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">By 2000, LQ had taken the lead, internationally, in the conservation of the South China Tiger. Eventually, LQ's application for registration of a charity was approved by the Charity Commission of the United Kingdom, and she set up a charity, which was registered as "Save China's Tigers". The cost involved in setting up the charity was borne by me. During the period 2000 to 2001, I spent approximately US$ 150,000 in setting up the charity and funding projects in relation to the South China Tiger conservation project.  </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Once "Save China's Tigers" was launched, I became concerned that the financial demands of the project were significantly greater than LQ and I could handle. We wished to make a difference to wildlife conservation and to this end focussed our energies on the conservation of the South China Tiger. However, we also realised that we would need to involve others in order to make the project successful. In addition, the support of the Chinese Government was critical because the South China Tiger existed only in China.  </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Because of my concerns regarding the financial demands of the project, LQ began investigating ways of raising funds for the project. Her initial attempt at fundraising was through the internet, when LQ set up a website directed towards fund raising for the project. Unfortunately, this did not prove sufficiently successful.  LQ believed that the effort to save the South China Tiger must involve the expertise of people and organizations from all over the world. "Save China's Tigers" should act as a bridge to channel such efforts to the project in China. She also wanted the charity to communicate to the rest of the world what efforts were being undertaken in China in regard to conservation.  Thus, when the "Save China's Tigers" charity was launched in London on 9 October 2000, we invited a delegation of Chinese authorities. I contributed towards their expenses incurred in travelling to London and attending the launch. The launch was held at the Chinese Embassy in London. This is evidence of the strides LQ had made by then in earning the-trust and confidence of the Chinese Government.  I emphasise that the aim of the entire project was the conservation of the South China Tiger.

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Following the reorganization of assets pursuant to my undertaking to this court, SCT UK owns most of the empty special purpose financing vehicles that used to be owned by CTSAT and cash to cover operations for less than 1 year after including the cost of liquidating various special purpose financing vehicles in light of the current circumstances which make any financing very difficult. Going forward this should lower the minimum annual cost. SCT UK also ultimately owns its registered office, the property at 66D Royal Mint Street, subject to a UN1 lean lodged by LQ. Of course, SCT UK is happy to provide an undertaking not to dispose of the property until this court has made a final determination. SCT UK is also the sole beneficiary of the assets held by CTSAT, these include the South African reserve, the Chinese forestry plantation, the Dutch windfarm debt, and approximately &#163;5.4 million in cash (ie less than 2 years of historical operating cost of the Chinese Tiger Project). </span></p>

	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">I provided the funds to pay the consultants who set up the charity on LQ&#8217;s instructions in 2000. Although the fees to the consultants were, as I recall, &#163;100k, I believe that SCT UK had only minimal capital. The remainder of the fee was allegedly for the consultants to raise funds but no funds were ever raised and we were henceforth reluctant to hire consultants for upfront fees. We always had a strong preference for success fees after that.  </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">My tax returns show that I claimed approximately &#163;400k of donations. As I recall, the US had punitive provisions that clawed back any deductions above a certain amount and there was hardly any tax benefit. I think I donated more than this but I did not bother to include it my taxes both because I had no income and because of the clawback provisions. </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">G Bank and the SARs </span></p>
	    <p class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">In 2004, I effectively donated to SCT UK my Stock Appreciation Rights (&#8220;SARs&#8221;) awarded to me by G  Bank as part of my discretionary compensation. The SARs were structured to be very similar to call options on G Bank stock. However, unlike traded options, G  Bank was keen to structure the SARs so that the value could only be realized at maturity.  I explored the possibility of assigning my SARs to SCT UK&#8217;s trading account at Credit Suisse. Eventually it turned out that I had been entitled to do what was needed. I then assigned the SARs to SCT UK, and SCT UK sold offsetting call options on G  Bank stock. I believe the proceeds to SCT UK still exceeded &#163;1 million. However by then the SARs were far less valuable than when the takeover rumours were circulating. So, SCT UK lost a lot in opportunity cost. I believe the losses were well into seven figures. SCT UK then decided to sue G Bank. </span></p>

	  <heading class="Default"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Around this time, G  Bank issued a press release in respect of some transactions that were being criminally investigated in the US. In the press release I felt G  Bank had deliberately sought to mislead investors to conclude that my business had been responsible for the offending transactions but since I had been fired, the problem had been adequately addressed. I was furious for many reasons but I was reluctant to sue right away because I was uncertain how such litigation would be perceived by those institutions to whom I was then marketing the financing transactions for the Chinese Tiger Project.  As I recall, the statute of limitation for libel was one year. Just before the year was up, I personally sued G  Bank for libel. So, I was from then on discussing with G  Bank both: </span></heading>

In addition, G  Bank agreed to pay SCT UK &#163;19.85 million in respect of its claim on the SARs.   For the avoidance of doubt, the allocation of the payments had nothing at all to do with any tax planning. Also, I reject entirely any suggestion that I could have taken the entire amount for myself. If I were to have asked G Bank to make a payment to me, in order to procure that SCT UK should drop its claims for no payment, then I would be guilty of an egregious and totally unacceptable conflict of interest. </span></p>

I was born in 1961 in Colorado and raised at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. I have one brother two years older than I am and one sister two years younger. Our parents were old enough to have lived through the Great Depression and their values were greatly shaped by that experience and they tried to pass on these values to their children. These values may seem like platitudes to some, or they may superficially seem contradictory to others. Nonetheless, they make sense to me and go to the core of how I analyze the world.  Our parents taught us to be self-reliant and to expect no help from others. At the same time, we were taught to look after others who needed help. This was especially important in hard times and for people close to us. Our parents were concerned about financial security and castigated us when they observed us spending money in a manner they considered irresponsible. Yet, they spent everything they earned trying to give us a better life than they had.</span></p>
