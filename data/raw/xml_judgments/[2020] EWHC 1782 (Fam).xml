This is the final hearing of the mother&#8217;s application for K&#8217;s summary return to Poland pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction or, alternatively, pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. The mother&#8217;s application was issued on 29 January 2020, just over four years after the father wrongfully removed K from her mother&#8217;s care in Poland, where she was habitually resident, using an Algerian passport for her which he had acquired covertly. </p>

She has been the subject of first instance and appellate judgments in Poland; the subject of two English High Court judgments, that of Roberts J in 2015 and that of Hayden J in 2016; and she has also been the subject of judgments by the Algerian courts. This case is a perfect example of the damage done to and experienced by children in international abduction cases, a fact often overlooked by many involved in this work.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This judgment is somewhat shorter than it might have been, because of developments during the hearing. In summary, the mother conceded that, in the light of K&#8217;s objections to a return to Poland, her applications could not succeed. She invited me to give her permission to withdraw those applications and this judgment explains why I now do so. It will be apparent from the contents of this judgment that she is to be commended for the painful and difficult decision she made about this litigation. Her decision was solely attributable to the love she has for K and to a sincere respect for K&#8217;s wishes to now remain living in England. </p>

It will be the foundation for the legal proceedings about K&#8217;s contact with her mother which will be initiated once the Hague Convention proceedings have concluded. K will be able to read it to understand, as a young person, what might have been less evident to her when she was much younger. I hope that she finds it helpful.  </p>

He has been based in the Reading area throughout the time that he has spent in England since he commenced his tertiary education. He obtained British nationality in about 1997, since when he has had dual Algerian and British nationality. His career has been that of an academic and a writer. He is a moderate but sincere follower of the Islamic faith. The mother was born in Poland and has Polish nationality. She too has a university education. </p>

During 2006 a relationship between them developed and, later that year, they went through an Islamic ceremony of marriage in Poland. K was born in Poland in 2007 and has British and Algerian nationality. In about August 2008 K and her parents relocated to Reading in the United Kingdom, where they lived as a family. Both parents had paid employment and shared in the care of K. In September 2011 K started primary school in England. From time to time, she had holidays in Algeria with both her mother and father separately and holidays in Poland with her mother. </p>

However, the mother and father quarrelled, and the mother admitted that she was having an affair with another man in Poland. On 17 November 2012, the father returned to England to find the mother and K had gone to Poland. It appears that the mother told K that they were going on a trip to London, thereby concealing from her that she would be leaving her father, her school and her friends to relocate abroad. K&#8217;s statement to the court made clear her sense of shock at both arriving in Poland, a place she described as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230; a completely new world for me. It was sudden and strange&#8230;</span>&#8221;, and at her mother being untruthful with her about where they were going. It is beyond dispute that K&#8217;s mother had removed her wrongfully from this jurisdiction, where K was habitually resident, and that this removal was in breach of the father&#8217;s rights of custody.   </p>

In 2013, he began Hague Convention proceedings by which he sought K&#8217;s return from Poland to England. On 4 September 2013, the District Court in Plock found that there had been a breach of his custody rights and granted the father&#8217;s application. The mother appealed and on 16 January 2014 the Regional Court in Plock upheld the appeal, finding that the mother had established a defence to the breach of the father&#8217;s custody rights under Article 13(b) of the Convention. Having had the benefit of a psychological assessment of K and the mother having indicated that she was not prepared to return to England herself, the Polish appeal court held that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">depriving the child of her mother&#8217;s care will cause the child great emotional harm, which will affect her entire life</span>&#8221;. On 18 June 2014, the Polish Court made an order that K should live with her mother. </p>

The father instructed solicitors during those proceedings, but he appeared in person at the final hearing. In connection with the father&#8217;s application, a Cafcass officer, Mr Power, travelled to Poland to assess K&#8217;s circumstances and make recommendations. Notwithstanding the mother&#8217;s behaviour in abducting K in the first place, Mr Power acknowledged that matters had </p>

K appeared to have settled well in Poland and was subsequently described by Roberts J in March 2015 as having been completely absorbed into her local home, school and community in Poland. As is clear from her statement to the court, K does not have a wholly positive view of her life in Poland. She accepts that she probably appeared happy and was close to her mother in the same way that she now is close to her father, but it was not until she lived in Algeria that she realised how unhappy she had been in Poland. She has memories of being bullied at school in Poland and she did not feel as if she fitted in. Those unhappy experiences do not appear to have been something of which her mother or K&#8217;s school were aware though I note that the mother removed K from her previous school in Poland because of alleged bullying. </p>

She found that K was habitually resident in Poland, and ordered that she should continue to live with her mother until further order of the Polish court. Further, Roberts J made a prohibited steps order preventing the father from (i) removing K from Poland, and (ii) removing her from the care and custody of the mother, save for agreed contact. The father attempted to appeal that decision but was unsuccessful in doing so.  </p>

This took place almost every day until about March 2015 when, according to the father, the frequency of contact decreased to about weekly. The material available to me suggests that this contact does not seem to have been satisfactory for either parent and, if that is right, I doubt that it was very satisfactory for K either. Additionally, K saw her father in August 2013, December 2014 and December 2015. All these visits took place in Poland when father and daughter had an opportunity to spend time with each other over several days.    </p>

During that contact, in flagrant breach of Roberts J&#8217;s order, he removed K from Poland to Algeria. This was, without doubt, an abduction. The father acknowledged in his most recent statement, dated 26 May 2020, that he had not sought the consent of the mother to take K to Algeria. He took K to Berlin and from Berlin they flew to Algeria. Before leaving Poland, the father asked K if she wanted to go to Algeria to see her cousins and she said that she did. At that time, K had no idea that she would not be returning to Poland and to the care of her mother. The father&#8217;s most recent statement suggested that he had initially intended the trip to Algeria to be a holiday. However, after about two or three weeks of being in Algeria with K, the father said that he decided it was in her best interests for K to remain there.  </p>

On 28 April 2016, the mother applied to the English court for K&#8217;s return to Poland.

The order made by Roberts J on 25 May 2016 recorded that the father agreed in principle that K should be living with her mother in Poland and that she was living in Algeria. I note that the father now disputes that he then agreed K should be living with her mother, as he believed K should remain in Algeria where she was thriving. </p>

However, Hayden J made K a ward of court and ordered the father to cause K&#8217;s return to Poland by 4 July 2016. Hayden J refused to return the father&#8217;s travel documents to him, on the basis that to do so would allow the father to return to Algeria and thereby effectively prevent the enforcement of both the order for K&#8217;s return and the Polish court order. Notwithstanding Hayden J&#8217;s decision, the father left this jurisdiction, defeating the bench warrant for his arrest issued by Hayden J on 8 July 2016. At a hearing before Judd J on 4 February 2020, the father accepted that, in breach of the passport order, he had obtained a further document from the Algerian embassy and then travelled to Algeria.

The application asserted that the father had removed K from Poland with the consent of the mother and that her allegation of abduction against the father had no basis in truth. It is now clear from the father&#8217;s own admission that this assertion was wholly untruthful. No reference was made in the application to either the 2016 English proceedings or to the January 2016 Polish order. The father stated that he had not approved either the application or the statement made to the Algerian court before these were lodged as he was still in England at that time.

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">and then acting as K&#8217;s Guardian, I have come to the view that K has underplayed the effect of her separation from her mother and the difficulties she faced at the beginning of her time in Algeria. I do not think that is attributable to her father&#8217;s influence but it is a way of coping with and rationalising what happened to her without being disloyal to the parent who was caring for her in that country. K said in her statement that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230; as a young child you trust your parents to do the right thing; you do not even think to question them and I did not&#8230;</span>&#8221;. That is a powerful statement which explains how K was forced to adapt herself to sudden and unforeseen changes of carer and country. The coping mechanism I have described was, in due course, overlaid by K&#8217;s own happy experiences of life in Algeria.   In her statement, K explained how much she loved being at school in Algeria, loved the culture and loved being surrounded by her father&#8217;s large extended family. Though K remembers frequent, almost daily, Skype or telephone calls with her mother, her mother&#8217;s perception is a little different. Contact was not infrequently facilitated by the father on his own phone, which deprived mother and daughter of privacy and there was something of a stop/start feel to indirect contact in that it would take place for a while and then abruptly cease, often for lengthy periods. What is clear is that direct contact failed and, after spring 2017, the mother chose not to visit K in Algeria. K is critical of her mother in this regard, but her view has been shaped without any real understanding of the obstacles her mother faced in trying to maintain direct contact in Algeria. </p>

At a telephone hearing on 7 November 2018, Theis J heard from the father and gave further directions. On 18 March 2019, during a telephone hearing attended by both parents acting in person, the father told Cohen J that he intended to return K to the jurisdiction when she finished school in three years&#8217; time and that he needed his travel documents because he intended to return himself to this jurisdiction in the summer of 2019. Despite expressing her concern as to whether the father&#8217;s claims about K&#8217;s proposed movement were genuine, the mother did not oppose K travelling to England since she did not consider it appropriate for K to be in Algeria without a parent. The transcript of the hearing does not record any overt acceptance by the mother that K should return to live in England (as opposed to Poland) or that she should remain in her father&#8217;s care (as opposed to returning to her mother).  </p>

K felt under pressure from her mother to tell the court that she wished to return to Poland and clearly had difficulty adapting to life with her mother in cramped accommodation in a house full of strangers to her. Whilst K acknowledged that there were some positive elements to spending time with her mother, she was upset when her mother sought to monitor her calls from her father and communications with others by installing an app on her phone which would allow her mother to see who she was calling and what she was texting. Whilst I have no doubt this was done by the mother to protect K from further abduction by her father, over time this apparent lack of trust - as K saw it - had a corrosive effect on K&#8217;s relationship with her mother. </p>

K told her mother that she did not want this and reported that her mother had said it was her choice. When Ms Roddy spoke to K last week, she was not so insistent that her mother had said the choice to return was hers. What was clear was the strength of her opposition to a return to Poland and thus Ms Roddy was concerned that K would hold her mother responsible if she were ordered to return. Ms Roddy described how K had been caught between her parents: the time with her mother in early 2020 had allowed her to get used to her mother once more but then this was disrupted when her mother left and she returned to the care of her father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Ms Roddy reported that K had told her that she spoke with her mother on most days and that her father encouraged her to communicate with her mother even when she was doing her homework and might not wish to do so. K denied being brainwashed by her father and pointed out that her account of her life in Poland was her own lived experience and not the experience of either her mother or her father. She would like her mother to visit her in the UK for contact and she was concerned that she would be retained in Poland if she visited her mother there. However, she was clear that she intended to travel to Poland unaccompanied when she was older to see her mother and her extended family, and that she also wished to travel to Algeria to see her family there. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Ms Roddy was of the opinion that K&#8217;s abrupt and unexpected return to her father in March 2020 had made a successful return to Poland almost impossible to achieve. K had had so many losses, adjustments and changes of care arrangements that she could not countenance the loss of her father once more. Care with either parent carried risks, but Ms Roddy explained that her present recommendation for K to remain in England was the least worst alternative for a girl who had already had to negotiate so much harm. She opined that K had a confidence that her mother would not desert her, come what may, but was less confident in her father. If K remained in England, her mother would feature in her life through contact. However, if she returned to Poland, K&#8217;s past experience was that her father would be unable to sustain contact with her.  </p>

Ms Roddy thought K would hold her father to account if his actions interfered with her rights and her desire to build on the relationship she has with her mother. However, K had been consistent in her refusal to return to Poland and the strength of her objection had increased during the proceedings. </p>

He made a powerful plea to the mother to hear and respond to K&#8217;s wishes and feelings. Overnight the mother reflected and during the course of the hearing the following day, she accepted that, in the light of K&#8217;s objections, she would be unsuccessful in persuading the court to order K&#8217;s return to Poland pursuant either to the Hague Convention or the inherent jurisdiction. She invited me to give her permission to withdraw her application. </p>

Rule 29.4 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 [&#8220;the FPR&#8221;] does apply to such applications and the test to be applied centres on those matters set out in r 1.1(2) of the overriding objective. As they are summary in nature, Hague Convention proceedings are not proceedings concerning the welfare or upbringing of a child, so the test is not that set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. The matters set out in r 1.1(2) include the need to deal with cases expeditiously and fairly; the need to deal with cases proportionately; the need to save expense and so on. Though all of these factors are to be applied &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">having regard to any welfare issues involved</span>&#8221; (r 1.1(1)), welfare considerations are unlikely to feature heavily and, in most cases, will not feature at all when giving permission to withdraw a Hague Convention application as these are not proceedings concerning the welfare or upbringing of a child. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Applying these considerations to the mother&#8217;s application, I am satisfied that I should give her permission to withdraw her application pursuant to the Hague Convention. It would not serve the ends of justice to compel the mother to pursue an application she wishes to bring to an end and which the other parties are also anxious should be resolved as soon as possible. There is a positive merit in allowing her to withdraw her application rather than going on to dismiss it. Withdrawal would not permit the mother subsequently to invite the Polish court to examine the question of K&#8217;s custody pursuant to the process set out in Article 11(6)-(8) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 [BIIA], whereas, for a period of three months beginning on the date the </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">Polish court was notified about an order for K&#8217;s non-return, such an option would theoretically remain open to her if her application were dismissed (that is if an order for non-return was made solely on an Article 13 basis). For the avoidance of doubt and in the context of Article 11(7) of BIIA, I am persuaded that an order for dismissal would operate in exactly the same way as an order for non-return. In the light of those submissions by Mr Setright QC, withdrawal is a course which is not only fair to the mother but is also fair to the other parties since it resolves any residual uncertainty about the availability of a remedy pursuant to BIIA. It is a course which is consonant with K&#8217;s overwhelming need for an expeditious conclusion to these proceedings. </p>

As this is an application concerning the welfare and upbringing of a child which would involve a welfare appraisal of what was in K&#8217;s best interests, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> applies to my consideration of the mother&#8217;s application to withdraw. It will be apparent from the contents of this judgment that K urgently requires finality as to where she will be living and with whom. That will be achieved by permitting the mother to withdraw this application, as she accepts that K should be subject to the jurisdiction of this court and that she will continue to live with her father. Though the father has conducted himself in a manner inimical to K&#8217;s welfare in the past, there is no suggestion that K should live elsewhere in this jurisdiction than with him.  </p>

Going forward, both parents will need to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">hear</span> what K is saying about contact and adapt themselves accordingly. She deserves that respect given the damage and losses inflicted on her by both her parents, who gave effect, in the past, to their wishes and their hurt with each other instead of putting K first. They are extraordinarily lucky that K is blessed with an intelligence and maturity which has helped her cope, for the moment, with the many losses they have each inflicted on her. Sadly, I suspect the damage to her psychological wellbeing in the long term may not be so easy to remedy and overcome. I hope I am wrong about that. </p>
